<doc id="234260" wikidata="Q1639360" url="?curid=234260" title="List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn">
<text>Joseph Haydn wrote sixty-eight string quartets. (The number was previously thought to be eighty-three, but this includes some arrangements and spurious works.) They are usually referred to by their opus numbers, not Anthony van Hoboken&#x27;s catalogue numbers or their publication order in the First Haydn Edition (FHE).

==Opus 1 (1755–57) ==
*Quartet No. 1 in B major (&quot;La Chasse&quot;), Op. 1, No. 1, FHE No. 52, Hoboken No. III:1
*Quartet No. 2 in E major, Op. 1, No. 2, FHE No. 53, Hoboken No. III:2
*Quartet No. 3 in D major, Op. 1, No. 3, FHE No. 54, Hoboken No. III:3
*Quartet No. 4 in G major, Op. 1, No. 4, FHE No. 55, Hoboken No. III:4
*Quartet No. 5 in E major, Op. 1, No. 0, Hoboken No. II:6 (also referred to as Opus 0)
*Quartet in B major, Op. 1, No. 5, FHE No. 56, Hoboken No. III:5 (later found to be the Symphony A, Hob. I/107)
*Quartet No. 6 in C major, Op. 1, No. 6, FHE No. 57, Hoboken No. III:6

==Opus 2 (1757–59) ==

The two quartets numbered 3 and 5 are spurious arrangements by an unknown hand.

*Quartet No. 7 in A major, Op. 2, No. 1, FHE No. 58, Hoboken No. III:7
*Quartet No. 8 in E major, Op. 2, No. 2, FHE No. 59, Hoboken No. III:8 (often includes a classical guitar) 
*Quartet in E major, Op. 2, No. 3, FHE No. 60 (arrangement of Cassation in E-flat major, Hob. II:21), Hoboken No. III:9
*Quartet No. 9 in F major, Op. 2, No. 4, FHE No. 61, Hoboken No. III:10
*Quartet in D major, Op. 2, No. 5, FHE No. 62 (arrangement of Cassation in D major, Hob. II:22), Hoboken No. III:11
*Quartet No. 10 in B major, Op. 2, No. 6, FHE No. 63, Hoboken No. III:12

==Opus 3 (spurious)==
This set of quartets is now commonly attributed to Romanus Hoffstetter, though there is no universal agreement on this. According to the scholar Allan Badley, &quot;The works were omitted from the Entwurf-Katalog, the running catalogue of his works he (Haydn) kept from 1765 until after the London visits, but found their way into the Haydn-Verzeichnis prepared in 1805 under the composer’s direct supervision by his faithful factotum Joseph Elssler. Haydn also accepted the six works as genuine in the edition of his complete string quartets published by Ignaz Pleyel. Unfortunately, both strands of evidence are not beyond questioning.&quot; Badley goes on to say &quot;The meagre bibliographical evidence has been painstakingly sifted and the works themselves subjected to every kind of analytical technique known to musicology. Haydn’s authorship still remains doubtful but so too does that of Pater Romanus Hoffstetter the most commonly favoured alternative.&quot;

In the 1980s, Scott Fruehwald claimed to show that the quartets were not by Haydn, based on stylistic analysis.. He also concluded that only the first two quartets were by Hoffstetter.

==List by keys==
==Recordings of complete cycles==

Multiple recordings of Haydn&#x27;s complete string quartets have been made over the years. The first complete set was made by the Tátrai Quartet for Hungaroton from 1964 to 1984 and issued as a boxed set in 2000. During the 1970s, the Aeolian Quartet recorded a complete cycle for Decca, which was then reissued in 2009. From 1994 to 1999, the Angeles Quartet recorded a cycle for Philips Records, which received critical reviews. During the 1990s, the Tátrai Quartet completed a cycle for Hungaroton. From 1989 to 2003, the Kodály Quartet recorded a cycle for Naxos Records. More recently, from 2002 to 2008, the Buchberger Quartet recorded a cycle for Brilliant Classics on period instruments. The Auryn Quartet completed their cycle on modern instruments for Tacet in 2014.

<doc id="234261" wikidata="Q594441" url="?curid=234261" title="Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus">
<text>Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus (died AD 66), Roman senator, who lived in the 1st century AD. Notable for his principled opposition to the emperor Nero and his interest in Stoicism, he was the husband of Arria, who was the daughter of A. Caecina Paetus and the elder Arria, father-in-law of Helvidius Priscus, and a friend and relative by marriage of the poet Persius. Thrasea was the most prominent member of the political faction known today as the Stoic Opposition.

== Origins and early life ==

According to Cassius Dio, Thrasea belonged to a distinguished and wealthy family. It is certain that this family came from Patavium, but it is not known whether he was born there or in Rome. Certainly he maintained close links with Patavium, in later life taking an important part in the city&#x27;s traditional festival. Nothing is known for certain of his early career, nor through whose influence he succeeded in entering the senate. By the year 42, however, he was married to Caecinia Arria, daughter of Caecina Paetus (suffect consul in 37). In that year Caecina was implicated in the revolt of Scribonianus against Claudius, probably with the aim of restoring the republic. According to his daughter Fannia, whose account is preserved in a letter of Pliny, Thrasea attempted unsuccessfully to prevent his mother-in-law Arria from killing herself along with her husband. It was probably after the death of Caecina Paetus that Thrasea added the name Paetus to his own, a very unusual step for a son-in-law and one which advertised his connection with an enemy of the emperor.

We have no information on the chronology of Thrasea&#x27;s progression through the lower ranks of the cursus honorum. It is possible, but by no means certain, that his political career was at a standstill at least in the early years of Claudius&#x27; reign. He was suffect consul November to December 56 under Nero, perhaps due to the influence of Nero&#x27;s adviser Seneca, who had preceded him in office in the same year. At some date probably not long after this, he was still in enough favour to be given an honorific priesthood as quindecimvir sacris faciundis. By the time of his consulship he had also acquired an important political ally in his son-in-law Helvidius Priscus.

There are some indications that Thrasea&#x27;s rise to prominence may have been helped by activity in the lawcourts. At some point between 52 and 62 (whether before or after his consulship is not clear) he probably held some provincial governorship; this is the implication of the statement in the &quot;Life of Persius&quot; that the young poet &#x27;travelled abroad&#x27; with his inlaw. Senators did not normally travel outside Italy simply for fun.

== Political activity under Nero ==

In 57, Thrasea supported the cause of the Cilicians accusing their late governor, Cossutianus Capito, of extortion, and the prosecution succeeded apparently largely through his influence. But Tacitus&#x27; first reference to him in the &quot;Annals&quot; relates to the following year, when he surprised both friends and enemies by speaking against a routine motion in the senate, a request by the Syracusans to exceed the statutory number of gladiators at their games. The objections to this which Tacitus attributes to (anonymous) &#x27;detractors&#x27; show, if accurate, that Thrasea already had a reputation for opposition to the status quo and for dedication to the ideal of senatorial freedom. To his friends, Thrasea explained that he was not unaware of the real state of affairs, but gave the senate the credit of understanding that those who paid attention to trivial matters would not pass over more important ones—leaving unspoken some such phrase as &#x27;if they were permitted real debate on such issues&#x27;.

In spring of the following year, he first openly showed his disgust at the behaviour of Nero and the obsequiousness of the senate after the emperor&#x27;s letter justifying the murder of Agrippina had been read, and various motions congratulating Nero proposed. Senatorial procedure required each individual in turn to give his opinion on the motion, and Thrasea chose to walk out of the meeting &#x27;since he could not say what he would, and would not say what he could&#x27; (Dio).

In 62, the praetor Antistius Sosianus, who had written abusive poems about Nero, was accused on a maiestas charge by Thrasea&#x27;s old enemy Cossutianus Capito, who had recently been restored to the senate through the influence of his father-in-law Tigellinus. Thrasea dissented from the proposal to impose the death sentence and argued that the proper legal penalty for such an offence was exile. His view won majority assent, and was eventually passed, despite a clearly unfavourable response from Nero, whom the consuls had consulted when the vote was taken. Whether Nero had intended Antistius to be put to death or whether, as many believed, he wished to make a display of his own clemency by saving him from a death sentence imposed by the senate, for the senate to have voted against the death penalty was clearly a serious upset to his plans.

In the same year, at the trial of the Cretan Claudius Timarchus in the senate, the defendant was alleged to have said several times that it was in his power whether the proconsul of Crete received the thanks of the province or not. Thrasea proposed that such abuses should be prevented by the prohibition of such votes of thanks. Once again he carried the majority, but a senatus consultum was not passed until the consuls had ascertained the views of the emperor.

The following year made plain Nero&#x27;s displeasure with Thrasea. When a daughter was born to the emperor at Antium, the senate went in a body to offer congratulations, but Thrasea was expressly excluded by Nero. Such &#x27;renunciations of friendship&#x27; on the part of the emperor were normally the prelude to the victim&#x27;s death, but unexpectedly Nero seems to have changed his mind at this point, perhaps due to fluctuating power dynamics with Tigellinus, who as Capito&#x27;s father-in-law might be presumed to have a strong motive to wish for Thrasea&#x27;s elimination. It was said that when Nero told Seneca he had been reconciled with Thrasea, Seneca congratulated him on recovering a valuable friendship, rather than praising him for his clemency.

From about this time, however, Thrasea withdrew from political life. We do not know exactly when he took this decision (Tacitus makes Capito say in 66 that &#x27;for three years he has not entered the senate-house&#x27; but Capito&#x27;s list of complaints against him is clearly contentious and possibly unreliable), nor what was the catalyst for such a volte-face, but it was clear that it was intended, and understood, as itself a political action, especially coming from one who had previously applied himself so assiduously to senatorial business; it was the ultimate form of protest. During this time, Thrasea continued to look after the interests of his clients. It was probably also in this period that he wrote his Life of Cato, in which he praised the advocate of senatorial freedom against Caesar, with whom he also shared an interest in Stoicism. This work, now lost, was a major source for Plutarch&#x27;s life of the younger Cato.

== Trial and death ==
In 66, Cossutianus Capito finally succeeded in convincing Nero to move against Thrasea. Nero may have hoped to &#x27;bury&#x27; his attack on Thrasea and simultaneously on Barea Soranus by acting during the visit of the Armenian king Tiridates to Rome; at all events, he began by excluding Thrasea from the reception of Tiridates. Perhaps, as Tacitus suggests, he wished to panic him into some sort of submission, but Thrasea&#x27;s reaction was merely to inquire what the charges against him were and to ask for time to prepare a defence—the implication being probably that there was no legal basis for proceedings against him. This was likely true, to judge by the bizarre nature of some of the supporting evidence alleged by Capito (such as not sacrificing to the Heavenly Voice of the emperor), but the trial nonetheless took place in the senate. Thrasea, having consulted with his friends, decided not to attend; he also declined the offer of the young Arulenus Rusticus, one of the tribunes, to use his tribunician veto against the decree of the senate, saying that such an action would merely endanger the life of the tribune without saving his own.

On the day of the trial, the meeting-place of the senate was surrounded by armed cohorts of the Praetorian Guard. A letter from Nero was read, mentioning no names but blaming senior senators for neglecting their public duties; then Capito spoke against Thrasea, and was followed by Eprius Marcellus, whom Tacitus regards as the more effective speaker. No speeches for the defence are mentioned; the senators had little alternative but to vote for the death penalty, in the form of the &#x27;free choice of death&#x27; (&quot;liberum mortis arbitrium&quot;), that is, an order to commit suicide. In a separate action, Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were also condemned to death; with Thrasea were condemned, but to lesser penalties, his son-in-law Helvidius Priscus and associates Paconius Agrippinus and Curtius Montanus.

When the news was brought to Thrasea at his suburban villa, where he was entertaining a number of friends and sympathisers, he retired to a bedroom, and had the veins of both his arms opened. Calling to witness the quaestor who had brought the death sentence, he identified the shedding of his blood as a libation to Iuppiter Liberator—Jupiter who gives freedom. The surviving text of Tacitus breaks off at the moment when Thrasea was about to address Demetrius, the Cynic philosopher, with whom he had previously that day held a conversation on the nature of the soul. His death, though painful and protracted, contained allusions to the deaths of Socrates and Cato, and was evidently presented by his biographer Arulenus Rusticus, and probably constructed by himself, as a model of a dignified, calm and humane end.

==In popular culture==
* Thrasea is mentioned in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, the 1895 novel by Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz.
* In the second chapter of Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s 1951 novel, &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;, the emperor alludes to Thrasea&#x27;s composure in the face of death when he muses, “If ever I am to undergo torture (and illness will doubtless see to that) I cannot be sure of maintaining the impassiveness of a Thrasea, but I shall at least have the resource of resigning myself to my cries.”

<doc id="234262" wikidata="Q3251764" url="?curid=234262" title="List of Masses by Joseph Haydn">
<text>Masses composed by Joseph Haydn are listed below. Masses are sorted using chronological indices given by New Grove. The Hoboken catalogue had also placed the masses in presumed chronological order, but further research has undermined that sequence.

*No. 1 in G major: &#x27;Missa rorate coeli desuper&#x27; (H. 22/3) (c.1750)
*No. 2 in F major: &#x27;Missa brevis&#x27; (H. 22/1) (1750)
*No. 3 in C major: &#x27;Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae&#x27;, also spuriously known as &#x27;Cäcilienmesse&#x27; (St Cecilia) (H. 22/5) (1766–73)
*No. 4 in D minor: &#x27;Missa sunt bona mixta malis&#x27; (H. 22/2) (1768; Fragment)
*No. 5 in E-flat major: &#x27;Missa in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae&#x27;, also known as the &#x27;Große Orgelmesse&#x27; (&#x27;Great Organ Mass&#x27;) (H. 22/4) (1770)
*No. 6 in G major: &#x27;Missa Sancti Nicolai, Nicolaimesse&#x27; (H. 22/6) (1772)
*No. 7 in B-flat major: &#x27;Missa brevis Sancti Joannis de Deo&#x27;, also known as the &#x27;Kleine Orgelmesse&#x27; (&#x27;Little Organ Mass&#x27;) (H. 22/7) (c.1775)
*No. 8 in C major: &#x27;Missa Cellensis, Mariazellermesse&#x27; (H. 22/8) (1782)

Masses nos. 9–14 form a group: each was composed by Haydn for the Esterházy family, to celebrate the name day (12 September) of Princess Maria Hermenegild, the wife of Prince Nikolaus II and a friend of the composer. The composition of these masses was Haydn&#x27;s principal duty to his old employers at this time of his career. 

The &quot;Heiligmesse&quot; in B-flat major, composed for the Capuchin friar Bernard of Offida, is thought to have been performed at the Feast of the Holy Name of Mary on September 11, 1796. The &quot;Paukenmesse&quot; in C major was first performed on December 26, 1797. Thirdly, the &quot;Missa in Angustiis&quot; in D minor was performed on September 23, 1798. Fourthly, the &quot;Theresienmesse&quot; in B-flat major is from 1799, and was written for Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Fifth, the &quot;Schöpfungsmesse&quot; in B-flat major was performed on September 13, 1801, and features melodies from the &quot;Creation&quot;, especially in the &quot;Gloria&quot;. Sixth, the &quot;Harmoniemesse&quot; in B-flat major was performed on September 8, 1802, and is almost certainly his last major work. 

*No. 9 in B-flat major: &#x27;Missa Sancti Bernardi von Offida&#x27;, also known as the &#x27;Heiligmesse&#x27; (H. 22/10) (1796)
*No. 10 in C major: &#x27;Missa in tempore belli&#x27; (&#x27;Mass in Time of War&#x27;), also known as the &#x27;Paukenmesse&#x27; (&#x27;Kettledrum Mass&#x27;) (H. 22/9) (1796)
*No. 11 in D minor: &#x27;Missa in Angustiis&#x27; (&#x27;Mass in Troubled Times&#x27;), also known as the &#x27;Nelson Mass&#x27; (H. 22/11) (1798)
*No. 12 in B-flat major: &#x27;Theresienmesse&#x27; (named for the Maria Theresa of the Two Sicilies) (H. 22/12) (1799)
*No. 13 in B-flat major: &#x27;Schöpfungsmesse&#x27; (&#x27;Creation Mass&#x27;) (H. 22/13) (1801)
*No. 14 in B-flat major: &#x27;Harmoniemesse&#x27; (&#x27;Wind-band Mass&#x27;) (H. 22/14) (1802). 

The &quot;Harmoniemesse&quot; 1802 was Haydn&#x27;s last major work. He shortly afterward sank into debilitating illness and was unable to compose further.

<text>Quintus Marcius Barea Soranus was a Roman senator who lived in the reign of Nero. He was suffect consul in 52, but later attracted the hatred of Nero, and upon being condemned to death committed suicide. He was associated with a group of Stoics opposed to the perceived tyranny and autocratic tendencies of certain emperors, known today as the Stoic Opposition.

== Life and career ==
Soranus was a member of the gens Marcia; his father, Quintus Marcius Barea Soranus, had been a suffect consul as well as governor of Africa. His brother was Quintus Marcius Barea Sura, friend of the future emperor Vespasian and maternal grandfather of Trajan.

His career prior to becoming consul is not well known. Subsequent to holding the &quot;fasces&quot;, Soranus was governor of Asia around 61/62. During this tenure, the Emperor Nero had ordered his freedman Acrato to take away the works of art of the city of Pergamon, but the people revolted; Soranus refused to follow the orders of the Emperor and punish its citizens.

== Trial and death ==
Soranus was accused by Ostorius Sabinus, an equestrian, of being friends with Rubellius Plautus (another object of Nero&#x27;s hatred), and for inciting the citizens of Asia to revolt. One of the chief witnesses against him was Egnatius Celer of Berytus, his client and former tutor. Soranus&#x27; daughter, Servilia, was also accused of having hired a sorcerer (&quot;magi&quot;), and was tried together with her father. Servilia confessed that she had consulted an astrologer, but only to pray in honor of her father and the emperor; Soranus asked that his daughter be spared because she was not involved in the conspiracy or aware of the misdeeds of her husband, Gaius Annius Pollio. In the end, Soranus was condemned to death (in 65 or 66), and committed suicide.

== Family ==
Soranus is known to have one daughter, Marcia Servilia Sorana, better known as &quot;Servilia&quot;.

<text>Diogenes the Cynic, also known as Diogenes of Sinope (c. 413/403–c. 324/321 BC), was an ancient Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynicism. Renowned for his ascetic lifestyle, biting wit, and radical critiques of social conventions, he became a legendary figure whose life and teachings have been recounted, often through anecdote, in both antiquity and later cultural traditions.

Born in a prosperous family in Sinope, his life took a dramatic turn following a scandal involving the defacement of coinage, an event that led to his exile and ultimately his radical rejection of conventional values. Embracing a life of poverty and self-sufficiency, he became famous for his unconventional behaviours that openly challenged societal norms, such as living in a jar or wandering public spaces with a lit lantern in daylight. Diogenes advocated for a return to nature and the renunciation of materialism, and introduced early ideas of cosmopolitanism by proclaiming himself a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;. His memorable encounters, including a legendary exchange with Alexander the Great, along with various accounts of his death, have made him a lasting symbol of philosophical defiance to established authorities and artificial values.

== Biography ==

=== Early life in Sinope ===

Diogenes was born ca. 413/403 BC in Sinope, a Milesian colony in Paphlagonia on the Black Sea (modem Sinop, northern Turkey). He was the son of Hicesias, a &quot;trapezitēs&quot;, that is, a moneychanger authorized to exchange foreign currencies for the local money. Nothing is known about his mother. As a child, Diogenes learned to read, write, and quote both epic and tragic verses, while also training in athletics and horsemanship. This background reflects his privileged upbringing, as private education was available only to wealthy families. In his father&#x27;s footsteps, he held the position of &quot;epimelētēs&quot;, a magistrate whose duties varied by city, though the specifics of his role remain unknown.In an episode that would later serve as a metaphor for his philosophical mission, he and his father were accused of &quot;defacing the currency&quot;. Ancient sources differ on the details. According to Diocles of Magnesia, Hicesias was responsible for restamping the coinage, forcing his son into exile. In contrast, Eubulides claims that Diogenes himself committed the act and had to leave the city with his father. Meanwhile, anonymous sources cited by Diogenes Laertius report that while Diogenes was guilty of the fraud, his father, who oversaw the public treasury, was arrested and died in prison, and Diogenes managed to escape.

It remains unclear whether Diogenes or his father was responsible for defacing the coins, and for whatever reasons they may have done so. Some scholars believe that this incident might have been a fictional creation inspired by Diogenes&#x27; own writings, with his famous goal to &quot;revalue the currency&quot; (&quot;paracharattein to nomisma&quot;) symbolising his challenge to conventional values. Others, like C.T. Seltman and H. Bannert, have argued that the story might be based on fact, citing defaced coins from Sinope dated between 350 and 340 BC and coins minted after 362 BC bearing the name &quot;Hikesio&quot; as the official. Diogenes himself admitted his guilt in his lost treatise, &quot;Pordalos&quot;, and his father&#x27;s role as &quot;trapezitēs&quot; would have made the crime possible.

One related account states that Diogenes once asked Apollo&#x27;s oracle at Delphi (or perhaps Delos) how he might gain renown. The oracle replied, &quot;Adulterate the currency&quot;, which he took to mean he should counterfeit coins. However, the Greek word &quot;nomisma&quot; is ambiguous, as it can refer to both coinage and social institutions. In fact, the oracle meant that his destiny was to subvert urban conventions, not to debase money. In another account, the oracular pronouncement occurs after his departure from Sinope, thus explicitly linking the command to its symbolic meaning, that is to wage a relentless war on the cultural and political &quot;currency&quot; of his contemporaries.

This story of the oracle is most likely fictional. It seems to mimic the oracle that Socrates is said to have received at Delphi, and may have been intended as a parody. According to R. Bracht Branham, the idea that Diogenes consulted an oracle to determine his philosophical mission contradicts his own views on traditional religion. Furthermore, Diogenes himself says that he embraced philosophy in Athens, well after the alleged offense occurred. Roubineau postulates that this legend may have been devised by later authors to downplay his role in any actual fraud.

=== Exile ===
The exact date of Diogenes&#x27; departure from Sinope is uncertain. It is also unclear whether he was banished or exiled, or if he fled out of fear of the consequences. While ancient tradition holds that Antisthenes (who died ca. 366 BC) introduced him to Socratic thought, some modern scholars have questioned the timeline, arguing that Diogenes may have learned about Antisthenes&#x27; philosophy only from his writings. Susan H. Prince suggests that he may have arrived in Athens sometime between the 360s and 345 BC, whereas H. Bannert contends that his arrival occurred in the years 370–365. To reconcile those views, some have proposed that he had visited Athens earlier, before the defacement and Antisthenes&#x27; death.Diogenes&#x27; exile marked a turning point, and a moment of profound spiritual conversion. In his time, being separated from one&#x27;s homeland, and thus denied the honour of being buried with one&#x27;s ancestors, was seen as a tragic fate. Diogenes rejected this sentimental attachment, embracing exile as the ultimate detachment from worldly ties. Plutarch notes that the hardships of exile transformed him into a philosopher. In Cynic thought, noble exiles like Odysseus and especially Heracles, about whom Diogenes wrote tragedies, served as models of exemplary behaviour. One anecdote also claims that a chance encounter with a mouse revealed to him the value of a simple life, since the rodent is capable of adapting itself to any circumstance.

Diogenes reportedly owned a Phrygian slave named Manes. Given Diogenes&#x27; poverty after fleeing Sinope, it is more likely that Manes was part of his early life rather than a slave bought in Athens. When the slave escaped, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, &quot;If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?&quot;. This attitude reflects the Cynic belief that true freedom comes from detaching oneself from possessions and desires, so even owning a slave could be seen as a form of self-enslavement. J. Garcia Gonzalez has argued that this anecdote, like other stories about Diogenes, is symbolic rather than factual, using the names &quot;Manes&quot; and &quot;Diogenes&quot; as generic representations to convey philosophical ideas. Although evading capture, Manes met a tragic end when wild dogs attacked him as he fled to Delphi. 

=== Life in Athens ===
Diogenes spent his mild winters in Athens, taking shelter in a jar (&quot;pithos&quot;), and his summers outdoors in Corinth, cooled by breezes from the Isthmus. He compared his lifestyle to that of the Great King of Persia, who endured winter in the scorching cities of Babylon and Susa and enjoyed summer in the milder climate of Ecbatana.Diogenes&#x27; life was marked by radical self-sufficiency, courage through passivity to fate, and a rational indifference to suffering. Diogenes went barefoot, and folded his tunic so that it could double as bedding. He openly engaged in behaviours, such as masturbating, spitting, or even urinating on people, that defied social norms, and he supported himself by begging, which he saw as fair compensation for his role in challenging society&#x27;s values. The Athenians reportedly held him in high regard, even replacing his jar when a youth broke it. One day, he famously discarded his drinking cup after watching a boy drink water from the hollow of his hands, saying that he was not aware until that moment that &quot;nature had already provided him with a cup.&quot; He was also known to wander the marketplace by day with a lit lamp, saying &quot;I am looking for a man&quot;. 

In his later years, he carried a walking stick when he left town, a symbol of both his itinerant lifestyle and public authority. Ancient texts report that he visited various other cities, which helped shape Diogenes&#x27; reputation as a wandering philosopher. Although he admired Sparta, he still employed his trademark method of teaching through criticism while he was there. When a Spartan cited Hesiod&#x27;s verse &quot;Nor would the ox die, if a neighbor were not evil&quot;, Diogenes retorted, &quot;But the Messenians and their oxen have died, and you are their neighbours&quot;. Diogenes&#x27; other travels remain mysterious. His visits to various cities in Asia Minor, especially Miletus, known for its rich intellectual history, suggest he may have journeyed for philosophical reasons, though the exact details are lost to us.

=== Later life in Corinth ===
Another likely apocryphal story claims that, while on a voyage to Aegina, he was captured by pirates led by a man named Scirpalus or Harpalus. Taken to Crete, he was sold at a slave market to a Corinthian man named Xeniades. Noticing Xeniades among the other bidders, he turned to the auctioneer and said, &quot;Sell me to him; he needs a master&quot;. Diogenes was asked to oversee the education of his sons and to manage the affairs of his household. After his master freed him, it is reported that he stayed in Corinth, living alone near a gymnasium called &#x27;the Craneum&#x27; on the outskirts of the city, nestled in a cypress grove overlooking the harbour.According to Dionysius the Stoic, Diogenes was taken prisoner in 338 by Philip II of Macedon during the Battle of Chaeronea, in northern Boeotia. Amused by his audacity, Philip decided to release him. In July 336, Diogenes attended the 111th Olympic Games. When a herald announced, &quot;Dioxippus has defeated the other men&quot;, he retorted, &quot;On the contrary! &quot;He&quot; defeats slaves, while &quot;I&quot; defeat men&quot;. When asked if he had come to watch the competitions, Diogenes replied that he was there to take part in them, to combat human ills: anger, mistrust, sadness, desire, and fear. At the Isthmian Games, he even crowned himself victor by placing a pine wreath on his head, an act that prompted the Corinthians to try to remove it.

According to tradition, he met Philip&#x27;s son Alexander the Great, likely in 336 when Alexander was proclaimed commander of the expedition against Persia at the Isthmus of Corinth. As Plutarch recounts, when Alexander arrived, Diogenes refused to join the formal greeting and instead stayed in his usual spot in a cypress grove outside Corinth. Alexander engaged him in a conversation that later became famous.
=== Death ===
Some sources claim that Diogenes died on the same night as Alexander the Great (June 10–11, 323 BC), but this is likely legendary. Modern scholars believe that he died in the late 320s, probably around 324/321 BC. Censorinus writes that Diogenes died at the age of 81, while Laertius holds that he lived to be about 90.
The exact location of Diogenes&#x27; death remains disputed. Some accounts claim he died in Corinth, either in the Craneion or at his former master&#x27;s house, while others suggest he died in Athens, or even near Olympia. Additionally, ancient sources offer various explanations for his death. Some, like Cercidas and Antisthenes of Rhodes, assert that he committed suicide by self-asphyxiation, a method symbolically reflecting his commitment to self-determination. Other accounts attribute his demise to eating a raw octopus in an attempt to demonstrate the uselessness of cooking (Athenaeus), to a fever contracted on the eve of his departure for the Olympic games (Epictetus and Jerome), or to an infected dog bite while trying to divide an octopus among some dogs (Diogenes Laertius).Diogenes showed little concern for his burial, instructing that his body be discarded, either left unburied outside the city wall for wild animals, thrown into a ditch and covered with dust, or even dumped into the river Ilisos. Diogenes&#x27; followers ended up in a violent dispute over how and who should manage his burial, an anecdote that seems to convey they had not fully embraced his lesson of indifference to human customs. Ultimately, the Corinthians arranged a funeral, and he was buried outside the city walls near the western gate, close to where he spent his final years. Eubulus, on the other hand, reports that Diogenes was buried by the children of Xeniades, for whom he had served as a tutor. Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, noted that Diogenes&#x27; tomb was among those visible near Corinth.

In ancient Greece and Rome, a philosopher&#x27;s death was often seen as a final statement on their teachings. Diogenes&#x27; death, with its imaginative and varied accounts, became as controversial as his indifference to his own burial. His perspective, as summarised by Teles, was shared by all the Cynics who followed him: &quot;What difference is there between being consumed by fire, devoured by a dog, left above ground to be preyed upon by vultures, or buried below ground to be eaten by worms?&quot;

According to Roubineau, given the tomb at Corinth and the account of his death in the Craneion, it seems likely that Diogenes died in or near Corinth. The more dramatic accounts, such as dying from eating an octopus, a dispute with a dog, or self-asphyxiation, appear to be philosophical fictions, and the most plausible explanation is that he died of old age.

A bronze statue of Diogenes was erected in Sinope after his death, with the following poem from Philiscus of Aegina at its base.

== Works ==
According to Laertius, Diogenes wrote dialogues, letters, and tragedies, though none of these works have survived. His writings may have served as sources for the many anecdotes about him, which vary in reliability and often leave their meanings open to interpretation. 

Diogenes is believed to have written a work called &quot;Politeia&quot; (&#x27;Republic&#x27;), known mainly through the accounts of Laertius and Philodemus. In this text, he presented controversial views on family, sexuality, and social and political practices that were considered so scandalous that some contemporary Stoics dismissed the work as inauthentic. Another work, &quot;Pordalos&quot;, appears to contain autobiographical elements, while the dialogue &quot;Ichthyas&quot; was addressed to a disciple of Euclid who shared the same name. At the time of Athenaeus (late 2nd–early 3rd century AD) Diogene&#x27;s &quot;Cephalion&quot; was still a well known work. Finally, debate continues as to whether the &quot;chreiai&quot; were written by Diogenes himself or if they are accounts about him composed by others, such as Metrocles.

Diogenes&#x27; tragedies explored major mythological narratives, featuring characters such as Helen, Thyestes (which allowed him to address the subject of anthropophagy), Heracles (the quintessential cynical hero celebrated for his endurance in adversity), Achilles, Medea (whose magical feats were interpreted allegorically), Chrysippus (the son of Pelops), and Oedipus (whose acts of parricide and incest did not shock him). These plays continued to be read into later centuries, reaching figures like Clement of Alexandria in the 1st century AD and Emperor Julian in the 4th century AD. Some ancient thinkers, and even some Cynics, held a low opinion of these tragedies. Stoics criticised them for addressing highly sensitive topics such as cannibalism, incest and parricide, in an immoral way. Emperor Julian even doubted their authorship, asking, &quot;What reader of these would not abhor them and find in them an excess of infamy not to be surpassed even by courtesans?&quot; Consequently, these tragedies were frequently attributed to one of Diogenes&#x27; disciples, such as Philiscus of Aegina or Pasiphon.

== Philosophy ==

=== Influences ===
Diogenes&#x27; philosophy was primarily influenced by Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC) and Antisthenes (c. 446 – c. 366 BC).

Emulating Socrates, Diogenes publicly questioned those who claimed to possess wisdom, and preferred engaging people in their everyday lives rather than teaching in formal educational settings like other philosophers. While he shared Socrates&#x27; goal of converting others to philosophy, his methods were far more abrasive, using harsh language and brutal critiques, a method that led Plato to call him &quot;Socrates gone mad&quot;.

Laertius states that Diogenes became a disciple of Antisthenes, himself a student of Socrates. Although the timeline of Diogenes&#x27; arrival in Athens and Antisthenes&#x27; death raises some doubts about this account, Diogenes clearly absorbed and adapted many of Antisthenes&#x27; ideas. These include emphasising virtue over societal laws and customs, prioritising deeds over abstract ideas, and believing in the fundamental equality of men and women.

=== Cosmopolitanism ===
Diogenes invented an early form of cosmopolitanism, and probably the term itself. When asked about his origin, he responded with a single word: &quot;kosmopolitēs&quot; (&quot;I am a citizen of the world&quot;). Diogenes maintained that &quot;the only true commonwealth was that which was commensurate with the universe&quot;.

Lucian quotes him as saying:

His philosophical outlook was likely shaped by his early years in Sinope and his subsequent exile. Encounters with non-Greek peoples along the Black Sea probably contributed to his development of cultural relativism. Favorinus argued that cosmopolitanism served as both a response to and a consolation for the loss of one&#x27;s homeland, and Diogenes&#x27; experience as a foreigner may have challenged the notion that political power naturally belongs to those born by accident in a particular city.

However, the continuity between ancient and modern cosmopolitanism must not be exaggerated. While Diogenes promoted the idea of being a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;, he and his followers did not advocate for a universal brotherhood. Instead, his focus was on revealing that the city-state is an artificial construct rather than a natural state of affairs.

=== Autarky ===

Diogenes authored a treatise called &quot;On Wealth&quot;. Although the original work has been lost, scholars have been able to partially reconstruct its contents from various aphorisms attributed to him. In one anecdote, he criticises a spendthrift for squandering his inheritance, suggesting that careful habits would have prevented his poverty. In another story, he compares good civic administration to well-managed household affairs, arguing that both require thoughtful, intelligent oversight rather than mere show, reflecting his broader ideas on redefining wealth and the value of intellectual management over manual labor.When Aristippus asked Diogenes what benefit he derived from philosophy, Diogenes replied: &quot;The ability to be rich without having a single obol&quot;. Following Socrates, Antisthenes and Xenophon, Diogenes made a distinction between actual poverty (being economically poor) and the feeling of poverty (suffering from chronic dissatisfaction due to unmet social expectations). In his view, even Greek tyrants could be considered &quot;poor&quot; if they constantly felt unable to meet the financial obligations of their social class.

The Cynics combined the ideals of sufficiency and frugality to develop the practice of mendicancy. It remains unclear whether Diogenes became a beggar before embracing philosophy or if he deliberately rejected working as a philosophical choice, though some credit Antisthenes with this influence. Plutarch records Diogenes&#x27; remark: &quot;In rags [Antisthenes] clothed me and condemned me to poverty and cast me out of my home&quot;. Diogenes used a large ceramic jar (&quot;pithos&quot;), originally meant for food storage, as a makeshift shelter. Later Latin interpretations, beginning with Seneca (1st century AD), shifted the term from &quot;pithos&quot; to &#x27;barrel&#x27; or &#x27;cask&#x27;, influencing modern depictions of the philosopher. However, Diogenes never lived in a barrel, as such containers did not exist in his time. While Diogenes&#x27; jar is commonly associated with his time in Athens, some sources also mention it as his home in Corinth.

== Reception ==
After Diogenes&#x27; death, classical Cynicism diverged into two main paths. One branch, founded by Zeno of Citium (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), evolved into Stoicism. This school embraced Diogenes&#x27; (and indirectly Socrates&#x27;) belief in living according to nature and reason, with virtue as the sole basis for happiness and external factors like one&#x27;s origin and social status regarded as irrelevant. The other stream, beginning with Crates of Thebes (c. 365 – c. 285 BC) and ending with Sallustius of Emesa (5th century AD), consisted of a succession of Cynics who preserved many of Diogenes&#x27; original principles and practices.

In ancient times, Cynicism was frequently overlooked in philosophical histories, with Diogenes often dismissed as a harmless eccentric. In the second century BC, Hippobotus omitted Cynicism from his list of philosophical schools, but Diogenes Laertius (3rd century AD) later argued that Cynicism was a legitimate school of philosophy, not merely a lifestyle. Often misunderstood, Cynicism was not a set of doctrines and did not pretend to the status of philosophical formal system. It was a practical philosophy of action meant to be immediately accessible to everyone, and its adherents lived out their beliefs rather than remaining detached scholars. Besides being criticised for their lack of theoretical sophistication, Diogenes and his followers were also condemned for their perceived immorality. Critics like Cicero argued that their shameless behaviour undermined traditional moral values.

== Legacy ==
=== Depiction in art ===

A damaged marble bas relief from the 1st century AD depicting Diogenes in a jar with a dog was discovered in 1726 during excavations at Monte Testaccio, near Rome. The fragment, part of a larger image of the legendary meeting between Diogenes and Alexander, was restored in the 18th century based on a medieval drawing, adding the figure of Alexander and a new head for Diogenes derived from a statue in the Villa Albani.Diogenes has long inspired Western art since the Renaissance. He is portrayed next to Aristotle in a fresco from 1475 by Davide Ghirlandaio. In Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot; (1509–1511), Diogenes is depicted sprawled on the steps, his disheveled, weathered cloak covering only part of his body, utterly indifferent to the renowned philosophers gathered around him, especially Plato and Aristotle, who loom above him on the top step.

Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s &quot;Diogènes&quot; (1860) portrays the philosopher seated at the mouth of his jar, adjusting his lamp while being observed by four dogs. John William Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Diogenes&quot; (1882) depicts him inside his jar, holding a scroll with a lamp nearby, as three elegant young women look on. Honoré Daumier also created a series of caricatures featuring Diogenes, occasionally including figures like Alcibiades or Alexander the Great.

In 2006, a statue by Turan Baş was erected in the modern Turkish city of Sinop. It features Diogenes standing on a barrel, holding a lamp, with a dog by his side.

=== Psychology ===

From the 20th century onward, Diogenes&#x27; name has come to be applied to Diogenes syndrome, a behavioural disorder characterised by severe self-neglect, domestic squalor, social withdrawal, poor personal hygiene, excessive hoarding, and domestic uncleanliness.

The eponym is generally considered a misnomer as Diogenes deliberately rejected common standards of material comfort, actively sought human company by venturing daily to Agora, and was a minimalist.

=== Other ===
The fictional Diogenes Club, named after the philosopher, appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s story &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; as the club to which Sherlock Holmes&#x27; brother, Mycroft, belongs. Its name reflects the fact that its members are well-educated yet notably quiet and unsociable—much like the philosopher himself.

The Diogenidae family and &quot;Diogenes&quot; genus of hermit crabs have been named in reference to Diogenes&#x27; jar.

In 2005, a European Union program aimed at reducing obesity was named DIOGENES, an acronym for Diet, Obesity, and Genes, referencing Diogenes&#x27; longstanding association with frugality.

<doc id="234269" wikidata="Q722683" url="?curid=234269" title="Marcus Valerius Probus">
<text>Marcus Valerius Probus, also known as M. Valerius Probus Berytius or Probus the [[Berytus|Berytian]] (c. 20/30 – 105 AD), was a Roman grammarian and critic, who flourished during Nero&#x27;s reign.
He was a student rather than a teacher, and devoted himself to the criticism and elucidation of the texts of classical authors (especially the most important Roman poets) by means of marginal notes or by signs, after the manner of the Alexandrine grammarians. In this way, he treated Horace, Lucretius, Terence and Persius, the biography of the latter being probably taken from Probus&#x27;s introduction to his edition of the poet. With the exception of these texts, he published little, but his lectures were preserved in the notes taken by his pupils. Some of his criticisms on Virgil may be preserved in the commentary on the &quot;Bucolics&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot; which goes under his name. Part of one of his treatises, &quot;De notis&quot;, has also been preserved (probably an excerpt from a larger work). It contains a list of abbreviations used in official and historical writings (especially proper names), in laws, legal pleadings and edicts.

The following works have been wrongly attributed to him:
#&quot;Catholica Probi&quot;, on the declension of nouns, the conjugation of verbs, and the rhythmic endings of sentences. This is now generally regarded as the work of the grammarian Marius Plotius Sacerdos (3rd century).
#&quot;Instituta artium&quot;, on the eight parts of speech, also called &quot;Ars vaticana&quot; (after the Vatican, where it was found). As mention is made in it of the Baths of Diocletian, it cannot be earlier than the 4th century. It is possibly by a later Probus, whose existence is, however, problematical.
#&quot;Appendix Probi&quot;, dealing with the noun, the use of cases, rules of orthography (valuable in reference to the pronunciation of Latin at the time), and a table of &quot;Differentiae&quot;. As the author has evidently used the Institute, it also must be assigned to a late date.
#&quot;De nomine excerpta&quot;, a compilation from various grammatical works.
#&quot;De ultimis syllabis ad Caelestinum&quot;, a work explaining the quantities and other features of word-endings in the Latin language.

See J Steup, &quot;De Probis grammaticis&quot; (1871); W.S. Teuffel &amp; Ludwig von Schwabe, &quot;A History of Roman Literature&quot; (Wilhelm Wagner trans., G.C.W. Warr ed., rev. ed. 1891) (1873), Vol. 2, p. 73, par. 295, available at .

<text>Johann Friedrich Dübner (20 December 180213 December 1867) was a German classical scholar (naturalized a Frenchman).

==Biography==
He was born in Hörselgau, near Gotha. After studying at the University of Göttingen he returned to Gotha, where from 1827 to 1832 he held a post (&quot;inspector coenobii&quot;) in connection with the gymnasium. During this period he made his name known by editions of Justin and Persius (after Casaubon).

In 1832 he was invited by the brothers Didot to Paris, to cooperate in a new edition of Estienne&#x27;s &quot;Greek Thesaurus&quot;. He also contributed largely to the &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; published by the same firm, a series of Greek classics with Latin translation, critical notes and valuable indexes. One of Dübner&#x27;s most important works was an edition of Julius Caesar undertaken by command of Napoleon III, which obtained him the cross of the Legion of Honour.

His editions are considered to be models of literary and philological criticism, and did much to raise the standard of classical scholarship in France. He violently attacked Burnouf&#x27;s method of teaching Greek, but without result. Dübner may have gone too far in his zeal for reform, and his opinions may have been too harshly expressed.

Dübner died in Montreuil, near Paris.

<doc id="234273" wikidata="Q2465506" url="?curid=234273" title="Separation of concerns">
<text>In computer science, separation of concerns (sometimes abbreviated as SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate &quot;concern&quot;, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as &quot;the details of the hardware for an application&quot;, or as specific as &quot;the name of which class to instantiate&quot;. A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).

Separation of concerns results in more degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program&#x27;s design, deployment, or usage. Common among these is increased freedom for simplification and maintenance of code. When concerns are well-separated, there are more opportunities for module upgrade, reuse, and independent development. Hiding the implementation details of modules behind an interface enables improving or modifying a single concern&#x27;s section of code without having to know the details of other sections and without having to make corresponding changes to those other sections. Modules can also expose different versions of an interface, which increases the freedom to upgrade a complex system in piecemeal fashion without interim loss of functionality.

Separation of concerns is a form of abstraction. As with most abstractions, separating concerns means adding additional code interfaces, generally creating more code to be executed. The extra code can result in higher computation costs in some cases, but in other cases also can lead to reuse of more optimized code. So despite the many benefits of well-separated concerns, there may be an associated execution penalty.

== Implementation ==
The mechanisms for modular or object-oriented programming that are provided by a programming language are mechanisms that allow developers to provide SoC. For example, object-oriented programming languages such as C#, C++, Delphi, and Java can separate concerns into objects, and architectural design patterns like MVC or MVP can separate presentation and the data-processing (model) from content. Service-oriented design can separate concerns into services. Procedural programming languages such as C and Pascal can separate concerns into procedures or functions. Aspect-oriented programming languages can separate concerns into aspects and objects.

Separation of concerns is an important design principle in many other areas as well, such as urban planning, architecture and information design. The goal is to more effectively understand, design, and manage complex interdependent systems, so that functions can be reused, optimized independently of other functions, and insulated from the potential failure of other functions.

Common examples include separating a space into rooms, so that activity in one room does not affect people in other rooms, and keeping the stove on one circuit and the lights on another, so that overload by the stove does not turn the lights off. The example with rooms shows encapsulation, where information inside one room, such as how messy it is, is not available to the other rooms, except through the interface, which is the door. The example with circuits demonstrates that activity inside one module, which is a circuit with consumers of electricity attached, does not affect activity in a different module, so each module is not concerned with what happens in the other.

== Origin ==
The term &quot;separation of concerns&quot; was probably coined by Edsger W. Dijkstra in his 1974 paper &quot;On the role of scientific thought&quot;.
Fifteen years later, it was evident the term was becoming an accepted idea. In 1989, Chris Reade wrote a book titled &quot;Elements of Functional Programming&quot; that describes separation of concerns:

Reade continues to say,
== Examples ==

=== Internet protocol stack ===
Separation of concerns is crucial to the design of the Internet. In the Internet protocol suite, great efforts have been made to separate concerns into well-defined layers. This allows protocol designers to focus on the concerns in one layer, and ignore the other layers. The Application Layer protocol SMTP, for example, is concerned about all the details of conducting an email session over a reliable transport service (usually TCP), but not in the least concerned about how the transport service makes that service reliable. Similarly, TCP is not concerned about the routing of data packets, which is handled at the Internet layer.

=== HTML, CSS, JavaScript ===
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are complementary languages used in the development of web pages and websites. HTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of content presentation style, and JavaScript defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of CSS, HTML performed both duties of defining semantics and style.

=== Subject-oriented programming ===
Subject-oriented programming allows separate concerns to be addressed as separate software constructs, each on an equal footing with the others. Each concern provides its own class-structure into which the objects in common are organized, and contributes state and methods to the composite result where they cut across one another. Correspondence rules describe how the classes and methods in the various concerns are related to each other at points where they interact, allowing composite behavior for a method to be derived from several concerns. Multi-dimensional separation of concerns allows the analysis and composition of concerns to be manipulated as a multi-dimensional &quot;matrix&quot; in which each concern provides a dimension in which different points of choice are enumerated, with the cells of the matrix occupied by the appropriate software artifacts.

=== Aspect-oriented programming ===
Aspect-oriented programming allows cross-cutting concerns to be addressed as primary concerns. For example, most programs require some form of security and logging. Security and logging are often secondary concerns, whereas the primary concern is often on accomplishing business goals. However, when designing a program, its security must be built into the design from the beginning instead of being treated as a secondary concern. Applying security afterwards often results in an insufficient security model that leaves too many gaps for future attacks. This may be solved with aspect-oriented programming. For example, an aspect may be written to enforce that calls to a certain API are always logged, or that errors are always logged when an exception is thrown, regardless of whether the program&#x27;s procedural code handles the exception or propagates it.

=== Levels of analysis in artificial intelligence ===
In cognitive science and artificial intelligence, it is common to refer to David Marr&#x27;s levels of analysis. At any given time, a researcher may be focusing on (1) what some aspect of intelligence needs to compute, (2) what algorithm it employs, or (3) how that algorithm is implemented in hardware. This separation of concerns is similar to the interface/implementation distinction in software and hardware engineering.

=== Normalized systems ===

In normalized systems separation of concerns is one of the four guiding principles. Adhering to this principle is one of the tools that helps reduce the combinatorial effects that, over time, get introduced in software that is being maintained. In normalized systems separation of concerns is actively supported by the tools.

=== SoC via partial classes ===
Separation of concerns can be implemented and enforced via partial classes.

==== SoC via partial classes in Ruby ====

<text>Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is a suburb of West London, England, within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham west of Charing Cross, and identified as a major metropolitan centre in the London Plan.

Although primarily residential in character, its focus is the shopping area of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, with the Westfield London shopping centre a short distance to the north. The main thoroughfares are Uxbridge Road, Goldhawk Road and Askew Road, all with small and mostly independent shops, pubs and restaurants. Loftus Road football stadium in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is home to Queens Park Rangers. In 2011, the population of the area was 39,724.

The district is bounded by Hammersmith to the south, Holland Park and Notting Hill to the east, Harlesden and Kensal Green to the north and by Acton and Chiswick to the west. White City forms the northern part of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush comprises the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, Askew, College Park &amp; Old Oak, and Wormholt and White City wards of the borough.

==History==


===Origins===
The name &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot; is thought to have originated from the use of the common land here as a resting point for shepherds on their way to Smithfield Market in the City of London. An alternative theory is that it could have been named after someone in the area, because in 1635 the area was recorded as &quot;Sheppard&#x27;s Bush Green&quot;.

Evidence of human habitation can be traced back to the Iron Age. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush enters the written record in the year 704 when it was bought by Waldhere, Bishop of London as a part of the &quot;Fulanham&quot; estate.

===19th century===
A map of London dated 1841 shows Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to be largely undeveloped and chiefly rural in character, with much open farmland, compared with fast-developing Hammersmith. Residential development began in earnest in the late 19th century, as London&#x27;s population expanded relentlessly. In 1904 the Catholic Church of Holy Ghost and St Stephen, built in the Gothic style with a triple-gabled facade of red brick and Portland stone, was completed and opened to the public.

===20th century===

Like other parts of London, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush suffered from bomb damage during World War II, especially from V-1 flying bomb attacks (known as &quot;doodlebugs&quot; or &quot;buzzbombs&quot;), which struck randomly and with little warning.

On 13 April 1963, the Beatles recorded their first-ever BBC Television broadcast at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. The group returned in 1964 for a further recording. Lime Grove Studios was demolished in 1994 to make way for residential accommodation.

More recently, the White City bus station is housed in the redeveloped Dimco Buildings (1898), Grade II listed red brick buildings which were originally built in 1898 as a shed for a London Underground power station. The Dimco buildings were used as a filming location for the &#x27;Acme Factory&#x27; in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and later served as the interior of the British Museum in &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;.

==Geography==

The area&#x27;s focal point is Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green (also known as Shepherds Bush Common), a triangular area of about of open grass surrounded by trees and roads with shops, with Westfield shopping centre to its north.

The Green is a hub on the local road network, with four main roads radiating from the western side of the green and three roads approaching its eastern apex, meeting at the large Holland Park Roundabout. This position makes it an important node of the bus network, with eighteen bus routes arriving there. It is also served by five London Underground stations (see &quot;Transport&quot; below): Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and White City both on the Central line, and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market, Goldhawk Road and Wood Lane all on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines.

To the east, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is bounded by the physical barrier of the West London railway line and the grade-separated West Cross Route (part of the aborted 1960s London Motorway Box scheme); the Holland Park Roundabout and the small Addison Bridge to the south are the only ways to cross this barrier from Shepherds Bush.

Most of the areas to the east of the barrier differ significantly in character, being associated with the more affluent Holland Park and Notting Hill; although the Edward Woods Estate just to the north-east of the roundabout is part of and is managed by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

To the south, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush neighbours Brook Green and Hammersmith.

==Commerce==

Commercial activity in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is now focused on the Westfield shopping centre next to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Central line station and on the many small shops which run along the northern side of the Green.

Originally built in the 1970s with a rooftop car park and connecting bridge to the station, the older West 12 Shepherds Bush shopping centre was significantly redeveloped in the 1990s. The bridge was removed, and the centre now houses several chain stores, a 12-screen cinema, gym, pub, restaurants, a medical practice and a supermarket.

The small shops continue along many of the most popular roads within Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, such as Uxbridge Road. Many of these establishments cater for the local ethnic minority communities. For example, a relatively large proportion of the local shops on Goldhawk Road (south of the Green) are dedicated to Ethiopian culture, whether that be through food, clothing or barbershops. (see &quot;Demographics&quot;).

Running parallel to, and partly under, an elevated section of the Hammersmith &amp; City line there is a large permanent market, the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market, selling all types of foodstuffs, cooked food, household goods, clothing and bric-à-brac.

The Westfield Group (with Hausinvest Europa) opened a shopping centre in October 2008.

==Office buildings==
As well as the offices within the Television Centre on Wood Lane, opposite this is Network House, 1 Ariel Way, a building that was let by Frost Meadowcroft on behalf of Westfield to Zodiak Entertainment in September 2009 and in Rockley Road is the Shepherds Building where Endemol another TV company are based and where Jellycat, a soft toy company, relocated their head office to in February 2010.

===Residential===
The residential areas of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush are primarily located to the west of the Green, either side of Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road to the southwest, and about as far as Askew Road in the west. Much of the housing in this area consists of three- or four-storey terraces dating from the late 19th century, and subsequently divided up into small flats.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is also home to the White City Estate, a housing estate that was originally constructed in the 1930s and further extended after the war in the early 1950s. It was built on the site of the grounds of the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition and close to the White City Stadium and has given its name to the northern part of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush which is now better known as White City.

==Transport==

=== Rail and Tube ===

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is a major transport interchange in west London. Five London Underground stations serve the area, including:

* Shepherd&#x27;s Bush – at the eastern apex of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, near the Westfield shopping centre
* Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market – to the north-west of the Green, on Uxbridge Road
* Goldhawk Road – to the south-west of the Green, on Goldhawk Road
* White City – to the north of the Westfield shopping centre
* Wood Lane – to the north of the Westfield shopping centre

All stations are in London fare zone 2.

The Central line links the area to Ealing and areas of north-west London, such as Greenford and Ruislip. To the east, the line links Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to London&#x27;s West End, the City, and Stratford.

The Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines share the same route through the area, with direct services southbound to nearby Hammersmith. To the north, the lines curve eastwards towards Latimer Road and Ladbroke Grove. The lines then run directly to key destinations such as Paddington, King&#x27;s Cross, Moorgate in the city, and the East End.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush railway station is served by National Rail trains, operated by London Overground () and Southern. There are direct services from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Kensington, and Clapham Junction and Balham, both of which are based in the south west of London, and Croydon in the south east of London. Northbound Southern services link the area to Wembley, Watford, Hemel Hempstead, and Milton Keynes. London Overground services running northbound travel towards Willesden Junction, where services continue towards West Hampstead, Camden, Hackney, and Stratford in east London. The station is an out-of-station interchange with Shepherd&#x27;s Bush tube station on the Central line, and is situated on the western side of Holland Park Roundabout.

=== Bus ===
There are two main bus interchanges in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

London Buses routes 31, 49, 72, 94, 95, 148, 207, 220, 228, 237, 260, 272, 283, 295, 316, 607, N72, N207, and C1 serve Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green and the southern side of the Westfield shopping centre.

Most of these routes also serve White City bus station on the northern side of Westfield.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush was also the proposed terminus of the West London Tram, an on-street light rail line running to Uxbridge via Acton, Ealing and Southall. This project was cancelled in 2007 in favour of an enhanced bus service and the development of Crossrail.

=== Cycling ===
Cycle lanes run around the southern rim of the Holland Park Roundabout on the eastern side of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. This provides cyclists with traffic-free access from Holland Park Avenue to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green.

Transport for London (TfL) proposes that a cycle spur will link the roundabout to Cycleway 9, which is intended to run along Kensington High Street.

The Santander Cycles bicycle-sharing system operates around Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, with docking stations near Westfield, Wood Lane station, and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Road.

=== Road ===

The A3220/West Cross Route runs along the eastern rim of the district. Until 2000, the route was the M41 motorway, part of the abandoned Ringways network of orbital roads in London. Despite not retaining motorway status, pedal cycles are prohibited from using the route northbound. The A3220 links Shepherd&#x27;s Bush with the A40/Westway to the north. This provides the area with a dual-carriageway link to Paddington and Marylebone to the east, and westbound to Acton and the M40 motorway. Southbound, the A3220 is named Holland Road and links the area to Earl&#x27;s Court, the A4, and Chelsea.

Other key routes through Shepherd&#x27;s Bush include:

* the A219 (Wood Lane/Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Road) – northbound to White City, Wormwood Scrubs, and Harlesden, southbound to Hammersmith, Fulham, and Putney;
* the A402 (Goldhawk Road/Holland Park Avenue) – westbound to Chiswick, eastbound to Notting Hill Gate, Marble Arch, and Oxford Street;
* the A4020 (Uxbridge Road) – westbound to Acton and Ealing.

==In popular culture==
===Arts and entertainment===
The junkyard in the sitcom &quot;Steptoe &amp; Son&quot; was situated at the fictional Oil Drum Lane, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. It is often humorously referred to in the popular BBC series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; where the main character, Edina Monsoon, owns her home but prefers to say she lives in the more favourable, upscale Holland Park nearby.

The BBC used to have many offices in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, but many have now been closed or moved. They included the Lime Grove Studios on the site of previous film studios Gaumont and Gainsborough Pictures. Sulgrave House, Threshold and Union Houses and Kensington House—now a hotel. The BBC&#x27;s presence in the Bush is now concentrated in two huge sites on Wood Lane, Television Centre and the White City building. The Media Village was built next to the White City building in the mid-1980s on the former site of the White City Stadium. It is used by the BBC and other media companies including Red Bee Media (formerly BBC Broadcast, now a private company). Television Centre was the national home of BBC Television, and it is from there that BBC TV and radio news, the BBC website and a host of TV drama and light entertainment were broadcast. The BBC moved all of its news operations from Television Centre to Broadcasting House in central London in 2012.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green The newly regenerated green in 2012–13 was the site for the public sculptures Goaloids by Fine Artist Elliott Brook. This Inspire Mark (awarded by LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) making it part of the Cultural Olympiad) artwork was installed on Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green for the duration of London 2012 and the Paralympic Games. These large unique rotating football related sculptures commemorated the history of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and White City, which hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics football. The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is the only Borough to have three football teams playing Premier League Football.

Bush Theatre is one of the most celebrated new writing theatres in the world. Situated on the green it has international reputation for discovering, nurturing and producing the best new theatre writers from the widest range of backgrounds, and for presenting their work to the high standards.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire is a music venue and former television studio, and has played host to some very popular acts and TV programmes, including David Bowie, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, &quot;Wogan&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, &quot;Crackerjack&quot;, and &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Bush Hall is another, rather smaller, venue at 310 Uxbridge Road, built in 1904 as a dance hall. It predominantly showcases smaller acoustic performers.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Walkabout was a popular music and live sports venue located on the western end of the green, and home to the West London Wildcats and Shepherds Bush Raiders Aussie Rules teams. On Australian and New Zealand national holidays, big sporting events such as the National Rugby League Grand Final, Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup Rugby Union test matches, Australian Football League grand final, memorial days such as Waitangi Day, Australia Day, and Anzac Day, and on Sundays after The Church, the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Walkabout was the centre of Antipodean life in London. The live music was usually a mixture of up and coming local acts, and cover bands who played Australian and New Zealand classic songs and contemporary popular music. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Walkabout closed in early October 2013 and it was announced the site would be redeveloped into a hotel.

The casting agency 2020 Casting, which supplies extras for film shoots, is based in Hopgood Street, just off Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green.

Some important rock and roll groups have roots in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. The Who infused much of their work with the youth culture of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush during the 1960s and 1970s. Steve Jones, guitarist of punk legends the Sex Pistols, was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, and Pistols drummer Paul Cook grew up here. The Clash&#x27;s early work is infused with the culture of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and the Westway. Libertines and Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty moved to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush at age 16. Tony Butler, bass-player with 1980s band Big Country and others, was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Bands Bush and Symposium hail from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, the former taking their name from the area.

Classical musicians Evelyn Glennie and Robert Steadman have both lived in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

In the Westfield shopping centre area at White City, the grade II listed Dimco buildings (1898), now redeveloped as a bus station, were used as the location for the &#x27;Acme Factory&#x27; in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

===Sports===
Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is home to Queens Park Rangers football club, who play their home games in Loftus Road.
Olympic gold medal winner Linford Christie also grew up in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and lived in Loftus Road as a child. A stadium on nearby Wormwood Scrubs is named the Linford Christie Stadium in his honour. Some of the football games in the 1908 Olympics were hosted in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Shepherds Bush F.C. were the local side until 1915.

Former England national rugby union team captain Lawrence Dallaglio was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham has created the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Conservation Area in order to promote the protection of local buildings of historic interest, and improve the character of the neighbourhood.

<text>Wollongong ( ; Dharawal: &quot;Woolyungah&quot;) is a city located in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. The name is believed to originate from the Dharawal language, meaning either &#x27;five islands/clouds&#x27;, &#x27;ground near water&#x27; or &#x27;sound of the sea&#x27;. Wollongong lies on the narrow coastal strip between the Illawarra Escarpment and the Pacific Ocean, 85 kilometres (53 miles) south of Sydney. Wollongong had an estimated urban population of 302,739 at June 2018, making it the third-largest city in New South Wales after Sydney and Newcastle and the tenth-largest city in Australia by population. The city&#x27;s current Lord Mayor is Tania Brown who was elected in 2024.

The Wollongong area extends from Helensburgh in the north to Windang and Yallah in the south. Geologically, the city is located in the south-eastern part of the Sydney basin, which extends from Newcastle to Nowra.

Wollongong is noted for its heavy industry, its port activity and the quality of its physical setting, occupying a narrow coastal plain between an almost continuous chain of surf beaches and the cliffline of the rainforest-covered Illawarra escarpment. It has two cathedrals, churches of many denominations and the Nan Tien Temple. Wollongong has a long history of coal mining and industry. The city attracts many tourists each year and is a regional centre for the South Coast fishing industry. The University of Wollongong has around 38,000 students.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by the Dharawal Indigenous Australians. The first Europeans to visit the area were the navigators George Bass and Matthew Flinders, who landed at Lake Illawarra in 1796. The first settlers in the region were cedar cutters in the early nineteenth century, followed by graziers in 1812. Charles Throsby established a stockman&#x27;s hut in the area in 1815. The first land grants were made in 1816. In 1830, a military barracks was constructed near the harbour. Further settlers arrived and in 1834 a town was planned. On 26 November 1834, the town was first gazetted and George Brown erected the first court house. The main road down the Escarpment through Bulli Pass was built by convict labour in 1835–6, although other passes were built during the 19th century as well, such as O&#x27;Briens Road and Rixons Pass. By 1856 Wollongong had a population of 864. 
In 1858, a court house was built. In 1861, a horse-drawn tramway from Mount Keira to the harbour was completed. In 1862 a telegraph line was opened between Wollongong and Bellambi. In 1865 the first gas supply in Wollongong was provided from a gas plant in Corrimal Street. In 1868 the extensions to the harbour were opened by Lady Belmore and named Belmore Basin. Patrick Lahiff established a coke works at Wollongong Harbour in the 1870s. He erected two beehive coke ovens between the north eastern end of the basin and Pulpit Rock. The ovens were demolished in 1892. The remains of the coke ovens were uncovered and recovered and are now preserved beneath the hill, with a plaque explaining their history.
In 1871 the old lighthouse was completed. Nevertheless, in 1881 a British clipper, , ran ashore off the mouth of Towradgi Creek. Her cargo included 24,000 bottles of Hennessy Cognac. Local police and NSW Customs recovered at least 5,000 bottles, but others were looted by members of the public.

The surviving part of the &quot;Queen of Nations&quot; wreck is only about from the shore, in water only deep. From time to time, a violent storm uncovers part of the wreck. After one such storm in 1991, looting resumed, including of the Cognac. The Commonwealth Government quickly issued an order protecting the wreck under the then &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot;. Since 2018 the &quot;Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018&quot; has automatically protected the wreck and its contents, as they are more than 75 years old.


In 1880 steam locomotives were introduced to haul coal from Mount Keira mine to the harbour. Gas street lighting was introduced in 1883. In 1885 a new court house was erected in Market Street. Like many Australian court houses, it was designed in a Classical Revival style considered appropriate for public buildings. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. In 1886 the first town hall was erected. The Illawarra Railway to Wollongong was completed in 1887, and now continues as far south as the town of Bomaderry on the Shoalhaven River. The navigator George Bass first documented the Illawarra coal deposits in 1797. There have been many coalmines in the district. Australia&#x27;s worst coal mining disaster occurred in 1902, at the Mount Kembla mine when an explosion killed 94 men and boys, the youngest aged 14, the oldest 69. Two other men died attempting to rescue survivors. Survivors were treated at the &quot;A. M. (Albert Memorial) Hospital&quot;, which opened in 1864 and closed when the Wollongong Hospital opened in 1907 on Garden Hill. In 1916 the Wollongong High School was opened.

Heavy industry was attracted to the region by the ready availability of coal. In 1928, Hoskins, later Australian Iron &amp; Steel, started a steelworks at Port Kembla, a few kilometres south of Wollongong. The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company (now BHP after merging with Billiton plc) acquired AI&amp;S in 1935, but has since spun-out their steel division as a separate company, now known as BlueScope. The steelworks has grown to become a world-class flat rolled steel producer, operating as a fully integrated steel plant with a production of around 5 million tonnes per year. Other industries to have set up in the massive Port Kembla industrial complex—the largest single concentration of heavy industry in Australia—include a fertiliser plant, an electrolytic copper smelter, a locomotive workshop, a coal export shipping terminal, a grain export shipping terminal and an industrial gases manufacturing plant.

In 1936, the new Wollongong Lighthouse was finished on Flagstaff Point. In 1942 Wollongong was proclaimed a City. In 1947 City of Greater Wollongong was formed. In 1954 the population of Wollongong was 90,852. In 1956 new Wollongong City Council Chambers were opened. In 1961 the Wollongong University College was established. In 1963, the Wollongong Teachers College was established. In 1965 the Westfield shopping centre at Figtree opened.

In 1985, the railway line was electrified to Wollongong, and in 1993 to Dapto. In 1986 the Wollongong Mall was completed. For a short while, trams (trackless trains) were used in the mall, though this ceased due to dangers involved. The mall was re-opened to traffic after the initial test but re-zoned a pedestrian area after and has remained one since.

In 1987 the council chambers and library building were completed, replacing the old council building at the present art gallery site. The Crown Gateway Shopping Centre was completed. Wollongong Mall was opened. In 1988, the current council administration building was completed, as well as the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre (IPAC), across the road on Burelli Street. IPAC was officially opened by Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1988. A sculpture recognizing Lawrence Hargrave was placed via helicopter on the eastern foothills of Mount Keira. In 1998 the 6000 seat Wollongong Entertainment Centre was opened.

In 1999, the Gateway and Crown Central mall buildings were unified as Wollongong Central and a pedestrian walkway/café was built connecting the buildings in an above ground bridge. In 2000, as part of the Sydney Olympics, the Olympic torch was carried through Wollongong as part of its journey. In 2001, the population of Wollongong reached 181,612 people. In 2004 the Wollongong City Gallery celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2005 Qantas established a daily air service from Wollongong to Melbourne that lasted till 2008.

In 2006/2007, the library was renovated, including new facilities, as part of the tenth anniversary of the library&#x27;s current site. Also at this time the beachfront was renovated with a new lookout and walkway upgrade. In June 2007, erosion was caused via storms to the beaches, the worst in 30 years.

Despite the decline of traditional manufacturing and blue-collar industries due to the abandonment of protectionist economic policies in the 1980s, many of these industrial installations still exist. The city&#x27;s economy is, however, on the rebound, thanks to diversification of economic activity including higher education, the fine arts, tourism, residential construction and eco-friendly electricity generation; however, the city&#x27;s economy still relies primarily on heavy industry, and will continue to in the near future.

Various meanings are given for the Aboriginal word &#x27; Wollongong&#x27; including &#x27;seas of the South&#x27;, &#x27; great feast of fish&#x27; , &#x27;hard ground near water&#x27;, &#x27;song of the sea&#x27; &#x27; sound of the waves&#x27; &#x27;many snakes&#x27; and &#x27; five islands&#x27;.

In 2024, the wreck of a coal ship was discovered by accident, off the coast of Wollongong. The ship the SS Nemesis was sailing from Wollongong to Melbourne and it sank nearly 120 years ago.

==Geography==

The city of Wollongong has a distinct geography. It lies on a narrow coastal plain flanked by the Tasman Sea to the east and a steep sandstone precipice known as the Illawarra Escarpment to the west. The coastal plain is widest in the south and narrowest in the north, with the city centre located about midway. South of the city centre but within the urban area is Lake Illawarra, a large lagoon. Although Wollongong sits on the immediate coast, it lies on the same longitude as Greater Western Sydney. The escarpment ranges between above sea level, with locally famous mountains such as Mount Keira (), Mount Kembla (), Broker&#x27;s Nose () and Mount Murray () to the south. It contains strata of coal measures, and the adit entrances to many coal mines have been established along the slopes of the escarpment throughout Wollongong. Suburbia encroaches on the escarpment&#x27;s lower slopes in some areas, but the majority remains in a relatively natural state forested with dry sclerophyll and pockets of temperate rainforest. The escarpment is largely protected by a State Conservation Area and local scenic protection zoning, and provides the visual backdrop to the city.

In the north the escarpment meets the coastline, and north of this the coastal road Lawrence Hargrave Drive hugs the cliff line. The unstable geology of the escarpment resulted in rockfalls, forcing the closure of the road. Subsequently, part of Lawrence Hargrave Drive was replaced in 2005 by the Sea Cliff Bridge just off the coast, crossing the submerged rock shelf. The bridge carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The Illawarra railway line must go through several tunnels to reach the Sydney metropolitan area. The Southern Freeway and Princes Highway provide alternative inland routes, descending the escarpment further south at Bulli Pass or at Mount Ousley, entering just north of Wollongong&#x27;s city centre.

To the south the plain reaches its maximum extent around Albion Park where it incorporates a large coastal saltwater lagoon called Lake Illawarra, separated from the Pacific Ocean by a long sandy spit.

The coastal strip consists of highly fertile alluvium, which made Wollongong so attractive to agriculturists in the nineteenth century. It contains many hills including the foothills of the escarpment&#x27;s lower slopes, and while these generally do not exceed one hundred metres in height they give much of the city an undulating character. The coastal strip is traversed by several short but flood-prone and fast-flowing streams and creeks such as Fairy Creek (Para Creek), Cabbage Tree Creek, Allans Creek, Nostaw Ravine, Jimbob Creek, Mullet Creek and Macquarie Rivulet.

The coastline consists of many beaches characterised by fine pale gold-coloured sands; however, these beaches are sometimes interrupted by prominent and rocky headlands, such as Tego Rock, jutting into the sea. In places these headlands have been excavated or extended to create artificial harbours at Wollongong, Port Kembla, Shellharbour and Kiama. Just off the coast south of Wollongong centre, near Port Kembla, lies a group of five islands known collectively as The Five Islands. The islands are a wildlife refuge.

===Climate===
Wollongong has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) as its warmest month mean of 
is just below the subtropical isotherm of . The highest recorded temperature is 44.1 °C on 1 January 2006, and the lowest 0.8 °C on 27 July 1986. Annually, Wollongong receives 107.4 clear days.

Rainfall is spread through the months but has a bias to the first half of the year. It is often associated with orographic lift caused by the escarpment and its exposed location on the Tasman Sea, which makes it more prone to moist easterlies. A significant flood event occurred on 18 August 1998 when Wollongong recorded 316 mm of rainfall (the nearby suburb of Mt Ousley recorded in excess of 445 mm), mostly falling in a 3-hour period. Wollongong also experiences thunderstorms during the warmer months bringing lightning, heavy rain and occasionally hail.

July and August are known as the windy months, with westerly gales that can gust at over 100 km/h. These are generally dry foehn winds off the Great Dividing Range, which are common in the winter and spring on the leeward side of the Ranges. 

== Urban structure ==
The inner city area includes the suburbs of Wollongong and North Wollongong, extending from Fairy Meadow in the north, west to include the Wollongong Hospital, and south to the Greenhouse Park. At the , the suburb of Wollongong had a population of 18,442.

The CBD is a major commercial hub containing many department stores and specialty shops, offices, and entertainment venues. It is centred on the Crown Street Mall and Wollongong Central, and approximates the area bounded by Market, Corrimal, and Burelli streets and the railway line. Surrounding the CBD lies a mixture of parks, reserves, light commercial property, houses and multi-story residential units. Multi-story housing is evident particularly on Smith&#x27;s Hill, north-east of the CBD, reflecting the popularity of combining inner-city living, coastal views and a beachside lifestyle.
To the east of the city lies Flagstaff Point, a rocky headland with eroded low cliffs topped by a grassy hill. The northern side of the point was excavated by convict labour to form Belmore Basin. This was later extended with the northern breakwater to create Wollongong Harbour. The area is the site of a historic colonial fort, several restored cannons and two lighthouses, a feature peculiar to the east coast of Australia. The older Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse located at the harbour entrance was made of wrought iron plates in 1871 and has become an icon of the city. The newer Wollongong Head Lighthouse was constructed in 1936 atop the Flagstaff Hill and is still used in the early 21st century. Belmore Basin houses the commercial fishing fleet and Fisherman&#x27;s Co-op, while the main harbour shelters private vessels.

The main beaches of central Wollongong are North Wollongong (or simply North [gong]) Beach, extending from the harbour up to the Fairy lagoon and Puckeys Estate Reserve, and Wollongong City Beach, extending south from Flagstaff Point and into Coniston Beach.

==Demographics==
The Wollongong metropolitan area includes the suburbs, outlying towns and rural localities stretching from Helensburgh in the north to Kiama in the south. According to the 2021 census, it had a population of 305,691 people. 
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.6% of the population.
* 76.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, North Macedonia 1.3%, New Zealand 1.1%, Italy 0.9% and India 0.9%.
* 81.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Macedonian 2.0%, Italian 1.1%, Arabic 1.1% , Mandarin 0.8%, and Spanish 0.8%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.0%, Catholic 23.3% and Anglican 13.6%.
* 5.1% of employed people worked in Hospitals (except Psychiatric Hospitals). Other major industries of employment included Other Social Assistance Services 3.1%, Aged Care Residential Services 2.8%, Supermarket and Grocery Stores 2.6% and Takeaway Food Services 2.5%.
It is the third largest city in New South Wales and the tenth largest in Australia. Using 2006 ABS geography, around 89% of the statistical district&#x27;s population reside in the built-up urban centre extending from Clifton to Shell Cove.

Wollongong is continuing to grow with a population growth of 3.1% for the period 2001 to 2006, although the supply of new residential land is limited by the geography particularly in the northern suburbs. The west Dapto area is a major centre of future growth with plans for 19,000 new dwellings and 50,000 people within 40 years. New residential areas are also being developed further south around the Albion Park, Shell Cove and Kiama areas.

Wollongong has a distinctly multicultural population. Many migrants were attracted to the area by the job opportunities at the Port Kembla steelworks in the post-war period, and settled in surrounding suburbs such as Cringila, Warrawong and Coniston. By 1966 about 60% of the wage earners at the Australian Iron and Steel steelworks were born overseas coming from over 100 countries. These included British, Irish, Macedonians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Greeks, Italians, Arabs, Russians, Bosnians, Croatians, Serbians, Germans, Turks, Lebanese, Chileans and Brazilians. With the end of the White Australia policy these were followed by Indo-Chinese refugees in the 1970s, Indians, Filipinos, Chinese, Japanese, Malaysians, Singaporeans, Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Pacific Islanders in the 1980s and 1990s. The University of Wollongong continues to attract students and staff from all over the world, with around 5,000 overseas student enrolments and countless overseas professors working there.

Around 20,000 people commute daily to jobs in Sydney by road and rail, making it one of the busiest commuter corridors in Australia.

==Politics and government==
Two federal divisions in the House of Representatives are mostly or entirely located in Greater Wollongong: Cunningham and Whitlam, with a very small portion of Gilmore being in the far southern suburbs of the city. On the state level, there are four electoral districts of the Legislative Assembly that are mostly or entirely located in Wollongong: Heathcote, Keira, Shellharbour and Wollongong, with a very small portion of Kiama being in the far southern suburbs of the city.

The city of Wollongong has traditionally voted for the centre-left Labor Party over the centre-right Liberal Party. Labor holds both of the two federal seats mostly or entirely located in Wollongong, as well as all four of the state seats that are mostly or entirely located in Wollongong. However, the Liberal Party has held the Wollongong-based state seat of Heathcote multiple times (including for 12 consecutive years from the Coalition&#x27;s 2011 landslide victory until Labor&#x27;s return to power in 2023, note that redistribution made Heathcote a notional Labor seat as it moved south to included more of Wollongong and less of southern Sydney). However, even in 2011 (when Labor suffered the worst defeat of a sitting New South Wales government in the state&#x27;s history and the Coalition won the largest majority government in the state&#x27;s history), Labor still won every Wollongong-based seat except Heathcote, making the Illawarra the only region in the state where Labor won more seats than the Coalition. The last time the Liberals won a Wollongong-based state seat other than Heathcote was in 1968, when the Coalition won the seat of Wollongong for one term before Labor regained it in 1971.

On the local level, there are two Wollongong-based local government areas (LGAs): the City of Wollongong and the City of Shellharbour, with a very small portion of the Municipality of Kiama being located in the far southern suburbs of the city. The City of Wollongong is represented by a directly elected Lord Mayor (currently Tania Brown) and 12 councillors (four each per ward): with Labor having eight seats, the Greens having three and the remaining two seats being held by independents Andrew Anthony and Ryan Morris. The City of Shellharbour has an indirectly elected Mayor (currently independent Chris Homer) and eight councillors: four generic independents, three Labor councillors and one councillor from the Kellie Marsh Independent Team.

==Education==
===Tertiary and further education===

There are two campuses of the Illawarra Institute of TAFE. The Wollongong Campus is the network&#x27;s largest campus, and it offers a variety of courses.

<text>Loki Software, Inc. (Loki Entertainment) was an American video game developer based in Tustin, California, that ported several video games from Microsoft Windows to Linux. It took its name from the Norse deity Loki. Although successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company folded in January 2002 after filing for bankruptcy.

==History==
Loki Software was founded on November 9, 1998, by Scott Draeker, a former lawyer who became interested in porting games to Linux after being introduced to the system through his work as a software licensing attorney. By December of that year Loki had gained the rights to produce a port of Activision&#x27;s then-upcoming strategy game &quot;&quot; for Linux. This was to become Loki&#x27;s first actual product, with the game hitting stores in May 1999. From there they gained contracts to port many other titles, such as &quot;Myth II: Soulblighter&quot;, &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot;, and &quot;Eric&#x27;s Ultimate Solitaire&quot;. Throughout the next two years up until its eventual closure the company would continue to bring more games to Linux. BSDi had also partnered with Loki to ensure its Linux ports ran on FreeBSD through a compatibility layer. After facing financial difficulties, Loki filed for bankruptcy in August 2001. The majority of the staff was laid off in January 2002 and Loki formally closed on January 31.

==Legacy==
Loki Software, although a commercial failure, is credited with the birth of the modern Linux game industry. Loki developed several free software tools, such as the Loki installer (also known as Loki Setup), and supported the development of the Simple DirectMedia Layer. They also started the OpenAL audio library project (now being run by Creative Technology and Apple Inc.) and with id Software wrote GtkRadiant. These are still often credited as being the cornerstones of Linux game development. They also worked on and extended several already developed tools, such as GCC and GDB. The book &quot;Programming Linux Games&quot; written in the early 2000s by Loki intern John R. Hall explains the major APIs Loki used to produce Linux games.

Loki also offered a start to many figures still in the Linux and gaming industries. Ryan C. Gordon (also known as icculus), a former employee of Loki, has been responsible for the Linux and Mac OS X ports of many commercial games after the demise of the company. Mike Phillips would help start Linux Game Publishing, which was itself founded in response to Loki&#x27;s closure. Nicholas Vining would go on to do some porting work and is currently the lead programmer at Gaslamp Games, which would later release their game &quot;Dungeons of Dredmor&quot; for Linux. Sam Lantinga would also later join Blizzard Entertainment and found Galaxy Gameworks to commercially support the Simple DirectMedia Layer; he would later also join Valve&#x27;s Linux team.

Although many Loki ports are unsupported since Loki&#x27;s closure, Linux Game Publishing managed to pick up the rights to &quot;MindRover&quot; and offer a supported and updated version of the game&#x27;s Linux port. id Software picked up the support for the Linux release of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, hiring Timothee Besset to maintain it; he would later also be responsible for porting some of id&#x27;s later products to Linux. Running with Scissors, to celebrate the release of the movie &quot;Postal&quot; in 2007 published a multiplayer only version of &quot;Postal 2&quot;, without the single player campaign. In 2004 the source header files for Rune were released freely by Human Head Studios. But so far no one has updated the Linux version of Rune, though the company stated that a game sequel is in the making, and delayed the development of &quot;Prey 2&quot;.

Software contractor Frank C. Earl claimed in 2010 to hold the porting rights for the entire &quot;Myth&quot; series and says he will port it to Linux. Kevin Bentley worked in 2009 on a &quot;Descent 3&quot; patch for Linux, which was re-released in 2014 on Steam by Rebecca Heineman, who got blessed source code access. On October 16, 2011, Project Magma released a new version of &quot;Myth II: Soulblighter&quot; for Linux.

==Games published==

In addition to the published titles, there is also an unfinished port of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. The later update of &quot;Deus Ex&quot; for Microsoft Windows features the OpenGL driver for the Unreal Engine from Loki Software&#x27;s Linux port. This makes the title more compatible with Wine.

<doc id="234280" wikidata="Q6498118" url="?curid=234280" title="Laughing Gas (novel)">
<text>Laughing Gas is a comic novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 25 September 1936 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 19 November 1936 by Doubleday, Doran, New York. Written in first person narrative, the story is set in Hollywood in the early 1930s (the Depression is mentioned twice) and is, compared to, say, Budd Schulberg&#x27;s &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; (1941), a light-hearted and exclusively humorous look at the film industry and in particular at child stars. Both Schulberg and Wodehouse describe the methods of all those would-be screenwriters and actors hunting for jobs, but Wodehouse&#x27;s depiction is not at all serious or critical.

== Plot summary==
Drone Reginald (&quot;Reggie&quot;) Swithin, narrator of the story, is the third Earl of Havershot. He is 28, unmarried, and has a face like a gorilla. As the new head of his family, he is assigned a delicate task by his Aunt Clara and by Plimsoll, the family lawyer: He is to go to Hollywood and look for Aunt Clara&#x27;s son, his cousin Eggy, who seems to have got himself into trouble, and bring him back home. In particular, Reggie is to prevent Eggy from getting engaged, let alone married, to some American gold-digger who would undoubtedly be far beneath the titled family.

On the train from Chicago to Los Angeles, Reggie meets the famous film actress April June, and immediately falls head over heels in love with her. Once in Hollywood, he completely forgets to look for Eggy until, one night, he bumps into him at a party that April June is giving. What is more, Eggy is accompanied by Ann Bannister, Reggie&#x27;s ex-fiancée, who is now engaged to Eggy. According to Eggy, Ann wants to reform him: make him drink less, and get a job as well. As the host of the party, the seemingly wonderful, tender, and caring April June (&quot;Money and fame mean nothing to me, Lord Havershot&quot;) is difficult to get hold of. When he finally succeeds in doing so and is just about to propose to her, Reggie&#x27;s tooth—in the nick of time, as it turns out later—starts hurting so badly that he has to postpone all his plans, hurry home, and make an appointment with a dentist.

On the following afternoon, he is in I. J. Zizzbaum&#x27;s waiting-room when he gets to know Joey Cooley, the 12-year-old movie star and darling of all American mothers. Joey is also going to have a tooth out, but Joey is going to be operated on by B. K. Burwash, Zizzbaum&#x27;s rival—they have a common waiting-room—exactly at the same time as Reggie. Presently reporters storm the dentist&#x27;s practice to take photos of Joey and interview him.

Both Reggie and Joey get laughing gas as anaesthetic. When Reggie regains consciousness he finds himself spoken to by B. K. Burwash, and also in the latter&#x27;s chair. He concludes that there has been a switch in the fourth dimension: Joey&#x27;s and his souls have changed bodies. Before he can clear up the situation, he is shoved into a car and brought &quot;home&quot;.

Joey&#x27;s home in Hollywood—originally he is from Chillicothe, Ohio, where his mother lives—is the Brinkmeyer estate, a kind of golden cage for little Joey. He has been informally adopted by T. P. Brinkmeyer, Hollywood film mogul, and his middle-aged sister, Miss Brinkmeyer, who turns out to be particularly nasty. Gradually, Reggie, in Joey&#x27;s body, gets to know the latter&#x27;s daily practice, which he finds horrifying: He has been put on a strict diet consisting mainly of dried prunes—but now he has the appetite of a 12-year-old! He must not leave the grounds except on official occasions, and he is not given any pocket money. He finds out very quickly that he can beat Miss Brinkmeyer&#x27;s strict regime by climbing out of his bedroom window onto the roof of an outbuilding. He finds some confederates among the Brinkmeyers&#x27; staff (all of whom are aspiring actors who want to attract Brinkmeyer&#x27;s attention by playing their servant roles in real life): The gardener readily supplies him with Mexican horned toads and some frogs (to hide in Miss Brinkmeyer&#x27;s room and clothes); and Chaffinch, the butler, even suggests to him that he may be able to sell Joey&#x27;s tooth to the press (who in turn might be willing to give it to a souvenir hunter) at the considerable price of $5,000. Desperate for some cash, Reggie agrees but is cheated out of the money by Chaffinch, who takes the money and runs off to New York. Moreover, Reggie is very disturbed when he learns that Ann Bannister has been hired to serve as girl Friday for Joey. For example, her duties include bathing the boy, which Reggie categorically refuses.

In the meantime, Joey, in Reggie&#x27;s body, embarks on a tour of vengeance: He has sworn to (literally) &quot;poke&quot; all the unpleasant people around him &quot;in the snoot&quot;, starting with his press agent and the director of a recent film of his. He also enters the Brinkmeyer estate and pushes Miss Brinkmeyer into the swimming pool. Wherever he goes, eyewitnesses describe him as looking like a gorilla. (Fair-haired Reggie Havershot admits earlier on in the novel that he is not particularly handsome.)

On the other hand, wherever Eggy (whose complexion, especially in the morning, is described as &quot;greenish&quot;) meets Reggie in Joey&#x27;s body, he thinks his drinking habits have got the better of him. He starts to panic and joins the Temple of the New Dawn, a temperance organisation, eventually becoming engaged to one of its promoters, Mabel Prescott. (All this happens in the course of only two days.) One of the meetings between Reggie/Joey and Eggy is when Eggy is hired as the kid&#x27;s elocution teacher.

Reggie/Joey is also harassed by two other child film stars who live in the neighbourhood, but at least he discovers that he can outrun them. Also, he is kidnapped, but the whole abduction turns out to be a publicity stunt he has not been warned of.

While Reggie&#x27;s soul is still inside Joey&#x27;s body Reggie also realises that his beloved April June is a &quot;pill&quot; and a scheming and selfish little beast jealous of everybody else&#x27;s success. When they are alone at her place, she even kicks him with her foot because by his turning up he has disturbed an interview for some magazine or newspaper. On the next morning his career abruptly comes to an end when it is in all the papers that he drank liquor and smoked.

At more or less the same time, a coincidence ends Reggie&#x27;s ordeal: Just as he is walking along a street near where he has been held prisoner, Joey/Reggie comes along driving a police motorcycle and hitting the kid. After a brief period of being unconscious, they both come to again, to discover that they have switched bodies again. They both have to flee the city immediately: Joey because he wants to escape the Brinkmeyers&#x27; wrath; and Reggie because he does not want to be caught by the police for what Joey did while walking around in his body (poking several people in the nose, stealing a police motorcycle and similar misdemeanours). Ann Bannister has organised a car that will bring Joey back to his mother in Ohio, and Reggie readily agrees to accompany him. He also makes up with Ann, and they are going to be married.

==Publication history==

&quot;Laughing Gas&quot; was serialised in &quot;This Week&quot; magazine (US) in six issues between 24 March and 28 April 1935, illustrated by Wallace Morgan. It was also serialised in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (UK), between August and October 1935.

The story was included in &quot;The Hollywood Omnibus&quot;, a collection of Wodehouse stories published in May 1985 by Hutchinson, London.

<doc id="234282" wikidata="Q57592" url="?curid=234282" title="Magnus Hirschfeld">
<text>Magnus Hirschfeld (14 May 1868 – 14 May 1935) was a German physician, sexologist and LGBTQ advocate, whose citizenship was later revoked by the Nazi government. Hirschfeld was educated in philosophy, philology and medicine. An outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, Hirschfeld founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee and World League for Sexual Reform. He based his practice in Berlin-Charlottenburg during the Weimar period. Performance Studies and Rhetoric Professor Dustin Goltz characterized the committee as having carried out &quot;the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights&quot;.

Hirschfeld is regarded as one of the most influential sexologists of the 20th century. He was targeted by early fascists and later the Nazis for being Jewish and gay. He was beaten by activists in 1920, and in 1933 his was looted and had its books burned by Nazis. Hirschfeld was forced into exile in France, where he died in 1935.

==Early life==
Hirschfeld was born in Kolberg in Pomerania (since 1945 in Poland), to an Ashkenazi Jewish family, the son of highly regarded physician and Senior Medical Officer Hermann Hirschfeld. As a youth he attended , which at the time was a Protestant school. In 1887–1888, he studied comparative linguistics in Breslau, but decided to transfer to University of Strasbourg (then named the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität)&quot; to study medicine and natural sciences in 1889. He left Straßburg for Berlin in 1890 where he continued his studies for a year before transferring to the University of Munich in 1891. Hirschfeld left Munich later that same year to complete his state mandated military service in Heidelberg, continuing his medical studies at the University of Heidelberg in his spare time. At the end of 1891, Hirschfeld completed his service and returned to Berlin to write his medical thesis on the effects of influenza on the nervous system, with Rudolf Virchow and Emil Heinrich du Bois-Reymond serving as his oral examiners. In 1892, he received his medical degree.

After his studies, Hirschfeld spent the next two years traveling the world, giving lectures and writing articles. He spent time in the major cities of France, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, and the United States. During his eight month stay in the United States, Hirschfeld traveled to Chicago to document the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition for a German newspaper. He became fascinated by the city&#x27;s homosexual subculture, struck by its similarities to the homosexual subculture of Berlin. As a result, Hirschfeld began to develop his theory about the universality of homosexuality around the world; he researched in books and newspaper articles about the existence of gay subcultures in Rio de Janeiro, Tangier, and Tokyo, all of which shared many of the same cultural similarities. 

Hirschfeld returned to Germany in 1894 and opened a naturopathic practice in Magdeburg, where he would develop his lifelong commitment to homosexual rights advocacy. He was struck by the number of his gay patients who had (&#x27;scars left by suicide attempts&#x27;), and often found himself trying to give his patients a reason to live. Hirschfeld was also deeply affected by the 1895 trial of Oscar Wilde, to which he made frequent reference in his writings. In 1896, he had one of the most formative experiences of his career; In 1896, a young lieutenant whom Hirschfeld was treating for severe depression took his own life. In the German language, the word for suicide is (&#x27;self-murder&#x27;), which carried more judgmental and condemnatory connotations than its English language equivalent, making the subject of suicide a taboo in 19th century Germany. The lieutenant addressed his suicide note to Hirschfeld, wherein he wrote that despite his best efforts, he could not end his desires for other men, and so had ended his life out of his guilt and shame. He explained that he lacked the &quot;strength&quot; to tell his parents the &quot;truth&quot;, and spoke of his shame of &quot;that which nearly strangled my heart&quot;. The officer could not even bring himself to use the word &quot;homosexuality&quot;, which he instead conspicuously referred to as &quot;that&quot; in his note. The note closes with the words, &quot;The thought that you [Hirschfeld] could contribute a future when the German fatherland will think of &quot;us&quot; in more just terms sweetens the hour of my death.&quot; Hirschfeld had been treating the officer from 1895–1896, and the use of the term &quot;us&quot; led to speculation that a relationship existed between the two. However, the officer&#x27;s use of , the formal German word for you, instead of the informal , suggests Hirschfeld&#x27;s relationship with his patient was strictly professional. Hirschfeld would go on to repeatedly cite this incident as the catalyst for his career as a sexologist and gay rights activist. 

In 1896, he moved his practice to Berlin-Charlottenburg to pursue this passion and soon published his first work on the subject of homosexualtiy under the psuedonym Th. Ramien entitled, &quot;Sappho und Socrates: Wie erklärt sich die Liebe der Männer und Frauen zu Personen des eigenen Geschlechts?&quot; (&quot;Sappho and Socrates: How does one explain the love of men and women to persons of their own sex?&quot;). The phamphlet argues that homosexuality is a biological, naturally occurring phenomenon which should not be criminalized, quoting the words of Friedrich Nietzsche: &quot;What is natural can not be immoral.&quot;

==Sexual rights activism==
===Scientific-Humanitarian Committee===

Magnus Hirschfeld found a balance between practicing medicine and writing about his findings. Between 1 May–15 October 1896, the (&#x27;Great Business Exhibition of Berlin&#x27;) took place, which featured nine &quot;human zoos&quot; where people from Germany&#x27;s colonies in New Guinea and Africa were put on display for the visitors to gawk at. Such exhibitions of colonised peoples were common at industrial fairs, and later after Qingdao, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands became part of the German empire, Chinese, Chamorros, and Micronesians joined the Africans and New Guineans displayed in the &quot;human zoos&quot;. Hirschfeld, who was keenly interested in sexuality in other cultures, visited the and subsequently other exhibitions to inquire of the people in the &quot;human zoos&quot; via interpreters about the status of sexuality in their cultures. It was in 1896, after talking to the people displayed in the &quot;human zoos&quot; at the , that Hirschfeld began writing what became his 1914 book &quot;Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes&quot; (&quot;The Homosexuality of Men and Women&quot;), an attempt to comprehensively survey homosexuality around the world, as part of an effort to prove that homosexuality occurred in every culture. In the book, Hirschfeld found that many homosexuals considered England to be the country with the highest rate of homosexuality. In addition to his book on homosexuality, Hirschfeld wrote a book on transvestism in 1910 known as &quot;Die Transvestiten: Eine Untersuchung über den Erotischen Verkleidungstrieb&quot; (&quot;Transvestites: The Erotic Drive to Cross-Dress&quot;).

In 1897, Hirschfeld founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee with the publisher Max Spohr (1850–1905), the lawyer Eduard Oberg (1858–1917), and the writer Franz Joseph von Bülow (1861–1915). The group aimed to undertake research to defend the rights of homosexuals and to repeal Paragraph 175, the section of the German penal code that, since 1871, had criminalized homosexuality. They argued that the law encouraged blackmail. The motto of the committee, &quot;Justice through science&quot;, reflected Hirschfeld&#x27;s belief that a better scientific understanding of homosexuality would eliminate social hostility toward homosexuals.

Within the group, some of the members rejected Hirschfeld&#x27;s theory of sexual intermediaries, which conceptualized all traits of sex, gender, and sexual orientation on a spectrum which ranged from masculine to feminine. Offended by the notion of being associated with gender non-conformity, Benedict Friedlaender and some others left the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee to form the or &#x27;Union for Male Culture&#x27;, which argued that male–male love is a demonstration of virile manliness similar to that of the classical Greek tradition. Under Hirschfeld&#x27;s leadership, the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee gathered 6000 signatures from prominent Germans on a petition to overturn Paragraph 175. Signatories included Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, Käthe Kollwitz, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, August Bebel, Max Brod, Karl Kautsky, Stefan Zweig, Gerhart Hauptmann, Martin Buber, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Eduard Bernstein, and even Emile Zola and Leo Tolstoy. The bill was brought before the in 1898, but was supported only by a minority from the Social Democratic Party of Germany. August Bebel, a friend of Hirschfeld from his university days, agreed to sponsor the attempt to repeal Paragraph 175.

Hirschfeld considered what would, in a later era, be described as &quot;outing&quot;: forcing out of the closet some of the prominent and secretly homosexual lawmakers who had remained silent on the bill. He arranged for the bill to be reintroduced and, in the 1920s, it made some progress until the takeover of the Nazi Party ended all hope for any such reform. As part of his efforts to counter popular prejudice, Hirschfeld spoke out about the taboo subject of suicide and was the first to present statistical evidence that homosexuals were more likely to commit suicide or attempt suicide than heterosexuals. Hirschfeld prepared questionnaires that gay men could answer anonymously about homosexuality and suicide. Collating his results, Hirschfeld estimated that 3 out of every 100 gays committed suicide every year, that a quarter of gays had attempted suicide at some point in their lives and that the other three-quarters had had suicidal thoughts at some point. He used his evidence to argue that, under current social conditions in Germany, life was literally unbearable for homosexuals.

A figure frequently mentioned by Hirschfeld to illustrate the &quot;hell experienced by homosexuals&quot; was Oscar Wilde, who was a well-known author in Germany, and whose trials in 1895 had been extensively covered by the German press. Hirschfeld visited Cambridge University in 1905 to meet Wilde&#x27;s son, Vyvyan Holland, who had changed his surname to avoid being associated with his father. Hirschfeld noted &quot;the name Wilde&quot; has, since his trial, sounded like &quot;an indecent word, which causes homosexuals to blush with shame, women to avert their eyes, and normal men to be outraged&quot;. During his visit to Britain, Hirschfeld was invited to a secret ceremony in the English countryside where a &quot;group of beautiful, young, male students&quot; from Cambridge gathered together wearing Wilde&#x27;s prison number, C33, as a way of symbolically linking his fate to theirs, to read out aloud Wilde&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;. Hirschfeld found the reading of &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; to be &quot;&quot; (shaken to the core of one&#x27;s being, i.e. something that is emotionally devastating), going on to write that the poem reading was &quot;the most earth-shattering outcry that has ever been voiced by a downtrodden soul about its own torture and that of humanity&quot;. By the end of the reading of &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, Hirshfeld felt &quot;quiet joy&quot; as he was convinced that, despite the way that Wilde&#x27;s life had been ruined, something good would eventually come of it.

====Feminism====
In 1905, Hirschfeld joined the (&#x27;League for the Protection of Mothers&#x27;), the feminist organization founded by Helene Stöcker. He campaigned for the decriminalisation of abortion, and against policies that banned female teachers and civil servants from marrying or having children. Both Hirschfeld and Stöcker believed that there was a close connection between the causes of gay rights and women&#x27;s rights, and Stöcker was much involved in the campaign to repeal Paragraph 175 while Hirschfeld campaigned for the repeal of Paragraph 218, which had banned abortion. From 1909 to 1912, Stöcker, Hirschfeld, Hedwig Dohm, and others successfully campaigned against an extension to Paragraph 175 which would have criminalised female homosexuality.

In 1906, Hirschfeld was asked as a doctor to examine a prisoner in Neumünster to see if he was suffering from &quot;severe nervous disturbances caused by a combination of malaria, blackwater fever, and congenital sexual anomaly&quot;. The man, a former soldier and a veteran of what Hirschfeld called the (&#x27;Herero revolt&#x27;) in German South West Africa (modern Namibia) appeared to be suffering from what would now be considered post-traumatic stress disorder, saying that he had done terrible things in Southwest Africa, and could no longer live with himself. In 1904, the Herero and Namaqua peoples who had been steadily pushed off their land to make way for German settlers, had revolted, causing Kaiser Wilhelm II to dispatch General Lothar von Trotha to wage a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; to exterminate the Herero and Namaqua in what has since become known as the Herero and Nama genocide. The genocide came to widespread attention when the SPD leader August Bebel criticized the government on the floor of the , saying the government did not have the right to exterminate the Herero just because they were Black. Hirschfeld did not mention his diagnosis of the prisoner, nor he did mention in detail the source of the prisoner&#x27;s guilt about his actions in Southwest Africa; the German scholar Heike Bauer criticized him for his seeming unwillingness to see the connection between the Herero genocide and the prisoner&#x27;s guilt, which had caused him to engage in a petty crime wave.

Hirschfeld&#x27;s position, that homosexuality was normal and natural, made him a highly controversial figure at the time, involving him in vigorous debates with other academics, who regarded homosexuality as unnatural and wrong. One of Hirschfeld&#x27;s leading critics was Austrian Baron Christian von Ehrenfels, who advocated radical changes to society and sexuality to combat the supposed &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, and saw Hirschfeld&#x27;s theories as a challenge to his view of sexuality. Ehrenfels argued that there were a few &quot;biologically degenerate&quot; homosexuals who lured otherwise &quot;healthy boys&quot; into their lifestyle, making homosexuality into both a choice and a wrong one at that time.

==== African anthropology ====
At the same time, Hirschfeld became involved in a debate with a number of anthropologists about the supposed existence of the (&#x27;Hottentot apron&#x27;), namely the belief that the Khoekoe (known to Westerners as Hottentots) women of southern Africa had abnormally enlarged labia, which made them inclined toward lesbianism. Hirschfeld argued there was no evidence that the Khoekoe women had abnormally large labia, whose supposed existence had fascinated so many Western anthropologists at the time, and that, other than being Black, the bodies of Khoekoe women were no different from German women. One Khoekoe woman, Sarah Baartman, the &quot;Hottentot Venus&quot;, did have relatively large buttocks and labia, compared to Northern European women, and had been exhibited at a freak show in Europe in the early 19th century, which was the origin of this belief about the Khoekhoe women. Hirschfeld wrote: &quot;The differences appear minimal compared to what is shared&quot; between Khoekoe and German women.

Turning the argument of the anthropologists on their head, Hirschfeld argued that, if same-sex relationships were common among Khoekoe women, and if the bodies of Khoekoe women were essentially the same as Western women, then Western women must have the same tendencies. Hirschfeld&#x27;s theories about a spectrum of sexuality existing in all of the world&#x27;s cultures implicitly undercut the binary theories about the differences between various races that was the basis of the claim of white supremacy. However, Bauer wrote that Hirschfeld&#x27;s theories about the universality of homosexuality paid little attention to cultural contexts, and criticized him for his remarks that Hausa women in Nigeria were well known for their lesbian tendencies and would have been executed for their sapphic acts before British rule, as assuming that imperialism was always good for the colonized.

===Eulenburg affair===
Hirschfeld played a prominent role in the Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1906–09, which became the most widely publicized sex scandal in Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907, when General Kuno von Moltke sued the journalist Maximilian Harden, after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg, who was the Kaiser&#x27;s best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. In his role as an expert witness, Hirschfeld testified that Moltke was gay and, thus, what Harden had written was true. Hirschfeld – who wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany – believed that proving Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization. He also testified that he believed there was nothing wrong with Moltke.

Most notably, Hirschfeld testified that &quot;homosexuality was part of the plan of nature and creation just like normal love.&quot; Hirschfeld&#x27;s testimony caused outrage all over Germany. The &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as &quot;a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience&quot;. The newspaper declared in an editorial: &quot;Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science, which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!&quot; A notable witness at the trial was Lilly von Elbe, former wife of Moltke, who testified that her husband had only had sex with her twice in their entire marriage. Elbe spoke with remarkable openness for the period of her sexual desires and her frustration with a husband who was only interested in having sex with Eulenburg. Elbe&#x27;s testimony was marked by moments of low comedy when it emerged that she had taken to attacking Moltke with a frying pan in vain attempts to make him have sex with her. The fact that General von Moltke was unable to defend himself from his wife&#x27;s attacks was taken as proof that he was deficient in his masculinity, which many saw as confirming his homosexuality. At the time, the subject of female sexuality was taboo, and Elbe&#x27;s testimony was controversial, with many saying that Elbe must be mentally ill because of her willingness to acknowledge her sexuality. Letters to the newspapers at the time, from both men and women, overwhelmingly condemned Elbe for her &quot;disgusting&quot; testimony concerning her sexuality. As an expert witness, Hirschfeld also testified that female sexuality was natural, and Elbe was just a normal woman who was in no way mentally ill. After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury&#x27;s decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld. He overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals &quot;have the morals of dogs&quot;, and insisted that this verdict could not be allowed to stand.

After the verdict was overturned, a second trial found Harden guilty of libel. At the second trial, Hirschfeld again testified as an expert witness, but this time, he was much less certain than he had been at the first trial about Moltke&#x27;s homosexuality. Hirschfeld testified that Moltke and Eulenburg had an &quot;intimate&quot; friendship that was homoerotic in nature but not sexual, as he had testified at the first trial. Hirschfeld also testified that, though he still believed female sexuality was normal, Elbe was suffering from hysteria caused by a lack of sex, and so the court should discount her stories about a sexual relationship between Moltke and Eulenburg. Hirschfeld had been threatened by the Prussian government with having his medical license revoked if he testified as an expert witness again along the same lines that he had at the first trial, and possibly prosecuted for violating Paragraph 175. The trial was a libel suit against Harden by Moltke, but much of the testimony had concerned Eulenburg, whose status as the best friend of Wilhelm II meant that the scandal threatened to involve the Kaiser. Moreover, far from precipitating increased tolerance as Hirschfeld had expected, the scandal led to a major homophobic and anti-Semitic backlash, and Hirschfeld&#x27;s biographer Elena Mancini speculated that Hirschfeld wanted to bring to an end an affair that was hindering rather helping the cause for gay rights.

Because Eulenburg was a prominent anti-Semite and Hirschfeld was a Jew, during the affair, the movement came out in support of Eulenburg, whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual, framed by false allegations of homosexuality by Hirschfeld and Harden. Various leaders, most notably the radical anti-Semitic journalist Theodor Fritsch, used the Eulenburg affair as a chance to &quot;settle the accounts&quot; with the Jews. As a gay Jew, Hirschfeld was relentlessly vilified by the newspapers. Outside Hirschfeld&#x27;s house in Berlin, posters were affixed by activists, which read &quot;Dr. Hirschfeld A Public Danger: The Jews are Our Undoing!&quot;. In Nazi Germany, the official interpretation of the Eulenburg affair was that Eulenburg was a straight Aryan whose career was destroyed by false claims of being gay by Jews like Hirschfeld. After the scandal had ended, Hirschfeld concluded that, far from helping the gay rights movement as he had hoped, the ensuing backlash set the movement back. The conclusion drawn by the German government was the opposite of the one that Hirschfeld wanted; the fact that prominent men like General von Moltke and Eulenburg were gay did not lead the government to repeal Paragraph 175 as Hirschfeld had hoped and, instead, the government decided that Paragraph 175 was being enforced with insufficient vigor, leading to a crackdown on homosexuals that was unprecedented and would not be exceeded until the Nazi era.

===World War I===
In 1914, Hirschfeld was swept up by the national enthusiasm of the Spirit of 1914, as the sense of national solidarity was known that at the outbreak of World War I rallied the majority of Germans to the defence of the Fatherland. Initially pro-war, Hirschfeld started to turn against the war in 1915, moving toward a pacifist position. In his 1915 pamphlet, (&#x27;Why do other nations hate us?&#x27;), Hirschfeld answered his own question by arguing that it was the greatness of Germany that excited envy from other nations, especially Great Britain, and so had supposedly caused them to come together to destroy the . Hirschfeld accused Britain of starting the war in 1914 &quot;out of envy at the development and size of the German Empire&quot;. was characterized by a chauvinist and ultra-nationalist tone, together with a crass Anglophobia that has often embarrassed Hirschfeld&#x27;s modern admirers such as Charlotte Wolff, who called the pamphlet a &quot;perversion of the values which Hirschfeld had always stood for&quot;.

As a Jewish homosexual, Hirschfeld was acutely aware that many Germans did not consider him to be a &quot;proper&quot; German, or even a German at all; so, he reasoned that taking an ultra-patriotic stance might break down prejudices by showing that German Jews or homosexuals could also be good, patriotic Germans, rallying to the cry of the Fatherland. By 1916, Hirschfeld was writing pacifist pamphlets, calling for an immediate end to the war. In his 1916 pamphlet (″&quot;The Psychology of War&quot;″), Hirschfeld was far more critical of the war than he had been in 1915, emphasizing the suffering and trauma caused by it. He also expressed the opinion that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the war because its horrors were &quot;superhuman in size&quot;. He declared that &quot;it is not enough that the war ends with peace; it must end with reconciliation&quot;. In late 1918, Hirschfeld together with his sister, Franziska Mann, co-wrote a pamphlet (″&quot;What every woman needs to know about the right to vote!&quot;″) hailing the November Revolution for granting German women the right to vote and announced the &quot;eyes of the world are now resting on German women&quot;.

===Interwar period===
In 1920, Hirschfeld was badly beaten by a group of activists who attacked him on the street; he was initially declared dead when the police arrived. In 1921, Hirschfeld organized the First Congress for Sexual Reform, which led to the formation of the World League for Sexual Reform. Congresses were held in Copenhagen (1928), London (1929), Vienna (1930), and Brno (1932).

Hirschfeld was both quoted and caricatured in the press as a vociferous expert on sexual matters; during his 1931 tour of the United States, the Hearst newspaper chain dubbed him &quot;the Einstein of Sex&quot;. He identified as a campaigner and a scientist, investigating and cataloging many varieties of sexuality, not just homosexuality. He developed a system which categorised 64 possible types of sexual intermediary, ranging from masculine, heterosexual male to feminine, homosexual male, including those he described under the term transvestite (), which he coined in 1910, and those he described under the term &quot;transsexuals&quot;, a term he coined in 1923. He also made a distinction between &quot;transsexualism&quot; and intersexuality.
At this time, Hirschfeld and the &quot;Institute for Sexual Sciences&quot; issued a number of transvestite passes to trans people in order to prevent them from being harassed by the police.
Hirschfeld co-wrote and acted in the 1919 film (″&quot;Different From the Others&quot;″), in which Conrad Veidt played one of the first homosexual characters ever written for cinema. The film had a specific gay rights law reform agenda; after Veidt&#x27;s character is blackmailed by a male prostitute, he eventually comes out rather than continuing to make the blackmail payments. His career is destroyed and he is driven to suicide. Hirschfeld played himself in , where the title cards have him say: &quot;The persecution of homosexuals belongs to the same sad chapter of history in which the persecutions of witches and heretics is inscribed... Only with the French Revolution did a complete change come about. Everywhere where the was introduced, the laws against homosexuals were repealed, for they were considered a violation of the rights of the individual... In Germany, however, despite more than fifty years of scientific research, legal discrimination against homosexuals continues unabated... May justice soon prevail over injustice in this area, science conquer superstition, love achieve victory over hatred!&quot;

In May 1919, when the film premiered in Berlin, the First World War was still a very fresh memory and German conservatives, who already hated Hirschfeld, seized upon his Francophile speech in the film praising France for legalizing homosexuality in 1792 as evidence that gay rights were &quot;un-German&quot;. At the end of the film, when the protagonist Paul Körner commits suicide, his lover Kurt is planning on killing himself, when Hirschfeld appears to tell him: &quot;If you want to honor the memory of your dead friend, you must not take your own life, but instead preserve it to change the prejudices whose victim – one of the countless many – this dead man was. That is the task of the living I assign you. Just as Zola struggled on behalf of a man who innocently languished in prison, what matters now is to restore honor and justice to the many thousands before us, with us, and after us. Through knowledge to justice!&quot; The reference to Émile Zola&#x27;s role in the Dreyfus affair was intended to draw a parallel between homophobia and anti-Semitism, while Hirschfeld&#x27;s repeated use of the word &quot;us&quot; was an implied admission of his own homosexuality. The anti-suicide message of reflected Hirschfeld&#x27;s interest in the subject of the high suicide rate among homosexuals, and was intended to give hope to gay audiences. The film ends with Hirschfeld opening a copy of the penal code of the and striking out Paragraph 175 with a giant X.

Under the more liberal atmosphere of the newly founded Weimar Republic, Hirschfeld purchased a villa not far from the building in Berlin for his new (&#x27;Institute of Sexual Research&#x27;), which opened on 6 July 1919. In Germany, the government made laws, but the governments enforced the laws, meaning it was up to the governments to enforce Paragraph 175. Until the November Revolution of 1918, Prussia had a three-class voting system that effectively disenfranchised most ordinary people, and allowed the to dominate Prussia. After the November Revolution, universal suffrage came to Prussia, which became a stronghold of the Social Democrats. The SPD believed in repealing Paragraph 175, and the Social Democratic Prussian government headed by Otto Braun ordered the Prussian police not to enforce Paragraph 175, making Prussia into a haven for homosexuals all over Germany. The Institute housed Hirschfeld&#x27;s immense archives and library on sexuality and provided educational services and medical consultations; the clinical staff included psychiatrists Felix Abraham and Arthur Kronfeld, gynecologist Ludwig Levy-Lenz, dermatologist and endocrinologist Bernard Schapiro, and dermatologist Friedrich Wertheim. The institute also housed the Museum of Sex, an educational resource for the public, which is reported to have been visited by school classes. Hirschfeld himself lived at the Institution on the second floor with his partner, Karl Giese, together with his sister Recha Tobias (1857–1942).

Giese and Hirschfeld were a well-known couple in the gay scene in Berlin where Hirschfeld was popularly known as . (&#x27;aunt&#x27;) was a German slang expression for a gay man but did not mean, as some claim, that Hirschfeld himself cross-dressed. People from around Europe and beyond came to the institute to gain a clearer understanding of their sexuality. Christopher Isherwood writes about his and W. H. Auden&#x27;s visit in his book &quot;Christopher and His Kind&quot;; they were calling on Francis Turville-Petre, a friend of Isherwood&#x27;s who was an active member of the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. Other celebrated visitors included German novelist and playwright Gerhart Hauptmann, German artist Christian Schad, French writers René Crevel and André Gide, Russian director Sergei Eisenstein, and American poet Elsa Gidlow.

In addition, a number of noted individuals lived for longer or shorter periods of time in the various rooms available for rent or as free accommodations in the Institute complex. Among the residents were Isherwood and Turville-Petre; literary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin; actress and dancer Anita Berber; Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch; Willi Münzenberg, a member of the German Parliament and a press officer for the Communist Party of Germany; Dora Richter, one of the first transgender patients to receive sex reassignment surgery at the institute, and Lili Elbe. Richter had been previously arrested for cross-dressing and discharged from the military. At the suggestion of a close friend, she later came to the institute for help. Hirschfeld had coined the term transvestite in 1910 to describe what today would be called transgender people, and the institution became a haven for transgender people, where Hirschfeld offered them shelter from abuse, performed surgeries, and gave otherwise unemployable transgender people jobs, albeit of a menial type, mostly as &quot;maids&quot;.

The Institute and Hirschfeld&#x27;s work are depicted in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s feature film (&quot;The Einstein of Sex&quot;, Germany, 1999; English subtitled version available). Although inspired by Hirschfeld&#x27;s life, the film is fictional. It contains invented characters and incidents and attributes motives and sentiments to Hirschfeld and others on the basis of little or no historical evidence. Hirschfeld biographer Ralf Dose notes, for instance, that &quot;the figure of &#x27;Dorchen&#x27; in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;The Einstein of Sex&quot; is complete fiction.&quot;

==World tour==
In March 1930, the Social Democratic chancellor Hermann Müller was overthrown by the intrigues of General Kurt von Schleicher. &quot;Presidential&quot; governments, responsible only to the President Paul von Hindenburg, pushed German politics in a more authoritarian direction. In 1929, the Müller government had come very close to repealing Paragraph 175, when the justice committee voted to repeal Paragraph 175. However, the Müller government fell before it could submit the repeal motion to the floor of the . Heinrich Brüning, a conservative Catholic on the right-wing of the party replaced Müller in March 1930, and was openly hostile toward gay rights and the fall of Müller ended the possibility of repealing Paragraph 175. Under the rule of Brüning as Chancellor and that of his successor, Franz von Papen, the state became increasingly hostile toward gay rights campaigners such as Hirschfeld, who began to spend more time abroad. Quite apart from the increased homophobia, Hirschfeld also became involved in a bitter debate within the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, as the repeal bill championed by Müller also made homosexual prostitution illegal, which badly divided the committee. Hirschfeld had always argued that &quot;what is natural cannot be immoral&quot; and, since homosexuality was in his view natural, it should be legal. Connecting the question of the legality of homosexuality to the legality of prostitution was a blurring of the issue, since these were different matters.

=== America and a &quot;straight turn&quot; ===
In 1930, Hirschfeld predicted that there would be no future for people like himself in Germany, and he would have to move abroad. In November 1930, Hirschfeld arrived in New York City, ostensibly on a speaking tour about sex, but in fact to see if it was possible for him to settle in the United States. Significantly, in his speeches on this American tour, Hirschfeld, when speaking in German, called for the legalization of homosexuality, but when speaking in English did not mention the subject of homosexuality, instead urging Americans to be more open-minded about heterosexual sex. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Hirschfeld as having come to America to &quot;study the marriage question&quot;, while the German-language newspaper described Hirschfeld as wanting to &quot;discuss love&#x27;s natural turns&quot; – the phrase &quot;love&#x27;s natural turns&quot; was Hirschfeld&#x27;s way of presenting his theory that there was a wide spectrum of human sexuality, all of which were &quot;natural&quot;. Hirschfeld realized that most Americans did not want to hear about his theory of homosexuality as natural. Aware of a strong xenophobic tendency in the United States, where foreigners seen as troublemakers were unwelcome, Hirschfeld tailored his message to American tastes.

In an interview with the Germanophile American journalist George Sylvester Viereck for the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; in late November 1930 that epitomised his &quot;straight turn&quot; in America, Hirschfeld was presented as a sex expert whose knowledge could improve the sex lives of married American couples. The &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; was part of the newspaper chain owned by William Randolph Hearst, which initially promoted Hirschfeld in America, reflecting the old adage that &quot;sex sells&quot;. In the interview with Viereck, Hirschfeld was presented as the wise &quot;European expert on romantic love&quot; who had come to teach heterosexual American men how to enjoy sex, claiming there was a close connection between sexual and emotional intimacy. Clearly intending to flatter the egos of a heterosexual American male audience, Hirschfeld praised the drive and ambition of American men, who were so successful at business, but stated that American men needed to divert some of their energy to their sex lives. Hirschfeld added, he had seen signs that American men were now starting to develop their &quot;romantic sides&quot; as European men had long since done, and he had come to the United States to teach American men how to love their women properly. When Viereck objected that the U.S. was in the middle of the Great Depression, Hirschfeld replied he was certain that United States would soon recover, thanks to the relentless drive of American men.
At least part of the reason for his &quot;straight turn&quot; was financial; a Dutch firm had been marketing Titus Pearls () pills, which were presented in Europe as a cure for &quot;scattered nerves&quot; and in the United States as an aphrodisiac, and had been using Hirschfeld&#x27;s endorsement to help with advertising campaign there. Most Americans knew of Hirschfeld only as a &quot;world-known authority on sex&quot; who had endorsed the Titus Pearls pills, which were alleged to improve orgasms for both men and women. Since Hirschfeld&#x27;s books never sold well, the money he was paid for endorsing the Titus Pearls pills were a major source of income for him, which he was to lose in 1933 when the manufacturer of the pills ceased using his endorsement in order to stay in the German market. In a second interview with Viereck in February 1931, Hirschfeld was presented by him as the &quot;Einstein of Sex&quot;, which was again part of the marketing effort of Hirschfeld&#x27;s &quot;straight turn&quot; in America. At times, Hirschfeld returned to his European message, when he planned to deliver a talk at the bohemian Dill Pickle Club in Chicago on &quot;homosexuality with beautiful revealing pictures&quot;, which was banned by the city as indecent. In San Francisco, Hirschfeld visited San Quentin prison to meet Thomas Mooney, whose belief in his innocence he proclaimed to the press afterward, and asked for his release. Unfortunately for Hirschfeld, the Hearst newspapers, which specialized in taking a sensationalist, right-wing, populist line on the news, dug up his statements in Germany calling for gay rights, causing a sudden shift in tone from more or less friendly to hostile, effectively ending any chance of Hirschfeld being allowed to stay in the United States.

=== Asia ===
After his American tour, Hirschfeld went to Asia in February 1931. Hirschfeld had been invited to Japan by Keizō Dohi, a German-educated Japanese doctor who spoke fluent German and who worked at Hirschfeld&#x27;s institute for a time in the 1920s. In Japan, Hirchfeld again tailored his speeches to local tastes, saying nothing about gay rights, and merely argued that a greater frankness about sexual matters would prevent venereal diseases. Hirschfeld sought out an old friend, S. Iwaya, a Japanese doctor who lived in Berlin in 1900–02 and who joined the Scientific-Humanitarian committee during his time there. Iwaya took Hirschfeld to the to introduce him to the Kabuki theater. Hirschfeld become interested in the Kabuki theater, where the female characters are played by men. One of the Kabuki actors, speaking to Hirschfeld via Iwaya, who served as the translator, was most insistent about asking him if he really looked like a woman on stage and was he effeminate enough as an actor. Hirschfeld noted that no one in Japan looked down on Kabuki actors who played female characters; on the contrary, they were popular figures with the public. Hirschfeld also met a number of Japanese feminists, such as Shidzue Katō and Ichikawa Fusae, whom he praised for their efforts to give Japanese women the right to vote. This greatly annoyed the Japanese government, which did not appreciate a foreigner criticizing the denial of female suffrage. Shortly before leaving Tokyo for China, Hirschfeld expressed the hope that his host and translator, Wilhelm Grundert, the director of the German–Japanese Cultural Institute, be made a professor at a German university. Grundert joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and, in 1936, was made a professor of Japanese studies at the University of Hamburg and, in 1938, become the chancellor of Hamburg university, all the while denouncing his former friend Hirschfeld as a &quot;pervert&quot;. In Shanghai, Hirschfeld began a relationship with a 23-year-old Chinese man studying sexology, Li Shiu Tong (also known by his nickname Tao Li), who remained his partner for the rest of his life. Hirschfeld promised Tao that he would introduce him to German culture, saying he wanted to take him to a &quot;Bavarian beer hall&quot; to show him how German men drank. Tao&#x27;s parents, who knew about their son&#x27;s sexual orientation and accepted his relationship with Hirschfeld, threw a farewell party when the two left China, with Tao&#x27;s father expressing the hope that his son would become the &quot;Hirschfeld of China&quot;.

After staying in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), where Hirschfeld caused an uproar by speech comparing Dutch imperialism to slavery, Hirschfeld arrived in India in September 1931. In Allahabad, Hirschfeld met Jawaharlal Nehru and gave speeches supporting the Indian independence movement, stating &quot;it is one of the biggest injustices in the world that one of the oldest civilized nations... cannot rule independently&quot;. However, Hirschfeld&#x27;s Indian speeches were mainly concerned with attacking the 1927 book &quot;Mother India&quot; by the white supremacist American author Katherine Mayo, where she painted an unflattering picture of sexuality in India as brutal and perverted, as &quot;England-friendly propaganda&quot;. As Mayo&#x27;s book had caused much controversy in India, Hirschfeld&#x27;s speeches defending Indians against her accusations were well received. Hirschfeld, who was fluent in English, made a point of quoting from the articles written by W. T. Stead in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; in 1885, exposing rampant child prostitution in London as proving that sexuality in Britain could also be brutal and perverted: a matter which, he noted, did not interest Mayo in the slightest. Hirschfeld was very interested in the subject of Indian sexuality or, as he called it, &quot;the Indian art of love&quot;. Hirschfeld&#x27;s main guide to India was Girindrasekhar Bose and, in general, Hirschfeld&#x27;s contacts were limited to the English-speaking Indian elite, as he did not speak Hindi or any other Indian languages. While staying in Patna, Hirschfeld drew up a will naming Tao as his main beneficiary and asking Tao, if he should die, to take his ashes to be buried at the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin.

=== Africa and the Middle East ===
In Egypt, where Hirschfeld and Tao traveled to next, arriving in November 1931, Hirschfeld wrote &quot;to the Arabs... homoerotic love practice is something natural and that Mohammad could not change this attitude&quot;. In Cairo, Hirschfeld and Tao met the Egyptian feminist leader Huda Sha&#x27;arawi-who stopped wearing the Muslim veil in 1923 and popularized going unveiled which, for Hirschfeld, illustrated how gender roles could change. In a rebuke to Western notions of superiority, Hirschfeld wrote &quot;the average ethical and intellectual levels of the Egyptians was equal to that of the European nations&quot;. Hirschfeld&#x27;s visit to the Palestine Mandate (present-day Palestine and Israel) marked one of the few times when he publicly referred to his Jewishness saying, as a Jew, it was greatly moving to visit Jerusalem. Hirschfeld was not a religious Jew, stating that (&#x27;fear of God&#x27;, i.e. religious belief) was irrational, but that he did feel a certain sentimental attachment to Palestine. In general, Hirschfeld was supportive of Zionism, but expressed concern about what he regarded as certain chauvinist tendencies in the Zionist movement and he deplored the adoption of Hebrew as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; saying, if only the Jews of Palestine spoke German rather than Hebrew, he would have stayed. In March 1932, Hirschfeld arrived in Athens, where he told journalists that, regardless of whether Hindenburg or Hitler won the presidential election that month, he probably would not return to Germany, as both men were equally homophobic.

==Later life and exile==
On 20 July 1932, the Chancellor Franz von Papen carried out a coup that deposed the Braun government in Prussia, and appointed himself the commissioner for the state. A conservative Catholic who had long been a vocal critic of homosexuality, Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down in general on &quot;sexual immorality&quot; in Prussia. The Institut für Sexualwissenschaft remained open, but under Papen&#x27;s rule, the police began to harass people associated with it. On 30 January 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as chancellor. Less than four months after the Nazis took power, Hirschfeld&#x27;s Institute was sacked. On the morning of 6 May, a group of university students belonging to the National Socialist German Students&#x27; League stormed the institution, shouting &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Burn Hirschfeld!&#x27;) and began to beat up its staff and smash up the premises. In the afternoon, the SA came to the institute, carrying out a more systematic attack, removing all volumes from the library and storing them for a book-burning event which was to be held four days later. In the evening, the Berlin Police arrived at the institution and announced that it was closed forever. His citizenship was later revoked by the Nazi government.

By the time of the book burning, Hirschfeld had long since left Germany for a speaking tour that took him around the world; he never returned to Germany. In March 1932, he stopped briefly in Athens, spent several weeks in Vienna and then settled in Zurich, Switzerland, in August 1932. While he was there, he worked on a book that recounted his experiences and observations while he was on his world tour and it was published in 1933 as (Brugg, Switzerland: Bözberg-Verlag, 1933). It was published in an English translation in the United States under the title &quot;Men and Women: The World Journey of a Sexologist&quot; (New York City: G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, 1935) and in England under the title &quot;Women East and West: Impressions of a Sex Expert&quot; (London: William Heinemann Medical Books, 1935). Hirschfeld stayed near Germany, hoping that he would be able to return to Berlin if the country&#x27;s political situation improved. With the Nazi regime&#x27;s unequivocal rise to power coinciding with the completion of his work on his tour book, he decided to go into exile in France. On his 65th birthday, 14 May 1933, Hirschfeld arrived in Paris, where he lived in a luxury apartment building on 24 Avenue Charles Floquet, facing the Champ de Mars. Hirschfeld lived with Li and Giese. In 1934, Giese was involved in a dispute at a public bathhouse that Hirschfeld called &quot;trifling&quot;, but it led French authorities to expel him. Giese&#x27;s fate left Hirschfeld very depressed. A year-and-a-half after arriving in France, in November 1934, Hirschfeld moved south to Nice, a seaside resort on the Mediterranean coast. He lived in a luxurious apartment building with a view of the sea across an enormous garden on the Promenade des Anglais. Throughout his stay in France, he continued researching, writing, campaigning and working to establish a French successor to his lost institute in Berlin. Hirschfeld&#x27;s sister, Recha Tobias, did not leave Germany and died in the Theresienstadt Ghetto on 28 September 1942 (the cause of death entered in her death certificate was &quot;heart weakness&quot;).

While in France, Hirschfeld finished a book that he had been writing during his world tour, (&quot;Racism&quot;). It was published posthumously in English in 1938. Hirschfeld wrote that the purpose of the book was to explore &quot;the racial theory which underlines the doctrine of racial war&quot;, saying that he himself was &quot;numbered among the many thousands who have fallen victim to the practical realization of this theory.&quot; Unlike many who saw the ideology of the Nazi regime as an aberration and a retrogression from modernity, Hirschfeld insisted that it had deep roots, going back to the German Enlightenment in the 18th century, and it was a part of modernity rather than an aberration from it. He added that, in the 19th century, an ideology that divided all of humanity into biologically different races – white, black, yellow, brown, and red – as devised by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach – served as a way of turning prejudices into a &quot;universal truth&quot;, apparently validated by science. In turn, Hirschfeld held the view that this pseudoscientific way of dividing humanity was the basis of Western thinking about modernity, with whites being praised as the &quot;civilized&quot; race in contrast to the other races, which were dismissed for their &quot;barbarism&quot;; such thinking was used to justify white supremacy. In this way, he argued that the racism of the National Socialist regime was only an extreme variant of prejudices that were held throughout the Western world, and the differences between Nazi ideology and the racism that was practiced in other nations were differences in degree rather than differences in kind. Hirschfeld argued against this way of seeing the world, writing &quot;if it were practical, we should certainly do well to eradicate the use of the word &#x27;race&#x27; as far as subdivisions of the human species are concerned; or if we do use it in this way, to put it into quote marks to show it is questionable&quot;.

The last of Hirschfeld&#x27;s books to be published during his lifetime, [The Human Spirit and Love: Sexological Psychology] (Paris: Gallimard, 1935), was published in French in late April 1935; it was his only book that was never published in a German-language edition. In the book&#x27;s preface, he described his hopes for his new life in France:
In search of sanctuary, I have found my way to that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul. I shall be glad and grateful if I can spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more grateful to be enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.

==Death==
On his 67th birthday, 14 May 1935, Hirschfeld died of a heart attack in his apartment at the Gloria Mansions I building at 63 Promenade des Anglais in Nice. His body was cremated, and the ashes interred in a simple tomb in the Caucade Cemetery in Nice. The upright headstone in gray granite is inset with a bronze bas-relief portrait of Hirschfeld in profile by German sculptor and decorative artist Arnold Zadikow (1884–1943), who like Hirschfeld was a native of the town of Kolberg. The slab covering the tomb is engraved with Hirschfeld&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;&quot; (&quot;through science to justice&quot;).
On 14 May 2010, to mark the 75th anniversary of Hirschfeld&#x27;s death, a French national organization, the (MDH), in partnership with the new LGBT Community Center of Nice (), organized a formal delegation to the cemetery. Speakers recalled Hirschfeld&#x27;s life and work and laid a large bouquet of pink flowers on his tomb; the ribbon on the bouquet was inscribed &quot;&quot; (&#x27;To the pioneer of our causes. The MDH and the LGBT Center&#x27;).

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Shtetl&quot;, Hirschfeld&#x27;s &quot;radical ideas changed the way Germans thought about sexuality.&quot; American Henry Gerber, attached to the Allied Army of Occupation following World War I, became impressed by Hirschfeld and absorbed many of the doctor&#x27;s ideas. Upon his return to the United States, Gerber was inspired to form the short-lived Chicago-based Society for Human Rights in 1924, the first known gay rights organization in the nation. In turn, a partner of one of the former members of the Society communicated the existence of the society to Los Angeles resident Harry Hay in 1929; Hay would go on to help establish the Mattachine Society in 1950, the first national homosexual rights organization to operate for many years in the United States. In 1979, the National LGBT Federation established the Hirschfeld Centre, Ireland&#x27;s second gay and lesbian community centre. Although badly damaged by a 1987 fire, the centre continued to house the &quot;Gay Community News&quot; magazine until 1997.

In 1982, a group of German researchers and activists founded the Magnus Hirschfeld Society in West Berlin, in anticipation of the approaching 50th anniversary of the destruction of Hirschfeld&#x27;s Institute for Sexual Science. Ten years later, the society established a Berlin-based center for research on the history of sexology. Since the late 20th century, researchers associated with the Magnus Hirschfeld Society have succeeded in tracking down previously dispersed and lost records and artifacts of Hirschfeld&#x27;s life and work. They have brought together many of these materials at the society&#x27;s archives in Berlin. At an exhibition at the in Berlin from 7 December 2011 to 31 March 2012, the society publicly displayed a selection of these collections for the first time.

The German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research established the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 1990. The Society awards the Medal in two categories, contributions to sexual research and contributions to sexual reform. The Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation, established in Germany in 2007, is named for Hirschfeld and lesbian activist FannyAnn Eddy. In May 2008, the promenade between Moltke Bridge and the Chancellor&#x27;s Garden got renamed Magnus-Hirschfeld-Ufer. On this promenade, there is a Memorial plaque with a description in English. In August 2011, after 30 years of advocacy by the Magnus Hirschfeld Society and other associations and individuals, the Federal Cabinet of Germany granted 10 million euros to establish the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation (), a foundation to support research and education about the life and work of Magnus Hirschfeld, the Nazi persecution of homosexuals, German LGBT culture and community, and ways to counteract prejudice against LGBT people; the Federal Ministry of Justice was expected to contribute an additional 5 million euros, bringing the initial endowment of the foundation to a total of 15 million euros.

==Portrayals in popular culture==
Hirschfeld has been portrayed in a number of works of popular culture both during his lifetime and subsequently. Following is a sampling of genres and titles:

===Podcasts===
Season 4 episode 2 of the podcast &quot;Making Gay History&quot; is about Hirschfeld, as is a Special Episode in Season 5 of the &quot;Bad Gays Podcast&quot;.

===Caricature===
Hirschfeld was a frequent target of caricatures in the popular press during his lifetime. Historian James Steakley reproduces several examples in his German-language book (Hamburg: MännerschwarmSkript, 2004). Additional examples appear in the French-language book (Paris: E. Bernard, [1908]) by .

===Film and television===
* &quot;Different from the Others&quot; (Germany, 1919); directed by Richard Oswald; cowritten by Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld appears in a cameo playing himself. Karl Giese, the young man who subsequently became Hirschfeld&#x27;s lover, also had a part in the film.

A feature-length documentary tracing the emergence of the homosexual subculture and the homosexual emancipation movement in pre-World War II Germanyand their destruction by the Nazi regime. According to film historian Robin Wood, Marshall &quot;treats the burning of Hirschfeld&#x27;s library and the closing of his Institute of Sexual Science as the film&#x27;s... central moment...&quot;
* A segment on Hirschfeld appears in episode 19 of &quot;Real Sex,&quot; first shown on HBO on 7 February 1998.
* &quot;The Einstein of Sex&quot; (Germany, 1999); directed by Rosa von Praunheim. A fictional biopic inspired by Hirschfeld&#x27;s life and work.

The first part of the film provides a brief overview of the history of the homosexual emancipation movement in Germany from the late 19th century through the early 1930s, with Hirschfeld and his work prominently featured.
* Several episodes of the second season of the Amazon television series &quot;Transparent&quot; (U.S., 2014–2019) include a portrayal of Hirschfeld and his institute. Hirschfeld was portrayed by Bradley Whitford.

===Fiction===
* Robert Hichens (1939). &quot;That Which Is Hidden&quot; (London: Cassell &amp; Company). U.S. Edition: New York: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, 1940.

At the tomb, he meets the late doctor&#x27;s protégé, a Chinese student named Kho Ling. The character of Ling refers to the memory of his mentor at numerous points in the novel. From the description of the settings and the characters, Ellendorf clearly was inspired by Hirschfeld, and Ling by Hirschfeld&#x27;s last partner and heir, Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li).
* Arno Schmidt (1970). (Frankfurt-am-Main: S. Fischer Verlag). Hirschfeld is quoted often in this novel about sexuality.
* Nicolas Verdan (2011). (Orbe, Switzerland: Bernard Campiche). A French-language spy thriller inspired by the sacking of Hirschfeld&#x27;s Institute for Sexual Science by the Nazis.

<text>John Conington (10 August 1825 – 23 October 1869) was an English classical scholar. In 1866 he published his best-known work, the translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil into the octosyllabic metre of Walter Scott. He was Corpus Professor of Latin at the University of Oxford from 1854 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Conington was born on 10 August 1825 in Boston, Lincolnshire, England, to the Revd Richard Conington and Jane ( Thirkhill). He is said to have learned the alphabet at fourteen months, and to have been reading well at three and a half. He was educated at Beverley Grammar School, an all-boys grammar school in Beverley, Yorkshire, and at Rugby School, an all-boys independent boarding school in Rugby, Warwickshire.

On 30 June 1843, Conington matriculated at University College, Oxford, to study &quot;literae humaniores&quot;. However, he was soon awarded a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and so moved college. He won the Ireland and Hertford scholarships in 1844. He was active in the Oxford Union, becoming secretary in 1845, president in 1846, and librarian in 1847. In December 1846, he graduated with a first class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He decided against taking Holy Orders, as was thus restricted to applying lay fellowships. Having been awarded a scholarship at University College in March 1846, he continued his studies after taking his degree and was awarded multiple Chancellor&#x27;s prizes for his work: for Latin verse (1847), for an English essay (1848), and for a Latin essay (1849).

==Career==
In February 1848, Conington elected a fellow of University College, Oxford. He also obtained the Chancellor&#x27;s prizes for Latin verse (1847), English essay (1848) and Latin essay (1849). He successfully applied for the Eldon Law Scholarship in 1849, and went to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn; but after six months he resigned the scholarship and returned to Oxford.

During his brief residence in London he began writing for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, and continued to do so after leaving. He showed no special aptitude for journalism, but a series of articles on university reform (1849–1850) was the first public expression of his views on a subject that always interested him.

In 1852, Conington was an unsuccessful candidate for the Professorship of Greek at the University of Edinburgh. In 1854, he was elected the first Corpus Christi Professor of Latin, based Corpus Christi College, Oxford. From this time he confined himself with characteristic conscientiousness almost exclusively to Latin literature. The only important exception was the translation of the last twelve books of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in the Spenserian stanza in completion of the work of P.S. Worsley, and this was undertaken in fulfilment of a promise made to his dying friend.

===Works===
Conington&#x27;s edition of Persius, with commentary and a prose translation was published posthumously in 1872. In the same year appeared his &quot;Miscellaneous Writings&quot;, edited by John Addington Symonds, with a memoir by Henry John Stephen Smith (see also Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro in &quot;Journal of Philology&quot;, ii., 1869).

In 1852 Conington began, in conjunction with Goldwin Smith, a complete edition of Virgil with a commentary, of which the first volume appeared in 1858, the second in 1864, and the third soon after his death. Goldwin Smith was compelled to withdraw from the work at an early stage, and in the last volume his place was taken by Henry Nettleship.

Conington&#x27;s other editions are:

*Aeschylus, &quot;Agamemmon&quot; (1848), &quot;Choëphori&quot; (1857); 
* English verse translations of Horace, &quot;Odes&quot; and &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot; (1863), &quot;Satires&quot;, &quot;Epistles&quot; and &quot;Ars Poëtica&quot; (1869).

==Views==

Known to be sympathetic to Radical political causes such as Chartism, Conington also loved intense scholarly conversation, often inviting favoured undergraduates to accompany him on his regular 2pm walks. One such was the future Idealist philosopher, T. H. Green. J. A. Symonds was another student friend of Conington&#x27;s and he and Green accompanied Conington on several of his summer reading parties during the Long Vacation. Henry Nettleship described the selection procedure:
In 1854, he had a personal and spiritual crisis. He began to attend chapel assiduously, only read religious books on Sundays, and to espouse conservative political views. He also became a follower of Edward Bouverie Pusey, one of the leaders of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement.

==Personal life==
Conington never married nor had any children.

On 23 October 1869, Conington died in Boston, Lincolnshire, following an illness caused by &quot;a malignant pustule on the lip&quot;. He was aged 44. He was buried at Fishtoft, Lincolnshire.

The Conington Prize, an award for the best dissertation by an undergraduate in the Faculty of Classics, University of Oxford, was named in his honour.

<text>Philip Stanhope Worsley (12 August 1835 – 8 May 1866) was an English poet.

==Life==
The son of the Rev. Charles Worsley, he was educated at Highgate School, where he made a lasting impression on Gerard Manley Hopkins, a fellow pupil in his boarding house, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate prize in 1857 with a poem on &quot;The Temple of Janus&quot;. In 1861 he published a translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, followed in 1865 by a translation of the first twelve books of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, in both of which he employed the Spenserian stanza with success.

In 1863, he published a volume of &quot;Poems and Translations&quot;. 

==Death==
He died at 30 of tuberculosis.

His unfinished translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; was completed after his death by John Conington.

<doc id="234286" wikidata="Q2469069" url="?curid=234286" title="USS Coronado (AGF-11)">
<text>USS &quot;Coronado&quot; (AGF-11) (originally LPD-11) was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after Coronado, California. She was designed as an (LPD), one of seven fitted with an additional superstructure level for command ship duties. The ship was launched on 1 July 1966, commissioned on 23 May 1970, and became the most advanced command ship in the world. The ship was the second combatant ship in the United States Navy to integrate women as full-time crew members.

&quot;Coronado&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 2006, was used for target practice during Valiant Shield 2012 exercises, and was sunk in the Marianas Island Range Complex on 12 September 2012.

==History==
The &quot;Coronado&quot;″s keel was laid down on 1 May 1965 by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 1 July 1966. After two years of labor shortages and a 12-month strike, she was commissioned 23 May 1970.

First assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in the 1970s, &quot;Coronado&quot; conducted extensive operations, deploying on numerous occasions to the Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea, as well as northern Europe.

In 1980, the &quot;Coronado&quot; was re-designated an Auxiliary Command Ship (AGF-11). Her first assignment was to relieve the as command ship for Commander, U.S. Middle East Force, stationed in the Persian Gulf.

Reassigned in October 1985, the &quot;Coronado&quot; relieved as the command ship of Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet. During a ten-month tour with the Sixth Fleet, &quot;Coronado&quot; operated out of Gaeta, Italy, participating in operations in the Gulf of Sidra and strikes against Libyan terrorist support facilities.

In July 1986, the &quot;Coronado&quot; was relieved as Sixth Fleet command ship and ordered to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to become the command ship for Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet. The admiral and his staff embarked on board &quot;Coronado&quot; in November 1986. Subsequently, &quot;Coronado&quot; was relieved as Third Fleet command ship and deployed to the Persian Gulf to assume duties as command ship for Commander, U.S. Middle East Force in January 1988. During this period she served as flagship for Operation Praying Mantis, the largest American naval action since World War II.

Upon her return to Pearl Harbor on 9 November 1988, &quot;Coronado&quot; again assumed her duties as Commander, U.S. Third Fleet command ship. USS &quot;Coronado&quot; remained homeported in Hawaii until August 1991, when crew and staff changed homeports to San Diego.

On 28 February 1994, &quot;Coronado&quot; became the first combatant ship in the United States Navy to embark women as part of its regular, full-time crew. Since then, Third Fleet and &quot;Coronado&quot; had become the center for naval innovation and technology experimentation. In November 1998 a large ship modification was completed. Incorporating the latest network-centric technology, &quot;Coronado&quot; became the most advanced command ship in the world.
===Sea-Based Battle Lab===
In October 2001, the Office of the Secretary of the Navy assigned &quot;Coronado&quot; to host the Navy&#x27;s Sea-Based Battle Lab (SBBL), an afloat platform for testing prototype systems and software, evaluating future naval capabilities, and assessing operational compatibility and possible further implementation throughout the United States Navy.

Developments in technology spawned significant advances in naval warfare capabilities. Wireless and web-based tools, along with new weapon systems, enabled naval forces to conduct precision operations with greater synchronization, expedience, and potency. With over of reconfigurable command space and one of the world&#x27;s most advanced naval C4I suites, SBBL offered a unique shipboard environment that facilitates the evaluation of research for maritime and joint operations.

The Third Fleet J9 Directorate was responsible for managing the SBBL. Partnered with other services, national laboratories, academia, and industry, the Third Fleet staff developed joint exercises and experiments for evaluating the following in an operational environment:
* JTF Command Center organization and configuration
* Tactics, techniques, and procedures
* Naval and joint doctrine
* Biometrics (human feature recognition)
* Wireless applications
* Knowledge management
* Web-based applications
* Logistics
* Humanitarian assistance/disaster relief

=== Decommissioning and disposal ===
Late 2003 saw a see-saw change for the &quot;Coronado&quot;. In November the ship was decommissioned, transferred to the Military Sealift Command and redesignated T-AGF-11. However, it was concluded shortly thereafter that the operations the ship engaged in required it to be a warship and thus the vessel was transferred back to the Navy and recommissioned, but kept a large civilian complement within the crew from the MSC. In 2004, the 7th Fleet command ship, , went into dry dock and &quot;Coronado&quot; temporarily assumed 7th Fleet command responsibilities. On 27 September 2004, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; returned to duty as the command ship.

&quot;Coronado&quot; was decommissioned at the end of Fiscal Year 2006.

On 12 September 2012, the &quot;Coronado&quot; was sunk by a number of warships, and now serves as an artificial reef for the Marianas region. The ship now rests deep at coordinates .

<doc id="234288" wikidata="Q810037" url="?curid=234288" title="Basil L. Gildersleeve">
<text>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve (October 23, 1831January 9, 1924) was an American classical scholar. An author of numerous works, and founding editor of the &quot;American Journal of Philology&quot;, he has been credited with contributions to the syntax of Greek and Latin, and the history of Greek literature.

==Early life and education==

Gildersleeve was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Emma Louisa Lanneau, daughter of Bazille Lanneau and Hannah Vinyard, and Benjamin Gildersleeve (1791–1875). His father was a Presbyterian evangelist, and editor of the Charleston &quot;Christian Observer&quot; from 1826 to 1845, of the Richmond, Virginia &quot;Watchman and Observer&quot; from 1845 to 1856, and of &quot;The Central Presbyterian&quot; from 1856 to 1860. 

His maternal grandfather was Bazile Lanneau (born Basile Lanoue), one of the many French Acadians who were forcibly expelled by the British from present day Nova Scotia during the French and Indian War. His maternal grandmother was Hannah Vinyard. 

Gildersleeve graduated from Princeton University in 1849 at the age of eighteen, and went on to study under Johannes Franz in Berlin, under Friedrich Ritschl at Bonn and under Friedrich Wilhelm Schneidewin at Göttingen, where he received his PhD in 1853.

==Career==
Upon returning to the United States, he was offered a position as a Classics professor at Princeton University, but he turned it down. From 1856 to 1876, he was professor of Greek at the University of Virginia, holding the chair of Latin also from 1861 to 1866. He married Eliza Fisher Colston on September 18, 1866 in Middlebury, Virginia. After service for the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War, during which Gildersleeve was shot in the leg, he returned to the University of Virginia. 

===Johns Hopkins University===
Ten years later, he accepted an offer from Daniel Coit Gilman to teach at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. When the Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, Gildersleeve was one of five original full professors and was responsible for setting up a program in the study of Greek and Roman literature, at which he succeeded admirably. He chose junior faculty and graduate students who went on to make a major impact in classical studies, at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere. His hiring also helped to reassure the Baltimore community that the new university was not just a northern institution transplanted south. Johns Hopkins was known to be opposed to slavery, founding president Daniel Coit Gilman was from Connecticut, and most other faculty were from the northern states, which led to suspicion regarding the intent of the new institution.

In 1880, the &quot;American Journal of Philology&quot;, a quarterly published by the Johns Hopkins University, was established under his editorial charge, and his strong personality was expressed in the department of the &quot;Journal&quot; headed &quot;Brief Report&quot; or &quot;Lanx Satura,&quot; and in the earliest years of its publication every tiny detail was in his hands. His style in it, as elsewhere, is in striking contrast to that of the typical classical scholar, and accords with his conviction that the true aim of scholarship is &quot;that which is.&quot; He published a &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; (1867; revised with the cooperation of Gonzalez B. Lodge, 1895 and 1899; reprinted 1997 with a bibliography of twentieth-century work on the subject) and a &quot;Latin Series&quot; for use in secondary schools (1875), both marked by lucidity of order and mastery of grammatical theory and methods. His edition of Persius (1875) has been attributed great value.

Gildersleeve&#x27;s bent was toward Greek more than Latin. His special interest in Christian Greek was partly the cause of his editing the &quot;Apologies&quot; of Justin Martyr (1877), which claimed to have &quot;used unblushingly as a repository for [his] syntactical formulae.&quot; Gildersleeve&#x27;s studies under Franz had no doubt quickened his interest in Greek syntax, and his logic, untrammeled by previous categories, and his marvelous sympathy with the language were displayed in this most unlikely of places. His &quot;Syntax of Classic Greek&quot; (Part I, 1900, with CWE Miller) collects these formulae. Gildersleeve edited in 1885 &quot;The Olympian and Pythian Odes of Pindar&quot;, with what was called &quot;a brilliant and valuable introduction.&quot; His views on the function of grammar were summarized in a paper on &quot;The Spiritual Rights of Minute Research&quot; delivered at Bryn Mawr on June 16, 1895. His collected contributions to literary periodicals appeared in 1890 under the title &quot;Essays and Studies Educational and Literary&quot;.

&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; published an article by Gildersleeve titled &quot;The Creed of the Old South&quot; in January 1892, and an essay, &quot;A Southerner in the Peloponnesian War&quot;, in September 1897. Johns Hopkins Press later published them in a book in 1915.

He was elected president of the American Philological Association in 1877 and again in 1908 and became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as of various learned societies. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896 and the American Philosophical Society in 1903. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from William and Mary (1869), Harvard (1896), Yale (1901), Chicago (1901), and Pennsylvania (1911); D.C.L. from the University of the South (1884); L.H.D. from Yale (1891) and Princeton (1899); and Litt.D. from Oxford and Cambridge (1905).

==Death and legacy==
Gildersleeve retired from teaching in 1915. He died on January 9, 1924, and was buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. In a memorial published in the &quot;American Journal of Philology&quot;, Professor C. W. E. Miller paid tribute to Gildersleeve, stating, &quot;Of Greek authors, there were few with whom he did not have more than a bowing acquaintance.&quot;

In more recent years, Gildersleeve has received critical attention for his unapologetic defense of slavery, during and after the Civil War. In &quot;Soldier and Scholar: Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve and the American Civil War&quot;, Ward Briggs published editorials written by Gildersleeve while he served as a staff officer in the Confederate Army and as a professor at the University of Virginia, which feature vitriolic attacks on critics of slavery with parallels drawn to ancient Greek authors and situations. He expressed his contempt for Confederate President Jefferson Davis, whom he considered inept. Jews also came under attack in his writings, including Confederate cabinet officer Judah P. Benjamin, and those accused of miscegenation.

Gildersleeve House, one of the undergraduate dormitories at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Gildersleeve Portal at Brown Residential College at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, are both named in his honor. His granddaughter Katherine Lane Weems made the two rhinoceros sculptures at Harvard University.

Fannie Manning Gildersleeve, a black woman born approximately 1869, lists Basil Gildersleeve as her father on her funeral records. Fannie Gildersleeve was married to Charlottesville, Virginia educator Benjamin Tonsler.

The University of Virginia&#x27;s Classics program offers a distinguished professorship in Gildersleeve&#x27;s honor. It is currently held by Anthony Corbeill.

<text>BlueScope Steel Limited is an Australian flat product steel producer that was spun-off from BHP Billiton in 2002.

==History==
BlueScope was formed when BHP Billiton spun-off its steel assets on 15 July 2002 as BHP Steel. It was renamed BlueScope on 17 November 2003.

Early in 2004, BlueScope merged with the American firm Butler Manufacturing. Such a merger was considered a strategic move for both companies as they were similar in character and non-overlapping in the markets they operated in, such that acquisition of Butler, based in Kansas City, Missouri, would provide BlueScope with access to United States and Chinese markets. Butler was founded in 1901, operated in sixteen countries and focused on non-residential building and building component construction. At the time of the merger, Butler had a dozen production facilities across the United States, China and Mexico.

In 2007, the company acquired four companies consisting of most of the United States holdings of the Argentinian firm Ternium, those being Steelscape, ASC Profiles, Varco Pruden Buildings; and Metl-Span, which was acquired by NCI Building Systems in 2012. The four companies had been held by the Mexican Grupo IMSA prior to their purchase by Ternium. Steelscape originated in 1996 as BHP Coated Steel and was originally owned by BlueScope.

In March 2012 a new coated steel manufacturing plant was inaugurated in Jamshedpur, India.

In February 2014, BlueScope purchased Orrcon Steel from Hills. Its products included RHS, SHS and CHS structural tubular steel, hot-rolled structural steel and fencing, roofing and building accessories.

Because of lower energy prices in the United States than in Australia, BlueScope in 2019 decided to expand its investment in America by $1 billion.

==Operations==

The corporate headquarters are located at Level 24, 181 William Street, Melbourne.

The company has 16,000 personnel. Its largest operating plant, an integrated steelworks, is located at Port Kembla, New South Wales. In October 2011, No.6 Blast furnace, one of two at Port Kembla, was shut down, reducing the plant&#x27;s production capacity by 50% after the company decided to exit the export market.

Major products include steel slab, hot rolled coil, steel plate, automotive steel, galvanised steel, corrugated galvanised iron, Zincalume brand (55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc, 1.5% silicon) coated steel, and Colorbond brand pre-painted steel. Tinplate production ceased in March 2007.

Orrcon Steel supplies steel, tube and pipe to steel fabricators, furniture and trailer body manufacturers, housing and construction companies and pipeline and infrastructure engineering firms.

It has distribution centres in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.

==Carbon footprint==
BlueScope reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 30 June 2020 at 10,280 Kt (-120 /-1.2% y-o-y).

==Controversy==
In August 2019, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission launched a civil case against BlueScope and its former general manager of sales and marketing Jason Ellis for engaging in cartel conduct, alleging that they tried to induce competitors to enter contracts to fix prices for flat steel products between 2013 and 2014. BlueScope denied the allegations, stating &quot;we do not believe that BlueScope, or any current or former employees, have engaged in cartel conduct&quot;. In December 2020, Ellis was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and fined $10,000 after pleading guilty to obstructing the investigation, inciting two employees to give false information. In December 2022 the Australian Federal Court found that BlueScope and Ellis had attempted to induce eight steel distributors in Australia and an overseas manufacturer to enter agreements to fix and/or raise the level of pricing for flat steel products. BlueScope was ordered to pay a $57.5 million penalty, the highest penalty ever imposed for cartel conduct in Australia.

On 6 May 2020, a 59-year-old man was killed at BlueScope&#x27;s Port Kembla facility after becoming trapped between a car and a crane, resulting in the site being temporarily shut.

On 14 May 2020, BlueScope was the subject of a cyberattack that forced its production systems to be temporarily halted company-wide after ransomware was discovered in one of its systems.

In July 2020, BlueScope was fined $30,000 by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority for failing to comply with dioxin air emission limits on six occasions between March and April 2020. In response, BlueScope completed air emissions modelling and engaged an independent consultant to undertake a health assessment of the elevated emissions.

== Major manufacturing facilities ==
* Port Kembla, New South Wales
* Western Port in Hastings, Victoria
* New Zealand Steel, Glenbrook
* Orrcon Brisbane Mill, Salisbury, Queensland
* Orrcon Precision Tubing Mill, Adelaide, South Australia

Finished products are transported around Australia by rail freight operator Pacific National. In February 2007 Pacific National secured Australia&#x27;s largest ever rail freight contract ($1 billion) with BlueScope Steel and OneSteel, to carry approximately three million tonnes of steel product each year for seven years. The contract was renewed for a further seven years from January 2015. In January 2022, Qube Holdings and SCT Logistics will take over from Pacific National.

<doc id="234297" wikidata="Q216051" url="?curid=234297" title="Charlie Watts">
<text>Charles Robert Watts (2 June 1941 – 24 August 2021) was an English musician who was the drummer of the Rolling Stones from 1963 until his death in 2021.

Originally trained as a graphic artist, Watts developed an interest in jazz at a young age and joined the band Blues Incorporated. He also started playing drums in London&#x27;s rhythm and blues clubs, where he met future bandmates Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones. In January 1963, he left Blues Incorporated and joined the Rolling Stones as drummer, while doubling as designer of their record sleeves and tour stages. Watts&#x27;s first public appearance as a permanent member was in February 1963; he remained with the band for 58 years until his death, at which time he, Jagger and Richards were the only members of the band to have performed on every one of their studio albums.

Nicknamed &quot;the Wembley Whammer&quot; by Jagger, Watts cited jazz as a major influence on his drumming style. Aside from his career with the Rolling Stones, Watts toured with his own group, the Charlie Watts Quintet, and appeared in London at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club with the Charlie Watts Tentet.

In 1989, Watts was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones, and in 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, also with the Rolling Stones. He has been ranked among the greatest drummers of all time.

==Early life==
Charles Robert Watts was born at University College Hospital in Bloomsbury, London, to Charles Richard Watts, a lorry driver for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and wife Lillian Charlotte (née Eaves), who had been a factory worker. He had a sister, Linda (born 1944), with whom he was close.

As a child, Watts lived in Wembley, at 23 Pilgrims Way. Many of Wembley&#x27;s houses had been destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs during World War II; Watts and his family lived in a prefab, as did many in the community. Watts would remember little of the Second World War, stating &quot;I heard bombs exploding in the neighbourhood. I remember the mad rush from the house into the air-raid shelters. I was very young. War was something of a game to me – I don&#x27;t think I ever really and truly got frightened.&quot;

In 1946, Watts met neighbour Dave Green, who had moved next door at 22 Pilgrims Way; they became childhood friends, and remained so until Watts&#x27;s death. Green became a jazz bass player, and recalls that as boys, &quot;we discovered 78rpm records. Charlie had more records than I did ... We used to go to Charlie&#x27;s bedroom and just get these records out.&quot; Watts&#x27;s earliest records were jazz recordings; he remembered owning 78 RPM records of Jelly Roll Morton and Charlie Parker. Green recalls that Watts also &quot;had the one with Monk and the Johnny Dodds Trio. Charlie was ahead of me in listening and acquisitions.&quot; Green and Watts would become bandmates in many of Charlie&#x27;s jazz projects.

Watts and his family subsequently moved to Kingsbury, where he attended Tylers Croft Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1956; as a schoolboy, he displayed a talent for art, music, cricket and football. When he and Green were both about thirteen, Watts became interested in drumming:

Watts&#x27;s parents gave him his first drum kit in 1955, and he practised drumming along to jazz records he collected. After completing secondary school, Watts enrolled at Harrow Art School (now the Harrow campus of the University of Westminster), which he attended until 1960.

==Career==
=== Jazz bands and Blues Incorporated ===

After leaving art school, he worked as a graphic designer for an advertising company called Charlie Daniels Studios, and also played drums occasionally with local bands in coffee shops and clubs. He and Green began their musical careers together from 1958 to 1959, playing in a jazz band in Middlesex called the Jo Jones All Stars. Watts initially found his transition to rhythm and blues puzzling: &quot;I went into rhythm and blues. When they asked me to play, I didn&#x27;t know what it was. I thought it meant Charlie Parker, played slow.&quot;

In 1961, Watts met Alexis Korner, who invited him to join his band Blues Incorporated. At that time, Watts was on his way to a sojourn working as a graphic designer in Denmark, but he accepted Korner&#x27;s offer when he returned to London in February 1962. Watts played regularly with Blues Incorporated and maintained a job with the advertising firm Charles, Hobson and Gray.

=== Career with the Rolling Stones ===


In mid-1962, Watts first met Brian Jones, Ian &quot;Stu&quot; Stewart, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who also frequented the London rhythm and blues clubs, but it was not until January 1963 that Watts finally agreed to join the Rolling Stones. Initially, the band could not afford to pay Watts, who had been earning a regular salary from his gigs. His first public appearance as a permanent member was at the Ealing Jazz Club on 2 February 1963. Watts was often introduced as &quot;The Wembley Whammer&quot; by Jagger during live concerts.

Besides his work as a musician, Watts contributed graphic art and comic strips to early Rolling Stones records such as the &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; record sleeve, and was responsible for the 1975 tour announcement press conference in New York City. The band surprised the throng of waiting reporters by driving and playing &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; on the back of a flatbed truck in the middle of Manhattan traffic. Watts remembered this was a common way for New Orleans jazz bands to promote upcoming dates. Moreover, with Jagger, he designed the elaborate stages for tours, first contributing to the lotus-shaped design of the Tour of the Americas, as well as the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour, the Bridges to Babylon Tour, the Licks Tour, and the A Bigger Bang Tour.

Watts&#x27;s last live concert with the band was 30 August 2019 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida. He had never missed a single concert throughout his career with the band. Besides Jagger and Richards, he is the only member to have appeared on every album in the Rolling Stones discography. 

In October 2023, two years after Watts&#x27;s death, the Rolling Stones released &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;. The album features two songs on which Watts plays the drums: &quot;Mess It Up&quot; and &quot;Live By The Sword&quot;.

=== Activities outside the Stones ===

Watts was involved in many activities outside his life as a member of the Rolling Stones. In December 1964, he published a cartoon tribute to Charlie Parker titled &quot;Ode to a High Flying Bird&quot;. Although he made his name in rock, his personal tastes lay principally in jazz.

In the late 1970s, he joined Ian Stewart in the back-to-the-roots boogie-woogie band Rocket 88, which featured many of the UK&#x27;s top jazz, rock and R&amp;B musicians. In the 1980s, he toured worldwide with a big band – the Charlie Watts Orchestra – that included such names as Evan Parker, Courtney Pine and Jack Bruce, who was also a member of Rocket 88.

In 1991, he organised a jazz quintet as another tribute to Charlie Parker. The year 1993 saw the release of &quot;Warm and Tender&quot; by the Charlie Watts Quintet, which included vocalist Bernard Fowler. This same group released &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot; in 1996. Both records included a collection of Great American Songbook standards. Following their collaboration on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;, he and drummer Jim Keltner released a techno/instrumental album titled &quot;Charlie Watts/Jim Keltner Project&quot;. Watts stated that even though the tracks bore such names as the &quot;Elvin Suite&quot; in honour of the late Elvin Jones, Max Roach and Roy Haynes, they were not copying their style of drumming, but rather capturing a feeling by those artists. &quot;Watts at Scott&#x27;s&quot; was recorded with his group, &quot;the Charlie Watts Tentet&quot;, at the Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London.

In April 2009, he began performing with the ABC&amp;D of Boogie Woogie. When asked by pianist Ben Waters to join the ensemble, he quickly agreed; his only demand being that Dave Green play bass, stating, &quot;If Dave does it, I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;

==Personal life and public image==
On 14 October 1964, Watts married Shirley Ann Shepherd (11 September 1938 – 16 December 2022), whom he had met before joining the Stones in 1963. The couple had one daughter, Seraphina, born in March 1968, who in turn gave birth to Watts&#x27;s only grandchild, a girl named Charlotte. Watts and Shirley were married for 57 years, until Watts&#x27;s death in 2021.

Watts lived at Halsdon House near Dolton, a rural village in North Devon, where he owned an Arabian horse stud farm. He also owned a percentage of the Rolling Stones&#x27; various corporate entities.

While all the Rolling Stones collected cars, Watts never had a driving licence, preferring to view his cars as beautiful objects. Watts was also a fan of cricket, and had a collection of cricket memorabilia.

=== Touring and band relationships ===
Watts expressed a love–hate attitude towards touring, stating in 2003 that he &quot;loved playing with Keith [Richards] and the band&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x27;t interested in being a pop idol sitting there with girls screaming&quot;. He left the band after every tour, once stating &quot;I don&#x27;t actually like touring&quot;, citing the time commitment and travel required. In 1989, the Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Watts did not attend the ceremony.

Watts&#x27;s personal life appeared to be substantially quieter than those of his bandmates and many of his rock-and-roll colleagues; onstage, he seemed to furnish a calm and amused counterpoint to his flamboyant bandmates. Known for his loyalty to Shirley, Watts consistently refused sexual offers from groupies on the road; in Robert Greenfield&#x27;s &quot;STP: A Journey Through America with The Rolling Stones&quot;, a documentary of the 1972 American Tour, it is noted that when the group was invited to the Playboy Mansion during that tour, Watts took advantage of Hugh Hefner&#x27;s game room instead of frolicking with the women. &quot;I&#x27;ve never filled the stereotype of the rock star&quot;, he remarked. &quot;Back in the &#x27;70s, Bill Wyman and I decided to grow beards, and the effort left us exhausted.&quot; In a 1996 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, he said that he had sketched every bed he had slept on while on tour since 1967. By 2001, he had filled 12 to 15 diaries.

One anecdote relates that in the mid-1980s, an intoxicated Jagger phoned Watts&#x27;s hotel room in the middle of the night, asking, &quot;Where&#x27;s my drummer?&quot; Watts reportedly got up, shaved, dressed in a suit, put on a tie and freshly shined shoes, descended the stairs, and punched Jagger in the face, saying: &quot;Never call me your drummer again. You&#x27;re &quot;my&quot; fucking &quot;singer&quot;!&quot; He expressed regret for the incident in 2003, attributing his behaviour to alcohol.

=== Health ===
In the mid-1980s, Watts&#x27;s previously moderate use of alcohol and drugs became excessive. &quot;[They were] my way of dealing with [family problems] ...&quot; he said. &quot;I think it was a mid-life crisis. All I know is that I became totally another person around 1983 and came out of it about 1986. I nearly lost my wife and everything over my behaviour.&quot;

Despite quitting smoking in the late 1980s, Watts was diagnosed with throat cancer in June 2004. He underwent a course of radiotherapy and the cancer went into remission. &quot;I went into hospital,&quot; Watts recalled, &quot;and eight months later Mick said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to do a record. But we&#x27;ll only do it when you&#x27;re ready.&#x27; They were buggering about, writing songs, and when I was ready I went down and that was it, &quot;A Bigger Bang&quot;. Then I did a two-year tour. It seems that whenever we stop, I get ill. So maybe I should carry on!&quot;

On 5 August 2021, it was reported that Watts had elected to sit out the resumption of the U.S. No Filter Tour due to heart surgery and that Steve Jordan would temporarily replace him on drums.

=== Death and tributes ===
Watts died at a London hospital on 24 August 2021, at age 80, with his family around him. Although the cause of death was never officially stated, Keith Richards mentioned in March 2022 that Watts had cancer.

Watts&#x27;s former bandmates Jagger, Richards, Wood and Wyman, all paid tribute to him. Many other celebrities and rock musicians paid tribute to Watts on his death, including Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Elton John, Brian Wilson, Pete Townshend, Nick Mason, Roger Daltrey, the members of U2, Bryan Adams, Liam Gallagher, Brian May, Roger Taylor, Kenney Jones, Chad Smith, Questlove, Peter Criss, and Max Weinberg. For 10 days, the contents of the Rolling Stones&#x27; official website were replaced with a single picture of Watts in his memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vitagliano/AS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after his death, Jason Isbell and Brittney Spencer dedicated a cover performance of &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; to Watts. On 27 August, the band&#x27;s social media accounts shared a video tribute to Watts consisting of a montage of pictures and film footage. The montage was set to the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1974 track &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Rock Me&quot;, which opens with the lines &quot;The band&#x27;s on stage and it&#x27;s one of those nights ... / The drummer thinks that he is dynamite, oh yeah&quot;. Watts was buried in Devon after a small ceremony. An authorised biography was released in October 2022.

On the first anniversary of Watts&#x27;s death, Jagger shared what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as a &quot;moving tribute&quot; on social media, which included a voiceover by Jagger backed with &quot;Till the Next Goodbye&quot;. To commemorate what would have been his 82nd birthday, Watts&#x27;s estate launched official Facebook and Instagram accounts on 2 June 2023, saying in a statement that &quot;Charlie was too modest to embrace social media in his lifetime&quot; and encouraging fans to &quot;celebrate his huge musical contribution to the world of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, blues and jazz, and the wonderful man known and loved to the millions of fans around the world&quot;. In September 2023 his private book collection was set to be put up for auction; his signed first edition of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was expected to fetch between £200,000–300,000. In January 2024, the Bayeux Museum in France announced that it had paid £16,000 to acquire a lifesize replica of the Bayeux Tapestry from Watt’s estate.

== Accolades ==
=== Drumming ===
In 1991, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Watts as an &quot;heroic yet quaint archetype ... of the &#x27;Rock Drummer&#x27;, and we are unlikely to hear their like again&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributed his professional survival to not ever aspiring for stardom nor forcing himself into songwriting.

In the July 2006 issue of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine, Watts was voted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame, joining Ringo Starr, Keith Moon, Steve Gadd, Buddy Rich and other highly esteemed and influential drummers from the history of rock and jazz. The music critic Robert Christgau called Watts &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest drummer&quot;. Unlike in most bands where the other musicians follow the lead of the drummer, Watts followed Richards; according to &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani, that is what &quot;makes the Stones impossible to copy&quot;.

He is often regarded as one of the greatest drummers of all time. In 2016, he was ranked 12th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote on the day he died that he was &quot;universally recognized as one of the greatest rock drummers of all time&quot;. Music critic Rob Sheffield wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Watts was &quot;rock&#x27;s ultimate drum god&quot; who &quot;made the Stones great by conceding nothing to them&quot;. Roger Taylor of Duran Duran cites Watts as &quot;an incredible drummer and one of my heroes&quot;.

=== Appearance ===
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named him one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Dressed Men&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; elected Watts into the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List.

<text>Charles Merivale (8 March 1808 – 27 December 1893) was an English historian and churchman, for many years dean of Ely Cathedral. He was one of the main instigators of the inaugural Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race which took place at Henley in 1829.

==Life==
===Early life===
Merivale was the second son of John Herman Merivale (1770–1844) and Louisa Heath Drury, daughter of Joseph Drury, headmaster of Harrow. He was educated at Harrow School under George Butler from 1818 to 1824, where his chief schoolfriends were Charles Wordsworth and Richard Chenevix Trench. He took part in the Eton versus Harrow cricket match in 1824. In 1824 he was offered a post in the Indian civil service, and went for a short time to Haileybury College, where he did well in Oriental languages. Deciding against an Indian career, he went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1826. Among other distinctions he came out as fourth classic in 1830, and in 1833 was elected fellow of St John&#x27;s. He was a member of the Apostles&#x27; Club, his fellow-members including Tennyson, A. H. Hallam, Monckton Milnes, W. H. Thompson, Trench and James Spedding. Merivale was the main protagonist on the Cambridge side in instigating the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race held at Henley on Thames in 1829. He rowed at number four in the Cambridge boat in the race which Oxford won.

===Clerical career===
Merivale was ordained deacon in 1833 and priest in 1834 and undertook college and university work successfully. He was appointed select preacher at Whitehall in 1839. In 1848 he took the college living of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lawford, near Manningtree in Essex. He was appointed Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons in 1863. In 1869, he declined the professorship of modern history at Cambridge, but in the same year accepted from Gladstone the deanery of Ely, and until his death devoted himself to the best interests of the cathedral, also receiving many honorary academical distinctions.

===Personal life===

Merivale married Judith Mary Sophia Frere, youngest daughter of George Frere in 1850. Their son John Herman Merivale was the first English professor of mining. Their daughter Sophia Merivale was the first female councillor elected in Oxford town council in November 1907.

===Death===
Merivale died at Ely at the age of 85. There is a memorial to him in Ely Cathedral and St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lawford.
== Works ==

Merivale&#x27;s principal work was &quot;A History of the Romans under the Empire&quot; in eight volumes, which came out between 1850 and 1862. It was intended to fill the gaps between the focus of the works by Mommsen and Gibbon.

He condensed his treatment and expanded his scope ten years later to complete &quot;A General History of Rome from the Foundation of the City to the Fall of Augustulus&quot; (1875).

He wrote several smaller historical works like &quot;The Roman Triumvirates&quot; (1876), and published sermons, lectures, and Latin verses. His rendering of John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Hyperion&quot; into Latin verse (1862) received high praise.

<doc id="234311" wikidata="Q2992812" url="?curid=234311" title="List of German field marshals">
<text>Field marshal () was usually the highest military rank in various German armed forces. It had existed, under slightly different names, in several German states since 1631. After the unification of Germany it was the highest military rank of the Imperial German Army and later in the Wehrmacht until it was abolished in 1945.


The vast majority of the people promoted to field marshal won major battles in wars of their time. Field marshals played a compelling and influential role in military matters, were tax-exempt, members of the nobility, equal to government officials, under constant protection or escort, and had the right to directly report to the royal family. In the Prussian military tradition, which set the tone for the 19th century and the German Empire, field marshals could only be promoted in wartime and the royal family was excluded, both resulting in the creation of the rank of colonel general with the rank of general field marshal () in 1854. Both restrictions would eventually end with the first royals being promoted during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and later honorary promotions to foreign monarchs would follow. Adolf Hitler effectively disregarded the wartime prerequisite by two promotions in 1936 and 1938, though all subsequent promotions were during wartime.

==Electorate (1356–1806) and Kingdom of Saxony (1806–1918)==
==Brandenburg-Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1870)==
==German Empire (1871–1918)==
==Weimar Republic (1918–33)==
After the loss of the First World War, Germany was transformed into what became known as the Weimar Republic, which was subject to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. It required the reduction of the German Army to 100,000 men, a reduction of the German Navy, and the abolition of the German Air Force. As a result of the new military arrangements, there were no field marshals created during the Weimar Republic.

<text>Richard Chenevix Trench (9 September 1807 – 28 March 1886) was an Anglican archbishop and poet.

==Life==
He was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Richard Trench (1774–1860), barrister-at-law, and the Dublin writer Melesina Chenevix (1768–1827). His elder brother was Francis Chenevix Trench. He went to school at Harrow, went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated in 1829. In 1830 he visited Spain. While incumbent of Curdridge Chapel near Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in Hampshire, he published (1835) &quot;The Story of Justin Martyr and Other Poems&quot;, which was favourably received, and was followed in 1838 by &quot;Sabbation, Honor Neale, and other Poems&quot;, and in 1842 by &quot;Poems from Eastern Sources&quot;. These volumes revealed the author as the most gifted of the immediate disciples of Wordsworth, with a warmer colouring and more pronounced ecclesiastical sympathies than the master, and strong affinities to Alfred Lord Tennyson, John Keble and Richard Monckton Milnes.

In 1841 he resigned his living to become curate to Samuel Wilberforce, then rector of Alverstoke, and upon Wilberforce&#x27;s promotion to the deanery of Westminster Abbey in 1845 he was presented to the rectory of Itchenstoke. In 1845 and 1846 he preached the Hulsean lecture, and in the former year was made examining chaplain to Wilberforce, now Bishop of Oxford. He was shortly afterwards appointed to a theological chair at King&#x27;s College London.

Trench joined the Canterbury Association on 27 March 1848, on the same day as Samuel Wilberforce and Wilberforce&#x27;s brother Robert.

In 1851 he established his fame as a philologist by &quot;The Study of Words&quot;, originally delivered as lectures to the pupils of the Diocesan Training School, Winchester. His stated purpose was to demonstrate that in words, even taken singly, &quot;there are boundless stores of moral and historic truth, and no less of passion and imagination laid up&quot;—an argument which he supported by a number of apposite illustrations. It was followed by two little volumes of similar character—&quot;English Past and Present&quot; (1855) and &quot;A Select Glossary of English Words&quot; (1859). All have gone through numerous editions and have contributed much to promote the historical study of the English tongue. Another great service to English philology was rendered by his paper, read before the Philological Society, &quot;On some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries&quot; (1857), which gave the first impulse to the great &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Trench envisaged a totally new dictionary that was a &quot;lexicon totius Anglicitatis&quot;. As one of the three founders of the dictionary, he expressed his vision thus: it would be &#x27;an entirely new Dictionary; no patch upon old garments, but a new garment throughout&#x27;.

His advocacy of a revised translation of the New Testament (1858) helped promote another great national project. In 1856 he published a valuable essay on Calderón, with a translation of a portion of &quot;Life is a Dream&quot; in the original metre. In 1841 he published his &quot;Notes on the Parables of our Lord&quot;, and in 1846 his &quot;Notes on the Miracles&quot;, popular works which are treasuries of erudite and acute illustration.

In 1856 Trench became Dean of Westminster Abbey, a position which suited him. Here he introduced evening nave services.
===Later career and death===
In January 1864 he was advanced to the post of Archbishop of Dublin. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley had been the first choice, but was rejected by the Irish Church, and, according to Bishop Wilberforce&#x27;s correspondence, Trench&#x27;s appointment was favoured by neither the prime minister nor the lord-lieutenant. It was, moreover, unpopular in Ireland, and a blow to English literature; yet it turned out to be fortunate. Trench could not prevent the disestablishment of the Irish Church, though he resisted with dignity. But, when the disestablished communion had to be reconstituted under the greatest difficulties, it was important that the occupant of his position should be a man of a liberal and genial spirit.

This was the work of the remainder of Trench&#x27;s life; it exposed him at times to considerable abuse, but he came to be appreciated, and, when in November 1884 he resigned his archbishopric because of poor health, clergy and laity unanimously recorded their sense of his &quot;wisdom, learning, diligence, and munificence.&quot; He had found time for &quot;Lectures on Medieval Church History&quot; (1878); his poetical works were rearranged and collected in two volumes (last edition, 1885). From 1872 and during his successor&#x27;s incumbency the post of Dean of Christ Church, Dublin was held with the archbishopric.

He died on 28 March 1886 at Eaton Square, London after a lingering illness, and was buried at Westminster Abbey.

George W. E. Russell described Trench as &quot;a man of singularly vague and dreamy habits&quot; and recounted the following anecdote of his old age:He once went back to pay a visit to his successor, Lord Plunket. Finding himself back again in his old palace, sitting at his old dinner table, and gazing across it at his wife, he lapsed in memory to the days when he was master of the house, and gently remarked to Mrs Trench, &quot;I am afraid, my love, that we must put this cook down among our failures.&quot;

<doc id="234317" wikidata="Q187352" url="?curid=234317" title="Kavala">
<text>Kavala (, &quot;Kavála&quot; ) is a city in northern Greece, the principal seaport of eastern Macedonia and the capital of Kavala regional unit.

It is situated on the Bay of Kavala, across from the island of Thasos and on the A2 motorway, a one-and-a-half-hour drive to Thessaloniki ( west) and a forty-minute drive to Drama ( north) and Xanthi ( east). It is also about 150 kilometers west of Alexandroupoli.

Kavala is an important economic centre of Northern Greece, a center of commerce, tourism, fishing and oil-related activities and formerly a thriving trade in tobacco.

== Names ==
Historically the city is known by several names. In antiquity the name of the city was Neapolis (&#x27;new city&#x27;, like many Greek colonies). In the Early Middle Ages it was renamed to Christo(u)polis (&#x27;city of Christ&#x27;) and from the 16th century and on to Kavala.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the modern name of the city is disputed. Some mention an ancient Greek settlement of &quot;Skavala&quot; near the town. Others propose that the name is derived from the Italian &quot;cavallo&quot; which means horse. The city is situated on the ancient route of Via Egnatia; hence Cavala designated &quot;the horses&quot; (cavalla) where imperial couriers changed horses. The French traveller Bellon, who visited Kavala in 1547, mentions a local tradition that the city initially took its name from Alexander the Great, who named it &quot;Bukephala&quot;, after the name of his horse Bucephalus. Another possibility is that &quot;Kavala&quot; is a Turkish name, given by the Turks after they refounded the city at the beginning of the 16th century. Last but not least, as the archaeologist Georgios Bakalakis first pointed out, there was a Byzantine fortress named Kavala close to the Byzantine city of Iconium - now Konya - in Asia Minor. When the Ottomans brought Muslim settlers from Iconium to establish in the territory of Kavala at the beginning of the 16th century, these people brought the name of their homeland with them. Nowadays the city&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the cyan city&quot; (Η γαλάζια πόλη) and the symbol of the municipality of Kavala is the head of goddess Parthenos, the patron goddess of ancient Neapolis, as depicted in the coinage of the ancient Greek city.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

The city was founded in the late 7th century BC by settlers from Thassos. It was one of several Thassian colonies along the coastline, all founded in order to take advantage of rich gold and silver mines, especially those located in the nearby Pangaion mountain (which were eventually exploited by Phillip II of Macedonia).

Worship of Parthenos/Virgin, a female deity of Greek Ionian origin associated with Athena, is archaeologically attested in the Archaic period. At the end of the 6th century BC Neapolis claimed independence from Thassos and began issuing its own silver coins with the head of Gorgo (γοργὀνειο) on one side. A few decades later a large Ionic temple made from Thassian marble replaced the Archaic one. Parts of it can now be seen in the town&#x27;s archaeological museum.

In 411 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, Neapolis was besieged by the allied armies of the Spartans and the Thassians but remained faithful to Athens. Two Athenian honorary decrees in 410 and 407 BC rewarded Neapolis for its loyalty.

Neapolis was a town of Macedonia, located from the harbour of Philippi. It was a member of the Second Athenian League; a pillar found in Athens mentions the contribution of Neapolis to the alliance. 
The town was later conquered by the Kingdom of Macedonia.
=== Roman and Byzantine Era ===

The military Roman road Via Egnatia passed through the city and helped commerce to flourish. It became a Roman &quot;civitas&quot; in 168 BC, and was a base for Brutus and Cassius in 42 BC, before their defeat in the Battle of Philippi.

The Apostle Paul landed at Neapolis during his first voyage to Europe.
In the 6th century, Byzantine emperor Justinian I, an Illyrian from Taor, Dardania (Procopius), fortified the city in an effort to protect it from barbarian raids. In later Byzantine times the city was called &quot;Christo(u)polis&quot; (Χριστούπολις, &quot;city of Christ&quot;) and belonged initially to the theme of Macedonia and later to the Theme of Strymon. The first surviving mention of the new name is in a &quot;taktikon&quot; of the early 9th century. The city is also mentioned in the &quot;Life of St. Gregory of Dekapolis&quot;. In the 8th and 9th centuries, Bulgarian attacks forced the Byzantines to reorganise the defence of the area, giving great care to Christoupolis with fortifications and a notable garrison. The city remained under Byzantine control and in 837 Byzantine armed forces from Christoupolis under the command of Caesar Alexius Moselie stopped Bulgarian raids in the plain of Philippoi.

At about 830-840 AD dates a Greek inscription on the walls of a defensive tower of the fortifications of the city, still visible today, and in 926, according to another inscription (nowadays in the archaeological museum of Kavala), the General of the Theme of Strymon Vasilios Klaudon, restored the &quot;fallen and damaged&quot; defensive walls.

In the mid of the 12th century the Arab geographer Edrisi visited Christoupolis and described it as a well fortified city and a center of sea trade. According to another inscription, also nowadays in the archaeological museum of Kavala, the Normans probably burnt the city in 1185, after they captured first Thessaloniki. Some years later, the city fell to the hands of the Lombards, after the Fourth Crusade and was liberated again by the leader of the state of Epirus, Theodorus Komnenos, in 1225. 


In 1302, the Catalans failed to capture the city. In order to prevent them from coming back, the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos built a new long defensive wall. In 1357 two Byzantine officers and brothers, Alexios and John, controlled the city and its territory. Excavations have revealed the ruins of an early Byzantine basilica under an Ottoman mosque in the Old Town. It was used until the late Byzantine era.

=== Ottoman Era ===

The Ottoman Empire first captured the city in 1387. Kavala remained a part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. In 1519 (Hijri 925) the town was directly owned by the Sultan as a hass, and had 22 Muslim and 61 Christian households. In the 16th century, an Aromanian that had converted to Islam in his late teenhood, Ibrahim Pasha, Grand Vizier of Suleiman the Magnificent, contributed to the town&#x27;s prosperity and growth by reconstructing the late Roman (1st - 6th century AD) aqueduct. The Ottomans also extended the Byzantine fortress on the hill of &quot;Panagia&quot;. Both landmarks are among the most recognizable symbols of the city today.

Muhammad Ali, the founder of a dynasty that ruled Egypt, was born to an ethnic Albanian family in Kavala in 1769. His house has been preserved as a museum.

=== 20th century ===

Kavala was captured by the Bulgarian Army in the First Balkan War and then captured again by the Greek Navy during the Second Balkan War and was incorporated into Greece with the Treaty of Bucharest. In August 1916 remnants of the IV Army Corps, stationed at Kavala under Ioannis Hatzopoulos surrendered to the advancing Bulgarian army. These events provoked a military revolt in Thessaloniki, which led to the establishment of the Provisional Government of National Defence, and eventually Greece&#x27;s entry into the First World War.

The Bulgarian occupation of the city lasted from August 1916 until September 1918. Hundreds of victims and eye-witnesses testified about the Bulgarian atrocities in the post-war inter-Allied interrogatory committee, which finally gave its report on 21 April 1919, after &quot;in situ&quot; examination of the circumstances.

After the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, the city entered a new era of prosperity because of the labor offered by the thousands of refugees that moved to the area from Anatolia. The development was both industrial and agricultural. Kavala became greatly involved and developed further in the processing and trading of tobacco. Many buildings related to the storage and processing of tobacco from that era are preserved in the city. During the Interwar period and the Second Hellenic Republic, Kavala was the 4th largest city in Greece (after Athens, Thessaloniki, and Patras). In 1934 Dimitrios Partsalidis was elected mayor of Kavala, the first communist mayor in modern Greek history. The city gained temporarily by the Press, the nickname &quot;Little Moscow&quot;.

During the Second World War and after the Battle of Greece, Bulgaria occupied the city again, following the German invasion (April 1941). During the Bulgarian occupation (1941–1944), almost the entire Jewish community of the city was deported, turned over to German authorities and exterminated in the Treblinka death camp as part of the Holocaust.

Following the years after the Second World War, the city faced economic decline and emigration.

In the late 1950s, Kavala expanded towards the sea by reclaiming land from the area west of the port.

In 1967, King Constantine II left Athens for Kavala in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a counter-coup against the military junta.

== Ecclesiastical history ==

Neapolis was important enough in the Late Roman province of Macedonia Prima to be a suffragan of its capital Philippi&#x27;s Metropolitan Archbishopric into the frames of the Greek - Christian eastern church. In the 8th century A.D. refers for the first time a bishopric of Christoupolis and later, between 886 - 912, during the reign of the emperor Leo the Wise, Christoupolis is mentioned as one of the six bishoprics of the metropolis of Philippi. Only later, in 1260, Christoupolis became a metropolis itself. 
After the liberation of the city of Kavala by the Greek army during the Balkan Wars, the local church was re-established under the official title &quot;Metropolis of Philippi, Neapolis and Thasos&quot; till nowadays. Metropolis of Kavala established a conference center dedicated to Saint Paul, in the village of Lydia, near the spot where, according to tradition, Paul baptized saint Lydia, in the river Zygaktis. In the same spot, Metropolis established a unique open-air baptistery as well as a unique octagonal baptistery, with mosaic and stained - glass decoration, the only such temple in Greece.

<text>Count Rutger von Ascheberg (2 June 1621 – 17 April 1693), also known as Roger von Ascheberg was a Swedish soldier, officer and civil servant who served as Lieutenant General in 1670, General in 1674, Field Marshal in 1678, Governor General of the Scanian provinces, in 1680, and Royal Councilor in 1681.

== Biography ==
Ascheberg was born on the estate Berbonen (Perbohnen) in Courland (today part of Latvia) on 2 June 1621. He was of an old Westphalian family that had emigrated to Courland in the 16th century. His parents were Wilhelm von Ascheberg and Margaretha von der Osten.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War ===
At the age of 13, he served as a page for Colonel Brink of the Swedish army, who was fighting in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany. He was present at a number of major battles, including the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634.

In 1639, he left the army for studies in France. At the age of 19, he was drafted into a Hessian cavalry regiment in Swedish service. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Wolfenbüttel in 1641. In the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1642, he was wounded and captured by the enemy but later rescued. During the remaining part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Ascheberg fought under Field Marshals Lennart Torstenson and Carl Gustaf Wrangel. He distinguished himself on a number of occasions and was made cornet in 1644, captain lieutenant in 1645 and Rittmeister in 1646.

After the peace was settled in 1648, Ascheberg remained in Germany. He held a position as bailiff from 1651–1655. In 1655, he was offered a position as lieutenant colonel and command of a regiment within the Swedish army, which was preparing for war against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

=== Second Northern War (1655–1660) ===
The war, known as the Second Northern War, initially took place in Poland-Lithuania. Ascheberg proved to be successful during the campaign. In March 1656. after capturing the city of Jarosław, Ascheberg was promoted to colonel. In July of the same year, he fought at the Battle of Warsaw. He commanded the Swedish forces in the Battle of Chojnice (Konitz), in which he was highly successful according to some sources. As a token of his appreciation, Swedish king Charles X Gustav gave Ascheberg a rapier he had used in battle. He also received valuable jewellery and an estate in Prussia.

Denmark attacked Sweden&#x27;s German possessions in 1657; this led to the Swedish army, including the forces under Ascheberg, leaving Poland to instead engage the Danish forces, who were seen as the more immediate threat. In 1658, Ascheberg spearheaded the March across the Belts, a bold maneuver where the army marched across the frozen ice of Little Belt and Great Belt in order to reach the Danish island of Zealand and the capital Copenhagen. He narrowly escaped being caught when the enemy under Frederick William of Brandenburg and Polish commander Stefan Czarniecki attacked Sønderborg in December 1658. In February 1659, he was badly wounded during the assault on Copenhagen. After spending 10 weeks in bed, a recovered Ascheberg returned to the battlefield in time to be in charge of the conquest of the island of Møn in May 1659. He remained on the island until the war ended in 1660.
=== Promotions and knighthood ===
In 1664, Ascheberg was promoted to major general, and in 1665, he took part when Field Marshal Wrangel led Swedish troops to the German city of Bremen during the conflict between Sweden and Bremen. He returned to Sweden when the conflict was settled. In 1670, he reached the rank of lieutenant general, and in 1673, he was declared Freiherr of the estate Kastellgården outside Kungälv. In 1674, he was promoted to general.

=== Scanian War (1675–1679) ===
In the Scanian War, Ascheberg was first responsible for the defence of Bohuslän against attacks from Norway. His force won a battle close to Kviström. He left Bohuslän for Scania and acted as commander in a number of battles, often alongside king Charles XI. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Halmstad in August 1676, where he was wounded in the arm. After recovering in Gothenburg, he joined the army in Scania in time to play a significant part in the largest battle of the war, the Battle of Lund in December. He contributed actively to the Swedish victory in the Battle of Landskrona in 1677, after which he was appointed Lieutenant Field Marshal. Before the war ended, he had received highest command of the Swedish army in Scania. In November 1678, after the hostilities had practically ended but before a peace treaty had been negotiated, Ascheberg was handed the highest position within the Swedish army: Field Marshal.
=== Governor-General and Count ===
After the Scanian war had ended in December 1679, Ascheberg was appointed Governor-General of Gothenburg, Bohuslän and Dalsland. In 1680, Scania and Halland was added to his governorship. He was declared Royal Councilor in 1681 and Count in 1687.

=== Mentor to the king ===
King Charles XI, who rose to the throne as a four-year-old when his father king Charles X Gustav died in 1660, saw Ascheberg as his military master. In a letter to Ascheberg, written 1680, Charles XI acknowledged that &quot;...the little that I have learnt in this war, I have got &quot;Herr&quot; Field Marshal to thank for, and for as long as I live, I will acknowledge that&quot;.

=== Death ===
Ascheberg died in Gothenburg on 17 April 1693. He was buried in German Church (&quot;Tyska kyrkan&quot;), also known as Kristine Church, Gothenburg, on 26 August 1694. King Charles XI attended the funeral.
Among the manors and estates that Ascheberg owned at the time of his death were Kastellegården, Gullmarsberg, Holma, Torreby, Stenungsön and Ström, in Bohuslän, as well as Sövdeborg, Agerup and Tosterup in Scania.

== Marriage and children ==

In 1650, at the age of twenty-nine, Rutger von Ascheberg married Maria Eleonora von Bussech (1632–1690), an eighteen-year-old girl from a Hessian noble family. She was buried in 1691, in the same church that her husband would be buried in three years later. 

Maria Eleonora was constantly pregnant during much of her marriage, giving birth almost once a year. The couple had 25 children, of which only 12 are known by name:
* George Fredrik von Ascheberg (1651 - 1677) 
* Margareta Sabina von Ascheberg (1652 - 1738) 
* Ludvig Volrath von Ascheberg (1654 - 1677) 
* Anna Elisabeth von Ascheberg (1656 - 1686) 
* Karl Gustaf von Ascheberg (1659 - 1660), died in infancy 
* Rutger von Ascheberg (1660 - 1660), died in infancy 
* Gustaf Adolf von Ascheberg (1661 - 1692) 
* Kristian Ludvig von Ascheberg (1662 - 1722) 
* Eleonora Elisabet von Ascheberg (1663–1737). She was born on 13 September 1663. On 14 September 1679, she married David Makeléer, and she died on 13 November 1737.
* Sofia Lovisa von Ascheberg (1664–1720), who married Hans Wachtmeister
* Otto Vilhelm von Ascheberg (1665–1687) 
* Margareta von Ascheberg (1671–1753), who married Kjell Kristoffer Barnekow (1663–1700) on 26 January 1691
* 13 other children who were stillborn or died shortly after birth

<text>Karmen Stavec (born 21 December 1973) is a Slovene musician and pop singer.

==Early years==
Karmen was born in West Berlin, at that time part of West Germany, to Slovene parents. After graduation she came to Domžale, Slovenia, where she joined the dance duo &quot;4 Fun&quot;. She also began to study Germanic studies at the Philosophical Faculty at the University of Ljubljana. In 1998 she started her own solo career.

==Music career==
She has participated four times in Slovene national selection, called &quot;EMA&quot; for the Eurovision song contest in 1998 (with Patrik Greblo), EMA 2001, EMA 2002 and EMA 2003. In 2002, at the EMA, she took second place behind the trio Sestre (&quot;The Sisters&quot;), although she received the highest number of points from televoting. Her song, &quot;Še in še&quot; won the National Finals Song Contest. In 2003 she won, and she represented Slovenia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, where she finished in 23rd place with the song &quot;Nanana&quot;, sung in English. The Slovene version of the song is called &quot;Lep poletni dan&quot; (meaning &quot;A Nice Summer Day&quot;).

In 2008, Karmen announced a return to the music scene with another entry in EMA 2009 with the song &quot;A si želiš&quot;. She finished third in the semi-finals and tenth in the final.

<text>Count Johan August Sandels (31 August 1764 – 22 January 1831) was a Swedish soldier and politician, being appointed Governor-general of Norway (&quot;Riksståthållare&quot; in Swedish, &quot;Rigsstatholder&quot; in Dano-Norwegian) 1818 and Field Marshal in 1824. He also served as acting Governor of Stockholm in 1815.

== Biography ==
Sandels was born in Stockholm. In the Finnish War (1808–1809) on 27 October 1808, he led the Swedish troops to victory against the Russian forces, at the Battle of Koljonvirta. His subordinate officers were Colonel Fahlander, Major Malm and Major Joachim Zachris Duncker.

These events and others in the Finnish War were later retold in a series of epic poems by Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Runeberg&#x27;s poem tells a story of Sandels having a feast while the enemy mounts a premature attack. Sandels continues his meal and is accused of cowardice, after which he raises and rides to the battle, drives back the enemy and is praised by his men.

Sandels also fought in the Swedish ranks against Napoleon during the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1813 and 1814. He received some award for his services in form of a donation lands in the then Swedish Pomerania.

His granddaughter, Augusta Sandels, married Philip, Prince of Eulenburg and Hertefeld, bringing some Pomeranian inheritance to the Eulenburg family and her descendants. The couple were granted the Prussian title of Count Sandels, in addition to their other titles.

== Finnish beer brand ==

&quot;Sandels&quot; is a beer brewed by Olvi since 1971. Humorous stories about Colonel Sandels (and his love of beer and food) are printed on the back label. &quot;Sandels&quot; was named the top rated beer brand in Finland in a 2015 study.

<doc id="234327" wikidata="Q18354206" url="?curid=234327" title="Tree warbler">
<text>Tree warblers are medium-sized warblers in the marsh- and tree-warbler family Acrocephalidae. They are found in Europe, Africa and western Asia. Until recently, they were all classified in the single genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;.

These warblers are associated with trees, though normally in fairly open woodland rather than tight plantations. Compared with the closely related &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; species, tree warblers have squarer tails and broader bill-bases. Most are unstreaked greenish or brownish above and cream or white below. They are insectivorous, but will occasionally take berries or seeds. The species breeding in temperate regions are mostly strongly migratory.

== Taxonomy ==
All the tree warblers were formerly placed in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; family Sylviidae but are now separated in the family Acrocephalidae, along with the marsh warblers, &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;, and some related species.

Considerable evidence, much of it summarised in Parkin et al. (2004), suggests that the genus &quot;Hippolais&quot; is paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. DNA studies, e.g. Leisler et al. (1997), interpreted by George Sangster in 1997, indicated that the olivaceous and booted/Sykes&#x27;s warbler grouping (the subgenus &quot;Iduna&quot;) are more closely related to &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; species than they are to icterine and melodious warblers and as a result the Dutch Committee on Avian Systematics (CSNA) has moved these four species into &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. A subsequent review by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union Records Committee retained the genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;, for all eight species, but in agreement with Sangster, acknowledged that they fell into two groups.

The retention of the &quot;Iduna&quot; grouping within &quot;Hippolais&quot; was done because it was felt that more evidence was needed for its placement, because of low bootstrap values, rather than because of a belief that the status quo was correct – no evidence was put forward to refute the DNA findings. Mark Constantine, in &quot;The Sound Approach to Birding&quot;, illustrated that there is extensive overlap in song types between species from the two genera, and that vocally, no characters existed which enabled species to be sorted into one genus or the other. Kenneth Williamson and Hadoram Shirihai, in discussing the identification of &quot;Hippolais&quot; and &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; warblers stressed the similarities between species in the two genera. Colin Bradshaw, in &quot;British Birds&quot;, has written several articles on morphological similarity between cross-generic species-pairs e.g. eastern olivaceous and Blyth&#x27;s reed warblers (Bradshaw 2000) and paddyfield and booted warblers (e.g. Bradshaw &amp; Steele 1995, Bradshaw &amp; Steele 1997, the latter a response to Lars Svensson&#x27;s comments on Bradshaw &amp; Steele 1995).

The species are:

Genus &quot;Iduna&quot;
* Thick-billed warbler, &quot;Iduna aedon&quot;
* Booted warbler, &quot;Iduna caligata&quot;
* Sykes&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Iduna rama&quot;
* Western olivaceous warbler (or isabelline warbler), &quot;Iduna opaca&quot;
* Eastern olivaceous warbler, &quot;Iduna pallida&quot;
* Mountain yellow warbler, &quot;Iduna similis&quot;
* African yellow warbler, &quot;Iduna natalensis&quot;

Genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;

* Upcher&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Hippolais languida&quot;
* Olive-tree warbler, &quot;Hippolais olivetorum&quot;
* Melodious warbler, &quot;Hippolais polyglotta&quot;
* Icterine warbler, &quot;Hippolais icterina&quot;

Genus &quot;Calamonastides&quot;
* Papyrus yellow warbler, &quot;Calamonastides gracilirostris&quot;

<doc id="234328" wikidata="Q736194" url="?curid=234328" title="Stellar association">
<text>A stellar association is a very loose star cluster, looser than both open clusters and globular clusters. Stellar associations will normally contain from 10 to 100 or more visible stars. An association is primarily identified by commonalities in its member stars&#x27; movement vectors, ages, and chemical compositions. These shared features indicate that the members share a common origin. Nevertheless, they have become gravitationally unbound, unlike star clusters, and the member stars will drift apart over millions of years, becoming a moving group as they scatter throughout their neighborhood within the galaxy.

Stellar associations were discovered by Victor Ambartsumian in 1947. The conventional name for an association uses the names or abbreviations of the constellation (or constellations) in which they are located; the association type, and, sometimes, a numerical identifier.

==Types==
Victor Ambartsumian first categorized stellar associations into two groups, OB and T, based on the properties of their stars. A third category, R, was later suggested by Sidney van den Bergh for associations that illuminate reflection nebulae.

The OB, T, and R associations form a continuum of young stellar groupings. But it is currently uncertain whether they are an evolutionary sequence, or represent some other factor at work. Some groups also display properties of both OB and T associations, so the categorization is not always clear-cut.

===OB associations===
Young associations will contain 10–100 massive stars of spectral class O and B, and are known as &quot;OB associations&quot;. These are believed to form within the same small volume inside a giant molecular cloud. Once the surrounding dust and gas is blown away, the remaining stars become unbound and begin to drift apart. It is believed that the majority of all stars in the Milky Way were formed in OB associations.

O class stars are short-lived, and will expire as supernovae after roughly one to fifteen million years, depending on the mass of the star. As a result, OB associations are generally only a few million years in age or less. The O-B stars in the association will have burned all their fuel within
10 million years. (Compare this to the current age of the Sun at about 5 billion years.)

The Hipparcos satellite provided measurements that located a dozen OB associations within 650 parsecs of the Sun. The nearest OB association is the Scorpius–Centaurus association, located about 400 light-years from the Sun.

OB associations have also been found in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Andromeda Galaxy. These associations can be quite sparse, spanning 1,500 light-years in diameter.

===T associations===
Young stellar groups can contain a number of infant T Tauri stars that are still in the process of entering the main sequence. These sparse populations of up to a thousand T Tauri stars are known as &quot;T associations&quot;. The nearest example is the Taurus-Auriga T association (Tau-Aur T association), located at a distance of 140 parsecs from the Sun. Other examples of T associations include the R Corona Australis T association, the Lupus T association, the Chamaeleon T association and the Velorum T association. T associations are often found in the vicinity of the molecular cloud from which they formed. Some, but not all, include O-B class stars. To summarize the characteristics of Moving groups members: they have the same age and origin, the same chemical composition and they have the same amplitude and direction in their vector of velocity.

===R associations===
Associations of stars that illuminate reflection nebulae are called &quot;R associations&quot;, a name suggested by Sidney van den Bergh after he discovered that the stars in these nebulae had a non-uniform distribution. These young stellar groupings contain main sequence stars that are not sufficiently massive to disperse the interstellar clouds in which they formed. This allows the properties of the surrounding dark cloud to be examined by astronomers. Because R-associations are more plentiful than OB associations, they can be used to trace out the structure of the galactic spiral arms. An example of an R-association is Monoceros R2, located 830 ± 50 parsecs from the Sun.

== Known associations ==
The Ursa Major Moving Group is one example of a stellar association. (Except for α Ursae Majoris and η Ursae Majoris, all the stars in the Plough/Big Dipper are part of that group.)

Other young moving groups include:
* Local Association (Pleiades moving group)
* Hyades Stream
* IC 2391 supercluster
* Beta Pictoris moving group
* Castor moving group
* AB Doradus moving group
* Zeta Herculis moving group
* Alpha Persei moving cluster
* Cameleopardis OB1 association

<doc id="234329" wikidata="Q1851558" url="?curid=234329" title="Richard Lower (physician)">
<text>Richard Lower ( – 17 January 1691) was an English physician who heavily influenced the development of medical science. He is most remembered for his pioneering work on blood transfusion and the function of the cardiopulmonary system, which he described in his book &quot;Tractatus de Corde&quot;.

==Life==
Lower was born in St Tudy, Cornwall, and studied at Westminster School, where he met John Locke, as well as Christ Church, Oxford, where he met Thomas Willis. He followed Willis to London, where he carried out anatomical research, some in partnership with Robert Hooke. His major work, &quot;Tractatus de Corde&quot; (1669), was concerned with the workings of the heart and lungs. Lower also experimented with blood transfusion.

Lower formed part of an informal research team, performing laboratory experiments at the University of Oxford during the Interregnum. He was a pioneer of experimental physiology. Lower was a medical student under Willis (Professor of Natural Philosophy from 1660 to 1675), earning his M.D. degree in 1665, and then collaborated with him to investigate the nervous system. He began his own research on the heart. He traced the circulation of blood as it passes through the lungs and learned that it changes when it is exposed to air. Lower was the first to observe the difference in arterial and venous blood.

The idea of blood transfusion had originated in Paris. A French monk, Dom Robert des Gabets
described the principle of transfusion at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences in July 1658. Lower showed it was possible for blood to be transfused from animal to animal, and performed the first transfusion between two dogs in February 1665. Inspired by the work of Lower, The French doctor Jean-Baptiste Denis performed the first documented transfusion of blood from an animal to a man (xenotransfusion), in a 15-yr-old male patient shortly followed by Lower. In November 1667, Lower worked with Edmund King, another student of Willis, to transfuse sheep&#x27;s blood into a man who was mentally ill. Lower was interested in advancing science but also believed the man could be helped, either by the infusion of fresh blood or by the removal of old blood. It was difficult to find people who would agree to be transfused, but an eccentric scholar, Arthur Coga, consented and the procedure was carried out by Lower and King before the Royal Society on 23 November 1667. Transfusion gathered some popularity in France and Italy, but medical and theological debates arose, resulting in the practice being prohibited. On 10 January 1670 the French Parliament prohibited transfusions, with the English Parliament rapidly following suit.

Lower studied the arterial circle at the base of the brain, named the circle of Willis after his teacher. He wanted to see if blood would continue to flow through the head if three of the four arteries supplying blood to the head were tied.

Lower also sought to understand how the cerebrospinal fluid was formed and how it circulated. These experiments led to a study of hydrocephalus, a disease in which fluid collects in the cavities of the brain. In Lower&#x27;s time, it was thought that catarrh, an inflammation of the mucous membranes, might be caused by seepage of fluid from the brain to the nose. Lower&#x27;s book &quot;De Catarrhis&quot; is of historical significance because it was the first scholarly attempt by an English physician to take a classical doctrine (the theory that nasal secretions are an overspill from the brain) and disprove it by scientific experiment.

Lower wrote &quot;Diatribae T. Willisii de Febribus Vindicatio&quot;, an eight-volume defence of Dr. Willis and his doctrine of fevers. In keeping with his interest in the circulatory system, Lower went on to write &quot;Tractatus de Corde&quot;, which described the muscular fibres of the heart, a method of ligaturing veins to produce dropsy, blood coagulation in the heart, the motion of digestive fluids, and other physiologic topics. Lower presented his &quot;Tractatus de Corde&quot; to the Royal Society in 1669.

Willis died in 1675 and Lower became busy with the demands of his medical practice. He took care of King Charles II during his final illness in 1685. When James II took the throne, Lower did not continue as court physician because of his anti-Catholic and Whiggish sentiments. However, he was consulted during pregnancy by the woman who would later become Queen Anne.

Lower died in London from a fever in 1691.

<doc id="234337" wikidata="Q944360" url="?curid=234337" title="William Hunter (anatomist)">
<text>William Hunter (23 May 1718 – 30 March 1783) was a Scottish anatomist and physician. He was a leading teacher of anatomy, and the outstanding obstetrician of his day. His guidance and training of his equally famous brother, John Hunter, was also of great importance.

==Early life and career==
Hunter was born at Long Calderwood, now a part of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, to Agnes Paul (–1751) and John Hunter (1662/3–1741). He was the elder brother of surgeon, John Hunter. After studying divinity at the University of Glasgow, he went into medicine in 1737, studying under William Cullen.

Arriving in London, Hunter became resident pupil to William Smellie (1741–44) and he was trained in anatomy at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London, specialising in obstetrics. He followed the example of Smellie in giving a private course on dissecting, operative procedures and bandaging, from 1746. His courtly manners and sensible judgement helped him to advance until he became the leading obstetric consultant of London. Unlike Smellie, he did not favour the use of forceps in delivery. Stephen Paget said of him:
To orthopaedic surgeons he is famous for his studies on bone and cartilage. In 1743 he published the paper &quot;On the structure and diseases of articulating cartilages&quot; – which is often cited – especially the following sentence: &quot;If we consult the standard Chirurgical Writers from Hippocrates down to the present Age, we shall find, that an ulcerated Cartilage is universally allowed to be a very troublesome Disease; that it admits of a Cure with more Difficulty than carious Bone; and that, when destroyed, it is not recovered&quot;.

==Later career==
In 1764, he became physician to Queen Charlotte. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767 and Professor of Anatomy to the Royal Academy in 1768.

In 1768 he built the famous anatomy theatre and museum in Great Windmill Street, Soho, where the best British anatomists and surgeons of the period were trained. His greatest work was &quot;Anatomia uteri umani gravidi&quot; [The anatomy of the human gravid uterus exhibited in figures] (1774), with plates engraved by Rymsdyk (1730–90), and published by the Baskerville Press. He chose as a model for clear, precise but schematic illustration of anatomic dissections the drawings by Leonardo da Vinci conserved in the Royal Collection at Windsor: Kenneth Clark considered him responsible for the 18th century rediscovery of Leonardo&#x27;s drawings in England. He praised them highly in his lectures and planned to publish them with his own commentary, but never had the time for the project before his death.

To aid his teaching of dissection, in 1775 Hunter commissioned sculptor Agostino Carlini to make a cast of the flayed but muscular corpse of a recently executed criminal, a smuggler. He was professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy of Arts in London from 1769 until 1772. He was interested in arts, and had strong connections to the artistic world.

==An avid collector==
Around 1765 William Hunter started collecting widely across a range of themes beyond medicine and anatomy: books, manuscripts, prints, coins, shells, zoological specimens, and minerals. In several of these areas, he worked closely with specialists, such as Johan Christian Fabricius, and George Fordyce who used his collections as tools for new biological and chemical science. He bequeathed his collections, plus a large sum to build a museum, to the University of Glasgow. The collections survive today as the nucleus of the University of Glasgow&#x27;s Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, while his library and archives are now held in the university&#x27;s library.

Hunter&#x27;s coin collection was especially fine, and the Hunter Coin Cabinet in the Hunterian Museum is one of the world&#x27;s great numismatic collections. According to the Preface of &quot;Catalogue of Greek Coins in the Hunterian Collection&quot; (Macdonald 1899), Hunter purchased many important collections, including those of Horace Walpole and the bibliophile Thomas Crofts. King George III even donated an Athenian gold piece on 7 April of 1774.

When the famous book collection of Anthony Askew, the &quot;Bibliotheca Askeviana&quot;, was auctioned off upon Askew&#x27;s death in 1774, Hunter purchased many significant volumes in the face of stiff competition from the British Museum.

He died in London in 1783, aged 64, and was buried at St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly. A memorial to him lies in the church.
== Controversy ==
In 2010, the self-described historian Don Shelton made some lurid claims about the methods by which Hunter, his brother John, and his teacher and competitor William Smellie might have obtained bodies for their anatomical work. In a non-peer-reviewed opinion piece in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&quot; he suggested that the two physicians committed multiple murders of pregnant women in order to gain access to corpses for anatomical dissection and physiological experimentation. He suggested that there was an inadequate match between supply and demand of pregnant corpses and that the two physicians must have commissioned many murders in order to carry out their work.

Shelton&#x27;s comments attracted media publicity, but were heavily criticised on factual and methodological grounds by medical historians, who pointed out that in 1761, Peter Camper had indicated that figures &quot;were not all from real life&quot;, and likely methods other than murder were available to obtain bodies of recently deceased pregnant women at that time. Hunter also provided case histories for at least four of the subjects illustrated in &quot;The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures&quot;, published in 1774. A recent review of Hunter&#x27;s sources of anatomical specimens was published in 2015. That &quot;multiple methods of preservation were combined&quot; at Hunter&#x27;s Great Windmill Street school in order to retain as much information from the individual cadavers as possible further indicates the rarity and value of these bodies. 

Helen King indicated that the over-enthusiastic response of the media and the internet to Shelton&#x27;s unreviewed speculations raised fresh questions about how medical history is generated, presented and evaluated in the media and, in particular, on the internet.

<text>University of Toronto Schools (UTS) is an independent secondary day school affiliated with the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The school follows a specialized academic curriculum, and admission is determined by a written examination and Multiple Mini-Interviews. Two Nobel Prize laureates attended UTS.

==History==
University of Toronto Schools was founded in 1910 as a &quot;practice school&quot;, also known as a laboratory school, for the University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Education. As originally conceived and reflected in its present name, UTS was intended to be a collection of at least two schools, one of which would enroll female students. The original plan was to recruit 200 teachers and 1200 students, but financial constraints limited the number of students to 375 boys.

The school operated a junior ice hockey team during the 1910s and 1920s in the Ontario Hockey Association. The school won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as the playoffs champions in 1919, and were finalists in 1914 and 1923. The Memorial Cup was established as the junior hockey championship of Canada in 1919. The school defeated Montreal Melville by an 8–2 score in a single game playoff to qualify as the Eastern Canada representative at the 1919 Memorial Cup. They defeated the Regina Patricias in two games, by scores of 14-3 and 15–5. Memorial Cup alumnus Dunc Munro later played as a defenceman in the National Hockey League.

UTS&#x27;s first headmaster was H. J. &quot;Bull&quot; Crawford, who also taught Classics at the school. Crawford was responsible for most administrative tasks, which, until a secretary was hired in 1921, included signing admit slips. In 1925, Mike Rodden coached the UTS Rugby team to an undefeated season, culminating in the Canadian Interscholastic Championship.

In 1934, A.C. Lewis succeeded John Althouse to become the third headmaster. In 1944, W. B. &quot;Brock&quot; MacMurray, a 1924 graduate of the school, became the fourth headmaster; his 28-year term at UTS remains the longest in school history. In 1957, the House System was established, with three of four houses named after the school&#x27;s first three headmasters - Crawford, Althouse, and Lewis. The fourth house, Cody, was named after a former president of the University of Toronto.

The 1960s were a &quot;turbulent&quot; decade in the history of UTS. Prior to the 1960s, the Ontario Ministry of Education required seniors to complete a number of matriculation exams in order to graduate. The student who scored highest on the province-wide exams would be awarded the Prince of Wales Scholarship; during the matriculation era, UTS students won thirteen Prince of Wales Scholarships.

Although matriculation exams would eventually be abolished in the 1960s, UTS students had been calling for change since the late 1930s in the form of valedictory addresses and protests. Addresses in 1963 and 1966 targeted the tendency for matriculations to reduce &quot;a tangible desire for knowledge&quot;, producing instead &quot;a mind that cannot think for itself&quot;. In 1967 the valedictory address lambasted a number of teachers and administrators who had been responsible for rigidly holding UTS to its past. The speech was not published in &quot;The Twig&quot; the following year, but was still circulated among students. Discontent with the school&#x27;s inability to reform climaxed in the &quot;Protest for Nothing&quot; in May 1969, which was led by Brian Blugerman, Michael Eccles, Paul Eprile and David Glennie. Unlike most protests, the placards that the protesters held were blank; when headmaster MacMurray asked for their demands, a student famously showed him a blank sheet of paper and stated, &quot;This is a list of our demands.&quot; The protest was front-page news in Toronto newspapers and was widely reported in the U.S. media, including the New York Times.

At the turn of the decade, UTS developed a &quot;New Program&quot;, which focused on completing subjects (&quot;units&quot;) for graduation instead of matriculations. The administration also agreed to allow students to complete their secondary school requirements in 4 years instead of 5, an advantage that was enjoyed until the 2003 double cohort. The Executive Council was formed in 1968 to provide a liaison between students and staff. Some of the Executive Council&#x27;s first recommendations were implemented in 1969, including making Latin optional after grade 11 and introducing non-numerical grades for Arts and Music courses. In addition to academics, certain aspects of the school&#x27;s extracurricular traditions were gradually being phased out. In 1966, participation in the Cadet Corps, which had been a bastion of UTS tradition, became optional; in 1972, the &quot;new administration&quot; announced that the cadet corps would be discontinued. Instead, it became an &quot;open&quot; corps, severing its affiliation with the school, and continues to this day. Change was also evident in the school&#x27;s teaching staff: in the 1960s alone, 35 new teachers were hired, compared to only 15 hirings during the 1950s.

Donald Gutteridge had originally arrived in 1962 at MacMurray&#x27;s request, and had taught Grade 13 English. In 1972, Gutteridge succeeded MacMurray. Although he was the school&#x27;s fifth headmaster, he was the first to call himself a &quot;principal&quot;. During his tenure as the premier of Ontario, Bill Davis came under fire for publicly funding UTS, which Liberal education critic Tom Reed called an &quot;elitist&quot; institution. Under pressure from the provincial government and the University of Toronto, a decision was made to admit girls into the school. Two proposals were tabled: the first involved expanding the school by maintaining the same number of incoming boys, and the second involved maintaining the class size by reducing the number of incoming boys. On January 18, 1973, the University of Toronto approved the second proposal, paving the way for a co-educational UTS the following academic year.The first two co-educational cohorts totalled 70 students; each cohort was divided into two classes of 35 students. In spite of initial concerns about the watered-down quality of UTS boys athletics, the junior girls basketball team won a city title in 1978. In order to assist families in financial need, the UTS Endowment Fund was set up in 1980; in 1989, approximately $50,000 was distributed to students in need.

In April 1993, the New Democratic government of Ontario announced the withdrawal of public funding from the school, leading to a dramatic rise in tuition costs, and prompting the mobilization of all its constituencies to make up the loss.

In 2004, UTS became an ancillary unit of the University of Toronto separate from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. The school formed its own board of directors representing alumni, parents and the university administration. Throughout the 2009–2010 school year, the school celebrated its centennial year with the Kickoff celebration at Varsity Stadium and the Homecoming weekend to be held in the school itself. The centennial year also saw the introduction of its new school song, written by Nathalie Siah &#x27;10, the House Centennial spirit pennant, as well as the House Cup, awarding the House who collected the most points (athletic, literary, and spirit) over the school year.

In 2015, Anand Mahadevan, a teacher at University of Toronto Schools, was the recipient of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Awards for Teaching Excellence. In 2023, 
Isabella Liu, another teacher at University of Toronto Schools, received the Prime Minister&#x27;s Awards for Teaching Excellence in STEM.

===Relocation and redevelopment===

The University of Toronto informed UTS in 2011 that it was rejecting its proposal for a $48 million refurbishment of its facilities and that the university intended to reclaim the property at 371 Bloor Street West for its own use. UTS had been given until 2021 to find and move to new space. However, in 2014, it was announced by the chair of the UTS board of directors that the University of Toronto and UTS were negotiating to maintain an affiliation between the two institutions and keep the school at its present location but redevelop the site so that it could meet the needs of both the university and the school.

In December 2015, the University of Toronto and UTS announced a 50-year agreement that would renew the school&#x27;s official affiliation with the university, allow UTS to remain on its Bloor Street campus, redevelop 60,000 square feet of its space as well as build a 60,000 square foot addition. The redevelopment proposal included the construction of a 700-seat auditorium that functions as a university classroom, as well as a double gym, a light-filled atrium and a black box theatre. The university retained ownership of the building and land but UTS paid for construction and operating costs. The agreement was subject to approval by the university&#x27;s governing council.

In 2017, UTS began fundraising for a redevelopment of the Bloor Street campus, under a campaign title of &quot;Building the Future&quot;. The fundraising goal was $60 million. The redevelopment includes the creation of four new science labs, a media lab, an innovation lab and stunning visual arts rooms. In preparation for the redevelopment, UTS was relocated to a temporary campus at 30 Humbert St. The school remained at the Humbert Street location until the week of April 4, 2022, when it returned to its original Bloor Street campus location.

==Admissions==
Most students enter in Grade 7 through a two-stage competitive process. Prior to the admission of the class of 2014, the first stage consisted of a multiple-choice exam; those who passed this test in the top percentiles (usually 200 students) were invited back for a second written exam and an interview. However, starting with the class of 2014, the admission process consists of the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT), and for the top 170 - 190 applicants, a second exam (focused on Math and English) and an interview with multiple staff members and UTS alumni (using an MMI format). Ultimately, 96 candidates (48 boys and 48 girls) are chosen from around 350 applicants in the first-stage process each year; the typical cutoff for SSAT scores for Grade 7 entrance is in the mid to high 1900s for boys, and low 1900s for girls, depending on the applicant pool for that year. 

==Academics==
UTS is attended by students from grades 7 through 12, with 78 students per grade in classes graduating before 2001, 104 students per grade in classes graduating before 2009, and 110 in classes graduating thereafter.

UTS has enriched courses and a specialized curriculum, which are designed to challenge and educate at a higher level than at most public and many independent schools. Because potential UTS candidates are required to pass a rigorous entrance examination to attend the school, its curriculum is accelerated on the assumption that its students assimilate information faster. For this reason several higher-grade subjects are taught at lower grade levels. For example, Grade 10 students can take an enriched version of Ontario&#x27;s Grade 11 courses in introductory physics, biology, and/or chemistry and Grade 7 students take both the Ontario grade 7 curriculum and grade 8 curriculum. As well, effort is made to enrich classes with extra material and more in-depth discussions. Similarly, in some courses, Grade 8 students will take the Ontario grade 9 curriculum. 

UTS offers Advanced Placement courses, but does not have an International Baccalaureate program. In addition to the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, graduates earn a UTS Diploma, which signifies the completion of certain specialized courses and attesting to an attainment level beyond the provincial standards.

UTS&#x27;s rate of student achievement is commensurate with its selective admissions policy, both in academics and in extracurricular activities. Virtually all UTS students go on to university following graduation. The school&#x27;s alumni include 22 Rhodes Scholars and two Nobel Prize winners: chemist John Polanyi and economist Michael Spence.

<text>The Globe and Mail is a Canadian newspaper printed in five cities in western and central Canada. With a weekly readership of more than 6 million in 2024, it is Canada&#x27;s most widely read newspaper on weekdays and Saturdays, although it falls slightly behind the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in overall weekly circulation because the &quot;Star&quot; publishes a Sunday edition, whereas the &quot;Globe&quot; does not. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; is regarded by some as Canada&#x27;s &quot;newspaper of record&quot;.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s predecessors, &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot; were both established in the 19th century. The former was established in 1844, while the latter was established in 1895 through a merger of &quot;The Toronto Mail&quot; and &quot;The Empire&quot;. In 1936, &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot; merged to form &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The newspaper was acquired by FP Publications in 1965, who later sold the paper to the Thomson Corporation in 1980. In 2001, the paper merged with broadcast assets held by BCE Inc. to form the joint venture Bell Globemedia. In 2010, direct control of the newspaper was reacquired by the Thomson family through its holding company, the Woodbridge Company. The Woodbridge Company acquired BCE&#x27;s remaining stake in the newspaper in 2015.

==History==
===Predecessors and establishment===

The predecessor to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; was called &quot;The Globe&quot;; it was founded in 1844 by Scottish immigrant George Brown, who became a Father of Confederation. Brown&#x27;s liberal politics led him to court the support of the Clear Grits, a precursor to the modern Liberal Party of Canada. &quot;The Globe&quot; began in Toronto as a weekly party organ for Brown&#x27;s Reform Party, but seeing the economic gains he could make in the newspaper business, Brown soon targeted a wide audience of liberal-minded freeholders. He selected as the motto for the editorial page a quotation from Junius, &quot;The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.&quot; The quotation is carried on the editorial page to this day.

By the 1850s, &quot;The Globe&quot; had become an independent and well-regarded daily newspaper. It began distribution by railway to other cities in Ontario shortly after Confederation. At the dawn of the twentieth century, &quot;The Globe&quot; added photography, a women&#x27;s section, and the slogan &quot;Canada&#x27;s National Newspaper&quot;, which remains on its front-page banner. It began opening bureaus and offering subscriptions across Canada.

&quot;The Mail and Empire&quot; was another newspaper that served as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;″s predecessor, having been formed through a merger of two conservative newspapers, &quot;The Toronto Mail&quot; and &quot;The Empire&quot; in 1895. &quot;The Toronto Mail&quot; was established in 1872, while &quot;The Empire&quot; was founded in 1887 by Brown&#x27;s former rival, Conservative politician and then-Prime Minister John A. Macdonald.

On 23 November 1936, &quot;The Globe&quot; merged with &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot;, The merger was arranged by George McCullagh, who fronted for mining magnate William Henry Wright and became the first publisher of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Press reports at the time stated, &quot;the minnow swallowed the whale&quot; because &quot;The Globe&quot;″s circulation (at 78,000) was smaller than &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot;″s (118,000).

===1930s–1990s===
From 1937 until 1974, the newspaper was produced at the William H. Wright Building, located at then 140 King Street West on the northeast corner of King Street and York Street, close to the homes of the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; at Old Toronto Star Building at 80 King West and the Old Toronto Telegram Building at Bay and Melinda. The building at 130 King Street West was demolished in 1974 to make way for First Canadian Place.

McCullagh committed suicide in 1952, and the newspaper was sold to the Webster family of Montreal. As the paper lost ground to &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; in the local Toronto market, it began to expand its national circulation. The newspaper was unionized in 1955, under the banner of the American Newspaper Guild.

In 1965, the paper was bought by Winnipeg-based FP Publications, controlled by Bryan Maheswary, which owned a chain of local Canadian newspapers. FP put a strong emphasis on the Report on Business section that was launched in 1962, thereby building the paper&#x27;s reputation as the voice of Toronto&#x27;s business community.

The newspaper moved locations from the William H. Wright Building to 444 Front Street West in 1974. The new location had been the headquarters of the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; newspaper, built in 1963. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; remained in the building until 2016, when it relocated to the Globe and Mail Centre. The Front Street building along with the Toyota dealership next door were demolished and redeveloped as The Well.

FP Publications and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; were sold in 1980 to The Thomson Corporation, a company run by the family of Kenneth Thomson. After the acquisition, there were few changes made in editorial or news policy. However, there was more attention paid to national and international news on the editorial, op-ed, and front pages in contrast to its previous policy of stressing Toronto and Ontario material.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; has always been a morning newspaper. Since the 1980s, it has been printed in separate editions in six Canadian cities: Montreal, Toronto (several editions), Winnipeg (Estevan, Saskatchewan), Calgary and Vancouver.

Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild (SONG) employees took their first-ever strike vote at &quot;The Globe&quot; in 1982, also marking a new era in relations with the company. Those negotiations ended without a strike, and the Globe unit of SONG still has a strike-free record. SONG members voted in 1994 to sever ties with the American-focused Newspaper Guild. Shortly afterwards, SONG affiliated with the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP).

Under the editorship of William Thorsell in the 1980s and 1990s, the paper strongly endorsed the free trade policies of Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The paper also became an outspoken proponent of the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord, with their editorial the day of the 1995 Quebec Referendum mostly quoting a Mulroney speech in favour of the Accord. During this period, the paper continued to favour such socially liberal policies as decriminalizing drugs (including cocaine, whose legalization was advocated most recently in a 1995 editorial) and expanding gay rights.

In 1995, the paper launched its website, globeandmail.com; on June 9, 2000, the site began covering breaking news with its own content and journalists in addition to the content of the print newspaper.

===21st century===
Since the launch of the &quot;National Post&quot; as another English-language national paper in 1998, some industry analysts had proclaimed a &quot;national newspaper war&quot; between &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot;. Partly as a response to this threat, in 2001 &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; was combined with broadcast assets held by BCE Inc. to form the joint venture Bell Globemedia.

In 2004, access to some features of globeandmail.com became restricted to paid subscribers only. The subscription service was reduced a few years later to include an electronic edition of the newspaper, access to its archives, and membership to a premium investment site.

On April 23, 2007, the paper introduced significant changes to its print design and also introduced a new unified navigation system to its websites. The paper added a &quot;lifestyle&quot; section to the Monday-Friday editions, entitled &quot;Globe Life&quot;, which has been described as an attempt to attract readers from the rival &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Additionally, the paper followed other North American papers by dropping detailed stock listings in print and by shrinking the printed paper to 12-inch width.

At the end of 2010, the Thomson family, through its holding company Woodbridge, re-acquired direct control of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; with an 85-percent stake, through a complicated transaction involving most of the Ontario-based mediasphere. BCE continued to hold 15 percent, and would eventually own all of television broadcaster CTVglobemedia.

====2010 redesign and relaunch====
On October 1, 2010, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; unveiled redesigns to both its paper and online formats, dubbed &quot;the most significant redesign in &quot;The Globe&quot;″s history&quot; by Editor-in-Chief John Stackhouse. The paper version has a bolder, more visual presentation that features 100 per cent full-colour pages, more graphics, slightly glossy paper stock (with the use of state-of-the-art heat-set printing presses), and emphasis on lifestyle and similar sections (an approached dubbed &quot;Globe-lite&quot; by one media critic). &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; sees this redesign as a step toward the future (promoted as such by a commercial featuring a young girl on a bicycle), and a step towards provoking debate on national issues (the October 1 edition featured a rare front-page editorial above the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; banner).

The paper has made changes to its format and layout, such as the introduction of colour photographs, a separate tabloid book-review section, and the creation of the Review section on arts, entertainment, and culture. Although the paper is sold throughout Canada and has long called itself &quot;Canada&#x27;s National Newspaper&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; also serves as a Toronto metropolitan paper, publishing several special sections in its Toronto edition that are not included in the national edition. As a result, it is sometimes ridiculed for being too focused on the Greater Toronto Area, part of a wider humorous portrayal of Torontonians being blind to the greater concerns of the nation. Critics sometimes refer to the paper as the &quot;Toronto Globe and Mail&quot; or &quot;Toronto&#x27;s National Newspaper.&quot; In an effort to gain market share in Vancouver, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; began publishing a distinct west-coast edition, edited independently in Vancouver, containing a three-page section of British Columbia news. During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published a Sunday edition, marking the first time that the paper had ever published on Sunday.

====2010–present====
In October 2012, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; relaunched its digital subscription offering under the marketing brand &quot;Globe Unlimited&quot; to include metered access for some of its online content.

On September 25, 2012, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; announced it had disciplined high-profile staff columnist Margaret Wente after she admitted to plagiarism. The scandal emerged after University of Ottawa professor and blogger, Carol Wainio, repeatedly raised plagiarism accusations against Wente on her blog.

On October 22, 2012, online Canadian magazine &quot;The Tyee&quot; published an article criticizing the &quot;Globe&quot;&#x27;s &quot;advertorial&quot; policies and design. &quot;The Tyee&quot; alleged the &quot;Globe&quot; intentionally blurred the lines between advertising and editorial content in order to offer premium and effective ad space to high-paying advertisers. &quot;The Tyee&quot; reporter Jonathan Sas cited an 8-page spread in the October 2, 2012, print edition, called &quot;The Future of the Oil Sands&quot;, to illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing the spread from regular &quot;Globe&quot; content.

In 2013, The Globe and Mail ended distribution of the print edition to Newfoundland.

In 2014, then-publisher Phillip Crawley announced the recruitment of a former staffer returned from afar, David Walmsley, as Editor-in-Chief, to be enacted 24 March.

The headquarters site at 444 Front Street West was sold in 2012 to three real estate firms (RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, and Diamond Corporation) that planned to redevelop the site at Front Street West into a retail, office and residential complex. In 2016, the newspaper moved to 351 King Street East, adjacent to the former Toronto Sun Building. It now occupies five of the new tower&#x27;s 17 stories, and is named the &quot;Globe and Mail Centre&quot; under a 15-year lease.

In 2015, the Woodbridge Company acquired the remaining 15 per cent of the newspaper from BCE.

Former Minister Michael Chan filed a libel lawsuit against &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2015 for $4.55 million after the paper allegedly &quot;declined to retract their unfounded allegations&quot; suggesting that Chan was &quot;a risk to national security because of his ties to China.&quot; In August 2024, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice dismissed the case after Chan&#x27;s failure to file court documents on time.

In 2017, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; refreshed its web design with a new pattern library and faster load times on all platforms. The new website is designed to display well on mobile, tablet, and desktop, with pages that highlight journalists and newer articles. The new website has won several awards, including an Online Journalism Award. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; also launched its News Photo Archive, a showcase of more than 10,000 photos from its historic collection dedicated to subscribers. In concert with the Archive of Modern Conflict, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; digitized tens of thousands of negatives and photo prints from film, dating from 1900 to 1998, when film was last used in the newsroom.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; ended distribution of its print edition to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI on 30 November 2017.

&quot;Globe and Mail&quot; employees are represented by Unifor, whose most recent negotiations in September 2021 brought in a three-year contract set to end in 2024.

==Report on Business==
&quot;Report on Business&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;ROB&quot;, is the financial section of the newspaper. It is the most lengthy daily compilation of economic news in Canada, and is considered an integral part of the newspaper. Standard ROB sections are typically fifteen to twenty pages, and include the listings of major Canadian, U.S., and international stocks, bonds, and currencies.

Every Saturday, a special &quot;Report on Business Weekend&quot; is released, which includes features on corporate lifestyle and personal finance, and extended coverage of business news. On the last Friday of every month, the &quot;Report on Business Magazine&quot; is released, the largest Canadian finance-oriented magazine.

Business News Network (formerly ROBtv) is a twenty-four-hour news and business television station, founded by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; but operated by CTV through the companies&#x27; relationship with CTVglobemedia.

===Top 1000===

The Top 1000 is a list of Canada&#x27;s one thousand largest public companies ranked by profit released annually by the &quot;Report on Business Magazine&quot;.

==Political stance==
In the 1990s, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; was the main media vehicle for Canada&#x27;s right wing. In 2011, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter said that the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; was considered politically moderately-conservative-to-centrist and is less socially liberal than its competitor, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Winter writes that &quot;While the &quot;Globe&quot; has probably lost parts of its more conservative and corporate readership to the &quot;National Post&quot;, it continues to cater to the Canadian political and intellectual elite.&quot; According to one 2006 publication, the newspaper was considered an &quot;upmarket&quot; newspaper, in contrast to downmarket newspapers such as the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;.

In federal general elections, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; has generally endorsed right-wing parties. The paper endorsed Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservatives in 1984 and 1988. In 1993, the paper endorsed a Liberal minority government (&quot;We do not trust the Liberals to govern unguarded&quot;). Practically, the newspaper endorsed Preston Manning&#x27;s right-wing Reform Party in Ontario and West to avoid vote splitting. In 1998, the newspaper endorsed the Progressive Conservatives, and it endorsed the Liberals in 2000 and 2004. The newspaper endorsed Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative Party in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 elections; in the 2015 election, the paper again endorsed the Conservatives but called for the party&#x27;s leader, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to step down. In the 2019 federal election it did not make an endorsement.

While the paper was known as a generally conservative voice of the business establishment in the postwar decades, historian David Hayes, in a review of its positions, has noted the &quot;Globe&quot;″s editorials in this period &quot;took a benign view of hippies and homosexuals; championed most aspects of the welfare state; opposed, after some deliberation, the Vietnam War; and supported legalizing marijuana.&quot; A December 12, 1967, &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; editorial stated, &quot;Obviously, the state&#x27;s responsibility should be to legislate rules for a well-ordered society. It has no right or duty to creep into the bedrooms of the nation.&quot; On December 21, 1967, then Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau, in defending the government&#x27;s Omnibus bill and the decriminalization of homosexuality, coined the phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.&quot;

The &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In a 2017 survey conducted among Canadians, it was found that 50% of respondents viewed the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; to be biased; placing it in a tie for first place with CBC Television in terms of perceived bias. Respondents who viewed the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; as biased had mixed opinions as to whether its coverage was favourable to the Liberal Party or the Conservatives. A 2010 survey found that the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; was perceived as slightly right of centre, in similar standing to the bulk of other Canadian news organizations.

===Promotion of the Century Initiative===
&quot;Globe&quot; writers and columnists Andrew Coyne, John Ibbitson and Doug Saunders are proponents of the Century Initiative. Additionally, the &quot;Globe&quot; has devoted op-ed space to those affiliated with or sympathetic to the project. The initiative&#x27;s stated goal is to increase Canada&#x27;s population to 100 million by 2100. Canada will need to increase its annual immigration intake to make this a reality. The initiative was founded in 2009 as the Laurier Project and is backed by Dominic Barton, the former head of the consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company.

In 2021, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; launched a webcast in partnership with the Century Initiative called &quot;People and Prosperity: Planning for Canadian Growth&quot;.

<text>The National Post is a Canadian English-language broadsheet newspaper and the flagship publication of Postmedia Network. It is published Mondays through Saturdays, with Monday released as a digital e-edition only. The newspaper is distributed in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. Weekend editions of the newspaper are also distributed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

The newspaper was founded in 1998 by Conrad Black in an attempt to compete with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. In 2001, CanWest completed its acquisition of the &quot;National Post&quot;. In 2006, the newspaper ceased distribution in Atlantic Canada and the Canadian territories. Postmedia assumed ownership of the newspaper in 2010, after the CEO of the &quot;National Post&quot;″s, Paul Godfrey, assembled an ownership group to acquire CanWest&#x27;s chain of newspapers.

==History==
Conrad Black built the &quot;National Post&quot; around the &quot;Financial Post&quot;, a financial newspaper in Toronto which Hollinger Inc. purchased from Sun Media in 1997. Originally slated for an October 5, 1998 launch date, the debut of the paper was delayed until October 27 because of financial complications that stemmed from Black&#x27;s acquisition of the &quot;Financial Post&quot;, which was retained as the name of the new newspaper&#x27;s business section.

Outside Toronto, the &quot;Post&quot; was built on the printing and distribution infrastructure of Hollinger&#x27;s national newspaper chain, formerly called Southam Newspapers, that included the newspapers &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, and &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; became Black&#x27;s national flagship title, and Ken Whyte was appointed editor.

Beyond his political vision, Black attempted to compete directly with Kenneth Thomson&#x27;s media empire led in Canada by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, which Black and many others perceived as the platform of the Liberal establishment.

When the &quot;Post&quot; launched, its editorial stance was conservative. It advocated a &quot;unite-the-right&quot; movement to create a viable alternative to the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien, and supported the Canadian Alliance. The &quot;Post&quot; op-ed page has included dissenting columns by ideological liberals such as Linda McQuaig, as well as conservatives including Mark Steyn and Diane Francis, and David Frum. Original members of the &quot;Post&quot; editorial board included Ezra Levant, Neil Seeman, Jonathan Kay, Conservative Member of Parliament John Williamson and the author/historian Alexander Rose.

The &quot;Post&quot; magazine-style graphic and layout design has won awards. The original design of the &quot;Post&quot; was created by Lucie Lacava, a design consultant based in Montreal. The &quot;Post&quot; now bears the motto &quot;World&#x27;s Best-Designed Newspaper&quot; on its front page.

===21st century===
The &quot;Post&quot; was unable to maintain momentum in the market without continuing to operate with annual budgetary deficits. At the same time, Conrad Black was becoming preoccupied by his debt-heavy media empire, Hollinger International. Black divested his Canadian media holdings, and sold the &quot;Post&quot; to CanWest Global Communications Corp, controlled by Israel &quot;Izzy&quot; Asper, in two stages – 50 percent in 2000, along with the entire Southam newspaper chain, and the remaining 50 percent in 2001. CanWest Global also owned the Global Television Network.

Izzy Asper died in October 2003, and his sons Leonard and David Asper assumed control of CanWest, the latter serving as chairman of the &quot;Post&quot;. Editor-in-chief Matthew Fraser departed in 2005. Fraser&#x27;s deputy editor, Doug Kelly succeeded him as editor. Pyette departed seven months after his arrival, replaced by Gordon Fisher.

The &quot;Post&quot; limited print distribution in Atlantic Canada in 2006, part of a trend to which &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Canada&#x27;s other two papers with inter-regional distribution, have all resorted. Print editions were removed from all Atlantic Canadian newsstands except in Halifax as of 2007. Focussing further on its online publishing, in 2008, the paper suspended weekday editions and home delivery in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The reorientation towards digital continued into its next decade.

Politically, the &quot;Post&quot; has retained a conservative editorial stance, although the Asper family has long been a strong supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada. Izzy Asper was once leader of the Liberal Party in his home province of Manitoba. The Aspers had controversially dismissed the publisher of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, Russell Mills, for calling for the resignation of Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien.

However, the &quot;Post&quot; endorsed the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2004 election when Fraser was editor. The Conservatives narrowly lost that election to the Liberals. After the election, the &quot;Post&quot; surprised many of its conservative readers by shifting its support to the victorious Liberal government of prime minister Paul Martin, and was highly critical of the Conservatives and their leader, Stephen Harper. The paper switched camps again in the runup to the 2006 election (in which the Conservatives won a minority government).

Like its competitor &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot; publishes a separate edition in Toronto, Ontario, Canada&#x27;s largest city and the fourth largest English-language media centre in North America after New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. The Toronto edition includes additional local content not published in the edition distributed to the rest of Canada, and is printed at the &quot;Toronto Star Press Centre&quot; in Vaughan.

On September 27, 2007, the &quot;Post&quot; unveiled a major redesign of its appearance. Guided by Gayle Grin, the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; managing editor of design and graphics, the redesign features a standardization in the size of typeface and the number of typefaces used, cleaner font for charts and graphs, and the move of the nameplate banner from the top to the left side of Page 1 as well as each section&#x27;s front page.

In 2009, the paper announced that as a temporary cost-cutting measure, it would not print a Monday edition from July to September 2009. On October 29, 2009, Canwest Global announced that due to a lack of funding, the &quot;National Post&quot; might close down as of October 30, 2009, subject to moving the paper to a new holding company. Late on October 29, 2009, Ontario Superior Court Justice Sarah Pepall ruled in Canwest&#x27;s favour and allowed the paper to move into a holding company. Investment bankers hired by Canwest received no offers when they tried to sell the &quot;National Post&quot; earlier that year. Without a buyer closing the paper was studied, but the costs were greater than gains from liquidating assets. The lawyer for Canwest, in arguing to Justice Pepall, said the &quot;National Post&quot; added value to other papers in the Canwest chain.

In 2010, an ownership group was assembled by &quot;National Post&quot; CEO Paul Godfrey in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company&#x27;s broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from U.S. private-equity firm Golden Tree Asset Management as well as other investors. The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010, forming the Postmedia Network. The company&#x27;s shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011. On October 28, 2011, the &quot;Post&quot; announced its first ever yearly profit. In 2016, Chatham Asset Management acquired a 66 per cent stake in the Postmedia Network, resulting in the reduction in their staff, including a third of the National Post&#x27;s editorial staff.

In 2024, the &quot;National Post&quot; published two articles in which it advocated for the Russian documentary film &quot;Russians at War&quot;. The first article by columnist Chris Selley introduced the claim that this film showed the human face of the Russians and was therefore banned. This statement was later used by the magazine &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; and other media to which cinematographer Anastasia Trofimova gave interviews to defend her film after it had been banned from the Zurich film festival. In the second article by Chris Knight, &quot;Russian-Canadian filmmaker battles attempts to suppress controversial film as Ukraine launches probe&quot;, the idea was taken further, claiming a Ukrainian campaign against the film, whereas in reality the film was widely criticized by the international press and others.

==Facilities==

The &quot;National Post&quot;″s main office is at 365 Bloor Street East in Toronto, Ontario. It was formerly located at 1450 Don Mills Road in the Don Mills neighbourhood of Toronto, which was vacated in 2012.

The newspaper is published at Postmedia&#x27;s Islington Printing Plant in Toronto&#x27;s Rexdale neighbourhood, along with the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, &quot;London Free Press&quot; and various Postmedia and Metroland-owned weekly newspapers. The newspaper was previously printed at the Toronto Star Press Centre in Vaughan, Ontario, until the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; closed the site.

== Criticism ==
===2006 Iran hoax===
On May 19, 2006, the newspaper ran two pieces alleging that the Iranian parliament had passed a law requiring religious minorities to wear special identifying badges. One piece was a front-page news item titled &quot;Iran Eyes Badges For Jews&quot; accompanied by a 1935 picture of two Jews bearing Nazi-ordered yellow badges. Later on the same day, experts began coming forward to deny the accuracy of the &quot;Post&quot; story. The story proved to be false, but not before it had been picked up by a variety of other news media and generated comment from world leaders. Comments on the story by the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused Iran to summon Canada&#x27;s ambassador to Tehran, Gordon E. Venner, for an explanation.

On May 24, 2006, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Doug Kelly, published an apology for the story on page 2, admitting that it was false and the &quot;National Post&quot; had not exercised enough caution or checked enough sources.

===Accusation of anti-Islam sentiment===
From 1998 to 2014, the now defunct Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) had been actively monitoring media coverage for anti-Muslim or anti-Islam sentiment and had issued reports highlighting its findings. It had opposed the use of phrases such as &quot;Islamic guerrillas,&quot; &quot;Islamic insurgency&quot; and &quot;Muslim militants&quot; saying that terms like &quot;militant&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; should be used without a religious association &quot;since no religion teaches or endorses terrorism, militancy or extremism.&quot; The Congress had singled out the &quot;National Post&quot;, saying the paper &quot;consistently is No. 1&quot; as an anti-Islam media outlet.

===Allegations of bias===
A 2017 survey of Canadians found that the &quot;National Post&quot; was perceived to be middle-of-the-pack for bias among national news outlets (perceived biased by 48 per cent of Canadians overall). A 2010 Ipsos survey commissioned by CBC found that 38% of respondents believed the &quot;Post&quot; leaned to the right or far right.

The advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East has accused the &quot;Post&quot; of pro-Israel bias for publishing articles from the Jewish News Syndicate which it describes as &quot;a mouthpiece for the Israeli military&quot;.

===Climate change coverage===
In a 2021 academic study on the presentation of the subject of climate change in 17 mainstream media outlets in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the &quot;National Post&quot; came out as the worst in terms of its misrepresentation of the scientific consensus on the impact of anthropogenic climate change. The &quot;National Post&quot; was found to represent scientific consensus only 70.83% of the time—noting the significant contribution of anthropogenic climate change—while 9.17% of the time it presented anthropogenic climate change and natural climatic variance as equally relevant, and 20% of the time presented anthropogenic climate change as a negligible phenomena.

=== Institute for Canadian Values ad Controversy ===

On September 24, 2011, the newspaper ran an advertisement paid for by the Institute for Canadian Values (ICV) which was hosted by Canada Christian College. The advertisement argued against the teaching of LGBTQ-related sex education topics in the Ontario school curriculum, and was criticized for alleged discrimination against transsexual, transgender, intersex, and two-spirited people. Following the controversy, the &quot;National Post&quot; apologized for the advertisement on September 30 and withdrew the ad from circulation.

<text>Mameluke (foaled 1948) was an American Thoroughbred race horse. Bred and raced by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, he was out of the mare, Schwester, and was sired by the 1936 Epsom Derby winner, Mahmoud who became the Leading sire in North America in 1946 and the Leading broodmare sire in North America in 1957.

Ridden by jockey Raymond Adair, and trained by Sylvester Veitch, Mameluke won a division of the 1951 Blue Grass Stakes but in that year&#x27;s Kentucky Derby, the horse slowed badly before being pulled up sore and finishing last.

In 1952, Mameluke won the Metropolitan Handicap and ran third in the Suburban Handicap.

<doc id="234346" wikidata="Q1457040" url="?curid=234346" title="Puerto Rico (board game)">
<text>Puerto Rico is a Euro-style board game designed by German designer Andreas Seyfarth and published in 2002 in a German-language edition by Alea. Players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico during the age of Caribbean ascendancy. &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; was the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek for over five years, until it was surpassed by &quot;Agricola&quot;. The aim of the game is to amass victory points in two ways: by exporting goods and by constructing buildings.

&quot;Puerto Rico&quot; can be played by three, four or five players, although an official two-player variant also exists. There is an official expansion released in 2004, which adds new buildings with different abilities that can replace or be used alongside those in the original game. A second, smaller expansion became available in 2009. Additionally, changes to the rules have been suggested that serve to balance the game.

==Gameplay==
Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons (money).

The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.

During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player who selected the role acts first and also receives a small privilege - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Roles that have already been selected earlier in a round are not available to be selected again. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.

The available roles are as follows:

Settler: Each player in turn order may select one of the plantation tiles available in the central offer and add it to their personal player board. The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players.

Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, &quot;violet buildings&quot; grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game.

Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger.

Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type.

Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases.

Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player &quot;must&quot; ship a good if able to, and &quot;must&quot; ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply.

Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round.

Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.

Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player&#x27;s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.

===Game balance variants===
The following changes may be made to the official rules in order to create what some players believe is a more balanced game giving each player a more equal chance of winning:

# The prices of the Factory and University buildings may be swapped, such that the Factory costs 8 doubloons and the university costs 7 doubloons. In a private conversation, the designer Andreas Seyfarth said he would make this change.
# In a forum on BoardGameGeek, some players have suggested that players starting with a corn plantation should start with 1 doubloon fewer than players who start with an indigo plantation.

===Ending===
The game can end in three different ways:
# Mayor is selected and there are not enough colonists to refill the colonist ship with the appropriate number.
# Captain is selected and the last VP chip is given to a player. (Additional chips are to be used during that round, once the supply is exhausted.)
# Builder is selected and a player has built out their 12th city space, thus having no room left to build.

In each case, players finish the current round before the game ends.

A player&#x27;s total score is calculated by adding the number on each of their victory chips, the building value of all of their buildings, and the bonus points from large buildings. Manned large buildings award bonus points based on various game conditions (such as the Fortress, which gives one victory point for every three colonists on the player board, or the City Hall, which awards a point for every small or large violet building owned by the player).

The winner is the player with the most victory points. In the event of a tie, the player with the most total goods added to doubloons is given the tie-breaker. If a tie still exists between players, they tie.

=== Two-player variant ===
&quot;Puerto Rico&quot; was released as a 3-5 player game but later received an official two-player variant from Alea. The two-player game is played with one Prospector, and in each round both players select three roles, before a doubloon is added to the seventh role and the Governor tile switches sides. Some players prefer to instead play with just five roles being selected each round - three for the Governor and two for the non-Governor - so that players never have the ability to select twice in a row and pull off powerful combos (like Craftsman/Trader).

==Strategy==
There are two primary strategies used in Puerto Rico, corresponding to the two means of earning victory points (VP). One strategy, often called the &#x27;shipping strategy&#x27;, is to attempt a high level of goods production, and to ship those goods back to the homeland for points. Corn is produced free and indigo has a low investment cost, therefore these goods are commonly chosen when this strategy is used because all exports are valued the same. The major disadvantage of this strategy is that doubloons are harder to acquire, and thus buildings are harder to build.

The other major strategy is to produce crops that are worth more (i.e. tobacco and coffee), and to use the cash produced from selling/trading to buy more buildings that also give new abilities. Expensive buildings can give a player many victory points, but fewer goods are likely to be shipped to the homeland, and so the VPs from exports can be expected to be low. In filling all their building spaces, a player can cause the game to end relatively quickly, before players using the &#x27;shipping strategy&#x27; can capitalise on their investment in buildings and crops that increase shipment VPs.

There are also many minor strategies that play on the nuances of how the buildings interact.

==Expansions and online versions==
In January 2004, Alea released an official expansion to &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;. The addition consists of 14 new buildings that may be used alongside of, or instead of, the original 17.

In February 2004, Seyfarth released a separate card game called &quot;San Juan&quot; for two, three or four players. It is based on &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; and published by the same companies, following the same art style and making use of some of the same buildings and resources.

A second expansion was under development, but it was later announced that it was cancelled. Instead, a different, but inclusive, expansion is included in the Alea 10th anniversary &#x27;treasure chest&#x27; released in 2009, which contains expansions for a number of different games by the company. The Puerto Rico expansions included consist of the original expansion, as well as a small expansion of several new buildings and red &#x27;nobleman&#x27; colonists, which interact with the new buildings. An English language translation of the new expansion was released at the end of 2009 by Rio Grande Games.

A playable online version is available, and, as of January 2017, 660,000 games had been played this way. An iPad version was launched in August 2011.

== Criticism ==
While &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; was highly reviewed upon its initial release in 2002, it has come under renewed attention since then for its core premise of colonialism.

In 2011, Jarrah E. Hodge at Bitch Media observed that &quot;&quot;Puerto Rico&quot; is sanitized of all references to the exploitation of African slaves on plantations, or the indigenous Taino inhabitants of the island, who were virtually wiped out by the Spanish colonists.&quot;

In 2017, Sam Desatoff at &quot;Vice&quot; magazine wrote &quot;It feels disrespectful for Seyfarth to disregard slavery so completely. By using slavery as a gameplay mechanic without acknowledging the human cost of it (or even using its name directly), by rendering the institution to a mere tool, the true costs of running your economic engine are ignored. It almost seems to uncritically adopt the slavers&#x27; mindset, without any self-awareness. The effect is to make players gathered around a table for a game of Puerto Rico into unwitting moral accomplices in the horrors of human servitude.&quot;

Academics Cornel Borit, Melania Borit, and Petter Olsen discussed &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; in a study of colonialism in popular board games in 2018. &quot;In &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, the indigenous population is completely absent. The world is populated only by colonists who arrive from the metropolitan centres by ship and settle into the new world with the support of the administrator (i.e. the Mayor), fitting into the freshly colonised society in accordance with labour force needs. Thus, the subaltern, who, from a historical point of view, had inhabited the Greater Antilles prior to colonisation, is excluded from the re-enactment of this colonial reality. To use Spivak’s critical parlance, it has no voice within the simulated historical world of the game.&quot;

Philosophy professor Stephanie Partridge wrote of &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; in 2019: &quot;Still, even those of us who are fairly good at seeing the connection between some games and our collective, colonialist past and present tend to find ourselves bracketing such concerns for the sake of gameplay. (Honestly, we probably pull in and out of the gameplay as the incorrigible social meanings impress themselves on us more or less, depending on what game activity we are carrying out). How many of us have carried on playing &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; or &quot;(Settlers of) Catan&quot; as if there are no indigenous peoples present in our fictionalized colonial world to “mess it up” — a &quot;terra nullius&quot; fantasy &quot;—&quot; or bracketing the (abstracted) exploitation or even enslavement of indigenous peoples. Our tendency to bracket, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t legitimate objections to such colonialist-themed games. It suggests that we have subjectively made an internal calculation about how egregious we think that the representational offense is and whether it is “worth it” to criticize the collective ludic activity of our friends.&quot;

<doc id="234351" wikidata="Q765192" url="?curid=234351" title="Further education">
<text>Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland is additional education to that received at secondary school that is distinct from the higher education (HE) offered in universities and other academic institutions. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. FE colleges may also offer HE qualifications such as HNC, HND, foundation degree or PGCE. The colleges are also a large service provider for apprenticeships where most of the training takes place at the apprentices&#x27; workplace, supplemented with day release into college.

FE in the United Kingdom is usually a means to attain an intermediate, advanced or follow-up qualification necessary to progress into HE, or to begin a specific career path outside of university education. Further Education is offered to students aged over 16 at colleges of Further Education, through work-based learning, or adult and community learning institutions.

== By country ==
=== United Kingdom ===

==== England ====

Provision for further education colleges was laid out in sections 41 to 47 of the Education Act 1944; their role was to offer &quot;full-time and part-time education&quot; and &quot;leisure-time occupation&quot; for persons over compulsory school age. In the 1960s, A-level students predominantly studied at school rather than colleges (often referred to as &quot;techs&quot; at that time). More types of colleges were introduced over the next decades, and by 1990 colleges took in almost half of A-level students.

Colleges in England are corporate bodies under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which removed further education colleges from local government control. Types of college include:
* General further education colleges
* Sixth form colleges
* Tertiary colleges
* Land-based colleges (e.g. agricultural specialisms)
* Specialist designated colleges (e.g. working men&#x27;s clubs)
* Art, design and performing art colleges

Policies relating to colleges are primarily the responsibility of the Department for Education (DfE). Until July 2016, colleges were also covered by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS); on the abolition of BIS and formation of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), responsibility for FE colleges moved to DfE. The regulatory body for sixth form colleges was already DfE prior to the 2016 changes.

Following the merger of the Education Funding Agency and the Skills Funding Agency in 2017, funding for colleges is provided through the Education and Skills Funding Agency for all further education students.In 2018/19, colleges&#x27; income totalled £6.5 billion, of which £5.1 billion (78%) was public funding. Most college funding follows the learner. Colleges must attract students, competing with each other and with other types of education and training provider. Colleges can borrow commercially, own assets, employ staff and enter into contracts, and they may make financial surpluses or deficits.

The Technical and Further Education Act 2017 laid out a framework for an insolvency regime for further education colleges known as &quot;Education Administration&quot;. This is a form of corporate administration adapted to the needs of further education, to be used &quot;where a further education body is unable to pay its debts or is likely to become unable to pay its debts&quot; and intended &quot;to avoid or minimise disruption to the studies of the existing students of the further education body as a whole&quot;. Education administrators were appointed to run Hadlow College and West Kent College in 2019.

All colleges and FE providers are subject to inspection by Ofsted, which monitors the quality of provision in publicly funded institutions in England. Membership organisations for providers include the Association of Colleges and the Sixth Form Colleges&#x27; Association.

In 2020, the government allocated £200 million for repairs and upgrades of FE college buildings, subject to a degree of matched funding by the colleges, and the Department for Education is allocating this to colleges via the Further Education Capital Transformation Fund (FECTF). Sixteen colleges with sites in poor condition have been selected, and detailed proposals were invited for submission before October 2021, for projects which can be completed by December 2024.

==== Northern Ireland ====
Further education in Northern Ireland is provided through seven multi-campus colleges. Northern Ireland&#x27;s Department for Employment and Learning has the responsibility for providing FE in the province.

*Belfast Metropolitan College
*North West Regional College
*Northern Regional College
*South Eastern Regional College
*South West College
*Southern Regional College

Most secondary schools also provide a sixth form scheme whereby a student can choose to attend for two additional years to complete their AS and A-levels.

==== Scotland ====
Scotland&#x27;s further education colleges provide education for those young people who follow a vocational route after the end of compulsory education at age 16. They offer a wide range of vocational qualifications to young people and older adults, including vocational, competency-based qualifications (previously known as SVQs), Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. Frequently, the first two years of higher education – usually in the form of an HND – are taken in an FE college, followed by attendance at university.

==== Wales ====
Further education in Wales is provided through:

* Sixth form colleges
* FE colleges
* Sixth forms within secondary schools

Further education in Wales comes under the remit of the Welsh Assembly Government. Funding came from Education and Learning Wales from 2000 until 2006, when that organisation was merged with the Assembly.

===Republic of Ireland ===

Further education in the Republic of Ireland is similar to that offered in the UK. Typical areas include apprenticeships and other vocational qualifications in many disciplines, such as childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. The many types of further education awards are known as Post Leaving Certificates.

Further education has expanded immensely in recent years, helped by the institutions and their relationships with their communities. Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), which was established in November 2012, is the regulator for FE qualifications.

<doc id="234352" wikidata="Q939680" url="?curid=234352" title="Palladas">
<text>Palladas (; fl. 4th century AD) was a Greek poet, who lived in Alexandria, Egypt.

== Life ==
All that is known about Palladas has been deduced from his 151 epigrams preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; (&quot;Anthologia graeca&quot;); another twenty-three appear in that collection under his name, but his authorship is suspect. His poems describe the persona of a pagan schoolteacher resigned to life in a Christian city, and bitter about his quarrelsome wife.

== Works ==
One of the epigrams attributed to him on the authority of Maximus Planudes is a eulogy on the celebrated Hypatia, daughter of Theon of Alexandria, whose death took place in 415. Another was, according to a &quot;scholium&quot; in the Palatine Manuscript (the most important source for our knowledge of Greek epigram), written in the reign of the joint emperors Valentinian and Valens (364–375). A third epigram on the destruction of Beirut (&quot;Anth. Gr.&quot; 9.27) suggests an alternative chronology dating Palladas&#x27; activity to the age of Constantine the Great. It is based on his edition of a papyrus codex that arrived from a private collection to the Beinecke Library at Yale University in 1996. Some of his arguments in favor of this new chronology have, however, been called into question.An anonymous epigram (&quot;Anth. Gr.&quot; 9.380) speaks of Palladas as having a high poetical reputation. However, Isaac Casaubon dismisses him in two contemptuous words as &quot;versificator insulsissimus&quot; (&quot;a most coarse poet&quot;). John William Mackail concurs with Casaubon, writing that &quot;this is true of a great part of his work, and would perhaps be true of it all but for the savage indignation which kindles his verse, not into the flame of poetry, but to a dull red heat.&quot;

There is little direct allusion in his epigrams to the struggle against the onslaught of Christianity. One epigram speaks obscurely of the destruction of the &quot;idols&quot; of Alexandria popular in the archiepiscopate of Theophilus in 389; another in even more enigmatic language (&quot;Anth. Gr.&quot; 10.90) seems to be a bitter attack on the doctrine of the Resurrection; and a scornful couplet against the swarms of Egyptian monks might have been written by a Reformer of the 16th century. For the most part his sympathy with the Greco-Roman pagan tradition is only betrayed in his despondency over all things. But it is in his criticism of life that the power of Palladas lies; with a remorselessness like that of Jonathan Swift he tears the coverings from human frailty and holds it up in its meanness and misery. The lines on the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; (&quot;Anth. Gr.&quot; 10.45), fall as heavily on the Neo-Platonic martyr as on the Christian persecutor, and remain even now among the most mordant and crushing sarcasms ever passed upon mankind.

=== &quot;A Question of Gender&quot; ===
This translation omits the epigram&#x27;s explicit reference to the role of grammar and thus grammatical gender in thought. Compare: &quot;A grammarian’s daughter made love and then bore/A masculine and feminine and neuter child.&quot; 

The epigram&#x27;s reference to the generative role of grammar underscores how the epigram is &quot;likely quite dark: [the daughter] gave birth to twins (a boy and a girl) and at least one of them died thus giving the three declensions.&quot;

== Date ==
Mackail groups Palladas to the same period with Aesopus and Glycon, each the author of a single epigram in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;. All three belong to the age of the Byzantine translators, when infinite pains were taken to rewrite well-known poems or passages in different metres, by turning Homer into elegiacs or iambics, and recasting pieces of Euripides or Menander as epigrams.

<doc id="234353" wikidata="Q4754200" url="?curid=234353" title="Anderson Township, Ohio">
<text>Anderson Township is a township located southeastern Hamilton County along the Ohio and Little Miami Rivers, approximately 13 miles southeast of downtown Cincinnati. The population was 44,088 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Anderson Township&#x27;s earliest settlement came in 1788, when pioneer Benjamin Stites settled near the mouth of the Little Miami River. The treaty of Easton forbade entering Ohio. but because England had been run out in the Revolutionary War, the local natives did not know treaty was void. The township was organized in 1793 as part of the Virginia Military District and was bounded by the Ohio and Little Miami Rivers, and the mouth of the Eight Mile Creek to the east. The township was important during its early days as the site of Flinn&#x27;s Ford, the southernmost crossing of the Little Miami River. Anderson Township remained mainly undeveloped forest and agricultural land until post-World War II suburbanization brought new infrastructure to the community. The population grew by an average of 1,000 persons per year from the 1950s through the early 1990s bringing massive residential and commercial developments to the area. Anderson Township is named for Richard Clough Anderson Sr., Virginia&#x27;s chief surveyor when the township was created.

Anderson Township became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 2009.

==Geography==
Located in the southeastern corner of the county, the township is bounded by the Ohio River to the south and the Little Miami River to the north and east. The western border does not follow any land or water feature but is instead defined by a straight line extending due south from the confluence of the Little Miami River&#x27;s East Fork and main channels. Land to the east of this border belongs to Clermont County. Municipal divisions that share a border with Anderson Township include all of the following:
*Linwood, Mt. Washington, East End, and California (all constituent neighborhoods of Cincinnati) to the west.
*Mariemont to the northwest.
*Plainville (officially part of Columbia Township) to the north.
*Terrace Park to the northeast
*Summerside, Mt. Carmel, and Tobasco (all, officially, of Union Township, Clermont County) to the east.
*Locust Grove (officially, Pierce Township, Clermont County) to the southeast.
*Campbell County, Kentucky to the south and southwest.

Other municipalities and subdivisions of note that neighbor the township not directly, but by proximity of one-eighth of a mile or less, include Mt. Lookout, Hyde Park, Fairfax, and Milford.

Also of note is the fact that Anderson&#x27;s nearest neighbors to the west, Mt. Washington and California, are functionally exclaves of the City of Cincinnati, as they are impossible to reach via land or water without crossing into territory administered by Anderson Township (which controls the Little Miami River as it exists within Hamilton County).

Where California occupies the side of the Little Miami opposite the city at its delta, Mt. Washington (just barely) achieves its connection to California via a narrow terrestrial tract of land that spans approximately . It features no public or private road and is made up of at least ten private land parcels, all accessed via Anderson. Exactly whose historical interests were served by this arrangement is the subject of irregular dispute, but the lack of precedent for these irregular borders has attracted local criticism in the near and distant past alike.

Anderson Township includes the following census-designated places:
*Cherry Grove
*Coldstream
*Dry Run
*Forestville
*Fruit Hill
*Salem Heights
*Sherwood
*Turpin Hills

The township is composed of of rolling hills with steep, wooded hillsides leading down to the Little Miami and Ohio rivers. As of 1990, 36% of Anderson Township had been developed into suburban communities for Cincinnati, 13% into farmland, and the remainder being left as woodland.

<text>Colerain Township is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population of the township was 59,037 at the 2020 census. It is the second-largest township in Ohio by area, surpassed by Madison Township, Lake County, Ohio.

==Name and history==
Statewide, other Colerain Townships are located in Belmont and Ross counties. The village of Colerain was laid out in 1790 by surveyor John Dunlap, who was Scots-Irish and a native of the town Coleraine, in County Londonderry, Ireland. Fort Coleraine, aka Dunlap&#x27;s Station, was one of the earliest attempts to settle the area despite the natives who had resided here for centuries without signing any land treaties.

The township was organized in 1794.

==Geography==
Located in the northern part of the county, it borders the following townships and cities:
*Ross Township, Butler County - north
*Fairfield - northeast
*Springfield Township - east
*Forest Park - east, between sections of Springfield Township
*Cincinnati - southeast
*Green Township - south
*Miami Township - southwest
*Whitewater Township - west
*Crosby Township - northwest

The only municipality in Colerain Township is a small part of the city of North College Hill in the far southeast, but ten census-designated places occupy most of the township in the east
*Dry Ridge, in the center, north of Northgate
*Dunlap, in the north
*Groesbeck, in the southeast, north of White Oak
*Mount Healthy Heights, in the northeast, south of Pleasant Run
*Northbrook, in the east
*Northgate, in the center
*Pleasant Run, in the northeast
*Skyline Acres, in the southeast, also in bordering Springfield Township
*Taylor Creek, in the southwest
*White Oak, in the southeast. White Oak is situated in both Colerain and Green Townships.
The unincorporated communities of White Oak, Groesbeck, Northbrook, and Northgate are all within the township. White Oak is unique in its geography, in that it is part in Colerain Township and part in Green Township to the south.

The township is composed of 42.9 sq mi (111 km) of gentle wooded hills separating the Mill Creek and Great Miami River basins, sloping down to the flood plain of the Miami. The terrain generally rises toward the north of the township. As of 1990, 29% of the township&#x27;s land had been urbanized, and 15% developed as agricultural property, while half remained as woodlands. The township is crossed by Interstates 74 and 275, while the main north–south artery is Colerain Avenue (U.S. Route 27).

<doc id="234356" wikidata="Q507036" url="?curid=234356" title="Lucius Annaeus Cornutus">
<text>Lucius Annaeus Cornutus () was a Stoic philosopher who flourished in the reign of Nero (c. 60 AD), when his house in Rome was a school of philosophy.

==Life==
Cornutus was a native of Leptis Magna in Libya, but resided for the most part in Rome. He is best known as the teacher and friend of Persius, whose fifth satire is addressed to him, as well as other distinguished students, such as Claudius Agathemerus. &quot;Through Cornutus Persius was introduced to Annaeus, as well as to Lucan, who was of his own age, and also a disciple of Cornutus&quot;. At Persius&#x27;s death, Cornutus returned to Persius&#x27; sisters a bequest made to him, but accepted Persius&#x27; library of some 700 scrolls. He revised the deceased poet&#x27;s satires for publication, but handed them over to Caesius Bassus to edit, at the special request of the latter.

Among Persius&#x27;s satires were lines that, as Suetonius records, &quot;even lashed Nero himself, who was then the reigning prince. The verse ran as follows:
: (King Midas has an ass&#x27;s ears)

but Cornutus altered it to:
: Who has not an ass&#x27;s ears?

in order that it might not be supposed that it was meant to apply to Nero.&quot;

Annaeus Cornutus was banished by Nero neverthelessin 66 or 68 ADfor having indirectly disparaged the emperor&#x27;s projected history of the Romans in heroic verse, after which time nothing more is heard of him.

==Writings==
He was the author of various rhetorical works in both Greek and Latin, such as . Excerpts from his treatise are preserved in Cassiodorus. A commentary on Virgil is frequently quoted by Servius, but tragedies mentioned by Suetonius have not survived.

Cornutus wrote a work on &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, and a commentary on the &quot;Categories of Aristotle&quot;, () whose philosophy he attacked along with his fellow Stoic Athenodorus. He also wrote a work called &quot;On Properties&quot; ().

===&quot;Compendium of Greek Theology&quot;===
His one major surviving work, the philosophical treatise, (&quot;Compendium of Greek Theology&quot;) is a manual of &quot;popular mythology as expounded in the etymological and symbolical interpretations of the Stoics&quot;. This early example of a Roman educational treatise, provided an account of Greek mythology on the bases of highly elaborated etymological readings. Cornutus sought to recover the earliest beliefs that primitive people had about the world by examining the various names and titles of the gods. The result, to modern eyes, is often bizarre, with many forced etymologies, as can be seen from the opening paragraph, where Cornutus describes Heaven ():
The Heaven [], my boy, encompasses round about the earth and the sea and everything both on the earth and the sea. On this account it has acquired its appellation, since it is an &quot;upper limit&quot; [] of all things and &quot;marks of the bounds&quot; [] of nature. Some say, however, that it is called Heaven [] from its &quot;looking after&quot; [] or &quot;tending to&quot; [] things, that is, from its guarding them, from which also &quot;doorkeeper&quot; [] and &quot;watching carefully&quot; [] are named. Still others derive its etymology from its &quot;being seen above&quot; []. Together with everything it encompasses, it is called the &quot;world&quot; [] from its being &quot;so beautifully ordered&quot; []
The book continues in a similar vein, proceeding from such gods as Zeus, Hera, Cronus, and Poseidon, to the Furies, Fates, Muses, and Graces. The work is pervaded throughout with a strong undercurrent of Stoic Physics.

We are told that the world has a soul that preserves it called Zeus who dwells in Heaven whose substance is fiery. Zeus is the power that pervades everything, and who assigns Fate to each person. The gods have sent us Reason (), which does not work evil, but which is part of the divine Reason of the universe:
&quot;Ocean&quot; is the that &quot;glides swiftly&quot; and changes continuously, whereas Tethys is the stability of the qualities. For from their blending or mixing come about those things that exist; and nothing would exist if either one unmixed gained the upper hand over the other.

===Spurious works===
&quot;Scholia&quot; to Persius are also attributed to Annaeus Cornutus; the latter, however, are of much later date, and are assigned by Jahn to the Carolingian period. The so-called &quot;Disticha Cornuti&quot; belong to the Late Middle Ages.

In 1891, Johannes Graeven proposed that an anonymous rhetorical treatise (the &quot;Anonymous Seguerianus&quot;) written in the 3rd century was written by a Cornutus. This attribution has not been generally accepted and, in any case, would refer to a later Cornutus.

<text>Columbia Township is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, USA. The 2020 census found 4,446 people living in the township. Initially one of Ohio&#x27;s largest townships by area at its inception in 1791, it gradually shrank to one of the smallest by the early 1950s due to annexations by the City of Cincinnati, Norwood, Silverton, the Villages of Fairfax, Indian Hill, Mariemont and others.

==History==
Columbia Township is named after the Columbia settlement, which Benjamin Stiles founded in 1788 as part of the Ohio Company of Associates&#x27; expansion from the Allegheny Mountains westward. This settlement represents the earliest recorded white settlement in the ancestral territory of the Native American, Shawnee people. Columbia is located in the historical Miami Valley, near Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport and now part of Cincinnati&#x27;s Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood. Statewide, other Columbia Townships are located in Lorain and Meigs counties.

Columbia Township was formed in 1791, a year after Hamilton County was organized, when the court of general quarter sessions of the peace divided the southern part of the county into Columbia, Cincinnati, and Miami townships, each extending from the Ohio River north, past the present-day Butler County line. Each township was assigned a standard cattle brand; historians have considered Columbia Township to be the county&#x27;s first township; on account of being issued cattle brand &quot;A&quot;. The township&#x27;s boundaries were defined as

Columbia Township was one of the largest townships in Ohio, larger than some present-day counties. The three townships included virtually all the white residents of the Symmes Purchase; in the midst of the Northwest Indian War, battles often small-scale, tit-for-tat series of armed skirmishes that pitted Indigenous Native American tribes against white settlers and the United States military continued until the Treaty of Greenville.

The township gradually shrank as Hamilton County&#x27;s population grew. In 1795, upon the signing of the Treaty of Greenville, the court of general quarter sessions of the peace created Deerfield and Dayton townships out of the northern reaches of Columbia Township. In 1803, the county commissioners created Sycamore Township from the northern half of Columbia Township and, in turn, created Symmes Township from Sycamore Township&#x27;s eastern half between 1820 and 1826. In the early 1840s, Spencer Township was carved out of the southwestern part of Columbia Township.

In 1861, the United States Army built Camp Dennison on in the northeastern corner of the township.

In 1876, Madisonville became the first village to incorporate within the township, followed by Norwood in 1881, Pleasant Ridge in 1891, and Terrace Park in 1893. The township&#x27;s population grew further as the Cincinnati Street Railway extended lines further into the suburbs between 1890 and 1910. Cincinnati annexed Madisonville, Pleasant Ridge, Oakley, and Kennedy Heights between 1911 and 1914.

From the 1920s, car ownership spurred additional growth in the southwestern corner of the township. Mariemont was developed as a car-centric community in 1922. The completion of Columbia Parkway in 1938 caused Cincinnati to annex surrounding unincorporated land, leading Indian Hill and Mariemont to incorporate as villages in 1941, followed by Fairfax in 1951. Unlike in other parts of Ohio, most villages in southwestern Ohio withdrew from their surrounding townships via paper townships, reducing the township to one of the smallest in Ohio by the early 1950s. One exception was Fairfax, which only withdrew on January 1, 2010, due in part to city residents&#x27; low tax contribution compared to their influence on township elections.

Columbia Township invested $75,000 through its partnership to support Mariemont&#x27;s development of the next segment of the Murray Path extension, a rail trail. In 2021 the path was extended to Columbia&#x27;s Plainville Business District and historic Madison Place neighborhood.

==Land Parcels==
Located in the eastern part of Hamilton County, Ohio, the township currently consists of eight disconnected parcels:

# Ridge &amp; Highland/Red Bank is the largest parcel in the township. Its western part contains several big-box stores, its central part mainly contains a segment of Interstate 71, and its eastern part contains a few residential subdivisions. It is mainly surrounded by the Cincinnati neighborhoods of Kennedy Heights, Pleasant Ridge, and Madisonville, but is bordered by Silverton and Madeira to the northeast.
# Norwood Green is the westernmost parcel, mainly of Fenwick Park. It is bordered by Norwood to the south and Pleasant Ridge in Cincinnati to the north.
# Ridgewood contains a residential subdivision. It is bordered by Amberley to the north and east, Pleasant Ridge in Cincinnati to the south, and Golf Manor to the west.
# The Stewart Road Area is the northernmost parcel, containing residences. It borders Sycamore Township on the north, Madeira to the east, and Silverton to the west
# The Camargo Road Area is mostly wooded with a few residences on its eastern fringe. It is bordered by Madeira to the north, Indian Hill to the east, and Madisonville in Cincinnati to the west.
# Madison Place covers two parcels each of which is a residential subdivision. These border Indian Hill to the east, Madisonville in Cincinnati to the west, and Mariemont to the south.
# Plainville is a parcel that stretches along the northern bank of the Little Miami River; it contains a commercial district and some residential subdivisions in its central portion but is otherwise mainly undeveloped. It borders Fairfax to the west, Mariemont and Indian Hill to the north, Terrace Park to the east, and Anderson Township to the south.
# Camp Dennison, the northeasternmost parcel, is mostly wooded but contains a public works facility of the Village of Indian Hill. It is bordered by the separate Camp Dennison CDP in Symmes Township to the north, Miami Township, Clermont County to the east, Milford to the south, and Indian Hill to the west.

The former extent of Columbia Township is now primarily occupied by the following municipalities:

Some of the remaining township lands, which cover only about 2.5 sq mi (6 km), are unsuitable for development, especially along the banks of the Little Miami River.

The Ohio Revised Code establishes the laws governing the township. The township is overseen by a board of trustees consisting of three members, elected during the general election in November of odd-numbered years for a four-year term that begins on January 1 of the following year. Two trustees are elected the year after the presidential election, while one trustee is elected the year prior to it.

An elected township fiscal officer serves a four-year term that begins on April 1 of the year following the presidential election. The general election for the fiscal officer takes place in November of the year before the presidential election.

The township&#x27;s board of trustees has the authority to appoint a township administrator, a role that Columbia Township utilizes. The township administrator serves as the head of the township&#x27;s administration, operating under the board’s direction and supervision. It is important to note that this position is not elected.

In the event of vacancies on the board of trustees, fiscal officer, or township administrator, the board of trustees may appoint a qualified individual to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term or until a successor is elected. 

===Joint Economic Development Zone (JEDZ) ===
On November 5, 2013, the residents of Columbia Township voted to establish a Joint Economic Development Zone (JEDZ) and to implement an earnings tax on individuals working in the Zone and on net profits from businesses in the Zone, in partnership with the Village of Fairfax.

<doc id="234360" wikidata="Q5188053" url="?curid=234360" title="Crosby Township, Ohio">
<text>Crosby Township is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The 2020 census found 6,030 people in the township.

==History==

The lands in Crosby Township were opened later and more slowly than its southern neighbors. While good land remained for sale in the more accessible townships there was little incentive to move this far away from the Ohio River. Difficulties with local Indians contributed to this delay.

Joab Comstock was the first settler. He came from New Haven, Connecticut in 1801 and purchased several sections leading up from the banks of the Great Miami River. The township was organized in 1803.

The township politics&#x27; in the nineteenth century were markedly pacifist due to the beliefs of resident Shakers and other denominations. During the Civil War, a subscription fund was raised and held by the township clerk, with the funds used to pay a bounty to a volunteer to replace any drafted subscriber. When the war and the draft ended in 1865, the remaining $1,200 was used to erect the frame building that has served as the Crosby Township Hall ever since.

===Name===
Named for Joab Comstock&#x27;s mother Thankful Crosby, it is the only Crosby Township statewide. Willey road however, may have been named for Joab&#x27;s wife Eunice Willey.

==Geography==
Located in the northwestern part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Ross Township, Butler County - northeast
*Colerain Township - east
*Whitewater Township - south
*Harrison Township - west
*Morgan Township, Butler County - northwest

One municipality, Harrison, while located primarily in Harrison Township, extends eastward into Crosby Township.

The township&#x27;s total area is 20 sq mi (52 km). The terrain rises in a series of hills from the Great Miami River in the southeast and the becomes more regular in the north and west. As of 1990, only 9% of the township&#x27;s land had been developed for suburban use, while 60% was agricultural and 27% remained wooded. Most of the extensive County Park, Miami Whitewater Forest, is located in Crosby Township.

===Settlements===
While there are no formally organized villages in the township, there have been three settlements: New Baltimore, New Haven, and Whitewater Shaker Village.

New Baltimore, formed in 1819 by Samuel Pottinger, is situated on the Miami River about east of New Haven. In July 1863, Morgan&#x27;s Raiders used a ford at New Baltimore to cross the Miami River.

New Haven was platted as a village by Joab Comstock in 1815. In the 19th century the village had a post office, but was known as &quot;Preston&quot;. This was necessary since there was already a New Haven in Huron County, Ohio, and the name was assigned by the first postmaster, Alexander Preston Cavender.

In 1824 settlement was accelerated by the founding of Whitewater Shaker Village as a commune of the Shakers, the organization&#x27;s fourth and last village in Ohio. Starting with 18 members and , the community eventually grew to over 125 members and occupied , and it remained an active community until it was abandoned in 1916 as a part of the general decline of the sect. Today the village&#x27;s Shaker Cemetery is maintained by the township trustees and is open to the public; while most of the settlement&#x27;s buildings remain along Oxford Road, they are all privately owned.

==Demographics==

===2020 census===
As of the census of 2020, there were 6,030 people living in the township, for a population density of 304.54 people per square mile (117.77/km2). There were 2,196 housing units. The racial makeup of the township was 93.2% White, 0.7% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.4% from some other race, and 4.6% from two or more races. 1.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 2,192 households, out of which 28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.3% were married couples living together, 16.0% had a male householder with no spouse present, and 12.3% had a female householder with no spouse present. 18.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.0% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57, and the average family size was 2.91.

22.6% of the township&#x27;s population were under the age of 18, 65.3% were 18 to 64, and 12.1% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.6. For every 100 females, there were 105.5 males.

According to the U.S. Census American Community Survey, for the period 2016-2020 the estimated median annual income for a household in the township was $106,770, and the median income for a family was $115,795. About 2.4% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 0.0% of those under age 18 and 0.0% of those age 65 or over. About 79.6% of the population were employed, and 36.1% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

===Fernald===
A major issue in the township is the ongoing activity related to the clean-up of the Fernald plant site, which was built during World War II and was used to refine uranium isotopes needed for the first atom bomb.

<text>Oksana Oleksandrivna Malaya (, born 4 November 1983), better known as Oxana Malaya, is a Ukrainian woman internationally known for her dog-imitating behavior. Malaya has been the subject of documentaries, interviews and tabloid headlines as a feral child &quot;raised by dogs&quot;.

== Biography ==
Malaya was born in the village of Nova Blahovishchenka in Hornostaivka Raion, Kherson Oblast, of the Ukrainian SSR. According to doctors and medical records, she was a normal child at birth, but was later neglected by her alcoholic father at age three, and she lived surrounded by dogs. When Malaya was found by authorities, she was seven and a half years old, but she could not talk, lacked many basic skills, and physically behaved like a dog. She was running around on all fours, barking, slept on the floor, and she ate and took care of her hygiene like a dog. Malaya was removed from her parents&#x27; custody by social services.

Malaya was eventually transferred to the foster home for mentally-disabled children in Barabol (rural Ovidiopol Raion of Odesa Oblast). She underwent years of specialized therapy and education to address her behavioural, social and educational issues. Upon adulthood, Malaya was taught to subdue her dog-like behaviour; she learned to speak fluently and intelligibly and works at a farm milking cows, but remains somewhat intellectually impaired.

In a Channel 4 documentary, and in the Portuguese SIC channel documentary, her doctors stated that it is unlikely that she will ever be completely rehabilitated into &quot;normal&quot; society. In 2001, Russian TV channel NTV made a documentary about her life. There have been multiple articles about her in the press.

In 2013, Malaya gave an interview on national Ukrainian TV, on the talk-show &quot;Hovoryt Ukraina&quot;, where she talked about herself and answered questions. During the show, Malaya said that she wants to be treated like a normal human being, and is offended when others call her a &quot;dog-girl&quot;. She said that she wants her brothers to visit her more often and that her main dream in her life is to find her biological mother. She also talked about her boyfriend, her life in the state foster home and her work with animals on the farm.

<text>Salvian (or Salvianus) was a Christian writer of the 5th century in Roman Gaul.

==Personal life==
Salvian&#x27;s birthplace is uncertain, but some scholars have suggested Cologne or Trier some time between 400 and 405. He was educated at the school of Trier and seems to have been brought up as a Christian. His writings appear to show that he had made a special study of the law; and this is the more likely as he appears to have been of noble birth and could describe one of his relations as being &quot;of no small account in her own district and not obscure in family&quot;. He was certainly a Christian when he married Palladia, the daughter of pagan parents, Hypatius and Quieta, whose displeasure he incurred by persuading his wife to retire with him to a distant monastery, which is almost certainly that founded by St Honoratus at Lerins. For seven years there was no communication between the two branches of the family, till at last, when Hypatius had become a Christian, Salvian wrote him a most touching letter in his own name, his wife&#x27;s, and that of his little daughter Auspiciola, begging for the renewal of the old affection. This whole letter is a most curious illustration of Salvian&#x27;s reproach against his age that the noblest man at once forfeited all esteem if he became a monk.

It was presumably at Lerins that Salvian made the acquaintance of Honoratus (died 429), Hilary of Arles (died 449), and Eucherius of Lyon (died 449). That he was a friend of the former and wrote an account of his life we learn from Hilary. To Eucherius&#x27;s two sons, Salonius and Veranus, he acted as tutor in consort with Vincent of Lérins. As he succeeded Honoratus and Hilary in this office, this date cannot well be later than the year 426 or 427, when the former was called to Arles, whither he seems to have summoned Hilary before his death in 429.

==Later work==
Salvian continued his friendly intercourse with both father and sons long after the latter had left his care; it was to Salonius (then a bishop) that he wrote his explanatory letter just after the publication of his treatise &quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot;; and to the same prelate a few years later he dedicated his great work, the &quot;De gubernatione Dei&quot; (&quot;The Government of God&quot;). If French scholars are right in assigning Hilary&#x27;s &quot;Vita Honorati&quot; to 430, Salvian, who is there called a priest, had probably already left Lyons for Marseille, where he is known to have spent the last years of his life (Gennadius, ap. Migne, lviii. 1099). It was probably from Marseille that he wrote his first letter — presumably to Lerins — begging the community there to receive his kinsman, the son of a widow of Cologne, who had been reduced to poverty by the barbarian invasions. It seems a fair inference that Salvian had divested himself of all his property in favour of that society and sent his relative to Lerins for assistance (&quot;Ep.&quot; i., with which compare &quot;Ad eccles.&quot; ii. 9, 10; iii. 5). It has been conjectured that Salvian paid a visit to Carthage; but this is a mere inference based on the minute details he gives of the state of this city just before its fall to the Vandals (&quot;De gub.&quot; vii. viii). He seems to have been still living at Marseille when Gennadius wrote under the papacy of Gelasius (492–496).

==Accounts of the fall of the Roman Empire==
Of Salvian&#x27;s writings there are still extant two treatises, entitled respectively &quot;De gubernatione Dei&quot; (more correctly &quot;De praesenti judicio&quot;) and &quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot;, and a series of nine letters. Several works mentioned by Gennadius, notably a poem &quot;in morem Graecorum&quot; on the six days of creation (&quot;hexaemeron&quot;), and certain homilies composed for bishops, are now lost (Genn. 67).

===&quot;De gubernatione Dei&quot; (&quot;De praesenti judicio&quot;)===
&quot;De gubernatione Dei&quot; (&quot;On the Governance of God&quot;) has been considered Salvian&#x27;s greatest work. Peter Brown described it as ‘the most vivid and by far the best-known commentary on the state of the Roman Empire in the 430s and 440s’. It was published after the capture of Litorius at Toulouse (439), to which he plainly alludes in vii.40. and after the Vandal conquest of Carthage in the same year (vi. 12), but before Attila&#x27;s invasion (451), as Salvian speaks of the Huns, not as enemies of the empire, but as serving in the Roman armies (vii. 9). The words &quot;proximum bellum&quot; seem to denote a year very soon after 439.

Through it&#x27;s eight surviving volumes, Salvian furnishes a valuable if prejudiced description of life in 5th century Gaul. He deals with the same problem that had moved the eloquence of Augustine and Orosius: why were these miseries falling on the empire? Could it be, as the pagans said, because the age had forsaken its old gods? Or was it, as the semi-pagan creed of some Christians taught, that God did not constantly overrule the world he had created (i. 1)? With the former Salvian will not argue (iii. 1). To the latter he replies by asserting that &quot;just as the navigating steersman never loses the helm, so does God never remove his care from the world&quot;. Hence the title of the treatise.

In books i. and ii. Salvian sets himself to prove God&#x27;s constant guidance, first by the facts of Scripture history, and secondly by the enumeration of special texts declaring this truth. Having thus &quot;laid the foundations&quot; of his work, he declares in book iii. that the misery of the Roman world is all due to the neglect of God&#x27;s commandments and the terrible sins of every class of society. It is not merely that the slaves are thieves and runaways, wine-bibbers and gluttons - the rich are worse (iv. 3). It is their harshness and greed that drive the poor to join the Bagaudae and fly for shelter to the barbarian invaders (v. 5 and 6). Everywhere the taxes are heaped upon the needy, while the rich, who have the apportioning of the impost, escape comparatively free (v. 7). The great towns are wholly given up to the abominations of the circus and the theatre, where decency is wholly set at nought, and Minerva, Mars, Neptune and the old gods are still worshipped (vi. 11; cf. vi. 2 and viii. 2).

Treves was almost destroyed by the barbarians; yet the first petition of its few surviving nobles was that the emperor would re-establish the circus games as a remedy for the ruined city (vi. 15). And this was the prayer of Christians, whose baptismal oath pledged them to renounce &quot;the devil and his works ... the pomps and shows (&quot;spectacula&quot;)&quot; of this wicked world (vi. 6). Darker still were the iniquities of Carthage, surpassing even the unconcealed licentiousness of Gaul and Spain (iv. 5); and more fearful to Salvian than all else was it to hear men swear &quot;by Christ&quot; that they would commit a crime (iv. 15). It would be the atheist&#x27;s strongest argument if God left such a state of society unpunished (iv. 12) - especially among Christians, whose sin, since they alone had the Scriptures, was worse than that of barbarians, even if equally wicked, would be (v. 2). But, as a matter of fact, the latter had at least some shining virtues mingled with their vices, whereas the Romans were wholly corrupt (vii. 15, iv. 14).

With this iniquity of the Romans Salvian contrasts the chastity of the Vandals, the piety of the Goths, and the ruder virtues of the Franks, the Saxons, and the other tribes to whom, though heretic Arians or unbelievers, God is giving in reward the inheritance of the empire (vii. 9, II, 21). It is curious that Salvian shows no such hatred of the heterodox barbarians as was rife in Gaul seventy years later. It is difficult to credit the universal wickedness adduced by Salvian, especially in face of the contemporary testimony of Symmachus, Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris.

===&quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot;===
&quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot; is explained by its common title, &quot;Contra avaritiam&quot; (&quot;Against Avarice&quot;). It strongly commends meritorious almsgiving to the church. It is quoted more than once in the &quot;De gubernatione&quot;. Salvian published it under the name of Timothy, and explained his motives for so doing in a letter to his old pupil, Bishop Salonius (&quot;Ep.&quot; ix.).

This work is chiefly remarkable because in some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea that it is better for the children to suffer want in this world than that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8–10).

==Editions==
The &quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot; was first printed in Sichard&#x27;s &quot;Antidoton&quot; (Basel, 1528); the &quot;De gubernatione&quot; by Brassican (Basel, 1530). The two appeared in one volume at Paris in 1575. Pithoeus added &quot;variae lectiones&quot; and the first seven letters (Paris, 1580); Ritterhusius made various conjectural emendations (Altorf, 1611), and Baluze many more based on manuscript authority (Paris, 1663–1669).

Numerous other editions appeared from the 16th to the 18th century, all of which are now superseded by those of Karl Felix Halm (Berlin, 1877) and F. Pauly (Vienna, 1883).

The two oldest manuscripts of the &quot;De gubernatione&quot; belong to the 10th century (Cod. Paris, No. 13,385) and the 13th (Brussels, 10,628); of the &quot;Ad ecclesiam&quot; to the 10th (Paris, 2172) and the 11th (Paris, 2785); of Epistle IX to the 9th (Paris, 2785); of Epistle VIII. to the 7th or 8th century (Paris, 95,559) and to the 9th or 10th century (Paris, 12,237, 12,236). Of the first seven epistles there is only one manuscript extant, of which one part is now at Bern (No. 219), the other at Paris (No. 3791). See &quot;Histoire littéraire de France&quot;, vol. ii.; Zschimmer&#x27;s &quot;Salvianus&quot; (Halle, 1875).

Salvian&#x27;s works are reprinted (after Baluze) in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Cursus patrologiae, ser. lat.&quot; vol. liii. For bibliography, see T. G. Schoenemann&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca patrum&quot; (ii. 823), and the prefaces to the editions of C. Halm (&quot;Monum. Germ.&quot;, 1877) and F. Pauly (Vienna, Corp. scr. eccl. Lat., 1883).

Gennadius, Hilary and Eucherius may be consulted in Migne, vols. lviii. and I. See also Samuel Dill, &quot;Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire&quot;, pp. 115–120.

<text>Delhi Township ( ) is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The 2020 census found 28,760 people in the township. It is the only Delhi Township statewide.

==History==
The area of modern-day Delhi Township was first settled by European Americans in 1789 with the founding of the village of South Bend. A year later, when Hamilton County was incorporated, the village loaned its name to South Bend township, which included the present-day location of Delhi Township. In 1809, South Bend Township was divided into Green and Miami townships. Delhi was later split from the southern portions of Green Township in 1816 as a result of a petition from residents. Upon incorporation, the township&#x27;s name was originally spelled as &quot;Delhigh&quot;, although the name morphed into &quot;Delhi&quot; sometime in the nineteenth century for unknown reasons.

===Sedam Springhouse===

The Sedam Springhouse, which may date back to the 1790s, is one of the oldest buildings in the township. Now known as the Delhi Springhouse, the structure stands on land near the stone house Colonel Cornelius Ryker Sedam built in 1796. The house no longer exists, but the springhouse has been restored. The structure protected a natural spring, which supplied water as late as 1937. The springhouse was also used to provide storage for perishable foods.

==Geography==
Located in the southwestern part of the county along the Ohio River, it has the following borders:
*Green Township - north
*Cincinnati - east (Price Hill), west (Sayler Park), and south (Riverside and Sayler Park)
*Miami Township - northwest

Much of what was once part of Delhi Township, including its entire shoreline along the Ohio River, is now part of the city of Cincinnati, the county seat of Hamilton County. Unincorporated communities in the township include Delhi Hills, Delshire, and Mount Saint Joseph. The Cincinnati communities of Price Hill, Sayler Park, Sedamsville and Riverside were part of Delhi Township until they were annexed by Cincinnati at the turn of the 20th century.

The township has an area of . Because the township covers the slopes leading down to the floodplain of the Ohio River, the township contains many hills, and its landscape is cut by a number of ravines caused by streams that make the descent.

==Climate==
Delhi Township is located within a climatic transition zone at the extreme northern limit of the humid subtropical climate. Being located within the northern periphery of the Upland South and also within the Bluegrass region of southern Ohio and Kentucky, the local climate is basically a blend of the subtropics to the south and the humid continental climate to the north.

Delhi Township&#x27;s average annual rainfall is , received over an average of 82 days, along with of snow. Temperatures range from an average July high of 88 °F (31 °C) to an average January low of 15 °F (-5 °C).

==Demographics==

===2020 census===
As of the census of 2020, there were 28,760 people living in the township, for a population density of 2,847.52 people per square mile (1,101.91/km2). There were 11,060 housing units. The racial makeup of the township was 88.9% White, 4.5% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.1% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.7% from some other race, and 4.8% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The average household size was 2.63, and the average family size was 3.16.

23.8% of the township&#x27;s population were under the age of 18, 58.2% were 18 to 64, and 18.0% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.6. For every 100 females, there were 96.1 males.

According to the U.S. Census American Community Survey, for the period 2016-2020 the estimated median annual income for a household in the township was $78,809, and the median income for a family was $92,844. About 8.6% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 13.0% of those under age 18 and 3.5% of those age 65 or over. About 65.6% of the population were employed, and 30.1% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Infrastructure==

===Fire department===
Three fire stations serve the township. Fire Station #33 serves as the fire department&#x27;s headquarters. The other stations are Station #30 and Station #36.

==Culture and recreation==

===Delhi Skirt Game===
Delhi has various annual celebrations, including the Delhi Skirt Game. The Delhi Skirt Game is a Chicago-style softball game between officers of the Delhi Township Police Department and the firefighters of the Delhi Township Fire Department; the teams consist of male officers dressed in drag. The game is played in Delhi Park on the first Friday of August, with festivities surrounding the game including live music, games of chance, concessions, auctions and fireworks. The Skirt Game benefits needy families of Delhi Township.

===&quot;Floral Paradise&quot;===
Following an 1850s grape blight which destroyed most of the township&#x27;s vineyards, many growers turned to vegetable farming. On the heels of a successful transition to vegetable farming, growers began to construct greenhouses in order to extend the growing season. At some point in the 1920–1930s, nearly all of the Delhi greenhouse operators began to realize the greater profit potential of growing flowers, and subsequently converted their greenhouses from vegetable-centric operations to growing cut flowers full-time.

The peak of local hothouse agriculture was reached during the late pre-WWII years, when as many as 55 family-run greenhouses operated in the township. Notably, Delhi Township-based greenhouses produced a significant percentage of carnations supplied throughout the United States by this time. In the local region, Delhi Township became known as the &quot;Floral Paradise of Ohio&quot;, a trademark phrase that is still featured on modern, official Delhi Township signage.

The importance of greenhouses in Delhi Township was even reflected in the equipment of the Delhi Township Fire Department; as late as 1986, small-diameter fire attack lines were equipped with iron pipe couplings (rather than otherwise ubiquitous National Standard threads) in order to be compatible with the fittings in use on most greenhouse irrigation standpipes of the time. This arrangement permitted firefighters to connect their hoses to the source of water closest to an interior greenhouse fire, eliminating the need to drag (potentially) hundreds of feet of heavy, charged hose connected at the fire apparatus&#x27;s pump panel outside. In this arrangement, water pressure in the involved greenhouse was boosted by a connection from the pumper to a standpipe connection on the outside of the structure. The requirement to carry a large variety of thread adapters (in order to be compatible with nearby, mutual aid departments), along with the rapid, penultimate decline of hothouse agriculture in Delhi Township led to the complete standardization to National Standard-threaded couplings within the department by the late 1980s.

Today, only a few family-run greenhouses remain—the combined results of a decline in business due to foreign flower imports, as well as the lucrative conversion of greenhouse properties to land made available for residential and commercial development in the post-World War II suburbanization boom.

===Parks===

The township operates over of park property. Parks operated by the township include Delhi Park, Five-Points Park, and Story Woods Park. Delhi Park, which opened in 1954, is the oldest park in the township. It has nine ball fields, including baseball courts, football fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, and sand volleyball courts. Delhi Park also has the Glen Carder Lodge, four picnic shelters and the &quot;Spray Park.&quot; Five-Points Park, a park, has a gazebo and the firefighter&#x27;s memorial. Story Woods Park, a park, has a playground facility, a picnic shelter, toilet facilities, and of walking trails. The township also has the Delhi Springhouse, which opened to protect the springs. The springhouse was also used as a source of drinking water and as cold storage for perishable foods. The Great Parks of Hamilton County operates Embshoff Woods, a park which opened in 1982 and consists of of protected natural areas.

In November 2007, the township dedicated Veterans Memorial Park in honor of the township&#x27;s military veterans. Located within the park are the Wall of Honor Monument and the Killed-in-Action Memorial.

===Newspaper===
The &quot;Delhi Press&quot; serves the areas of Delhi and Sayler Park, Cincinnati.

==Public libraries==
The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County operates the Delhi Township Branch. The township first received a library in 1949 when a collection of books opened in Delhi Public School. A permanent library facility was dedicated in January 1968. In 1999, an addition added of space to the building, increased the size of the collection, expanded the children&#x27;s area, added a glass reading room, and altered the landscaping. The branch was renamed to the Delhi Township Branch Library during its reopening and rededication.

<doc id="234368" wikidata="Q681737" url="?curid=234368" title="Coming of age">
<text>Coming of age is a young person&#x27;s transition from being a child to being an adult. The specific age at which this transition takes place varies between societies, as does the nature of the change. It can be a simple legal convention or can be part of a ritual or spiritual event.

In the past, and in some societies today, such a change is often associated with the age of sexual maturity (puberty), especially menarche and spermarche. In others, it is associated with an age of religious responsibility. 

Particularly in Western societies, modern legal conventions stipulate points around the end of adolescence and the beginning of early adulthood (most commonly 16 though ranging from 14 to 21) when adolescents are generally no longer considered minors and are granted the full rights and responsibilities of an adult. Some cultures and countries have multiple coming of age ceremonies for multiple ages. 

Many cultures retain ceremonies to confirm the coming of age, and coming-of-age stories are a well-established sub-genre in literature, the film industry, and other forms of media.

These ceremonies can represent acceptance into a larger culture, feelings of importance, legal rights and permissions, or entrance into the marriage landscape, depending on the culture. 

==Cultural==

===Ancient Greek===
In certain states in Ancient Greece, such as Sparta and Crete, adolescent boys were expected to enter into a mentoring relationship with an adult man, in which they would be taught skills pertaining to adult life, such as hunting, martial arts and fine arts.

===South Africa===

===Ancient Rome===
The puberty ritual for the young Roman male involved shaving his beard and taking off his &quot;bulla&quot;, an amulet worn to mark and protect underage youth, which he then dedicated to his household gods, the Lares. He assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot; (&quot;toga of manhood&quot;), was enrolled as a citizen on the census, and soon began his military service. Traditionally, the ceremony was held on the Liberalia, the festival in honor of the god Liber, who embodied both political and sexual liberty, but other dates could be chosen for individual reasons.

Rome lacked the elaborate female puberty rituals of ancient Greece, and for girls, the wedding ceremony was in part a rite of passage for the bride. Girls coming of age dedicated their dolls to Artemis, the goddess most concerned with virginity, or to Aphrodite when they were preparing for marriage. All adolescents in ritual preparation to transition to adult status wore the &quot;tunica recta&quot;, the &quot;upright tunic&quot;, but girls wove their own. The garment was called &quot;recta&quot; because it was woven by tradition on a type of upright loom that had become archaic in later periods.

Roman girls were expected to remain virgins until marriage, but boys were often introduced to heterosexual behaviors by a prostitute. The higher the social rank of a girl, the sooner she was likely to become betrothed and married. The general age of betrothal for girls of the upper classes was fourteen, but for patricians as early as twelve. Weddings, however, were often postponed until the girl was considered mature enough. Males typically postponed marriage till they had served in the military for some time and were beginning their political careers, around age 25. Patrician males, however, might marry considerably earlier; Julius Caesar was married for the first time by the age of 18.

On the night before the wedding, the bride bound up her hair with a yellow hairnet she had woven. The confining of her hair signifies the harnessing of her sexuality within marriage. Her weaving of the &quot;tunica recta&quot; and the hairnet demonstrated her skill and her capacity for acting in the traditional matron&#x27;s role as &quot;custos domi&quot;, &quot;guardian of the house&quot;. On her wedding day, she belted her tunic with the &quot;cingulum&quot;, made from the wool of an ewe to symbolize fertility, and tied with the &quot;knot of Hercules&quot;, which was supposed to be hard to untie. The knot symbolized wifely chastity, in that it was to be untied only by her husband, but the &quot;cingulum&quot; also symbolized that the bridegroom &quot;was belted and bound&quot; to his wife. The bride&#x27;s hair was ritually styled in &quot;six tresses&quot; &quot;(seni crines)&quot;, and she was veiled until uncovered by her husband at the end of the ceremony, a ritual of surrendering her virginity to him.

===Anglo-Celtic===
The legal age of majority is 18 in most Anglo-Celtic cultures (such as Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland). One is legally enabled to vote, purchase tobacco and alcohol, marry without parental consent (although one can wed at 16 in United Kingdom and New Zealand) and sign contracts. But in the early twentieth century, the age of legal majority was 21, although the marriageable age was typically lower. Even though turning 21 now has few, if any, legal effects in most of these countries, its former legal status as the age of majority has caused it to continue to be celebrated. 

=== Brazil ===
In the Sateré-Mawé tribe of the Brazilian Amazon, young boys celebrate their coming of age at 13 where they participate in the Bullet Ant Initiation. During this ceremony, the boys go out and search for bullet ants, and the ants are sedated. Then, the ants are woven into gloves. The ants are woven into the gloves so that their stingers are facing inwards- towards the skin. When the ants wake up, they&#x27;re furious. The boys then have to wear the gloves for 20 minutes to prove their manhood. They will do this 20 times over the course of many months for the initiation to be finished. Any scream or cry is seen as a sign of weakness. 

===Judaism===
In the Jewish faith, boys reach religious maturity at the age of thirteen and become a &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; (&quot;bar mitzvah&quot; means &quot;son of the commandment&quot; literally, and &quot;subject to commandments&quot; figuratively). Girls mature a year earlier, and become a &quot;bat mitzvah&quot; (&quot;bat mitzvah&quot; means &quot;daughter of the commandment&quot;) at twelve. The new men and women are looked upon as adults and are expected to uphold the Jewish commandments and laws. Also, in religious court they are adults and can marry with their new title of an adult. Nonetheless, in the Talmud; Pirkei Avot (5:25), Rabbi Yehuda ben Teime gives the age of 18 as the appropriate age to get married. At the end of the bar or bat mitzvah, the boy or girl is showered with candies, which act as &quot;sweet blessings&quot;. Besides the actual ceremony, there usually is a bar or bat mitzvah party.

====Chassidim====
In various Chassidic sects when boys turn 3 years of age, they have an &quot;upsherin&quot; (sect related typical &quot;Brooklin-Yiddish&quot; for Yiddish &quot;Abshern&quot;, for German &quot;Abscheren&quot;, &quot;Haare schneiden&quot;, engl. &quot;hair cut&quot;, ) ceremony, when they receive their first haircut. Until then, their parents allow their hair to grow long, until they undergo this esoteric rite. Little girls for the first time co-light some extra &quot;″Shabbat&quot; candles, after their mothers did so, also when they turn 3 years of age.

===Shinto===
In the Shinto faith, boys were taken to the shrine of their patron deity at approximately 12–14 years old. They were then given adult clothes and a new haircut. This was called Genpuku.

===Sikhism===
In Sikhism, when one reaches the age of maturity, the men will typically partake in a ceremony called Dastar Bandhi. This is the first time the proper Sikh Turban is tied on the adolescent. Women who wear the turban may also partake in the ceremony, although it is less common.

<text>Green Township is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. It is a suburb of the neighboring city of Cincinnati. With a population of 60,424 at the 2020 census, Green Township is the most populous township in Hamilton County, and the second most populous township in Ohio. It was founded in 1809.

==History==
It is one of sixteen Green Townships statewide.

The township was originally held intact by John Cleves Symmes, with the apparent intent of naming it as the academy township for his purchase. In 1802 a court order awarded half the township to one of his Miami Company investors, Elias Boudinot. This became part of the disputes over the entire Symmes Purchase. The township is named after Nathanael Greene, a Revolutionary War general.

The township was home to The Western Hills Airport (Also called &quot;Frank Airport&quot; and &quot;Cheviot Airport&quot;) and was the first airport in western Hamilton County, Ohio. The airport was located in the neighborhood of Bridgetown, Ohio. Airport operations began in 1929, shutdown during World War II, then reopened after the end of the war, slowly declining until the corporation ceased services in 1949 as aircraft outgrew the facilities.

==Geography==
Located in the west central part of the county, it borders the following townships and city:
*Colerain Township - north
*Cincinnati - east
*Delhi Township - south
*Miami Township - west

Two cities occupy what was once part of Green Township: Cheviot in the east center, and Cincinnati, the county seat of Hamilton County, in the east and southeast. Nearly all of the remainder of the township is part of one of the following census-designated places:
*Bridgetown, in the center
*Covedale, in the south
*Dent, in the northwest
*Mack, in the west and southwest
*Monfort Heights, in the northeast, south of White Oak
*White Oak, in the northeast

The township encompasses 27.9 sq mi (72.3 km) of gently rolling hills above the Ohio River northwest of downtown Cincinnati. As of 1990, over 50% of the township&#x27;s area has been was converted to urban use, largely as a suburb of Cincinnati; 38% is classed as forested, and 11% as farmland.

<text>A governess is a woman employed as a private tutor, who teaches and trains a child or children in their home. A governess often lives in the same residence as the children she is teaching. In contrast to a nanny, the primary role of a governess is teaching, rather than meeting the physical needs of children; hence a governess is usually in charge of school-aged children, rather than babies.

The position of governess used to be common in affluent European families before the First World War, especially in the countryside where no suitable school existed nearby and when parents preferred to educate their children at home rather than send them away to boarding school for months at a time, and varied across time and countries. Governesses were usually in charge of girls and younger boys. When a boy was old enough, he left his governess for a male tutor or a school.

Governesses are rarer now, except within large and wealthy households or royal families such as the Saudi royal family and in remote regions such as outback Australia. There has been a recent resurgence amongst wealthy families worldwide to employ governesses or full-time tutors. The reasons for this include personal security, the benefits of a tailored education, and the flexibility to travel or live in multiple locations.

==Role==
Traditionally, governesses taught &quot;the three Rs&quot; (reading, writing, and arithmetic) to young children. They also taught the &quot;accomplishments&quot; expected of upper-class and middle-class women to the young girls under their care, such as French or another language, the piano or another musical instrument, and often painting (usually the more ladylike watercolours, rather than oils) or poetry. It was also possible for other (usually male) teachers with specialist knowledge and skills to be brought in, such as a drawing master or dancing master.

===In the United Kingdom===
In the Victorian household, the governess was neither a servant nor a member of the host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo, she frequently ate on her own, away from both the family and the servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else&#x27;s home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and beautiful, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage and enforce the governess&#x27;s social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.

However, being a governess was one of the few legitimate ways by which an unmarried, middle-class woman could support herself in Victorian society. The majority of governesses were women whose fortunes had drastically declined (e.g. Sarah Bennett), due to perhaps the death of their father or both of their parents, or the failure of the family business, and had no relatives willing to take them in. Her position was often depicted as one to be pitied, and the only way out of it was to get married. It was difficult for a governess to find a suitable husband because most of the eligible men she encountered were her social superiors, who preferred a bride from within their own social class, particularly since such women generally had better financial resources.

Once a governess&#x27;s charges grew up, she had to seek a new position, or, exceptionally, might be retained by a grown daughter as a paid companion.

===British governesses outside the United Kingdom===
An option for the more adventurous was to find an appointment abroad. There is also some allusion to the phenomenon of governesses being engaged abroad in &quot;A galaxy of governesses&quot; by Bea Howe.

The Russian Empire proved to be a relatively well-paid option for many. According to Harvey Pitcher in &quot;When Miss Emmie was in Russia: English Governesses before, during and after the October Revolution&quot;, as many as thousands of English-speaking governesses went there. The estimate of numbers (&#x27;thousands&#x27;), although necessarily vague, is justified by some knowledge of the main lodging house used by those not accommodated with their host families, St. Andrew&#x27;s House, Moscow, and by the places of worship they preferentially frequented, for example the church associated with the House. Pitcher drew extensively on the archives of the Governesses&#x27; Benevolent Institution in London.

==Notable governesses==
*Katherine Swynford ( – 1403), governess to the children of John of Gaunt, became his mistress and the mother of his Beaufort children; after some time, the couple married, and eventually the children were legitimised. She was a great-great grandmother of Henry VII of England through his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort.
*Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury (1473–1541), governess to the future Queen Mary I of England. They were also third cousins.
*Kat Ashley (circa 1502 – 1565), governess to Queen Elizabeth I of England.

*Jane Gardiner (1758–1840), from her mid-teens governess to the daughters of Lady Martin, and from 1780 to the children of Lord Ilchester. She was succeeded in this second post by Agnes Porter, whose memoirs were reprinted in 1998 as &quot;A Governess in the Age of Jane Austen&quot;.
*Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797), author of the early feminist classic &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, worked as a governess in the household of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family, where she greatly influenced Margaret King.

*Anna Leonowens (1831–1915), governess to the harem of Mongkut (King of what is now Thailand). Her memoirs were later novelised as &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, which in turn inspired the musical drama &quot;The King and I&quot;.
*Edith Cavell (1865–1915) worked first as a governess before she trained as a nurse
*Anne Sullivan (1866–1936), the so-called &quot;Miracle Worker&quot;, who educated the remarkable deaf and blind girl Helen Keller.
*Marie Curie (1867–1934), who worked as a governess in multiple households to fund her education, later became one of the most influential women in the history of science.

<text>Gryphaea, one of the genera known as devil&#x27;s toenails, is a genus of extinct oysters, marine bivalve mollusks in the family Gryphaeidae.

These fossils range from the Triassic period to the middle Paleogene period, but are mostly restricted to the Triassic and Jurassic. They are particularly common in many parts of Britain.

These oysters lived on the sea bed in shallow waters, likely in large colonies. The complete fossils consist of two articulated valves: a larger gnarly-shaped shell (the &quot;toenail&quot;) and a smaller, flattened shell, the &quot;lid&quot;. The soft parts of the animal occupied the cavity between the two shells, just like modern oysters. The shells also feature prominent growth bands. The larger, curved shell sat within the mud on the sea floor. These shells are sometimes found in fossil plates along with &quot;Turritella&quot;, clams, and sometimes sharks&#x27; teeth and fossilized fish scales. Its distribution is common in areas of Europe.

A classic location to find these fossils is Redcar, on the northeast coast of England. There used to be a common folk belief that carrying one of these fossils could prevent rheumatism.

The name &quot;devil&#x27;s toenail&quot; is also used for some fossil species of the genus &quot;Exogyra&quot;, which is in the same family (Gryphaeidae) as &quot;Gryphaea&quot;.

Two genera have been removed from this genus: &quot;Pycnodonte&quot; and &quot;Texigryphaea&quot;.

<doc id="234376" wikidata="Q266226" url="?curid=234376" title="Springfield Township, Hamilton County, Ohio">
<text>Springfield Township is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 35,862 as of the 2020 census. Springfield Township is home to the largest private school in Ohio (St. Xavier High School), the largest lake in Hamilton County (at Winton Woods County Park), and the Cincinnati area&#x27;s annual Greek Festival (at Holy Trinity-St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church).

==History==
In 1795, upon the signing of the Treaty of Greenville, the court of general quarter sessions of the peace for Hamilton County created Springfield and Fairfield townships out of the northern reaches of Cincinnati Township.

In 1810, Millcreek Township was formed from the northern part of Cincinnati Township and the southern part of Springfield Township.

===Name===
Springfield Township is one of 11 townships by this name statewide.

==Geography==

Springfield Township is suburban with abundant green space and parks, including most of the 2,500-acre Winton Woods County Park. The township also includes the largest lake in Hamilton County, the 188 surface-acre Winton Woods lake.

Springfield Township today consists of the core of the original township boundaries, although five non-contiguous &quot;islands&quot; exist due to annexations. The Township Master Plan divides the township into eleven neighborhoods, which closely align with the seven public school districts serving the township, but generally not the five census-designated places (CDPs).

The following municipalities have become independent of, or annexed land within, the original Springfield Township boundaries:

The Township borders ten municipalities, and Colerain Township to the west:
*Fairfield - north, north of Forest Park
*Forest Park - north, between Fairfield and Green Hills, west of Springdale
*Greenhills - north, south of Forest Park
*Springdale - northeast, between Forest Park and Glendale
*Glendale - northeast, between Springdale and Woodlawn
*Woodlawn - east, between Glendale and Wyoming
*Wyoming - southeast, between Woodlawn and Cincinnati
*Cincinnati - south
*North College Hill - southwest, south of Mount Healthy
*Mount Healthy - southwest, north of North College Hill

<doc id="234382" wikidata="Q1163943" url="?curid=234382" title="Elephant (2003 film)">
<text>Elephant is a 2003 American psychological drama film written, directed and edited by Gus Van Sant. It takes place in Watt High School, in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, and chronicles the events surrounding a school shooting, heavily inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. The film begins a short time before the shooting occurs, following the lives of several characters both in and out of school, who are unaware of what is about to unfold. The film stars mostly new actors, including John Robinson, Alex Frost, and Eric Deulen.

&quot;Elephant&quot; is the second film in Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Death Trilogy&quot;—the first is &quot;Gerry&quot; (2002) and the third &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005)—all three of which are based on actual events.

Although &quot;Elephant&quot; was controversial for its subject matter and allegations of influence on the Red Lake shootings, it was generally praised by critics and received the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.
==Plot==
At the start of the film, John McFarland is driven to school by his father, who is driving erratically down the road. Noticing the damage done to the car, John realizes that his father is drunk and makes him move to the passenger seat so he can drive. When John arrives at school late, he is reprimanded by the principal, Mr. Luce.

The majority of the film is spent following several high school students going about their daily lives just before a school shooting. In addition to John, who struggles with controlling his alcoholic father, photography student Elias builds a portfolio of other students. Outcast Michelle struggles with her body issues and assists in the library. Bulimics Nicole, Brittany, and Jordan gripe about their parents and squabble while popular athlete and lifeguard Nathan meets with his girlfriend, Carrie. Acadia, a close friend of John&#x27;s, attends a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting.

Unknown to anyone, two other students, Alex and Eric, are preparing to carry out a bomb/shooting attack on their school. Flashbacks throughout the film show them preparing for the massacre by ordering weapons online and formulating an attack plan. The two have a brief sexual encounter in the shower after they both admit that they&#x27;ve never kissed anyone before. Their motives for the shooting appear vague; the film provides evidence suggesting bullying, neglect, violent video games, and Nazism.

On the day of the shooting, the pair makes their way to school in Alex&#x27;s car. Alex is armed with a Carbon-15 and a shotgun while Eric has a TEC-9. As they enter the school, they encounter John, and Alex tells him to leave. Realizing what is about to happen, John tries to warn students and teachers outside not to go into the school, but few people listen. He then notices his dad is missing after they arrived earlier and goes looking for him.

Alex and Eric plant propane bombs in the cafeteria, hoping to blow it up and shoot people as they try to escape the fire. When the bombs fail, they decide to start shooting indiscriminately. The pair heads into the library, where Elias photographs them right before they open fire on students. Michelle and Elias are killed. Other students quickly realize that the gunfire is real and begin to panic, and teachers begin evacuating students.

Alex and Eric split up to opposing ends of the school to continue their shooting. Alex enters the girls&#x27; bathroom where he surprises Jordan, Nicole, and Brittany, presumably shooting all three. A student attending the Gay-Straight Alliance meeting enters the hallway investigating the gunfire and is shot dead. The alliance members evacuate through a window save for Acadia, who freezes at the sight of her dead classmate. Benny, an African-American student-athlete, finds her and helps her out the window before deciding to find the shooters.

Outside the school, John finds his now sobered-up father, who tries to comfort his son as the shooting continues. While helping students escape, Mr. Luce is cornered and threatened by Eric, prompting Mr. Luce to try and reason with him. Benny walks up behind Eric, and Eric abruptly turns around and shoots Benny dead. Eric tells Mr. Luce not to treat kids like him and Alex poorly. He then lets Mr. Luce go, only to gun him down seconds later.

Alex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation about who they&#x27;ve shot, which ends when Alex shoots Eric mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over killing Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan hiding in a freezer. He tauntingly recites &quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot; to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film then cuts to the credits, leaving the ending ambiguous.

==Cast==
* Alex Frost as Alex, the more intelligent of the two killers, implied to be the one in charge. He is an accomplished but frustrated pianist and sketch artist. 
* Eric Deulen as Eric, a slacker, Alex&#x27;s friend, and the other killer. He is less intelligent than Alex, and Alex is obviously aware of this. He is shot in the chest by Alex near the end of the film, while talking about whom he had killed earlier. 
* John Robinson as John McFarland, Alex&#x27;s friend who has trouble at school while managing his alcoholic father. Alex warns him and a few other people to stay away from the massacre. 
* Timothy Bottoms as Mr. McFarland, John&#x27;s alcoholic father.
* Matt Malloy as Mr. Luce, the principal of the school. Cornered by Eric, who briefly spares him, he is presumed dead after being shot several times.
* Elias McConnell as Elias, a photography student building his portfolio with portraits of other students.
* Nathan Tyson and Carrie Finklea as Nathan and Carrie, a popular lifeguard/football player and his girlfriend. Alex taunts them with Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. 
* Kristen Hicks as Michelle, a nerdy girl ashamed of her body. The film follows her through the locker room and into the library where she assists, and it is there that she is the first to die in the massacre.
* Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor, and Nicole George as Brittany, Jordan, and Nicole, three bulimic girls who talk incessantly, gripe about parents, and squabble with one another.
* Bennie Dixon as Benny, an athletic student who helps Acadia escape out of a window before approaching Eric. He is shot and presumed dead.
* Alicia Miles as Acadia, a close friend of John and a member of the Gay-Straight Alliance. During the shooting, Benny discovers her standing still in a classroom and helps her escape from the school and the shooters.

==Production==

The film began as a documentary that Van Sant had intended to make about the Columbine High School massacre; eventually, the idea of a factual account was dropped.

&quot;Elephant&quot; was filmed in Van Sant&#x27;s hometown, Portland, Oregon, in late 2002, on the former campus of Whitaker Middle School (previously Adams High School).

There was no initial script before the filming started. The script was &quot;written&quot; to its final form during shooting, with cast members improvising freely and collaborating in the direction of scenes. It was shot over 20 days.

JT LeRoy (a pen name for author Laura Albert) is credited as an associate producer for the film.

=== Title ===
The title &quot;Elephant&quot; is a tribute to the 1989 BBC short film of the same name, directed by Alan Clarke. Van Sant originally believed Clarke&#x27;s title referred to the parable of the blind men and an elephant, in which several blind men try to describe an elephant, and each draws different conclusions based on which body part they touched, and Van Sant&#x27;s film uses that interpretation, as the same general timeline is shown multiple times from multiple viewpoints. Later, Van Sant discovered Clarke&#x27;s film referred to the phrase &quot;elephant in the room&quot; (the collective denial of some obvious problem).
Also, Gus Van Sant named Chantal Akerman&#x27;s film &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot; (1975) as an inspiration.

Clarke&#x27;s film &quot;Elephant&quot; reflects on sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Van Sant&#x27;s minimalist style and use of tracking shots mirrors Clarke&#x27;s film.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Elephant&quot; received mainly positive reviews from critics and has a score of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 164 reviews with an average rating of 7.10/10. The critical consensus states &quot;The movie&#x27;s spare and unconventional style will divide viewers.&quot; The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 37 critics indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert praised the film and gave it 4 out of 4 stars writing &quot;Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Elephant&quot; is a violent movie in the sense that many innocent people are shot dead. But it isn&#x27;t violent in the way it presents those deaths. There is no pumped-up style, no lingering, no release, no climax. Just implacable, poker-faced, flat, uninflected death. Truffaut said it was hard to make an anti-war film because war was exciting even if you were against it. Van Sant has made an anti-violence film by draining violence of energy, purpose, glamor, reward and social context. It just happens. I doubt that &quot;Elephant&quot; will ever inspire anyone to copy what they see on the screen. Much more than the insipid message movies shown in social studies classes, it might inspire useful discussion and soul-searching among high school students.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Shooting controversies===
Rafael Solich, the perpetrator of the 2004 Carmen de Patagones school shooting had watched the film days prior to the shooting.

The Red Lake shootings that occurred in 2005 were briefly blamed on the film, as it was viewed by gunman Jeff Weise 17 days prior to the event. A friend of Weise said that he brought the film over to a friend&#x27;s house and skipped ahead to parts that showed two students planning and carrying out a school massacre. Although they talked about the film afterwards, Weise said and did nothing to make anyone suspect what he was planning.

During the Suzano school shooting that occurred in 2019, both perpetrators were seen wearing clothing that resembled that of the main characters of &quot;Elephant&quot;.

<doc id="234388" wikidata="Q7661298" url="?curid=234388" title="Symmes Township, Hamilton County, Ohio">
<text>Symmes Township ( ) is one of the twelve townships of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 15,642 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Symmes Township is located in what was originally the Symmes Purchase. The township was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly on January 19, 1822. However, its year of establishment is usually given as 1824, as seen in the township&#x27;s previous logo. In 1853, the Little Miami Railroad was completed, connecting the township to Cincinnati. Symmes Township survived a 1994 attempt to merge with Loveland, as well as efforts the following year to incorporate most of Symmes and Deerfield Townships as the City of Heritage.

===Name===
Named for John Cleves Symmes, it is one of two Symmes Townships statewide; the other Symmes Township is located in Lawrence County.

==Geography==
Located in the northeastern corner of the county, the township has been cut into two &quot;islands&quot; due to annexations by surrounding cities. They have the following borders:

===The northern island===
*Deerfield Township, Warren County – north
*Hamilton Township, Warren County – northeast
*Loveland – east
*Miami Township, Clermont County – southeast
*Indian Hill – south
*Montgomery – southwest
*Sycamore Township – west

===The southern island===
*Miami Township, Clermont County – north and east
*Columbia Township – south
*Indian Hill – west

===Unincorporated communities===
The cities of Indian Hill, Loveland, and Montgomery have annexed large portions of Symmes Township, especially Indian Hill. The following census-designated places (unincorporated communities) are in the township:
*Camp Dennison, in the southern part of the township
*Loveland Park, in the northeastern corner, extending north into Warren County
*Remington, in the southern tip of the northern &quot;island&quot;
*Sixteen Mile Stand, in the western portion of the northern &quot;island&quot;

==Demographics==

===2020 census===
As of the census of 2020, there were 15,642 people living in the township, for a population density of 1,858.4 people per square mile (717.5/km2). There were 6,001 housing units. The racial makeup of the township was 72.4% White, 4.8% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 14.1% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 1.0% from some other race, and 7.5% from two or more races. 4.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

<doc id="234393" wikidata="Q274782" url="?curid=234393" title="Dignity">
<text>Dignity is the right of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. In this context, it is of significance in morality, ethics, law and politics as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in &quot;behaving with dignity&quot;. 

The content of contemporary dignity is derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, summarized in the principle that every human being has the right to human dignity. In Article 1, it is stipulated that &#x27;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;dignity&quot;, attested from the early 13th century, comes from Latin concept of &quot;&quot;, variously translated as &quot;worthiness&quot; or &quot;prestige&quot;,
by way of French &quot;&quot;.

== Modern use ==
English-speakers often use the word &quot;dignity&quot; in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and vulnerable groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.

&quot;Dignity&quot; also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the &quot;worth&quot; of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.

In ordinary modern usage, the word denotes &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;status&quot;, and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special philosophical use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions. International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined, and scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and algeny, cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.

Aurel Kolnai states:
Dignity also tends to connote the features of self-contained serenity, of a certain inward and toned-down but yet translucent and perceptible power of self-assertion: the dignified type of character is chary of emphatic activity rather than sullenly passive, perhaps impassive rather than impassible, patient rather than anxiously defensive, and devoid but not incapable of aggressiveness.

== Violations ==

=== Categories ===
Human dignity can be violated in multiple ways. The main categories of violations are:
; Humiliation: Violations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, &quot;it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. &#x27;I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is. More generally, etymology of the word &quot;humiliation&quot; has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves &quot;downward spatial orientation&quot; in which &quot;something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there&quot;. This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people&#x27;s self-worth or their self-esteem.
; Instrumentalization or objectification: This aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on Immanuel Kant&#x27;s moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized. 
; Degradation: Violations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices and acts that modern society generally considers unacceptable for human beings, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. 
; Dehumanization: These are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.

=== Examples ===
Some of the practices that violate human dignity include torture, rape, social exclusion, labor exploitation, bonded labor, and slavery. 

Both absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice. Absolute poverty is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people&#x27;s garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. Relative poverty, on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.

Another example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of sanitation. Having no access to toilets leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to defecation in the open, which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity. Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for &quot;manual scavenging&quot; of human excreta from unsanitary toiletsusually by people of a lower caste, and more often by women than men. Female genital mutilation (FGM) has been considered by Pope Francis I to be an example of a practice that violates human dignity.

The movie &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; depicts a wealthy man (Peter Sellers) and his son (Ringo Starr) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money. The &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot; has a similar plot.

==Philosophical history==
===Pico della Mirandola===
A philosopher of the Renaissance, Pico della Mirandola, granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of angels. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers. This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the Renaissance, intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.

===Kant===

A philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment (18th century), Immanuel Kant held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity. &#x27;Value&#x27; is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer&#x27;s judgment of that thing. Things that are &quot;not&quot; relativethat are &quot;ends in themselves&quot;, in Kant&#x27;s terminologyare by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an &quot;end in itself&quot; only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant&#x27;s words: &quot;Morality, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity.&quot; Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that &quot;free will&quot; is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.

===Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth===
Philosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth. Gewirth&#x27;s views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant&#x27;s, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency. But while sharing Kant&#x27;s view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of &quot;well-being&quot;.

Among other topics, including the dignity of labor, Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity. According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals. &quot;The dignity of man,&quot; he said, &quot;is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things.&quot; To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.

===Others===
Dan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with &#x27;being human&#x27; (Egonsson&#x27;s &#x27;Standard Attitude&#x27;, Wertheimer&#x27;s &#x27;Standard Belief&#x27;), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity. Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and &quot;alive&quot; to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states &quot;it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status.&quot;

According to Arthur Schopenhauer, dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.

Karl Marx&#x27;s views on dignity were complex, and debates over the role of dignity in his thought relate to the question of whether Marx&#x27;s critique of capitalism had a moral dimension. Marx wrote positively about dignity in his early work, and suggested it could underpin his theory of alienation; however he elsewhere rejected the view that humans have a right to dignity, and argued that moral norms could not form the basis of a critique of capitalism because they form part of society&#x27;s ideological superstructure. The philosopher Somogy Varga argues that Marx&#x27;s account of dignity forms part of a critique of Kantian ethics as unjusifiably imagining moral values to be transhistorical rather than emerging from historical processes and social practices.

More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, &quot;it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide.&quot;

==Religion==
Human dignity is a central consideration of Christian philosophy. The Catechism of the Catholic Church insists that the &quot;dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and likeness of God&quot;. &quot;All human beings&quot;, says the Church, &quot;in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person.&quot; The catechism states in CCC 1703 (to be fact checked) that &quot;the right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person&quot;, and also links animal welfare to human dignity: &quot;it is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly&quot;.

The Catholic Church proclaims the equal dignity of all people, regardless of their living conditions or qualities. This dignity &quot;comes from the love of the Creator&quot; for humans that are created in his image; this dignity was further elevated by the incarnation and resurrection of Christ, since it caused humans to share the nature of God. Specifically, human dignity is intrinsic to human persons, and does not spring from agency or free will. 

Human dignity, or &quot;kevod ha-beriyot&quot;, is also a central consideration of Judaism. &quot;Talmud&quot; cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient. Medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides, in his codification of &quot;Halakha&quot;, cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: &quot;Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command&quot;.

An Islamic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus, Muhammed, and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. &quot;The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him&quot; (Quran 31:22). Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: &quot;We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws.&quot; (Quran 37:80) Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: &quot;Therefore We have saved you and your son from this. We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps.&quot; (37:104–105) The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God&#x27;s Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity&#x27;s full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri, head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in Iran, in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal &quot;potential&quot;, but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God. This is in keeping with the 1990 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which states that &quot;True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection&quot;.

Ultimately, the Buddhist understanding of human dignity is rooted in the idea that people are able to choose the path of self-perfection. The state of self-perfection, a condition of fully developed courage, wisdom and compassion, is described as Buddhahood or enlightenment. The idea that all people—all life, in fact—have this potential is expressed by the concept, stressed particularly in the Mahayana tradition, that all living beings possess Buddha nature.

==United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights==
==Medicine==
In the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the bioethics of human genetic engineering, human cloning, and end-of-life care (particularly in such situations as the Terri Schiavo case, a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a persistent vegetative state).

===International bodies===
In June 1964, the World Medical Association issued the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot;. The Declaration says at article 11, &quot;It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects.&quot;

The Council of Europe invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the council, at Oviedo, approved the &quot;Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine&quot;. The convention&#x27;s preamble contains these statements, among others:

The Convention states, &quot;Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine.&quot;

In 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the &quot;UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights&quot;. At Article 2, the declaration states, &quot;Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity.&quot; At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect &quot;could be contrary to human dignity.&quot; The &quot;Commentary&quot; that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, &quot;it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake.&quot;

===Canada===
In 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled &quot;New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies&quot;. The report used &quot;the principles of respect for human life and dignity&quot; as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were &quot;contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity.&quot;

===Denmark===
The Ministry of Health enacted the &quot;Danish Council Act 1988&quot;, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned &quot;reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos.&quot;

===France===
In 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, &quot;Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or
rules to be observed by research.&quot; The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to &quot;the rule of reason&quot; and must have regard for &quot;undefined dignity in its practical consequences.&quot; The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are &quot;respecting human dignity&quot; and respecting &quot;the dignity of science.&quot;

===Portugal===
The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its &quot;Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning&quot; in 1997. The opinion states, &quot;the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited.&quot;

===Sweden===
Sweden&#x27;s &quot;The Genetic Integrity Act&quot; (2006:351), &quot;The Biobanks in Medical Care Act&quot; (2002:297), &quot;Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act&quot; (1998:531), and &quot;The Health and Medical Services Act&quot; (1982:763) all express concern for &quot;the integrity of the individual&quot; or &quot;human dignity.&quot;

===United States===
In 2008, The President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the council&#x27;s chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, &quot;… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity.&quot;

==Law==
McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law. They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a &quot;natural law approach.&quot; The natural law approach, they said, depends upon &quot;exercises of faith.&quot; McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:
===Canada===
In 2004, Canada enacted the &quot;Assisted Human Reproduction Act&quot;. Section 2(b) of the Act states, &quot;the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research.&quot; The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a chimera.

=== European Union ===

Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms the inviolability of human dignity.

===France===
In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France&#x27;s dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old. The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France. The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization.

===Germany===
Human dignity is the fundamental principle of the German constitution. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: &quot;Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.&quot; Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the right to life. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:

*Human dignity is the basis of § 131 of the German criminal code, which prohibits the depiction of cruelty against humans in an approving way. § 131 has been used to confiscate horror movies and to ban video games like &quot;Manhunt&quot; and the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series.
*A decision by the German Federal Constitutional Court in 1977 said life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional as a violation of human dignity (and the &quot;Rechtsstaat&quot; principle). Today, a prisoner serving a life term can be granted parole on good behavior as early as 15 years after being incarcerated, provided that his release is held to constitute little danger to the public. Persons deemed still dangerous can be incarcerated indefinitely on a life term, if this judgment is regularly reaffirmed.
*§ 14(3) of the Luftsicherheitsgesetz, which would have allowed the Bundeswehr to shoot down airliners if they are used as weapons by terrorists, was declared unconstitutional mainly on the grounds of human dignity: killing a small number of innocent people to save a large number cannot be legalized since it treats dignity as if it were a measurable and limited quantity.
*A Benetton advertisement showing human buttocks with an &quot;H.I.V. positive&quot; stamp was declared a violation of human dignity by some courts, but in the end found legal.
*The first German law legalizing abortion in 1975 was declared unconstitutional because the court held that embryos had human dignity. A new law on abortion was developed in the 1990s. This law makes all abortions &quot;de jure&quot; illegal, except if preceded by counseling (§ 219(1) of the German criminal code).
*In a decision from 1981, the German Federal Administrative Court declared that peep shows violated the human dignity of the performer, regardless of their feelings. The decision was later revised. Peep shows where the performer cannot see the persons who are watching them remain prohibited as a matter of dignity.

===India===
The word &#x27;dignity&#x27; is mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution of India:

The preamble is widely regarded as the backbone of the Indian constitution, and is seen as embodying its spirit. There have been instances where in contentious situations like the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, criticisms have been made by recalling the constitutional Values of dignity and national integrity, as mentioned in the Preamble.

===Iran===
The need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that &quot;the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God&quot;[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.

===South Africa===
The Constitution of South Africa lists &quot;human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms&quot; as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the Bill of Rights is described as affirming the &quot;democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom&quot;. Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that &quot;Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.&quot; In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to criminal punishment, the law of defamation, and the right to marriage and family life.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss Federal Constitution provides in article 7 that &quot;Human dignity must be respected and protected.&quot; It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must &quot;take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment&quot; when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled &quot;The dignity of living beings with regard to plants&quot;.
