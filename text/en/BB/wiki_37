<text>The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) is a worldwide network of spacecraft communication ground segment facilities, located in the United States (California), Spain (Madrid), and Australia (Canberra), that supports NASA&#x27;s interplanetary spacecraft missions. It also performs radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the Solar System and the universe, and supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

== General information ==

DSN currently consists of three deep-space communications facilities located such that a distant spacecraft is always in view of at least one station.&lt;ref name=&quot;NF-151/7-87&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

* the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex () about north of Barstow, California. For details of Goldstone&#x27;s contribution to the early days of space probe tracking, see Project Space Track;
* the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (), west of Madrid, Spain; and
* the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) in the Australian Capital Territory (), southwest of Canberra, Australia near the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.

Each facility is situated in semi-mountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to help shield against radio frequency interference. The strategic placement of the stations permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates, which helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world.

The DSN supports NASA&#x27;s contribution to the scientific investigation of the Solar System: It provides a two-way communications link that guides and controls various NASA uncrewed interplanetary space probes, and brings back the images and new scientific information these probes collect. All DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, parabolic reflector antennas.
The antennas and data delivery systems make it possible to:

* acquire telemetry data from spacecraft.
* transmit commands to spacecraft.
* upload software modifications to spacecraft.
* track spacecraft position and velocity.
* perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.
* measure variations in radio waves for radio science experiments.
* gather science data.
* monitor and control the performance of the network.

Other countries and organizations also run deep space networks. The DSN operates according to the standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, as do most other deep space networks, and hence the DSN is able to inter-operate with the networks of other space agencies. These include the Soviet Deep Space Network, the Chinese Deep Space Network, the Indian Deep Space Network, the Japanese Deep Space Network, and the ESTRACK of the European Space Agency. These agencies often cooperate for better mission coverage. In particular, DSN has a cross-support agreement with ESA that allows mutual use of both networks for more effectiveness and reduced risk. In addition, radio astronomy facilities, such as Parkes Observatory or the Green Bank Telescope, are sometimes used to supplement the antennas of the DSN.

===Operations control center===
The antennas at all three DSN Complexes communicate directly with the Deep Space Operations Center (also known as Deep Space Network operations control center) located at the JPL facilities in Pasadena, California.

In the early years, the operations control center did not have a permanent facility. It was a provisional setup with numerous desks and phones installed in a large room near the computers used to calculate orbits. In July 1961, NASA started the construction of the permanent facility, Space Flight Operations Facility (SFOF). The facility was completed in October 1963 and dedicated on May 14, 1964. In the initial setup of the SFOF, there were 31 consoles, 100 closed-circuit television cameras, and more than 200 television displays to support Ranger 6 to Ranger 9 and Mariner 4.

Currently, the operations center personnel at SFOF monitor and direct operations, and oversee the quality of spacecraft telemetry and navigation data delivered to network users. In addition to the DSN complexes and the operations center, a ground communications facility provides communications that link the three complexes to the operations center at JPL, to space flight control centers in the United States and overseas, and to scientists around the world.

==Deep space==
Tracking vehicles in deep space is quite different from tracking missions in low Earth orbit (LEO). Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface, and so require few stations (the DSN has only three main sites). These few stations, however, require huge antennas, ultra-sensitive receivers, and powerful transmitters in order to transmit and receive over the vast distances involved.

Deep space is defined in several different ways. According to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was designed to communicate with &quot;spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from Earth to the farthest planets of the solar system.&quot; JPL diagrams state that at an altitude of , a spacecraft is always in the field of view of one of the tracking stations. The International Telecommunication Union, which sets aside various frequency bands for deep space and near Earth use, defines &quot;deep space&quot; to start at a distance of from the Earth&#x27;s surface.

=== Frequency bands ===
The NASA Deep Space Network can both send and receive in all of the ITU deep space bands - S-band (2 GHz), X-band (8 GHz), and Ka-band (32 GHz).

However, not all space missions can use these bands. The Moon, the Earth-moon Lagrange points, and the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points L1 and L2 are all closer than 2 million km from Earth (distances are here), so they are considered near space and cannot use the ITU&#x27;s deep space bands. Missions at these locations that need high data rates must therefore use the &quot;near space&quot; K band (27 GHz). Since NASA has several such missions (such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter), they have enhanced the Deep Space Network to receive (but not transmit) at these frequencies as well.

The DSN is also pursuing optical deep space communication, offering greater communication speeds at the cost of susceptibility to weather and the need for extremely precise pointing of the spacecraft. This technology is working in prototype form.

== History ==
The forerunner of the DSN was established in January 1958, when JPL, then under contract to the U.S. Army, deployed portable radio tracking stations in Nigeria, Singapore, and California to receive telemetry and plot the orbit of the Army-launched Explorer 1, the first successful U.S. satellite. NASA was officially established on October 1, 1958, to consolidate the separately developing space-exploration programs of the US Army, US Navy, and US Air Force into one civilian organization.

On December 3, 1958, JPL was transferred from the US Army to NASA and given responsibility for the design and execution of lunar and planetary exploration programs using remotely controlled spacecraft. Shortly after the transfer, NASA established the concept of the Deep Space Network as a separately managed and operated communications system that would accommodate all deep space missions, thereby avoiding the need for each flight project to acquire and operate its own specialized space communications network. The DSN was given responsibility for its own research, development, and operation in support of all of its users. Under this concept, it has become a world leader in the development of low-noise receivers; large parabolic-dish antennas; tracking, telemetry, and command systems; digital signal processing; and deep space navigation. The Deep Space Network formally announced its intention to send missions into deep space on Christmas Eve 1963; it has remained in continuous operation in one capacity or another ever since.

The largest antennas of the DSN are often called on during spacecraft emergencies. Almost all spacecraft are designed so normal operation can be conducted on the smaller (and more economical) antennas of the DSN, but during an emergency the use of the largest antennas is crucial. This is because a troubled spacecraft may be forced to use less than its normal transmitter power, attitude control problems may preclude the use of high-gain antennas, and recovering every bit of telemetry is critical to assessing the health of the spacecraft and planning the recovery. The most famous example is the Apollo 13 mission, where limited battery power and inability to use the spacecraft&#x27;s high-gain antennas reduced signal levels below the capability of the Manned Space Flight Network, and the use of the biggest DSN antennas (and the Australian Parkes Observatory radio telescope) was critical to saving the lives of the astronauts. While Apollo was also a US mission, DSN provides this emergency service to other space agencies as well, in a spirit of inter-agency and international cooperation. For example, the recovery of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) would not have been possible without the use of the largest DSN facilities.

=== DSN and the Apollo program ===
Although normally tasked with tracking uncrewed spacecraft, the Deep Space Network (DSN) also contributed to the communication and tracking of Apollo missions to the Moon, although primary responsibility was held by the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN). The DSN designed the MSFN stations for lunar communication and provided a second antenna at each MSFN site (the MSFN sites were near the DSN sites for just this reason). Two antennas at each site were needed both for redundancy and because the beam widths of the large antennas needed were too small to encompass both the lunar orbiter and the lander at the same time. DSN also supplied some larger antennas as needed, in particular for television broadcasts from the Moon, and emergency communications such as Apollo 13.

Excerpt from a NASA report describing how the DSN and MSFN cooperated for Apollo:


The details of this cooperation and operation are available in a two-volume technical report from JPL.

== Management ==
The network is a NASA facility and is managed and operated for NASA by JPL, which is part of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Interplanetary Network Directorate (IND) manages the program within JPL and is charged with the development and operation of it. The IND is considered to be JPL&#x27;s focal point for all matters relating to telecommunications, interplanetary navigation, information systems, information technology, computing, software engineering, and other relevant technologies. While the IND is best known for its duties relating to the Deep Space Network, the organization also maintains the JPL Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS) and JPL&#x27;s Institutional Computing and Information Services (ICIS).

The facilities in Spain and Australia are jointly owned and operated in conjunction with that government&#x27;s scientific institutions. In Australia, &quot;the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), an Australian
Commonwealth Government Statutory Authority, established the CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science Division to manage the day-to-day operations, engineering, and maintenance activities of the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex&quot;. Most of the staff at Tidbinbilla are Australian government employees; the land and buildings are owned by the Australian government; NASA provides the bulk of the funding, owns the movable property (such as dishes and electronic equipment) which it has paid for, and gets to decide where to point the dishes. Similarly, in Spain, &quot;Ingenieria de Sistemas para la Defensa de España S.A. (ISDEFE), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA) and a part of the Spanish Department of Defense, operates and maintains the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (Madrid)&quot;.

Peraton (formerly Harris Corporation) is under contract to JPL for the DSN&#x27;s operations and maintenance. Peraton has responsibility for managing the Goldstone complex, operating the DSOC, and for DSN operations, mission planning, operations engineering, and logistics.

== Antennas ==

Each complex consists of at least four deep space terminals equipped with ultra-sensitive receiving systems and large parabolic-dish antennas. There are:

* Three or more Beam waveguide antennas (BWG)
* One antenna.

Five of the beam waveguide antennas were added to the system in the late 1990s. Three were located at Goldstone, and one each at Canberra and Madrid. A second beam waveguide antenna (the network&#x27;s sixth) was completed at the Madrid complex in 2004.

In order to meet the current and future needs of deep space communication services, a number of new Deep Space Station antennas had to be built at the existing Deep Space Network sites. At the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex the first of these was completed in October 2014 (DSS35), with a second becoming operational in October 2016 (DSS36). A new 34 meter dish (DSS53) became operational at the Madrid complex in February 2022.

By 2025, the 70-meter antennas at all three locations will be decommissioned and replaced with 34-meter BWG antennas that will be arrayed. All systems will be upgraded to have X-band uplink capabilities and both X and Ka-band downlink capabilities.

== Current signal processing capabilities ==

The general capabilities of the DSN have not substantially changed since the beginning of the Voyager Interstellar Mission in the early 1990s. However, many advancements in digital signal processing, arraying and error correction have been adopted by the DSN.

The ability to array several antennas was incorporated to improve the data returned from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; Neptune encounter, and extensively used for the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission, when the spacecraft&#x27;s high-gain antenna failed to deploy and as a result &quot;Galileo&quot; was forced to resort to operating solely off its low-gain antennas.

The DSN array currently available since the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission can link the dish antenna at the Deep Space Network complex in Goldstone, California, with an identical antenna located in Australia, in addition to two antennas at the Canberra complex. The California and Australia sites were used concurrently to pick up communications with &quot;Galileo&quot;.

Arraying of antennas within the three DSN locations is also used. For example, a dish antenna can be arrayed with a 34-meter dish. For especially vital missions, like &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, non-DSN facilities normally used for radio astronomy can be added to the array. In particular, the Canberra dish can be arrayed with the Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia; and the Goldstone 70-meter dish can be arrayed with the Very Large Array of antennas in New Mexico. Also, two or more dishes at one DSN location are commonly arrayed together.

All the stations are remotely operated from a centralized Signal Processing Center at each complex. These Centers house the electronic subsystems that point and control the antennas, receive and process the telemetry data, transmit commands, and generate the spacecraft navigation data. Once the data are processed at the complexes, they are transmitted to JPL for further processing and for distribution to science teams over a modern communications network.

Especially at Mars, there are often many spacecraft within the beam width of an antenna. For operational efficiency, a single antenna can receive signals from multiple spacecraft at the same time. This capability is called Multiple Spacecraft Per Aperture, or MSPA. Currently, the DSN can receive up to 4 spacecraft signals at the same time, or MSPA-4. However, apertures cannot currently be shared for uplink. When two or more high-power carriers are used simultaneously, very high order intermodulation products fall in the receiver bands, causing interference to the much (25 orders of magnitude) weaker received signals. Therefore, only one spacecraft at a time can get an uplink, though up to 4 can be received.

== Network limitations and challenges ==

There are a number of limitations to the current DSN, and a number of challenges going forward. Most of these are outlined in an Audit of NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network performed by NASA&#x27;s Office of Inspector General. Their main conclusions are:
* NASA&#x27;s DSN Is oversubscribed, leading to mission impacts and scheduling challenges
* Capacity limitations leading to mission impacts are expected to increase with the onset of crewed Artemis missions
* Capacity limitations, lack of readily available backups, and laborious process present challenges to scheduling time on DSN
* Upgrades to NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network Are behind schedule and more costly than planned
* Challenges with International Partners and project oversight

Other problems have been noted as well:
* The Deep Space Network nodes are all on Earth. Therefore, data transmission rates from/to spacecraft and space probes are severely constrained due to the distances from Earth. For now it can connect with the Mars orbiters in the Mars Relay Network for faster and more flexible communications with spacecraft and landers on Mars. Adding dedicated communication satellites elsewhere in space, to handle multiparty, multi-mission use, such as the canceled Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, would increase flexibility towards some sort of Interplanetary Internet. 
* The need to support &quot;legacy&quot; missions that have remained operational beyond their original lifetimes but are still returning scientific data. Programs such as Voyager have been operating long past their original mission termination date. They also need some of the largest antennas.
* Replacing major components can cause problems as it can leave an antenna out of service for months at a time.
* The older 70 m antennas are reaching the end of their lives. At some point these will need to be replaced. The leading candidate for 70 m replacement had been an array of smaller dishes, but more recently the decision was taken to expand the provision of 34-meter (112 ft) BWG antennas at each complex to a total of 4. All the 34-meter HEF antennas have been replaced.

Because of capacity limits on the DSN, new spacecraft intended for missions beyond geocentric orbits are being equipped to use the beacon mode service, which allows such missions to operate without the DSN most of the time. In addition, NASA is creating a network of Lunar Exploration Ground Sites to offload much of the lunar and Artemis mission needs from the DSN.

==DSN and radio science==

The DSN forms one portion of the radio sciences experiment included on most deep space missions, where radio links between spacecraft and Earth are used to investigate planetary science, space physics and fundamental physics. The experiments include radio occultations, gravity field determination and celestial mechanics, bistatic scattering, doppler wind experiments, solar corona characterization, and tests of fundamental physics.

For example, the Deep Space Network forms one component of the gravity science experiment on &quot;Juno&quot;. This includes special communication hardware on Juno and uses its communication system. The DSN radiates a Ka-band uplink, which is picked up by &quot;Juno&quot;″s Ka-Band communication system and then processed by a special communication box called KaTS, and then this new signal is sent back the DSN. This allows the velocity of the spacecraft over time to be determined with a level of precision that allows a more accurate determination of the gravity field at planet Jupiter.

Another radio science experiment is REX on the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft to Pluto-Charon. REX received a signal from Earth as it was occulted by Pluto, to take various measurements of that system of bodies.

;Notes
# The sun orbiting &quot;Ulysses&quot;″ extended mission operation terminated June 30, 2009. The extension permitted a third flyby over the Sun&#x27;s poles in 2007–2008.
# The two Voyager spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy, but retain the capability of returning science data from a full complement of VIM science instruments. Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating until around 2020, when the available electrical power will no longer support science instrument operation. At this time, science data return and spacecraft operations will cease.
# The Deep Space Positioning System (DSPS) is being developed.

<doc id="231524" wikidata="Q530906" url="?curid=231524" title="Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem">
<text>The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem () is the Latin Catholic ecclesiastical patriarchate in Jerusalem, officially seated in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was originally established in 1099, with the Kingdom of Jerusalem encompassing the territories in the Holy Land newly conquered by the First Crusade. From 1374 to 1847 it was a titular see, with the patriarchs of Jerusalem being based at the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura in Rome. Pope Pius IX re-established a resident Latin patriarch in 1847.

The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem is now the archbishop of Latin Church Catholics of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem with jurisdiction for all Latin Catholics in Israel, Palestinian authority, Jordan and Cyprus. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem also holds the office of grand prior of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The office of Latin patriarch of Jerusalem became vacant on 24 June 2016, and the patriarchate was managed by Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa as apostolic administrator. Pizzaballa was appointed Latin patriarch on 24 October 2020. He took possession of the see on 6 November 2020.

It is exempt, being directly subject to the Holy See (and exceptionally its Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches, which normally handles Eastern Catholics). It is not within an ecclesiastical province, and has no metropolitan functions.

The title of patriarch in the Latin Church is retained by only five archbishops: the Latin patriarchs of Jerusalem, of the West (being the pope himself), of Venice, of Lisbon and of the East Indies. Until 1964, there had also been the honorary patriarchal titles of Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch; still others were abolished earlier.

Outside the Catholic Church, the title of &quot;Patriarch of Jerusalem&quot; is also used by the Greek Orthodox patriarch, the Armenian patriarch, and within the Catholic Church it is also used titularly by the Melkite patriarch.

== History ==
Jerusalem (in Latin also Hierosolyma) was one of the Apostles&#x27; original bishoprics. It was renamed Aelia Capitolina in 135 AD, again Jerusalem in 325. In 451 it was promoted as patriarchal see. After 649, Pope Martin I appointed John of Philadelphia (Amman) as patriarchal vicar of Jerusalem to replace Sergius of Jaffa.

In 1054, the Great Schism split Christianity into the Catholic Church, which consisted of the pope of Rome and virtually all of Western Christianity; and the Eastern Orthodox Church—which consisted of the four Orthodox Christian patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, Constantinople and Alexandria—under the stewardship of Constantinople. Apart from the Maronites, most Christians in the Holy Land came under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

=== Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem ===
In 1099, the Western crusaders captured Jerusalem, set up the Kingdom of Jerusalem and established a Latin hierarchy under a Latin Patriarch (in communion with Rome), while expelling the Orthodox patriarch. The Latin Patriarchate was divided into four archdioceses—their heads bearing the titles of archbishop of Tyre, archbishop of Caesarea, archbishop of Nazareth and archbishop of Petra—and a number of suffragan dioceses. The Latin patriarch took over control of the Latin quarter of the city of Jerusalem (the Holy Sepulchre and the immediate surroundings) as his metropolitan see, and had as his direct suffragans the bishops of Lydda-Ramla, Bethlehem, Hebron and Gaza, and the abbots of the Temple, Mount Sion and the Mount of Olives.

The Latin patriarch resided in Jerusalem from 1099 to 1187, while Orthodox patriarchs continued to be appointed, but resided in Constantinople. In 1187, the crusaders were forced to flee Jerusalem, and the Latin Patriarchate moved to Acre (Akka), while the Orthodox patriarch returned to Jerusalem. The Catholic Church continued to appoint residential Latin patriarchs. The crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem endured almost 200 years until the last vestiges of the kingdom were conquered by the Muslim Mamluks in 1291, and the Latin hierarchy was effectively eliminated in the Levant.

With the fall of Acre, the Latin patriarch moved to the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1291.

=== Titular Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem ===

In 1374, the Kingdom of Cyprus underwent a severe upheaval when it was invaded by the Genoese, who conquered Famagusta and held King Peter II captive.

From that time on, the Latin patriarchs of Jerusalem ceased to reside in Cyprus. The Catholic Church continued to appoint titular patriarchs of Jerusalem, but from then on they were based at the in Rome.

In 1342, Pope Clement VI officially committed the care of the Holy Land to the Franciscans and the Franciscan Custos of the Holy Lands (the grand masters of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre) held the title &quot;ex officio&quot; under the papal bull &quot;Gratiam agimus&quot; by Clement VI, unless someone was specifically appointed to the honorary office.

In 1570, it gained territories from the suppressed Archdiocese of Nicosia and Diocese of Paphos, and in 1571 it gained more territories from the suppressed Diocese of Limassol and Diocese of Famagosta, all in former crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, which had fallen to the Ottoman Turks.

===Modern Patriarchate of Jerusalem===

A resident Latin patriarch was re-established in 1847 by Pius IX, with Bishop Joseph Valerga being appointed to the office. Though officially superseding the Franciscans, Valerga was also the grand master of the Order. On Valerga&#x27;s death in 1872, Vincent Braco was appointed, and following his death in 1889, the Ottoman sultan authorised the re-establishment of a Latin hierarchy. The grand masters of the Order continued to be named as Latin patriarchs until 1905.

The Co-Cathedral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus is the principal, or &quot;mother&quot; church of the Latin Patriarchate, the church in which the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem has his official chair (cathedra). However, the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre has the title of cathedral of the patriarchate. The residence of the patriarch is in the Old City, near the Co-Cathedral, while the seminary, which is responsible for the liturgical education, is in Beit Jala, a town 10 km south of Jerusalem, where it has been since 1936.

In 1987, Michel Sabbah became the first native Palestinian to be appointed Latin patriarch. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem is now the diocesan archbishop of Latin Catholics of the &quot;Catholic Archdiocese of Jerusalem&quot; and has jurisdiction for all Latin Church Catholics in Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Cyprus.

The prerogatives of the patriarch in his relation with government authorities overlap with the prerogatives of the apostolic nuncio to Israel and the apostolic delegate to Jerusalem and Palestine.

In 2008, Archbishop Fouad Twal was appointed patriarch to succeed Michel Sabbah. He exercised his mandate from June 21, 2008, until June 24, 2016, when he reached the canonical age of retirement and Pope Francis accepted his resignation. Pope Francis appointed Pierbattista Pizzaballa as apostolic administrator of the patriarchate and named patriarch on 24 October 2020.

Pope Paul VI visited in January 1964, Pope John Paul II in March 2000, Pope Benedict XVI in May 2009 and Pope Francis in May 2014.

== Organisation and Territory ==

The Patriarch is supported by bishops and non-bishop patriarchal vicars:

*William Shomali, Auxiliary Bishop and Vicar General of Latin Patriarchate, and Patriarchal Vicar for Jerusalem and Palestine

*Rafic Nahra, Auxiliary Bishop and Patriarchal Vicar for Israel, based in Nazareth

*Bruno Varriano, OFM, Auxiliary Bishop and Patriarchal Vicar for Cyprus, based in Nicosia

*Iyad Twal, Auxiliary Bishop-elect and Patriarchal Vicar for Jordan, based in Amman

*Piotr Zelazko, Patriarchal Vicar for the Hebrew-speaking Catholics, based in Jerusalem

*Matthew Coutinho, SDB, Patriarchal Vicar for the migrants and asylum seekers of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, based in Tel Aviv

== Statistics and extent ==
As per 2015, it pastorally served 293,053 Catholics in 66 parishes with 464 priests (81 diocesan, 383 religious), 9 deacons, 1,652 lay religious (590 brothers, 1,062 sisters) and 55 seminarians. Since then, several parishes have been added and there are now over 70 across four areas in 2023.

The proper archdiocese of the patriarchal see of Jerusalem has jurisdiction over all Latin Catholics (not Eastern Catholics) in the Holy Land (Israel, Palestine and Jordan) as well as Cyprus. In Jerusalem, the Latin Catholic community is the largest Christian community, with some 4,500 people out of an estimated Christian population of about 11,000.

== Special churches ==
In Jerusalem, the patriarch has his cathedral archiepiscopal see, a minor basilica and World Heritage Site: the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre, as well as the Co-Cathedral, also a World Heritage Site: Co-Cathedral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, and four other Minor Basilicas and World Heritage Sites: Basilica of the Agony, Basilica of St. Stephen, Dormition Abbey of the Virgin Mary and St. Anne’s Church.

Other cities in the archdiocese have more minor basilicas: Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth, Basilica of the Transfiguration in Mount Tabor, Carmelite Monastery of Stella Maris in Haifa and St. Cleophas Church in El Qubeibeh, and two other World Heritage Sites, both in Bethlehem : Church of St. Catherine and Church of the Nativity.

<text>James Kimble Vardaman (July 26, 1861 – June 25, 1930) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Mississippi. A Democrat, he served as the Governor of Mississippi from 1904 to 1908 and then represented Mississippi in the United States Senate from 1913 to 1919.

Known as &quot;The Great White Chief&quot;, Vardaman had gained electoral support for his advocacy of populism and white supremacy, saying: &quot;If it is necessary every Negro in the state will be lynched; it will be done to maintain white supremacy.&quot; Aligning with economically left-wing populists and favoring progressive reforms in railing against banks, railroads, and tariffs, he appealed to the poorer whites, yeomen farmers, and factory workers. Vardaman&#x27;s tenure as Governor of Mississippi was marked by his advocacy of regulating corporations, enacting child labor laws, segregating streetcars, ending educational opportunities for African Americans, and defending lynching. After finishing his term, he defeated Democratic incumbent LeRoy Percy, a member of the planter elite, in the primary for the 1912 U.S. Senate election, and was then elected unopposed in the general election.

==Early life and education==
Vardaman was born in July 1861 in Jackson County, Texas, while it was under the control of the Confederate States of America, a fact he often remembered. He moved to Mississippi, where he studied law and passed the bar. Hernando Money was a cousin and political ally. He settled in Greenwood, Mississippi, becoming editor of &quot;The Greenwood Commonwealth&quot;.

==Political career==

=== Early political career ===
As a Democrat, Vardaman served in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1890 to 1896 and was elected as its speaker in 1894. He was known for his populist appeal to the everyday person. State Democrats took action to ensure that they did not lose power again. After having gained control of the legislature by suppressing the black vote, they passed a new constitution in 1890 with provisions, such as a poll tax and literacy test, that raised barriers to voter registration and disenfranchised most blacks.

Referring to the 1890 Mississippi state constitution, Vardaman said:
Vardaman was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War and served in Puerto Rico.

=== Governor of Mississippi ===
Vardaman ran twice in Democratic primaries for governor, in 1895 and 1899, but was unsuccessful. The state was virtually one-party, and winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to victory in the general election for any office. In 1903 Vardaman won the primary and the general elections for governor, serving one four-year term (1904–1908). In the election, he said that &quot;a vote for Vardaman is a vote for white supremacy, a vote for the quelling of the arrogant spirit that has been aroused in the blacks by Roosevelt and his henchmen, ...a vote for the safety of the home and the protection of our women and children.&quot;

In late December 1906, he went to Scooba, in rural Kemper County, with the Mississippi National Guard, to ensure that control was established. Whites had rioted against blacks there and in Wahalak and feared retaliation; in total, two white men were killed and 13 blacks. The events were covered by the Associated Press and the &quot;New York Times&quot;, among other newspapers. During his term as governor, he called out the National Guard eleven times to prevent lynchings.

By 1910, his political coalition of chiefly poor white farmers and industrial workers began to identify proudly as &quot;rednecks.&quot; They began to wear red neckerchiefs to political rallies and picnics. Vardaman advocated a policy of state-sponsored racism against blacks and said that he supported lynching to maintain white supremacy. From 1877 to 1950, Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings in the nation. He was known as the &quot;Great White Chief.&quot; Several reforms were also carried out during his time as governor.

=== U.S. Senate ===

Vardaman was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1912 in the first popular election of the state&#x27;s senators by defeating the incumbent LeRoy Percy, a member of the planter elite, in the Democratic primary. He ran on a platform of repealing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment, which gave blacks the vote and other rights. He was unopposed in the general election. Vardaman served one term, from 1913 until 1919. He voted against the U.S. declaration of war on Germany and the entry into World War I, only five other senators voted with him. He was defeated in his primary re-election bid in 1918.

Vardaman ran in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in 1922 but was defeated in the primary runoff by U.S. Representative Hubert Stephens by 9,000 votes.

While serving as senator in Congress, Vardaman supported at the national level many reforms he advocated in Mississippi including higher tax surcharges on high incomes, government ownership of coal mines, shipping companies, telephone lines and railroads, and also long-term credit for farmers. In addition, he advocated guaranteed government pensions for the elderly.

===Rhetoric===
Vardaman was known for his provocative speeches and quotes and once called Theodore Roosevelt a &quot;little, mean, coon-flavored miscegenationist.&quot; About the education of black children, he remarked, &quot;The only effect of Negro education is to spoil a good field hand and make an insolent cook.&quot; &quot;The knowledge of books does not seem to produce any good substantial result with the Negro, but serves to sharpen his cunning, breeds hopes that cannot be fulfilled, creates an inclination to avoid labor, promotes indolence, and in turn leads to crime.&quot;

After the president of Tuskegee University, Booker T. Washington, had dined with Roosevelt, Vardaman said that the White House was &quot;so saturated with the odor of the nigger that the rats have taken refuge in the stable.&quot; Regarding Washington&#x27;s role in politics, Vardaman said: &quot;I am opposed to the nigger&#x27;s voting, it matters not what his advertised moral and mental qualifications may be. I am just as much opposed to Booker Washington, with all his Anglo-Saxon reenforcement, voting, as I am to voting by the coconut-headed, chocolate-colored typical little coon, Andy Dotson, who blacks my shoes every morning. Neither one is fit to perform the supreme functions of citizenship.&quot;

==Personal life, death, and legacy==

Vardaman married Anna Burleson Robinson. Their son, James K. Vardaman, Jr., later was appointed as a governor of the Federal Reserve System, serving from 1946 to 1958. Vardaman died on June 25, 1930, at the age of 68, at Birmingham Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

The town of Vardaman, Mississippi is named after him. There is also a Vardaman Hall at the University of Mississippi, which has borne his name since it was built in 1929. In July 2017, the University of Mississippi announced that Vardaman&#x27;s name would be removed from the building, but it still has not been removed as of September 2023.

==In popular culture==
In William Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;, a character in the Bundren family is named after the governor, presumably because the Bundrens are a family of poor, rural whites, one of Governor Vardaman&#x27;s key constituencies. And in another of Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;, Gov. Vardaman was mentioned twice; both characters who mention him express admiration for his moral views and politics.

<text>Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH (formerly MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk GmbH) is a German motorcycle manufacturer located in Zschopau, Saxony. The acronym MZ since 1956 stands for MotorenwerkeZschopau&quot; GmbH ([[German language|German]] for Zschopau engine factory). From 1992 to 1999 the company was calledMuZ, an [[acronym]] for Motorrad und Zweiradwerk&quot; (German for motorcycle and two-wheeler factory).
==Timeline==
* 1906 Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen (Denmark) buys an empty cloth factory in Zschopau
* 1907 engine supplier, producing engines for bicycles, motor-assisted bicycle
* 1917 Rasmussen invents the steam-powered car (Dampf-Kraft-Wagen), also known by its trademark DKW
* 1920 Release of the 2-stroke engines for motorcycles
* 1923 Company is renamed DKW
* 1924 DKW buys Slaby-Beringer
* 1927 Company starts racing activities
* 1928 DKW takes over the Audi factory at Zwickau
* 1929 60,000 motorcycles leave the Zschopau factory, and DKW is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world
* 1931 Introduction of DKW small cars
* 1932 The Auto Union is formed from Audi, Horch, Wanderer and DKW
* 1939 RT 125 is developed
* 1948 Now owned by the East German state, company is renamed Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau (IFA), a Communist-controlled umbrella foundation.
* 1949 Auto Union (and therefore, DKW) officially moves to Ingolstadt, Bavaria in West Germany. 
* 1950 The Zschopau works begin production of the RT 125 model, developed before the war, under the trademark IFA (Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau). This model had become patent-free after World War II as part of war reparations and was further developed in Britain (BSA Bantam), USA (Harley-Davidson Hummer), Russia (M-1A Moskva), Japan, Italy and West Germany.
* 1952 The BK350 appears, the first two-stroke shaft drive.
* 1956 The works is now called VEB Motorradwerk Zschopau, or MZ for short. 
* 1962 Manufacture of the ES 125/ES 150 begins. This was the first motorcycle with an asymmetric low beam headlight pattern.
* 1970 The millionth motorcycle rolls off the conveyor belt, an MZ ETS 250 Trophy Sport
* 1972 MZ takes over manufacture of sidecars from Stoye.
* 1983 The two millionth motorcycle rolls off the conveyor belt, this time an MZ ETZ 250. With disc brakes (drum brakes remained an option) and 12-volt electrics the MZ had reached the modern standard in motorcycle design.
* 1989 MZ ceases manufacture of sidecars.
* 1990 MZ is privatised on 18 December.
* 1993 MZ enters receivership, and the ETZ patent is sold to the Turkish firm Kanuni, which continued producing models 251 and 301. The MuZ company is formed from the remnant.
* 1996 MuZ is bought by the Malaysian corporation Hong Leong Group
* 1999 The u is dropped from the name MuZ.
* 2008 – On 9 June, Motor Cycle News reports that MZ is to cease operations at the end of 2008 because the company&#x27;s Malaysian backers had withdrawn their financial support after years of continuing losses.
* 2008 – On 12 December, the MZ factory in Zschopau closes, halting motorcycle production that had lasted 88 years in the same town. The old &#x27;East German&#x27; factory had become a night club, called MZWerk in 1992. the production had moved to Hohndorf since 1995.
* 2009 – Former Grand Prix stars Ralf Waldmann and Martin Wimmer together with his wife Dr. Martina Häger buy the MZ motorcycle brand and found Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH. The asset deal goes through on 23 March 2009 for a reported four million euros. The cash is put up Dr. Martina Häger 90% and Ralf Waldmann 10%. The new board consists of Martin Wimmer, Dr Martina Häger, Ralph Waldmann, Helmut Lichtenberg and Otto Elbers. Wimmer takes the role of MZ Managing Director. As the company&#x27;s financing for starting a production is not yet secured, the State of Saxony through the Minister of Finance, Prof. Dr. Georg Unland, commits to a local state bank guarantee in August 2009. The business plan consisted of building bicycles, motorcycles as well as developing block heating cogeneration stations of different sizes. There were plans for the firm to produce a road bike based on the Moto2 GP project bike.
* 2011 – It took two years until the local state bank guarantee was handed out in connection with the financing bank, Merkur Bank of Munich, Germany. Also investor Peter Ertel, a company shareholder since 2010, pays out Dr. Martina Häger and Ralf Waldmann in July 2011. He becomes the main shareholder of Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH.
* 2012 – In February 2012, the company struggled as two customers don&#x27;t pay their bills totalling 530,000 euros. In addition, the company Clean Mobile AG, Munich, a supplier for the electric drive units of the E-bike production has to declare insolvency. One of the customers of MZ also does not pay his bills with them. The complete production of E-bike comes to a stop. In August 2012, MZ CEO Wimmer gets a loan offer from Merkur Bank based on the company&#x27;s cash deposit at the bank. He had found a new investor to overcome the company&#x27;s difficulties and needed to bridge the time until the investment could be closed. Unforseeably, beginning of September 2012, Merkur Bank withdrew their loan offer. According to German law, Wimmer was forced to file for insolvency proceedings on September 7, 2012. This was despite the fact that the company had enough assets to continue business. At a meeting held on September 21, 2012, including all creditors and employees, Wimmer gets their consent and extension agreements to continue to run the company, only Merkur Bank wanted to have an internal meeting on September 24, 2012, before their decision. In the afternoon of September 24, 2012 they withdrew their support. On September 28, 2012, insolvency lawyer Junker gets appointed and thus Wimmer gets detracted to run the company. Nevertheless, he convinces Junker to have Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH present all their products on the world&#x27;s biggest motorcycle show, Intermot in Cologne starting on October 2. Everything had been prepared including the launch of the world&#x27;s first motorcycle with a variable valvelift and valve timing cylinder head, the MZ RT 125. Motorcycle News reported the revolutionary engine. After the show, starting October 6, 2012, Wimmer tries to save the company by finding investors to get rid of Junker. In a letter to the Merkur Bank dated October 12 the funds deposited are requested to be paid out. Merkur Bank withheld the funds and refused to pay them out. On November 5, 2012, the insolvency proceedings became irrevocable by a court decision. On November 19, 2012, Merkur Bank now do pay out the funds requested before, but meanwhile they own all assets of Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH as they had been given as guarantee for their bank credits.
* 2013 In January investor Peter Ertel sued Merkur Bank. In April Merkur Bank countersued Ertel and included Wimmer. In June Wimmer countersued Merkur Bank for the loss of his shares in Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH. The case is still ongoing under the file reference 3O 565/13 before the Landgericht Munich I, the local court in Munich, Germany. The insolvency lawyer Junker does not find any successors for Wimmer and Ertel and declares that he is unable to continue to run Motorenwerke Zschopau GmbH on April 30, 2013. On May 17, Motorcycle News reports that MZ is declared insolvent and unable to be continued.

The Zschopau works was one of the oldest motorcycle factories in the world, producing motorcycles since 1922. They were the first company to develop the two-stroke engine for vehicles and were the leader in two-stroke development worldwide. Rasmussen had begun the motorcycle production under the brand name DKW. Later he also started the car company DKW cars. In the world economic crises of 1929, four local car manufacturers under the leadership of Rasmussen&#x27;s DKW founded Auto Union, nowadays known as Audi AG car manufacturer. The best known models from Zschopau later were the two-stroke 125/150 and 250 series, with the variants ES, ETS, TS and ETZ. In the 1950s, MZ was the world leader in two-stroke engines. Especially through the work of their racing engineer and department leader Walter Kaaden their engines became nearly unbeatable and in 1961 they nearly won the world championships in the 125 cc class against Soichiro Honda&#x27;s four-stroke engines. The championship was lost through one of the biggest spy scandals in motorcycle history. The factory rider Ernst Degner fled from East Germany and brought all their knowledge to Suzuki. Walter Kaaden&#x27;s secret was stolen. He had developed the two-stroke exhaust pipe, known as expansion chamber. In 1962, with his stolen knowledge that he brought to Suzuki he won the first world title for the Japanese manufacturer. The British author Mat Oxley wrote a book about this scandal: &quot;Stealing Speed&quot;. Later MZ was one of the few producers that made motorcycles with sidecars, though prior to 1972 sidecars were manufactured by Stoye. A later version named the MuZ Voyager was an Austrian 500 cc, four-valve, rotax-equipped, retro-styled standard, custom-painted to match the model #562 sidecar made by Velorex of Czechoslovakia. However, a cease and desist order was issued in the early 1990s by Kawasaki, who owned the rights to that name, and MuZ subsequently renamed the motorcycle the Silverstar, and the sidecar-equipped version the Silverstar Gespann. Only after Hong Leong Group took over the lead of MZ Motorrad und Zweiradwerke GmbH the funding was secured to invest in the development of new engines and motorcycles. They developed with the German MZ engineers the models MZ 1000s and MZ RT 125 (with a four-stroke engine) and as a successor model to one of the most famous and copied motorcycle models in the world, the MZ RT125.

==Sports==
Activities started in 1927.

===Enduro===
Winner of International Six Day Trial: 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1987.

====Road racing====
* 1958 first wins in 125/250 cc and an overall second championship 250 cc
* The MZ two-stroke engines, developed by engineer Walter Kaaden, have influenced motorcycle racing for decades. His 1961 125 cc race engine design was the first to achieve an output of per litre. His revolutionary two-stroke system was copied widely in the 1960s by Japanese manufacturers. Suzuki two-stroke engines became competitive in motor sport only after they gained possession of Kaaden&#x27;s MZ design secrets from racer Ernst Degner after his defection from East Germany in 1961. MZs were ridden to 13 GP victories and 105 rostrum places between 1955 and 1976.
The East German government did not support the international racing aspirations of MZ. The defection to the West of Grand Prix rider Ernst Degner, complete with his theft of a set of secrets, started the end of the glory years of Kaadens bikes.
* The MZ ETZ 250 and 251 are currently being used in club racing around Britain, providing budget racing for those who want to race with all of the fun but less of the expense. The home of MZ racing is the &quot;British MZ Racing Club&quot; (BMRC).
* In 2010 MZ under Wimmer started to compete in the new Moto 2 Grand Prix class with the rider Anthony West (motorcycle racer). After initial problems (MZ were the only manufacturers to use a steel frame) Peter Rubatto, known in Germany as Mr. Superbike, took over the race team management from Ralf Waldmann. MZ scored World Championship points and managed to be in the front row of the USA Indianapolis GP in 2010. In 2011 the MZ Racing Team was extended to 2 riders, Anthony West and Max Neukirchner. The riders were managed by Marco Nicotari (Max Neukirchner) and Warren Willing (Anthony West). In the last race of the season 2011, Anthony West had a bad starting position but ran through the field. He nearly won the first Grand Prix for MZ since the 1960s. The season 2012 was unsuccessful under the influence of the financial problems. At the end of August 2012 the team had to withdraw from racing.
* The 1994 launched &quot;MZ Skorpion Sport&quot; 660 cc single got its own racing series in several countries since 1996. Famous for its precise handling, it is still a popular mount for club racing. Its Yamaha-based engine can be reliably tuned to 150 percent of its original performance. At that stage, it can become competitive in &quot;Supermono&quot; as well as single- and twin-cylinder or even already historic racing classes. Based in Germany, the low-budget one-make &quot;&quot; amateur racing series for un-, up to mildly tuned &quot;Skorpions&quot; celebrated its 25th jubilee in 2021. Which took place 19 years after the end of the base model&#x27;s production and 13 years after the factory&#x27;s final closure. Presently this makes the &quot;MZ-Cup&quot; the oldest and longest lasting one-brand and one-make cup for motorcycles worldwide. From 2022 on the &quot;MZ-Cup&quot; also opened up for off ranking guest participations of other selected single-cylinder bikes.

==Notable models==


*RT 125: 1939–1962 and 2000-today
* ES 125/150 Pressed steel frame with Earles type front suspension. Four speed, six volt, pre-mix.
* ES 250 : Utilized a pressed steel body with Earles type front suspension.
* ETS 250 : Sports version of the ES but with more traditional type of tank and telescopic forks. The distinctive fuel tank makes this model a desirable classic motorcycle.
* TS 125/150 : Direct descendants of the RT 125, and the last MZs to use &quot;premix&quot; fuel and a 6-volt electrical system.
* TS 250: Developed from the ES/ETS machines but with a new frame. The engine hung from the top beam pivoting at the rear with no front down tube. Early models were four-speed machines with the vertical finned cylinder head but the later machines had the flat top engine and five-speed gear box, the basis of the later models. These models were all 6-volt and pre-mix fuel.
* ETZ 250 : The first road going MZ to include a disk front brake and automatic oil injection. There has been a special model ETZ250A which equipped the GDR&#x27;s army and has been exported to several countries of the former east block.
* ETZ 251 : Derived from the ETZ 250 but with modifications to the motor and chassis. A 300 cc version was also marketed.
* ETZ 125/150 : Similar to the ETZ 251 in appearance but with an updated 125/150 motor, now with the flat-topped cylinder head, five-speed gearbox and autolube. The design of the engine was still derived from the original DKW design, apparent from the concentric kick start and gear lever arrangement.
* 500R : MZ&#x27;s first four-stroke motorcycle, essentially an ETZ 251 with a Rotax 500 cc engine fitted, although the engine was no longer rubber mounted and a front down tube provided extra support.
* MZ Skorpion: The 500 cc Rotax engine used on the Seymour-Powell designed prototype was replaced with a 660 cc Yamaha water-cooled engine on the production vehicle.
*MZ 1000S: MZ&#x27;s biggest bike, and their first &quot;in-house&quot; four-stroke engine. The MZ 1000S is the most powerful inline twin cylinder engine worldwide.

==UK Importer &quot;Specials&quot;==
In the early 1980s in the UK, MZ were regarded by the motorcycle press as producing ugly and old-fashioned (if worthy) motorcycles. The then importer, Wilf Green, decided to try and update the image of the bikes by producing his own modified versions of the TS125, christened the “Pathfinder” and the “Sport”.

Both bikes were, in essence, standard TS125 deluxe models with remodelled fuel tanks and a remodelled, shortened GRP rear mudguard. The Sport also had a re-sculpted seat whereas the Pathfinder was transformed into a budget trial bike with the addition of knobbly tyres, high level front mudguard, motocross bars, high level exhaust and remodelled airbox. Neither bike was produced in great numbers.

Wilf Green subsequently created the ETZ300 (as distinct from the later, factory produced ETZ301), which was essentially a standard ETZ250 with a re-bored (and slightly restyled) engine, cockpit fairing and revised decals. Shortly after releasing this bike, however, Wilf Green lost the MZ import franchise meaning an end to importer-modified special editions in the UK.

==Most recent models==

MZ manufactured a line of 125 cc four-stroke motorcycles using an engine that was designed in-house. The MZ 125 produces and nearly of torque. It is a liquid-cooled, dual-overhead-cam design with four valves, high-voltage electronic ignition and an 11,000 rpm ignition cut-off. This engine was used in four models, all of which share a common frame. The frame is a tube-steel backbone with the engine as a stressed bottom member. Differences in the suspension, fascia, gearing, and equipment make the four models relatively distinct, despite the shared platform. All four bikes feature a six-speed transmission and dual disc brakes.

* The RT-125 is a mini naked sport bike introduced in 2000. It features a 125 cc liquid-cooled DOHC single-cylinder engine, developing 15 bhp.
* The 125-SM is a Supermotard style bike with taller street tuned suspension, tallish gearing, and reduced weight.
* The 125-SX features the same appearance as the SM but has a suspension tuned more for off-road use, enduro-style tires, and slightly lower gear ratios.
* The 125 FunX is a minimalist light-duty motocross bike.

All four 125s are capable of speeds over , with the fastest being the RT and SM, both of which are capable of sustained speeds.

MZ also used a Yamaha-built 660 cc single in the Baghira line of mid-displacement Enduro/DualPurpose/Motard bikes.

The last new MZ model was the 1000S which featured a novel 1000 cc, DOHC parallel twin designed and built by MZ. The 1000S is a sport-tourer by design. The 1000S&#x27; unique engine is exceptionally compact for its displacement. The range includes a naked (unfaired) version and a full tourer with luggage, higher handlebars, and lower footpegs for comfort. Both of these are retuned, with less outright horsepower than the &#x27;S&#x27;, but with more torque.

In addition to the 1000S, MZ also produced the naked version of the 1000S, known as the MZ1000SF, and the sports touring version called the MZ1000ST. MZ also produces its own lines of scooters called the MZ Moskito, powered by a 50 cc two-stroke engine.

Besides scooters, MZ also produced its own line of underbone motorcycles, targeted for the Southeast Asian market. Their debut underbone model was the MZ Perintis 120, launched in 2002. The Perintis was succeeded by the MZ Mantizz series, launched in 2004. The Mantizz series has two displacement options – 125 cc and 110 cc. All MZ underbone models are powered by four-stroke engines and are manufactured in MZ&#x27;s Malaysian plant in Shah Alam.

MZ also competed in the European GP-500 class with race-only models, and built several scooter and ATV models ranging in displacement from 50 cc to 185 cc, as well as the Charlie electric scooter, the fastest stand-up electric scooter produced.

As of January 2010 only the Charlie electric scooter is in production, and the company is under new owners.

<doc id="231535" wikidata="Q590301" url="?curid=231535" title="William Bennett (flautist)">
<text>William Ingham Brooke Bennett (7 February 1936 – 11 May 2022) was a British flautist and teacher. He played in many English orchestras and chamber music ensembles, and as a soloist. He made more than 100 recordings, including chamber music with partners including George Malcolm, Osian Ellis, and Yehudi Menuhin. He premiered flute concertos written for him, by William Mathias, Diana Burrell and Raimundo Pineda. Bennett taught at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg in Germany and the Royal Academy of Music, and held master classes worldwide.

== Early life and studies ==
William Ingham Brooke Bennett was born in London to parents who were both architects. He boarded at Beltane School until he was 16, starting his school life as a seven-year-old during the Second World War. He started playing the recorder at the age of 8 and the flute at 12. He studied the flute in London with Geoffrey Gilbert from the age of 15 and went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama a year later. Instead of doing two years of compulsory national military service after the war, he chose instead to serve three years in the Scots Guards band, which allowed him to continue his studies at the Guildhall School of Music. He went to Paris on a French government scholarship at 21, where he had lessons with Fernand Caratgé and Jean-Pierre Rampal. In the 1960s, he studied with Marcel Moyse.

== Career and recordings ==
At the age of 22, Bennett started working in his first principal flute position in the BBC Northern Orchestra (now the BBC Philharmonic). He played with major British orchestras, including Sadlers Wells Opera, the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He played and recorded with chamber music ensembles, including the Melos Ensemble, Nash Ensemble, Vesuvius Ensemble and Prometheus Ensemble.

As a soloist he had partnerships with harpsichordist George Malcolm, with whom he recorded the complete Bach flute sonatas and Mozart concertos, and with pianist Clifford Benson and harpist Osian Ellis, with whom he recorded extensively. In his solo recordings he partnered with Yehudi Menuhin, the Grumiaux Trio, I Musici, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and the English Chamber Orchestra, and also recorded with artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Wynton Marsalis. He rerecorded the complete Handel flute sonatas, with Harold Lester, and contemporary works such as Berio&#x27;s &quot;Sequenza&quot;, Boulez&#x27;s Sonatine, Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Merle Noir&quot;, and Richard Rodney Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Winter Music&quot; which was composed for him.

In addition to recording the standard flute repertoire, he made first recordings of 19th century works by Ferdinand Ries, Bernhard Romberg, and Paul Taffanel. He premiered concertos by William Mathias, Diana Burrell and Venezuelan composer Raimundo Pineda, written for him. Bennett had his own record label, &quot;Beep Records&quot;. In the 1980s, he was professor of flute at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg in Germany, and he taught at the Royal Academy of Music in London and at masterclasses all over the world. Bennett ran his own school, the International Flute Summer School, and was president of the British Flute Society.

== Personal life ==
Bennett was usually known by his initials, WIBB. He had two daughters from his first marriage (1961) to cellist Rhuna Martin. His elder daughter, Vanora Bennett, is a writer; his younger daughter is an Arabist who works as a translator for international organizations. In 1981, he married Michie, a fellow flautist who is producer and director of Beep Records, and has run the International Flute Summer School for 35 years. Bennett had skills in art.

Bennett died on 11 May 2022 at age 86.
== Awards and recognition ==
For his distinguished services to music, Bennett was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1995. He was appointed Flautist Laureate by the British Flute Society in 2003. In 2004, he gained the title of Flute of Gold from the Italian Falaut Flute society. He also received two Lifetime Achievement Awards, one from the National Flute Association in 2002 and another from the Chicago Flute Club in 2009.
In 2018, he was awarded the Walter Willson Cobbett Medal by the Worshipful Company of Musicians &quot;in recognition of services to chamber music&quot;.

== William Bennett scale ==
In addition to making a balalaika and a guitar whilst still at school, Bennett&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the intonation of his flute led him to start altering the position of the tone holes of his flute when he was 18 years old. He invented the tuning patch, and then built his own flute at age 20. He worked to improve the scale further, in collaboration with other British flautists and makers, which helped to improve the intonation of the modern flute. Many makers use the William Bennett scales, including Altus Flute.

== Recordings ==
Bennett made more than 100 recordings, including:

* &quot;Paul Taffanel: Mignon Fantasie&quot; (Southern Music)

Also known as the High Point Special Facility (HPSF), its preferred designation since 1991 is &quot;SF&quot;.

The facility is a major relocation site for the highest level of civilian and military officials in case of national disaster, playing a major role in continuity of government (per the U.S. Continuity of Operations Plan).

Mount Weather is the location of a control station for the FEMA National Radio System (FNARS), a high frequency radio system connecting most federal public safety agencies and the U.S. military with most of the states. FNARS allows the president to access the Emergency Alert System.

The site was brought into the public eye in 1974 by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the Associated Press, which mentioned the facility following the crash of TWA Flight 514, a Boeing 727 jetliner, into Mount Weather on December 1 of that year resulting in the deaths of 92 people.

== Location ==
Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains, access to the operations center is available via State Route 601 (also called Blueridge Mountain Road) in Bluemont, Virginia. The facility is located near Purcellville, Virginia, west of Washington, D.C.

The site was originally opened as a weather station in the late 1800s. William Jackson Humphreys was selected as the supervising director for the Mount Weather Research Observatory, which was operational from 1904 to 1914. In 1928, the observatory building was the summer White House for Calvin Coolidge. The site was used as a Civilian Public Service facility (Camp #114) during World War II. At that time, there were just two permanent buildings on the site: the administration/dormitory building, and the laboratory. Those buildings still stand, supplemented by many more modern buildings.

The underground facility within Mount Weather, designated &quot;Area B&quot;, was completed in 1959. FEMA established training facilities on the mountain&#x27;s surface (&quot;Area A&quot;) in 1979.

The above-ground portion of the FEMA complex (Area A) is at least . This measurement includes a training area of unspecified size. Area B, the underground component, contains .

== Notable activations and evacuations ==
The Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center saw the first full-scale activation of the facility during the Northeast blackout of 1965.

According to a letter to the editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, after the September 11 attacks, most of the congressional leadership were evacuated to Mount Weather by helicopter.

Between 1979 and 1981, the National Gallery of Art developed a program to transport valuable paintings in its collection to Mount Weather via helicopter. The success of the relocation would depend upon how far in advance warning of an attack was received.

== In the media ==

The first video of Mount Weather shot from the air to be broadcast on national TV was filmed by ABC News producer Bill Lichtenstein, and was included in the 1983 &quot;20/20&quot; segment &quot;Nuclear Preparation: Can We Survive&quot;, featuring &quot;20/20&quot; correspondent Tom Jarriel. Lichtenstein flew over the Mount Weather facility with an ABC camera crew. The news magazine report also included House Majority Leader Tip O&#x27;Neill and Representative Ed Markey, confirming that there were contingency plans for the relocation of the United States government in the event of a nuclear war or major disaster.

Both Mount Weather and the now deactivated bunker at The Greenbrier were featured in the A&amp;E documentary &quot;Bunkers&quot;. The documentary, first broadcast on October 23, 2001, features interviews with engineers and political and intelligence analysts, and compared The Greenbrier and Mount Weather to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s control bunker buried beneath Baghdad.

Author William Poundstone investigated Mount Weather in his 1989 book &quot;Bigger Secrets&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
While the novel &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; mentions a facility called Mount Thunder, a reference to Mount Weather, the road descriptions in the book make it quite clear that it is the same facility. It is also referred to in the movie based on the book, filmed during the Kennedy Administration and released in 1964.

Mount Weather has been the setting for several apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fictional works. These include the 2002 series finale of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the 2008 film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, the novel series &quot;The 100&quot; and its TV adaptation CW&#x27;s &quot;The 100,&quot; and Syfy&#x27;s TV series &quot;Z Nation&quot;.

Mount Weather is also mentioned in the novel &quot;Memorial Day&quot; by Vince Flynn, and in the novels &quot;One Year After&quot; and &quot;The Final Day&quot;, both by William R. Forstchen.

It is also mentioned in the movie &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, as well as CW&#x27;s TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;; Season 4 Episode 22 &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot;. It was shown in the opening scenes of the 2002 spy film, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name.

It is the setting for the season 2 episode of &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, and was a setting for Season 4 episode 22 of &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;, &quot;Night Watch&quot;. It was also mentioned in William Cooper&#x27;s book, &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;.

<doc id="231538" wikidata="Q1929396" url="?curid=231538" title="Selectivity (radio)">
<text>Selectivity is a measure of the performance of a radio receiver to respond only to the radio signal it is tuned to (such as a radio station) and reject other signals nearby in frequency, such as another broadcast on an adjacent channel.

Selectivity is usually measured as a ratio in decibels (dB), comparing the signal strength received against that of a similar signal on another frequency. If the signal is at the adjacent channel of the selected signal, this measurement is also known as adjacent-channel rejection ratio (ACRR).

Selectivity also provides some immunity to blanketing interference.

LC circuits are often used as filters; the Q (&quot;Quality&quot; factor) determines the bandwidth of each LC tuned circuit in the radio. The L/C ratio, in turn, determines their Q and so their selectivity, because the rest of the circuit - the aerial or amplifier feeding the tuned circuit for example - will contain present resistance. For a series resonant circuit, the higher the inductance and the lower the capacitance, the narrower the filter bandwidth (meaning the reactance of the inductance, L, and the capacitance, C, at resonant frequency will be relatively high compared with the series source/load resistances). For a parallel resonant circuit the opposite applies; small inductances reduce the damping of external circuitry (see electronic oscillator).

There are practical limits to the increase in selectivity with changing L/C ratio:
*tuning capacitors of large values can be difficult to construct
*stray capacitance, and capacitance within the transistors or valves of associated circuitry, may become significant (and vary with time)
*the series resistance internal to the wire in the coil, may be significant (for parallel tuned circuits especially)
*large inductances imply physically large (and expensive coils) and/or thinner wire (hence worse internal resistance).

Therefore other methods may be used to increase selectivity, such as Q multiplier circuits and regenerative receivers. Superheterodyne receivers allow use one or more fixed intermediate frequency tuned circuits for selectivity. Fixed tuning eliminates the requirement that multiple tuning stages accurately match while being adjusted.

<doc id="231544" wikidata="Q4705494" url="?curid=231544" title="Aladdin Deck Enhancer">
<text>The Aladdin Deck Enhancer is a system-enhancing adaptor to use Compact Cartridges on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was produced by Camerica and developed by Codemasters but not licensed by Nintendo. It is similar to the Datach system for the Famicom, but without the Barcode feature. It was released in November 1992, with its planned library to reach a total 24 games by the end of 1993. However, only seven games were actually released. The device had low sales and Camerica went bankrupt in 1993.

==Hardware==

Invented by Richard Darling, the Aladdin Deck Enhancer contains a bypass Security Circuit Chip, a Memory Control Chip, and a Graphics Chip, which work with the lock-out chip and other features inside the Nintendo Entertainment System. First, the Compact Cartridge is inserted into the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, which is shaped the same as a standard NES cartridge, and then this is inserted into the Control Deck. Inside the slot where the Compact Cartridge is placed is a recessed switch, which changes the Security/Region settings from position A to position B. The device contains 8 kilobytes of RAM for graphics use.

The device allowed Camerica to make cheaper game cartridges by sharing more of the requisite componentry of each cartridge: 10NES lock-out chip, RAM, and extra circuitry. However, by the time the product was released the next generation of consoles were already released as the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis. By then, the Aladdin lacked a sizable market base to warrant making a large game library, and Camerica was soon forced to close.

&quot;Dizzy Prince of the Yolkfolk&quot; by Codemasters, designed by the Oliver Twins, was enhanced for the NES release and retitled &quot;Dizzy the Adventurer&quot; and originally bundled with the Aladdin released in November 1992. It is the only Aladdin game not released on a normal-sized NES cartridge. Only another six games were ever released, all primarily from the Codemasters library. More games were listed as &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, but never released as Aladdin cartridges. &quot;CJ&#x27;s Elephant Antics&quot; was not released as a standalone game but is part of the &quot;Quattro Arcade&quot; NES cartridge, which contains three other games.

Aladdin games are typically identical to their standalone counterparts with a few exceptions. &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy&quot; is the only one with any improvement: a faster character, changed items system, 250 instead of 100 stars to collect, and other smaller changes.

==Games==
Each game for the Aladdin Deck Enhancer comes in a small cardboard box with a punched out hole at its top for it to be hung on a peg. Instead of the typical instruction booklet with many stapled pages, it has a fold-out brochure or poster.

&quot;Big Nose Freaks Out&quot;: This is the second of two games starring Big Nose, in addition to &quot;Big Nose the Caveman&quot;. Both are platform adventure games. In this adventure he rolls along on his wheel board, which is somewhat like a skateboard but with only one wheel, holding his trusty club and the occasional rocks. Bones are considered money in his time and Big Nose has gotten all his bones stolen, and must journey through this prehistoric land and get them back.

&quot;Dizzy the Adventurer&quot;: Dizzy is an egg-shaped hero with red boots and gloves. In this sixth game in the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series, Dizzy and Daisy are tricked into entering an old castle by the Evil Wizard Zaks. There, Daisy pricks her finger and falls into a mysterious sleep, while Dizzy is imprisoned. He must escape and find a way to wake his girlfriend, but along the way he must solve many puzzles by bringing the right item to the right place.

&quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy&quot;: An award-winning game by Codemasters, and the seventh game in the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series. Dizzy must rescue his kidnapped girlfriend and help the rest of the Yolkfolk. Along the way, he must face numerous dangers, collect stars to get into the castle and solve various puzzles.

&quot;Linus Spacehead&#x27;s Cosmic Crusade&quot;: This is Linus&#x27;s second adventure for the Aladdin Deck Enhancer; the other is on the &quot;Quattro Adventure&quot; cartridge. Linus is home at last on his own planet Linoleum. He must get a car and camera, go back to Earth, take pictures and then return home. It is part click-and-move adventure/puzzle and part side-scroller platform game.

&quot;Micro Machines&quot;: This is a licensed product of the Micro Machines toy line. It is a racing game where the player controls miniature cars that drive over household environments such as tables, floors, a sandbox, and a bathtub.

&quot;Quattro Adventure&quot;: This is a cartridge of four adventure-platform games.

* &quot;Boomerang Kid&quot; was lost in the outback when his parents were camping with him in the outback. Fortunately, he was rescued from a hungry dingo by Aboriginal Australian people who took him in and raised him as their own. Now grown up, Boomerang Kid wishes to repay their kindness, and the opportunity arises when their boomerang store is raided. Boomerang Kid begins a quest to retrieve every last boomerang before he will return.
* &quot;Super Robin Hood&quot;: Robin Hood must save his beloved Marion by searching the castle for keys and switches while avoiding guards and other obstacles.
* &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; is the second game in the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series. Dizzy the hero goes sailing one day, gets lost in a storm, and finds himself on a mysterious island. He must discover all the coins located on the island and then figure out how to get off the island, all the while solving various puzzles.
* &quot;Linus Spacehead&quot;, while in a race, has crashed his spaceship into the Earth and needs to get back home. He must pick up the pieces of his radio so he can signal home. He is only able to jump and duck as he moves through the various levels while being attacked by things such as fish, birds, coconuts, and bats.

&quot;Quattro Sports&quot;: This is a cartridge of four sports games.
* is a worldwide baseball game where the player competes against teams from around the world with one or two players.
*&quot;Soccer Simulator&quot; is a top view soccer game where the player competes against teams from around the world with one or two players.
*&quot;Pro Tennis&quot; is a tournament-based game with a two player option.
*&quot;BMX Simulator&quot; is a licensed product of the BMX sports bike line, where the player controls a bicycle rider in a top view looking down at the track, similar to &quot;Super Sprint&quot;.

<text>The King of Fighters (KOF) is a series of fighting games by SNK that began with the release of &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; in 1994. The series was initially developed for SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo MVS arcade hardware and received yearly installments up until its tenth entry, &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; — thereafter, SNK moved away from annual &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; releases and games adopted a Roman numbered format, while simultaneously retiring the use of Neo Geo. The first major installment after this change was &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; (2005) on the Atomiswave arcade board. The series&#x27; most recent arcade hardware is the Taito Type X2, first used with the release of &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; (2009) and continues with the latest entry in the series, &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; (2022). Ports of the arcade games have been released for several video game consoles.

The games&#x27; story focuses on the title tournament in which fighters from multiple SNK games take part. SNK also created original characters to serve as protagonists, with individual story arcs, interacting with fighters from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, among other titles. Multiple spin-off games, such as the &quot;R&quot; duology for the Neo Geo Pocket and &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; for the PlayStation 2, for example, have also been released. There have been multiple cross-over games in which the SNK cast interacted with characters created by Capcom, while some characters have been present as guest characters in other games, such as Mai Shiranui in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; games, Geese Howard in &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, Kula Diamond in &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, and Terry Bogard in &quot;Fighting EX Layer&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;. Critical reception of the video games have been generally positive with their use of teams and balanced gameplay often cited.

==Games==
===Main series===
*SNK released the first game in the series, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, on August 25, 1994. It featured characters from SNK&#x27;s previous fighting game series &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, as well as original characters (including characters from other franchises such as &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; and &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;, adapted for a versus fighting game). The game&#x27;s success led SNK to release yearly installments for the series numbering the games for the year they were released. 

*&quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, as well as adding new characters, began the series&#x27; first story arc titled &quot;The Orochi Saga&quot;. It was also the first game in the series that allowed players to create their own three-member teams with any character in the game. 
*&quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; established the second part of &quot;The Orochi Saga&quot;. Depending on the playable characters on a team, an exclusive ending would be played. 
*&quot;The Orochi Saga&quot; story arc concluded in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;. 
*Unlike the series&#x27; previous games, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; did not feature a story. Instead, it was promoted as a &quot;Dream Match&quot; game that allowed players to choose most of the characters available from the previous titles, including ones that were supposedly dead. SNK refitted the Dreamcast version and renamed it &quot;The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999&quot; with an extended cel animated introduction and 3D backgrounds.

*&quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; introduced &quot;The NESTS Chronicles&quot; story arc. In a new tactic, a specific person from a team would be an assistant called a &quot;Striker&quot;. This person would be able to aid the team for a few seconds in combat. The Dreamcast version was titled &quot;The King of Fighters: Evolution&quot;, with several improvements in the game such as new Strikers and better animation. 

*&quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; is the second part of &quot;The NESTS Saga&quot; as well as the last &quot;KOF&quot; game produced by SNK before its bankruptcy. It adds a few new playable characters and a couple of Strikers—most from earlier KOF titles and other SNK franchises such as &quot;Metal Slug&quot;, &quot;Robo Army&quot;, &quot;Burning Fight&quot;, &quot;Buriki One&quot;, &quot;The Last Blade&quot;, &quot;Savage Reign&quot; and &quot;Kizuna Encounter&quot;. 
*&quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot; ends the second story arc. The Korean company Eolith helped develop the game after SNK was declared bankrupt. 
*&quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot; was created to reunite old characters from previous &quot;KOF&quot; games and featured no story, similar to &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot;. It was also developed by Eolith.

*A new &quot;KOF&quot; story arc titled the &quot;Tales of Ash&quot; began in &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;, the last &quot;KOF&quot; game to be released for the Neo Geo system. It allowed players to change characters while playing, but the number of team members was reduced to three. SNK returned to develop the franchise with this entry. By 2004, SNK abandoned the series&#x27; yearly releases and numbered future games in a more conventional manner. 
*The first main series&#x27; game released as such was &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; in 2005. 
*In 2009, &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; was released. It used high-resolution, hand-drawn 2D sprites on detailed 2D backgrounds. It is a storyless gathering of fighters, similar to KOF &#x27;98 and 2002.
*The story arc ends with &quot;The King of Fighters XIII.&quot; Released during the summer of 2010, which features the entire roster from &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; as well as additional characters.

*&quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, featuring 3D graphics and a large roster of characters while also establishing a new story arc was released for the PlayStation 4 on August 23, 2016. 
*In December 2018, SNK revealed it was working on &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, and was released on February 17, 2022.

===Spin-offs and remakes===
*&quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; was remade and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 as &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94 Re-Bout&quot; in Japan. This version has several new features like hi-res graphics, online play, team edit, a playable Rugal Bernstein, and the addition of Saisyu Kusanagi. 
*A remake of &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot; titled &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Match&quot; was released in Japanese arcades in 2008 and later on some video game consoles expanding the character roster and improving the graphics. 
*A remake of &quot;KOF 2002&quot;, titled &quot;The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match&quot; was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2009 in Japan. SNK also produced a game titled &quot;The King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise&quot; which could be connected to the Japanese Dreamcast port of &quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot;. *Yumekobo also developed the visual novel game with strategy elements for fights known as . The game follows Kyo&#x27;s daily life as he prepares to fight in the tournament in &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot; while interacting with other rivals. 
*For the Neo Geo Pocket, an adaptation of &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot; titled &quot;King of Fighters R-1&quot; was released on October 28, 1998. A sequel for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, &quot;King of Fighters R-2&quot; an adaptation of &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot;, was released on March 19, 1999.

*In 2004, SNK produced the first 3D installment of the series, &quot;The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact&quot;. The game and its sequel &quot;&quot;, and its upgraded version &quot;Maximum Impact: Regulation A&quot;, revises much of the backstory for the characters and settings from previous games. A second update called &quot;Regulation A2&quot; was planned but cancelled. The producer of the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series, Falcoon, stated that the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; games are in a different continuity from the original series of games. Another spin-off video game, &quot;The King of Fighters Neowave&quot;, was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Arcade during 2005 and 2006. &quot;Neowave&quot; is essentially a remix of &quot;KOF 2002&quot;, with a new presentation and a few roster changes. Like &quot;KOF2002&quot;, &quot;Neowave&quot; has no storyline and is considered a &quot;dream match&quot;. Tomokazu Nakano created the character artwork. 
*Two video games were released for the Game Boy Advance titled &quot;The King of Fighters EX: Neo-Blood&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood&quot; featuring characters and backgrounds from &quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot; and &quot;2000&quot;, respectively. The GBA games featured some exclusive content such as new stages and exclusive characters such as Moe Habana, introduced in &quot;EX: Neo-Blood&quot;, while &quot;EX2: Howling Blood&quot; featured more exclusive characters, including a new end boss. The data was based on the DC version of The &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; and put into &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; system. However, the game&#x27;s quality was terrible according to Akihiko Ureshino.
*A role-playing video game was also created exclusively for the PlayStation under the title &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, adapting a manga with the same name. An N-Gage version of the second Game Boy Advance game was released in 2005 titled &quot;The King of Fighters Extreme&quot;, which added Bluetooth multiplayer capability.

*By late 2000s, at least three pachislot games were developed for the series. The first, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, is based on the Orochi storyline; the second, &quot;The King of Fighters 2&quot;, is based on the fight of K&#x27; against the NESTS cartel; and the third, &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; focuses on the series&#x27; 3D titles. None of these was released outside Japan. At least six games for Japanese mobile phones have also been developed. While a few of them are fighting games, others are mini-games like volleyball and quizzes.

===Related games===
Several characters from the series also appear in crossover video games. &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot; is a 2-on-2 tag team fighting game for the Atomiswave arcade board, and &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot; is a fighting game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Along with the &quot;KOF&quot;, characters from other SNK series also star in both of these games. A rhythm game titled &quot;The Rhythm of Fighters&quot; was released for mobile phone games during 2015. Capcom also produced a series of similar crossover fighting games with SNK. The SNK-produced fighting games of this crossover include the Dimps-developed portable fighting game &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot; for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999 and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; for the Neo Geo in 2003. The games produced by Capcom are &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; in 2000. This was followed by a minor upgrade, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK Pro&quot;, and a sequel titled &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, both released in 2001. The three games were produced for NAOMI hardware and later ported to various consoles. SNK also produced &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;, and the video game card game titled &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS&quot;.

Multiple mobile phone games have also been produced including &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;, &quot;Kimi wa Hero&quot;, &quot;Clash of Kings&quot;, &quot;KOF X Arena Masters&quot;, &quot;KOF: WORLD&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters Orochi Go&quot;, &quot;The King of Cyphers&quot;, and a crossover with &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. An otome game &quot;King of Fighters for Girls&quot; is also in development. The characters have also been guests in other mobile games such as Kyo in &quot;Fighting Days&quot;.

===Compilations===
In addition to the remakes of games such as &quot;KOF &#x27;94 Re-bout&quot;, &quot;KOF &#x27;98 Ultimate Match&quot;, and &quot;KOF 2002 Unlimited Match&quot;, SNK has released compilations of their &quot;KOF&quot; games. Two &quot;KOF&quot; compilations were released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Neo Geo Online Collection.

The first compilation, features &quot;KOF &#x27;95&quot;, &quot;KOF &#x27;96&quot;, and &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot;, the three games comprising the Orochi story arc. The compilation features a Color Edit mode that allows the player to create a custom color palette for every character in each game, the choice to play each game with original and arranged soundtracks, and an online versus mode which supports the Multi-Matching BB (MMBB) service. The second compilation, , features the original Neo Geo versions of &quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot;, &quot;KOF 2000&quot;, and &quot;KOF 2001&quot;, as well as the corresponding Dreamcast versions of each game. It has the same features as the previous compilation but with online support available only for the Dreamcast games in the compilation.

A separately produced compilation titled &quot;The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga&quot; was released for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii outside of Japan. This compilation has the same lineup of games as the Japanese &quot;Orochi Hen&quot;, along with &quot;KOF &#x27;94&quot; and &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot;. The extra features are different. There is an added Challenge Mode where the player must win certain matches against the CPU in &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot; under specific conditions, a media gallery featuring listenable tracks from each game, and a collection of official illustrations.

There were also two double-pack compilations, the first being &quot;The King of Fighters 2000/2001&quot; (&quot;The King of Fighters: The Saga Continues&quot; in PAL regions) and &quot;The King of Fighters 2002/2003,&quot; both on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

==Gameplay elements==

The basic gameplay system of &quot;KOF&quot; is similar to SNK&#x27;s previous games like the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;. The game uses a four attack button configuration like &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;, that consists of light punch, light kick, strong punch and strong kick. Like &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, specialized techniques are performed by pressing buttons in combination, allowing the player to dodge an opponent&#x27;s attack or to launch a character&#x27;s powerful knockdown attack. As with most other fighting games, each character has a set of basic, unique, and special moves the player can perform using a specific series of joystick and button inputs. Each new installment provides new ways to create stronger attacks such as &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;. Instead of charging the Power Gauge it is now filled when the player strikes the opponent or by performing Special Moves. The player can stock up to three Power Gauges. The player can use one stock of the Power Gauge to perform a Super Special Move or enter a &quot;MAX&quot; mode, in which the player&#x27;s defensive and offensive strength are increased. Performing a Super Special Move while in MAX mode allows the player to perform a more powerful Super Special Move.

The franchise is known for innovating the fighting genre by replacing a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting games with a format consisting of 3-on-3 team-based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose the order in which their team members enter the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the next member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.

Three games—&quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;, and &quot;2001&quot;—added the idea of each team being given an extra character that can assist the player to produce more attacks or combos against the enemy. While &quot;2002&quot; brought back the classic 3-o- 3 teams, &quot;2003&quot; and &quot;XI&quot; made the change so that each team switches fighters in the middle of combat with one of them being a &quot;Leader&quot; character who can perform stronger techniques. Later games, however, returned to the classic way of fighting while still delivering different ways and rules of fighting.

==Plot and characters==
The titular King of Fighters tournament originated from SNK&#x27;s previous fighting game franchises, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; (canonically and chronologically beginning during the events of &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;). The first game in the series, &quot;KOF &#x27;94&quot;, centers on a black market arms dealer named Rugal Bernstein, who hosts a well-known fighting tournament to lure worthy adversaries into his trap so that he can kill them and turn them into stone statues, adding them to his collection of defeated martial artists. In addition to previously established fighting game stars Terry Bogard and Ryo Sakazaki, the game introduces a new hero: a young Japanese martial artist named Kyo Kusanagi, who serves as the lead character in the early &quot;KOF&quot; games. In making Kyo, SNK wanted his personality to contrast with those of earlier leads and stand out within the crossover.

In &quot;KOF &#x27;95&quot;, Rugal, having survived the previous tournament, hosts a new one with the intention of seeking revenge against his adversaries. &quot;KOF &#x27;95&quot; introduced Kyo&#x27;s rival Iori Yagami to the series. It was the first game to mention the presence of the Orochi clan, which would serve as the central plot element in the series&#x27; following two games. The tournaments in &quot;KOF &#x27;96&quot; and &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot; are hosted by a woman named Chizuru Kagura, who seeks to recruit allies (particularly Kyo and Iori, who are descended from the Three Divine Vessels along with Kagura herself) to fight against the Orochi clan. The Orochi storyline concludes in &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot;. The next game in the series, &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot;, is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; with no plot development.

&quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot; introduces a new story arc involving a mysterious corporation known as NESTS, which seeks to create an army of genetically altered fighters. The game introduces a new lead character named K&#x27;, a fugitive from NESTS who was genetically enhanced with Kyo&#x27;s DNA. The next two games in the series, &quot;KOF 2000&quot; and &quot;KOF 2001&quot;, continue the NESTS story line, with each game unraveling the mystery of the organization further. &quot;KOF 2002&quot;, like &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot; before it, is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the series with no particular plot. Like Kyo, K&#x27; was created as a different hero. Rather than the cocky Kyo, K&#x27; is a dark hero who reluctantly fights against the NESTS syndicate.

&quot;KOF 2003&quot; begins a new story line focusing on another new lead character named Ash Crimson, a young man who seeks to possess the powers of the Three Divine Vessels for his own unknown agenda. Similar to K&#x27;, Ash is given a different characterization acting as a villain during his story arc. The tournaments in &quot;KOF 2003&quot; and &quot;KOF XI&quot; were hosted by &quot;Those From the Past&quot;, an organization of inhuman warriors who try to break the Orochi seal to take its powers so they can give them to their shrouded master. While &quot;KOF XII&quot; does not have a story, &quot;KOF XIII&quot; follows another tournament hosted by them where Ash eventually confronts their superior despite him being Ash&#x27;s ancestor.

&quot;KOF XIV&quot; establishes a new storyline involving a new lead character named Shun&#x27;ei. Described as a &quot;kind-hearted&quot; person, SNK states that while Shun&#x27;ei is not a new main character, he is still important for the saga.

==Development==

&quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was originally conceptualized as a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up until SNK changed it to a fighting game that took its subtitle from the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; game: &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;. &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was created by game designer Masanori Kuwasashi. He enjoys &quot;Tensai Bakabon&quot;, &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot;, &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; and &quot;Devilman&quot;, as well as arcade and Super Famicom games. After working on package design for electronic products, he decided that he would leave to pursue a different career in the video game industry. SNK recruited much of its new staff back in the 1880s and early 1990s. Kuwasashi, Tanabe and Shimizu - under the stewardship of Nishiyama - would go on to form the core of a game development team. The prototype version of the game was a &quot;River City Ransom&quot;-style TEAM-BATTLE side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up. However, the idea was eventually abandoned. They eventually decided to turn their idea into a fighting game. This game was a team battle concept and there were not enough characters, so characters from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; and &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot; were also added to the roster. The concept of a three-person team was one of the ideas kept from the side-scrolling version. The title &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was re-used from the subtitle of the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; game, &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;. &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series&#x27; director Toyohisa Tanabe asserted that the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; fighters were added specifically for adults. The newer &quot;KOF&quot; characters were intended to appeal to younger and recent audiences. Characters like Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan were added to provide an off-beat variety to the cast, which he had previously said was too serious. A major inspiration for this crossover idea was the usage of Ryo Sakazaki from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; as a guest character in &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;; Bringing Ryo to &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; revolutioned the idea of the crossover concept that would conceptualize &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;.

While the first two games used the Neo Geo MVS arcade, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; includes 68 KB of video RAM and 64 KB of RAM. This made &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; the first game to break the technical limits of the MVS system. SNK staff members noted that due to the great popularity of some of the series&#x27; characters, it is difficult to design new ones that might have the same appeal. This also happens during location tests of new games. During the mid 1990s, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was SNK&#x27;s most popular IP as their other famous works like &quot;Art of Fighting 3&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; were poorly received by the gamers. Though &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; saw a revival through &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;&quot;, these two games were released during the time SNK went bankrupt leaving the company to mainly focus on &quot;KOF&quot;. The artist known as Shinkiro was responsible for the first artwork involving the cast. As a result, newcomer artist Hiroaki Hashimoto felt for his debut that he needed to draw appealing characters, despite his inexperience. For the first time, former producer Takashi Nishiyama was not on the team for &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; which caused the team some concern. Despite early unease over the game&#x27;s state, SNK was pleased with the outcome and described it as an appealing arcade game. Following its release, SNK thanked the fans for their support. Mexican company Evoga had a major influence on the games due to the franchise&#x27;s popularity within Latin America.

In 2000, SNK went bankrupt. Eolith negotiated a license agreement in the same year to keep producing the &quot;KOF&quot; series because of the franchise&#x27;s popularity in Korea and worldwide. BrezzaSoft assisted Eolith with the game&#x27;s production. Fearing disappointing returning fans, Eolith decided to maintain most of the common parts from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; while adding new elements to it. One of the biggest changes is the optional use of Strikers where players can use between one and three characters to assist the playable one. The team aimed to refine the original gameplay system of earlier &quot;KOF&quot; games. While conducting a popularity poll of the characters, Eolith still aimed to include the least popular teams in the game. The great popularity of Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami led to their immediate inclusion in the game. References to works from Evoga can be seen in the game&#x27;s scenarios. While working on it, the team played &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; for the developers to see if they could include a character within the game. A member from Evoga won, resulting in the team asking to add Angel to the game. Starting in 2003, the games were again developed by SNK, now called SNK Playmore. SNK Playmore discontinued the AES system in 2003, preferring to publish video games in cooperation with Sammy, using its Atomiswave arcade board, which provided a more secure, modern platform for new arcade releases. This allowed the new &quot;KOF&quot; games to feature better audio and graphics than earlier games.

Following the release of the first game in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, a new game was released each year. The last of these yearly releases was &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;. In December 2004, Falcoon, the series&#x27; main illustrator, mentioned that the next game the SNK Playmore staff were trying to release was different from &quot;The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact&quot; or what could have been a &quot;The King of Fighters 2004&quot;. The game&#x27;s development began when SNK staff finished making &quot;Neo Geo Battle Coliseum&quot;. &quot;KOF 2003&quot; would be followed by &quot;XI&quot;, &quot;XII&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot; which had major changes to appeal to the audience. The decision to create &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; was made when SNK Playmore&#x27;s CEO Eikichi Kawasaki decided the company should return to producing appealing fighting games rather than Pachinko-Slot Machines and Mobile Apps. While it took some time, full production of the game began when more staff from Esaka joined the team in April 2014. Yasuyuki Oda was the game&#x27;s director. This was his first contribution to the franchise, leading a younger staff. During his first employment at SNK, games like &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; motivated him to make a 3D game after he had left SNK. When Oda returned to SNK, there was never any debate about transitioning the series transition from 2D to 3D, though adapting some of the characters proved more difficult than others. Many of SNK&#x27;s staff consider &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot; and &quot;KOF 2002&quot; the best games in the franchise. They gave them ideas to create new entries in the series that would surpass the quality of these two games. During a contest, SNK used the DLC character Najd based on the Saudi Arabian artist Mashael. SNK Chairman Zhihui Ge expressed a desire to attract more Middle Eastern fans to play the game. He also hired new creators during the post-release of &quot;XIV&quot;. In retrospect, Oda said the SNK game studio was revived with &quot;KOFXIV&quot;, resulting in the company finally making more &quot;Samurai Shodowns&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; games in future years. Oda wishes the company could keep doing this.

SNK decided to make &quot;XV&quot; while they were still working on &quot;XIV&quot; but only started development after &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; was completed. Feeling the previous title had outdated graphics for a 2016 game, SNK chairman Zhihui Ge said that &quot;XV&quot; would the Unreal Engine 4 to provide a better presentation. Oda has compared Shun&#x27;ei to Rock Howard, and says that his story could end up being as fun to write as Rock&#x27;s. Oda feels that unlike the older fighting game protagonists, Shun&#x27;ei has a one-of-a-kind world view, and his values change as he grows older.

==Reception==

While the fighting system has been well-received, critics have had mixed feelings regarding the Striker system introduced in &quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot;. In &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;The History of SNK&quot; article, &quot;KOF &#x27;99: Evolution&quot; was described as one of the best fighting games on the Dreamcast, along with &quot;&quot;. However, because it was released during the PlayStation 2&#x27;s launch and Dreamcast&#x27;s ending, the game did not sell well. The boss character Rugal Bernstein, among others, has been described as one of the most challenging characters to defeat in fighting games; this feeling also led to some criticism.

The developers of &quot;KOF&quot; noted that Kyo and Iori were also highly popular in Korea which led to their immediate inclusion in &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, the first game not developed by the original company. In the book &quot;Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific&quot;, Kyo was regarded as one of the most popular video game characters in Hong Kong from the mid-1990s onward alongside Iori and Mai, among others, to the point of overshadowing the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters who were also largely well-known. The formation of the Three Sacred Treasures Team in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; had a major impact with fans because it was appealing because of the Orochi saga and because of its incorporation of Japanese mythology. Although Kyo&#x27;s story arc ends with &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, he has remained a more popular hero than his successors like Ash Crimson in Western regions, which led to Ignition Entertainment promoting &quot;KOF XII&quot; using him. Similarly, &quot;Anime UK News&quot; preferred Kyo and Iori more than the next lead, Shun&#x27;ei. &quot;GameType&quot; lamented most characters a have a tendecy to retain their classic outfits with few exceptions like Terry Bogard, Kyo Kusanagi, and Robert Garcia. While exploring the story, they hoped the return to the Orochi narrative based on the handling of Chizuru Kagura in &quot;2003&quot; would appeal more to the audience as &quot;GameType&quot; did not enjoy the NESTS arc from previous installments alongside Nona&#x27;s artwork. Meanwhile, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; &quot;XI&quot; called it an &quot;excellent 2D game&quot;, comparable to other works such as one of Capcom&#x27;s most famous games, &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;.

The Mexican company Evoga had a major influence on the game due to the franchise&#x27;s popularity in Latin America and often playtested the games. With &quot;KOF XIV&quot;, SNK noted the series&#x27; popularity was still dominant in South America and China, leading to the creation of teams composed of characters from those areas. The popularity of the franchise in those markets has been attributed mainly to economic factors - machines featuring &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series were often cheaper and more easily accessible than those featuring competing titles from other companies.

&quot;The Daily Star&quot; noted the games&#x27; popularity comes not only from the gameplay but also the characters who tend to develop across the series—for example the rivalry between Kyo and Iori. The franchise&#x27;s story arcs were also found to be appealing as they stand out from other fighting game franchises. Kakuchopurei.com felt the series offered a balanced cast which would help any newcomer while also agreeing with &quot;The Daily Star&quot; on how SNK handled the story lines. There has also been censorship of some of the ports of the North American games, most notably Whip&#x27;s gun and blood. Singer Del the Funky Homosapien has recorded a song titled &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; whose lyrics involve the characters and special moves. Ash Crimson&#x27;s character received a poor response in Western regions. In an interview with Ignition Entertainment&#x27;s director of business development Shane Bettehausen, Alex Lucard of &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; said that North American SNK fans detested Ash and complained about his inclusion in &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; without a storyline while popular series&#x27; characters were overlooked. &quot;After Ignition&quot; polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;. The company announced Ash&#x27;s unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two featuring Kyo and Iori.

Ben Herman, president of SNK Playmore USA, commented that although he received complaints about the English voices for the game, &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; sold over 100,000 units as of May 2006, becoming a commercial success. Despite initial issues with the online mode and other features of the game &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; Yasuyuki Oda said the fan response was positive especially after these issues were fixed.

<text>The Fink project is an effort to port and package open-source Unix programs to macOS. Fink uses dpkg and APT (Debian&#x27;s package management system), as well as its own frontend program, codice_1 (which is implemented as a set of Perl modules).

== Implementation ==
Fink features a binary distribution for quick and easy installation using APT, as well as a more extensive source distribution. In addition to command-line tools for handling packages, the shareware app Phynchronicity provides a GUI.

Fink can be used to install newer versions of packages installed by macOS or to install packages not included in macOS by Apple edict. Fink stores all its data in the directory codice_2 for newer macOS releases and codice_3 for macOS 10.14 and earlier (although this can be changed if initially compiling fink itself from source code). This goes against the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard&#x27;s recommendation to use the codice_4 prefix; the reasons given in the Fink FAQ are that other installers might overwrite Fink&#x27;s files under codice_4, and that having an entirely separate directory makes it easier to disable the binaries and libraries that Fink installs. MacPorts, another macOS package manager, follows a similar approach by storing its data in codice_6 by default. Within Fink&#x27;s directory, a FHS-like layout (codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, etc.) is used.

== History ==
The Fink project was started in December 2000 by German hacker Christoph Pfisterer.
The name Fink is German for finch and is a reference to the name of the macOS core, Darwin; Charles Darwin&#x27;s study of diversity among finches led him eventually to the concept of natural selection.

Christoph Pfisterer left the project in November 2001. Since then, several people have stepped in and picked up support for Fink. As of March 2008, the project was managed by 6 administrators, 89 developers, and an active community. As of March 2014, the Fink core team were made up of nine active developers, who are responsible for the central management of the project and maintain the &quot;essential&quot; packages.

The Fink community regularly adds support for the latest versions of macOS with their release. Latest Fink versions, starting with version 0.45.0, support up to MacOS Catalina. Support for MacOS Big Sur and Monterey is being worked on.

<doc id="231549" wikidata="Q179674" url="?curid=231549" title="Teutons">
<text>The Teutons (, ; ) were an ancient northern European tribe mentioned by Roman authors. The Teutons are best known for their participation, together with the Cimbri and other groups, in the Cimbrian War with the Roman Republic in the late second century BC.

Some generations later, Julius Caesar compared them to the Germanic peoples of his own time, and used this term for all northern peoples located east of the Rhine. Later Roman authors followed his identification. However, there is no direct evidence about whether or not they spoke a Germanic language. Evidence such as the tribal name, and the names of their rulers, as they were written up by Roman historians, indicates a strong influence from Celtic languages. On the other hand, the indications that classical authors gave about the homeland of the Teutones is considered by many scholars to show that they lived in an area associated with early Germanic languages, and not in an area associated with Celtic languages.

== Name ==
The ethnonym appears in Latin as &quot;Teutonēs&quot; or &quot;Teutoni&quot; in the plural, and less commonly as &quot;Teuton&quot; or &quot;Teutonus&quot; in the singular. It transparently originates from the Proto-Indo-European stem *&quot;tewtéh₂-&quot;, meaning &quot;people, tribe, crowd,&quot; with the addition of the suffix &quot;-ones&quot;, which is frequently found in both Celtic (e.g., &quot;Lingones&quot;, &quot;Senones&quot;) and Germanic (e.g., &quot;Ingvaeones&quot;, &quot;Semnones&quot;) tribal names during the Roman period. The term conveys the idea of a &quot;mass of people,&quot; in contrast to distinguished individuals—such as leaders or heroes—or those belonging to a more elite group. It may have originally meant &quot;people under arms&quot; in Proto-Indo-European, as suggested by the Hittite &quot;tuzzi-&quot; and the Luwian &quot;tuta&quot; (&quot;army&quot;).

The name &quot;Teutones&quot; can be interpreted either as Celtic, from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;towtā&quot; (&quot;people, tribe)&quot;, or as pre-Germanic. Its recorded spellings do not match the later Proto-Germanic form *&quot;þeudō-&quot; (&quot;nation, people, folk,&quot; cf. Gothic &quot;þiuda&quot;), which suggests that if it is indeed Germanic, it must derive from an earlier stage of the language (prior to the first consonantal shift), unless the Greek and Latin renditions are corrupt and do not accurately represent the original form. The stem &quot;tewtéh₂-&quot; is so widespread in Indo-European languages that linking the ethnonym to other names with the same origin, such as the Teutoburg Forest (&quot;Teutoburgensis saltus&quot;), is challenging.

Later on, beginning with ninth-century monastic Latin texts, the term &quot;Teuton&quot; came to refer specifically to speakers of West Germanic languages—a usage that has persisted into modern times. Originally, it was used as a learned alternative to the similar-sounding term &quot;theodiscus&quot;, which was a Latinized form of the contemporary West Germanic word meaning &quot;of the people.&quot; By extension, the adjective &quot;Teutonic&quot; has often been used more broadly to mean the same as &quot;Germanic.&quot;

== Linguistic affiliations ==
The Teutons commonly are classified as a Germanic tribe and thought probably to have spoken a Germanic language, although the evidence is fragmentary. However, because of the non-Germanic, possibly Celtic, form of the names of both the Teutones and their associates the Cimbri, as well as the personal names known from these tribes, some historians have suggested a Celtic origin for the Teutones.

The earliest classical writers classified the Teutones as Celts; more generally, they did not distinguish between Celtic and Germanic peoples. Apparently, this distinction was first made by Julius Caesar, whose main concern was to argue that raids into southern Gaul and Italy by northern peoples who were less softened by Mediterranean civilization, should be seen in Rome as a systematic problem that can repeat in the future, and thereby demanded pre-emptive military action. This was his justification for invading northern Gaul.

After Caesar, Strabo (died circa AD 24) and Marcus Velleius Paterculus (died circa AD 31) classify Teutons as Germanic peoples. Pliny also classified them this way and specified that they were among the Ingaevones, related to the Cimbri and Chauci.

== Homeland ==
Plutarch in his biography of Marius, who fought the Teutones, wrote that they and the Cimbri &quot;had not had intercourse with other peoples, and had traversed a great stretch of country, so that it could not be ascertained what people it was nor whence they had set out&quot;. He reported that there were different conjectures: that they were &quot;some of the German peoples which extended as far as the northern ocean&quot;; that they were &quot;Galloscythians&quot;, a mixture of Scythians and Celts who had lived as far east as the Black Sea, or that the Cimbri were Cimmerians, from even farther east.

The Fourth Century BC traveller, Pytheas, as reported by Pliny the Elder (died AD 79), described the Teutones as neighbours of the northern island of Abalus where amber washed up in the spring, and was traded by the Teutones. Abalus was one day&#x27;s sail from a tidal marsh or estuary facing the ocean (&quot;aestuarium&quot;) called &quot;Metuonis&quot; inhabited by another Germanic people, the &quot;Guiones&quot; (probably either the Inguaeones, or Gutones).

Pomponius Mela (died circa 45 CE) stated that the Teutons lived on a large island, &quot;Codannovia&quot;, which was one of a group of islands in a large bay called &quot;Codanus&quot;, open to the ocean. Most scholars have interpreted this bay as being the Baltic Sea, and &quot;Codannovia&quot; as being Scandinavia.
:31. On the other side of the Albis [Elbe], the huge Codanus Bay [Baltic Sea] is filled with big and small islands. For this reason, where the sea is received within the fold of the bay, it never lies wide open and never really looks like a sea but is sprinkled around, rambling and scattered like rivers, with water flowing in every direction and crossing many times. Where the sea comes into contact with the mainland, the sea is contained by the banks of islands, banks that are not far offshore and that are virtually equidistant everywhere. There the sea runs a narrow course like a strait, then, curving, it promptly adapts to a long brow of land. 32. On the bay are the Cimbri and the Teutoni; farther on, the farthest people of Germany, the Hermiones.

The thirty Orcades [Orkney Islands] are separated by narrow spaces between them; the seven Haemodae [Denmark] extend opposite Germany in what we have called Codanus Bay; of the islands there, Scandinavia [sic: the manuscript has &quot;Codannavia&quot;], which the Teutoni still hold, stands out as much for its size as for its fertility besides.

Surviving texts based on the work of the geographer Ptolemy mentioned both Teutones and &quot;Teutonoaroi&quot; in Germania, but this is in a part of his text that has become garbled in surviving copies. Gudmund Schütte proposed that the two peoples should be understood as one, but that different versions of works based on that of Ptolemy used literary sources such as Pliny and Mela to place them in different positions somewhere near the Cimbri, in a part of the landscape they did not have good information for – either in Zealand or Scandinavia, or else somewhere on the southern Baltic coast.

According to scholar Stefan Zimmer (2005), since both the name of the Teutones and Crimbri left traces in place names from Jutland (in &quot;Thy&quot; and &quot;Himmerland&quot;, respectively), &quot;there is no reason to doubt the ancient accounts of the origins of the two tribes&quot;.

== Cimbrian War ==

After achieving decisive victories over the Romans at Noreia and Arausio in 105 BC, the Cimbri and Teutones divided their forces. Gaius Marius then defeated them separately in 102 BC and 101 BC respectively, ending the Cimbrian War. The defeat of the Teutones occurred at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae (near present-day Aix-en-Provence).

According to the writings of Valerius Maximus and Florus, the king of the Teutones, Teutobod, was taken in irons after the Teutones were defeated by the Romans. Under the conditions of the surrender, three hundred married women were to be handed over to the victorious Romans as concubines and slaves. When the matrons of the Teutones heard of this stipulation, they begged the consul that they might instead be allowed to minister in the temples of Ceres and Venus. When their request was denied, the Teutonic women slew their own children. The next morning, all the women were found dead in each other&#x27;s arms, having strangled each other during the night. Their joint martyrdom passed into Roman legends of Teutonic fury.

Reportedly, some surviving captives participated as the rebelling gladiators in the Third Servile War of 73-71 BC.

<text>King&#x27;s Quest is a graphic adventure game series, released between 1980 and 2016 and created by the American software company Sierra Entertainment. It is widely considered a classic series from the golden era of adventure games. Following the success of its first installments, the series was primarily responsible for building the reputation of Sierra. Roberta Williams, co-founder and former co-owner of Sierra, designed all of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; games until the series&#x27; reboot in 2015.

The &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series chronicles the saga of the royal family of the Kingdom of Daventry through their various trials and adventures. The story takes place over two generations and across many lands as the heroes and heroines fight villains such as evil witches and wizards.

*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, an episodical &quot;re-imagining&quot; by The Odd Gentlemen (2015–2016)

==Original series==
The world of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; encompasses many different kingdoms and supernatural realms. The main characters in the series are King Graham, originally a knight of Daventry who won the throne of the kingdom through questing, and members of his family: his wife Queen Valanice and his twin son and daughter, Prince Alexander and Princess Rosella. The exception is &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot;, where the protagonist is Connor of Daventry, a tanner (and a knight like Graham from the first game) who is unrelated to the royal family. The later sequels have more elaborate storylines, more complicated puzzles, and more original and well-developed characters.

Technologically, the series pioneered the use of animation and pseudo-3D environments in graphic adventure games, so that the main character could, for example, walk behind objects on-screen. The primary way in which characters solve puzzles and advance through the game is by using items found earlier in the game and stored in their inventory. Other puzzles include the mapping of labyrinths, deserts, or other inhospitable places; solving riddles; and tasks involving the use of logic or lateral thinking skills. It is important to use all one&#x27;s character&#x27;s senses to gather all the information available: look, listen, smell, taste, or touch whenever possible.

===The Quest===
The &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; (for which the series takes its name) usually involves becoming a king or the adventures of members of the royal family of Daventry in other lands to save their kingdom. Often, the quest is given to the protagonist through the realm&#x27;s magic mirror (the first game involves obtaining the magic mirror, which becomes an important feature in the later games).

In &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I: Quest for the Crown&quot;, the young knight Sir Graham is sent by the dying King Edward on a quest to destroy the wicked witch Dahlia and find three treasures in order to become the new king. In &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II: Romancing the Throne&quot;, the quest is for King Graham to find his queen. Through the magic mirror, retrieved in the first game, he learns of the beautiful Valanice captured by the witch Hagatha in the land of Kolyma.

The follow-ups &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III: To Heir Is Human&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella&quot; do not star Graham, but involve the protagonists who ultimately end up saving the king and/or the kingdom from threats such as a dragon and untimely death. Gwydion begins as a peasant of Llewdor and a slave of the wizard Manannan; he escapes by using the wizard&#x27;s magic against him, and ultimately discovers he is really Alexander, the long-lost son of King Graham and Queen Valanice and brother of the Princess Rosella. After Alexander restores the magic mirror and saves Rosella and the kingdom from the ravages of the dragon, Graham is taken deathly ill; to obtain a cure for her father, Rosella must travel to the fairy land of Tamir (after learning about it through the magic mirror) and vanquish the witch Queen Lolotte.

&quot;King&#x27;s Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!&quot; returns to the King in his attempt to rescue both his kingdom and family from Mordack, Hagatha&#x27;s and Manannan&#x27;s brother and also an evil magician, who is seeking revenge against Alexander for Manannan&#x27;s downfall, in the land of Serenia. This is the first game that does not include the magic mirror.

&quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; follows Prince Alexander&#x27;s attempt to save his true love, marry her, and ultimately becoming the king of the Land of the Green Isles. The magic mirror pointed him in the right direction to finding the kingdom.

&quot;King&#x27;s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride&quot; is the only game in the series that does not involve King Graham (he is missing entirely from the story), Castle Daventry, or saving the kingdom of Daventry (only a small portion of the land is shown briefly in the introduction), nor the magic mirror. Rather, the plot involves the dual protagonists Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella attempting to save the realm of Eldritch from the evil enchantress Malicia. Rosella ultimately finds a romantic interest in Prince Edgar, whom she rescues with the implication that they may marry in the future.

&quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot; is similar to &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;, in that it involves a young knight attempting to save King Graham (who stands in place of Edward), Queen Valanice, and the kingdom of Daventry from harm. Again the magic mirror shares a prominent role in telling of the doom that befell the kingdom.

===Development===
Much of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; was inspired by fairy tales, which designer Roberta Williams loved reading, in particular the Andrew Lang&#x27;s Fairy Books. Many creatures, characters and situations from world mythologies, fairy tales, folklore and classic literature are encountered within the world of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;. Many of the puzzle solutions are inspired by various tales so that a player with knowledge of the stories beforehand would have an advantage.

The concept of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series was derived from ideas first established in &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot; (&quot;Adventure in Serenia&quot;) which was an early forerunner of the series. The game versions followed the exploits of an unnamed hero known only as the &quot;wanderer&quot;, in later versions said to be a time traveler from the future. The game&#x27;s connection to the King&#x27;s Quest series led to its inclusion as one of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; trivia questions. The fifth &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; game marked a return to Serenia, the land first seen during the game. The game&#x27;s backstory was further tied into the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; history through &quot;The King&#x27;s Quest Companion&quot;. According to the &quot;Companion&quot;, in various periods of history people from the real world withdrew to Daventry, which explains how historical and mythical elements exist there. In most of the series, it is said that the games take place, &#x27;a long time ago&#x27; a few centuries in our past.

Many of the classic Sierra games series had in-jokes, cameos, or homages to characters, situations and elements of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series. Cedric from &quot;KQV&quot; was often the brunt of several jokes found in &quot;Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist&quot;, &quot;Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Space Quest VI&quot;. Rosella has appeared in or was mentioned in the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series, &quot;Police Quest II&quot;, and &quot;Quest for Glory&quot; series. Graham is mentioned in or appears in several of the &quot;Space Quest&quot;, &quot;Police Quest&quot;, and &quot;Laura Bow&quot; games.

===Other media releases===
====Collections====
The games in the series have been released together in several collections or bundles through the years (often packed with bonus material).
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest 15th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; (1994): It contains &quot;KQI&quot; (AGI &amp; SCI versions) through &quot;KQVI&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Questions&quot;, and &quot;King Graham&#x27;s Board Game Challenge&quot;. It also contains a French floppy version of &quot;KQV&quot;, and the German floppy version of &quot;KQVI&quot;, as well as a variety of concept material, artwork, documents, articles, and videos.
*King&#x27;s Quest Collection (1995): It contains &quot;KQI&quot; (AGI &amp; SCI versions) through &quot;KQVI&quot;, as well as all of the bonus material from the &quot;15th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition,&quot; plus some additional ones including a playable demo of &quot;KQVII&quot;.
*&quot;Roberta Williams Anthology&quot; (1996): It contains &quot;KQI&quot; (AGI &amp; SCI versions) through &quot;KQVII&quot; (2.0 version), plus &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot;, &quot;Laura Bow Mysteries 1 &amp; 2&quot;, &quot;Mixed-Up Mother Goose&quot; (AGI &amp; VGA versions), &quot;Mystery House&quot;, &quot;Mission Asteroid&quot;, &quot;Time Zone&quot;, &quot;Dark Crystal&quot;, and Chapter 1 demo of &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, as well as a variety of bonuses.
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest Collection Series&quot; (1997): Also known as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest Collection 2&quot;; it contains &quot;KQI&quot; (AGI &amp; SCI versions) through &quot;KQVII&quot; (2.0 version), &quot;King&#x27;s Questions&quot;, &quot;Graham&#x27;s Board Game Challenge&quot;, &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot;, &quot;Mixed-Up Mother Goose Deluxe&quot;, &quot;Laura Bow 1 &amp; 2&quot;, &quot;Mystery House&quot;, &quot;Mission Asteroid&quot;, and &quot;Time Zone&quot;. It also contains most of the bonuses from the previous versions as well as some new ones.
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest MASK/Collection Bundle&quot; (1998): A special bundle sold through Sierra during the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest Mask of Eternity&quot;. It included both the 1997 &quot;King&#x27;s Quest Collection&quot;, and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VIII&quot; at a discounted price plus the first seven games. Both products came in separate boxes.
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest Collection&quot; (2006): Vivendi Universal released &quot;King&#x27;s Quest Collection&quot;, a compilation CD for Windows XP encompassing games &quot;KQI&quot;–&quot;VII&quot;. Rather than porting the games directly, however, this release uses the original versions running under the DOSBox emulator and a Windows front end (as a result, it is also possible to run &quot;KQI&quot;–&quot;VI&quot; on other platforms with a little tweaking and ports of DOSBox). &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VII&quot; is the earlier 16-bit Windows version, version 1.4, lacking DOS compatibility, but runs natively on Windows 32-bit versions but is incompatible with 64-bit windows. Missing in the collection are the original AGI version of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;, as well as installation for the Windows CD version of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI&quot; with high-resolution character art (although the assets can be accessed through ScummVM), the 2.0 DOS and Windows versions of &quot;KQVII&quot;, and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot;. It also lacks any of the bonus material from previous collections. This collection was released on Steam in 2009, but has been later removed, likely due to bugs and compatibility issues.
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest Bundle&quot;: &quot;King&#x27;s Quest 1+2+3&quot;, &quot;4+5+6&quot;, and &quot;7+8&quot; collections (2010): Three collections released by Activision through GOG.com. The first consists of the classic AGI versions of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;–&quot;III&quot; (the &quot;KQI&quot; remake is not included) released 2010, and the later games King&#x27;s Quest 4–5–6 on Vista. The final collection contains &quot;King&#x27;s Quest 7&quot; (2.0 version) and &quot;8&quot; designed to work on Vista and Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit. The collections come with assorted bonus material such as windows background artwork. All three sets can be bought as a bundle; the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest Bundle&quot; at 30% off the regular price of all three separately.
*&quot;King&#x27;s Quest: The Complete Collection&quot; (2015): Bundles the five chapters and a bonus playable episode of the reboot &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series.

*&quot;King Graham&#x27;s Board Game Challenge: Checkers &amp; Backgammon&quot;: A board game collection starring King Graham.

====&quot;Quest for Daventry&quot;====
&quot;Quest for Daventry&quot; is a &quot;King&#x27;s Quest V&quot; themed pinball board in &quot;Take a Break! Pinball&quot;, one of the first pinball games for Windows. Other boards in the game are also based on Sierra game characters like Larry Laffer, Gir Draxon, Willy Beamish, and Roger Wilco. The pinball game follows a narrative story with objectives based on the &quot;KQV&quot; adventure game. The board transforms adding new locations as the player finishes missions. Short cut scenes are shown near the ticker when certain objectives are met, and the ticker lists narrative or objective information.

====&quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Official Book of Games&quot; series====
This game contains both King Graham and Rosella as opponents. They both are able to communicate with other players in the game, discussing various topics related to the Kingdom of Daventry. One notable aspect of the stories of the characters is that it introduces Rosella&#x27;s Great-Grandfather, who &quot;slew the Dragon of Herenna&quot;. Another discussion between the royal family and Roger Wilco establishes that Roger once crashed a spaceship into Castle Daventy&#x27;s moat (a nod to an Easter egg in &quot;Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter&quot;). Graham and Rosella along with two &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; villains Mordack and Lolotte would go on to appear in &quot;Hoyle 3: Board Games&quot;, although they are not nearly as interactive, only commenting on moves in the game. In &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Classic Card Games&quot; only Graham returns as an opponent representing the series&#x27; characters, again comments were limited in interactivity, but it contains fully digitized speech.

===Books===
====Guide books====
Most of the games of the series came with manuals that included short stories or recap of the series. The manual for &quot;KQIII&quot; included the spellbook needed to solve the puzzles in the game (the spells were reprinted in &quot;The King&#x27;s Quest Companion&quot;). Often the manuals contained information used for copy-protection schemes.

====Novels====
Three original novels have been published by Boulevard Books:
*&quot;The Floating Castle&quot; (1995): Written by Craig Mills, placed somewhere between &quot;KQIV&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;, it follows Alexander on a quest to discover what is behind the mysterious Floating Castle and the monstrous invasions over the kingdom.
*&quot;The Kingdom of Sorrow&quot; (1996): Written by Kenyon Morr (pseudonym of Mark Sumner and Marella Sands), placed between &quot;KQII&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, it follows the adventures of Graham, who moves to rescue an imprisoned Fairy Queen held by the giant Dunstan in order to return balance in nature.
*&quot;See No Weevil&quot; (1996): Also written by Kenyon Morr, set between &quot;KQII&quot; and &quot;III&quot;. Taking place seven years after the previous book, it focuses on Rosella, just before her 15th birthday, who must run the Kingdom of Daventry during an absence of her parents.

==Cancelled games==
===&quot;King&#x27;s Quest II &amp; III&quot; remakes===
In 1990 the developers at Sierra redeveloped &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; with a new interface and up-to-date technology. The plan was to redevelop &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot; but due to rather disappointing sales of the 1990 remake of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;, the prospect of officially remaking and re-releasing the sequels was scrapped.

===Davidson version of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VIII&quot;===
Between September 1996 to January 21, 1997, due to criticism over the content in &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot; and &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; by Davidson &amp; Associates, a team of managers was assigned to work above Roberta Williams. They began creating their own version of &quot;KQVIII&quot; while ignoring her version. Their version was purged of combat, violence and possibly religious themes.
While Williams continued to work on her own ideas including its own script and puzzles, the Davidson&#x27;s team of managers began to design their script and puzzles for their own version of &quot;KQVIII&quot;. Davidson&#x27;s intervention was ultimately stopped (Davidson left the company in January 1997) and Williams reasserted her control, but this was not without its damage to her version of the game&#x27;s final release (due to loss of time and funding), which was already hurting from other technical issues caused by Dynamix engine development problem and others.

===Cancelled Sequels===
There have been several attempts to create a ninth installment in the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series, all of which have been canceled before going into production. All three development attempts never went past announcement or concept stages nor received official titles. They were described as the next game in the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; franchise in known released information. &quot;King&#x27;s Quest 9&quot; or &quot;Kings&#x27;s Quest IX&quot; are more unofficial designation for being the next game in the franchise used by the media in regards to released information. The idea of a &quot;King&#x27;s Quest 9&quot; goes back to some of the discussions with Roberta Williams after the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot;.

The &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity Prima&#x27;s Official Strategy Guide&quot; by Rick Barba made reference to &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IX&quot; as the next title in the series if a new one was made (or at least as a description of the ninth game in the series). Roberta Williams offered a few ideas for a &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IX&quot; in 1998–1999, her version never saw development. The ninth game has been in development four times since then with three different developers, Vivendi Games, Silicon Knights, and Telltale Games between 2001 and 2013, and eventually The Odd Gentlemen rebooted the series in 2015.

====Roberta Williams/Sierra====
Following the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VIII&quot; (&quot;Mask of Eternity)&quot;, Roberta Williams occasionally alluded to ideas if she was allowed to make the follow-up game or ideas that would influence the direction of any follow-up games, or ideas that were cut during the process of &quot;KQVIII&quot; that she would have liked to have introduced in the following game. Though she was generally tightlipped on the subject when it came to the next game, there are a few details. These never evolved into anything, however, and the game was neither started nor canceled.

Primarily it was decided during the production of &quot;KQVIII&quot; that Graham was now too old to go on adventures, and that Alexander would be less likely to go on adventures as he now had his own concerns as king of the Green Isles. This led to Roberta introducing a new playable character into the series (which started with Connor), which probably would have had similar impact in future games in the series had she had the chance to develop them. Rosella was still a possibility for use in future games, and Williams tossed out the idea that Connor might even meet the princess. This idea grew to include the idea that Rosella would possibly fall in love with Connor, or Connor would fall in love with Rosella and initiate some kind of love triangle between them and Rosella&#x27;s other love interest, Edgar (&quot;KQIV&quot;/&quot;KQVII&quot;). In addition she had ideas to add multiplayer as early as &quot;KQVIII&quot; early development, but these were cut and she hoped to introduce them into future games in the series. Some of the ideas were an MMO (massive multiplayer online) adventure game, with the ability for players to collect and swap items to help each other solve puzzles, or fight monsters together.

====Vivendi Games====
There was a ninth installment in development by Vivendi Games (under the Sierra branding) between 2001 and 2002. It was canceled before going into production. The game never made it past the prototype stage. Images of two renders of the playable character were leaked to the public. The renders show what looks like an older and bearded King Graham, wielding a giant sword, wearing full armor, and having the ability to flip in the air, suggesting that it may have been a third-person action-adventure game, similar to the 3D &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; games. This, like later attempts at producing a new game, were described as the new &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, and not necessarily &quot;KQIX&quot; (though news media referred to it as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest 9&quot;).

====Silicon Knights====
Silicon Knights worked on a prototype for a &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; game at some point before Telltale Games acquired the rights. This information was released to the public through documents on the Silicon Knights suit against Epic Games.

====Telltale Games====
Telltale Games&#x27; take on the ninth installment of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; franchise was first announced at a press event on February 17, 2011. Telltale said that they had entered into an agreement with Activision, then current owner of the rights to the classic Sierra On-Line adventure franchises, to create new episodic games based on those series. The first Sierra intellectual property they intended to work on was &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;. As development never went far, the game never received a title beyond the reference to the franchise name.

The game was to follow the format of previous Telltale Games series such as &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, as a continuation of the series with all new episodic games and multiple series. It was intended to preserve the back story of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, and fit into the established canon. It was intended to include the challenge and possibilities of death of the original games, but the gameplay was going to be adapted to relieve some of the frustration present in the original games.

Telltale approached Roberta Williams, the originator of the series, and one of the designers on all of the original games, to see if she was interested in working on the new one. While she declined by saying she had retired from games, she did offer the development team advice, which was &quot;very valuable&quot;, according to developer Dave Grossman. In May 2012, Dan Connors confirmed that Dave Grossman was in charge of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; project, and Telltale was working on how to proceed. The game was confirmed to be canceled by Telltale senior vice president of publishing, Steve Allison, on April 3, 2013.

==Fan-created games==

There have been several fan-created &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; games both original and retellings of the original games that have been released by various developers. Mike and Matt Chapman, creators of the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; series of cartoons and games, have created a game known as &quot;Peasant&#x27;s Quest&quot;, mostly based on &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot; but with allusions throughout the game to &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV&quot;, and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the series as number 79 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;humor, story telling, and classic puzzle implementation make the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series the most consistent top-quality line-up in computer gaming&#x27;s history&quot;.

By 1994, the &quot;King″s Quest&quot; series had sold 2.5 million copies, making it the bestselling computer game series at that time. According to Sierra, combined sales of the series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By 1997, the series had sold 7 million copies.

<doc id="231552" wikidata="Q2713448" url="?curid=231552" title="Power Stone (video game)">
<text>is a 1999 arcade fighting game developed and published by Capcom, released on the Sega NAOMI arcade board and ported to the Dreamcast home console. It consists of battles in three-dimensional environments and contains objects that could be picked up and used. A sequel, &quot;Power Stone 2&quot;, was released a year later, and manga and anime adaptations have also been made. Both games were later ported to the PlayStation Portable as Power Stone Collection in 2006, known in Japan as . Both are also set to be ported to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows in 2025 as part of &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay involves selecting a character and then proceeding to battle the other characters, one at a time, in various locales. The three-dimensional fighting includes the ability to use special attacks as well as to pick up and fight with such objects as tables, chairs, rocks and bombs. During battle, &quot;Power Stones&quot;, resembling gems of different colors, appear in the arena. If a character collects three Power Stones, they transform into a more powerful version of themself. The character will then be able to use one of two super special attacks: generally a massive long-range power attack and a grab or close-range move. The powered-up mode only lasts until the power bar is fully drained, during which the special attack can be executed (which completely depletes the power bar) or other, lesser special moves can be executed (which only use a small portion of power). Each match continues until the life bar of one of the two characters fighting is depleted.

==Plot==
Set in the 19th century, strong believers of legends, myths and superstition search for fame, fortune and glory. One legend above all is sought after by many, a treasure which can make any dream come true. Believers from all over the world set out to search for this treasure, and are forced to fight against one another in pursuit of the legendary Power Stone.

==Characters==
There are 10 characters in the original &quot;Power Stone&quot;:
* is the main character of &quot;Power Stone&quot;. Aged 21 and weighing , Fokker measures and has a fighting style of boxing. He is the son of Pride Falcon (Pride Fokker in Japan), who is playable in &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; after unlocking him. He is from Londo (a reference to London). When in Power Change, he is known as the Red Whirlwind. Falcon&#x27;s Japanese name is a reference to the Fokker, the plane he is seen in. This was possibly removed in the English version because of the inappropriate puns that would follow. His Power Change is a similar hybrid to Iron Man.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version of &quot;Power Stone&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. However, &quot;Power Stone Collection&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Blake Fischer of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the former console version, &quot;Every Dreamcast owner should have this title. It&#x27;s unique, it&#x27;s fast, and most importantly, it&#x27;s loads of fun. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 34 out of 40 for the same console version, and 29 out of 40 for the PSP version.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their May 1, 1999 issue as the eighteenth most-successful arcade game of the month. The game sold 200,000 copies.

In the UK, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the Dreamcast version a full 5-star rating, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s fantastic&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same console version&#x27;s Japanese import a score of nine out of ten, calling it &quot;a jewel in Dreamcast&#x27;s crown.&quot; Larry &quot;Major Mike&quot; Hryb of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the game in one review, &quot;&quot;Power Stone&quot; rocks. It&#x27;s an entertaining spin on fighting games for fans and non-fans alike. It may lack the technique and depth of &quot;Soul Calibur&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, but for fun and exciting gameplay, it will be hard to beat.&quot; In another review, The D-Pad Destroyer said, &quot;[For] Those of you looking for something new in your fighting games, look no further. &quot;Power Stone&quot; may not be hard-hitting kung fu action, but it&#x27;s a lot of fun. Grab a friend and get &quot;Stone&quot;.&quot; A Severed Head later said of the PSP version, &quot;The games in &quot;Power Stone Collection&quot; may be a generation old, but after revisiting these two relatively underrated titles, you won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re playing outdated games. You&#x27;d be missing out on one of the best fighting series from Capcom since &quot;Street Fighter&quot; if you didn&#x27;t give this one a whirl.&quot; Darren Jones of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; gave the same PSP version 90%, saying, &quot;The original &quot;Power Stone&quot; games were criminally ignored when first released, but now all you sinners have been given a second chance with this nigh-on perfect pair of conversions. The first (and best) game plays especially well on the PSP&#x27;s luxurious screen and both games run at a terrific speed over a wi-fi connection. Pick up this great collection and redeem yourselves before it&#x27;s too late.&quot; &quot;GameZone&quot; gave said PSP version 7.5 out of 10, saying it was &quot;Fast, frantic, and highly entertaining gameplay – from the first &quot;Power Stone&quot;. &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; isn&#x27;t nearly as exciting. The sequel is worth playing, but know that this is not worth buying as a &#x27;collection.&#x27; Buy it for the original if you love the original.&quot;

Colin Williamson of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave the Japanese Dreamcast import a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it was &quot;fast, fluid, and an utter blast to play, especially in the versus mode.&quot; Scott Alan Marriott later gave the U.S. version four stars out of five, saying, &quot;The only real problem with &quot;Power Stone&quot;, aside from the emphasis on evading attacks by jumping around the room, is the lack of characters -- a total of ten are playable after unlocking the bosses, which seems too small a number compared to other fighting games. It also would have been great if the developers doubled the size of the playing field and offered four-player simultaneous action for some truly intense battles. Other than these minor issues, &quot;Power Stone&quot; shines brightly in a genre filled with so many ordinary titles.&quot;

==Legacy==
A sequel was released in 2000 called &quot;Power Stone 2&quot;, which featured the original cast (minus the hidden characters Kraken and Valgas; Kraken would be added to the console ports as an unlockable character) as well as several new characters. The sequel features the same three dimensional combat system, but now allows up to four players to play simultaneously. There are new maps, some of which contain multiple areas and moving sections. The sequel also features an entirely new arsenal of weapons, from futuristic handguns to gigantic mallets, and magic wands to vehicles. Players can collect these items in a special &quot;Adventure&quot; mode; they can then be traded at a special &quot;Item Shop&quot;, or combined to form new items.

A remake of the two games was released for the PSP in 2006 under the name Power Stone Collection. This collection contains slightly updated versions of both games (Dreamcast versions) on one UMD. The PSP version of the original &quot;Power Stone&quot; included the four new characters introduced in &quot;Power Stone 2&quot;. The arcade version is also set to be re-released in 2025 as part of &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

A lone &quot;Power Stone Manga&quot; from KC BomBom Comic was issued on March 15, 1999. An anime series adapting the events of the first game premiered in April 1999.

<doc id="231553" wikidata="Q4784196" url="?curid=231553" title="Arapahoe Basin">
<text>Arapahoe Basin ( ; often shortened to A-Basin, or simply The Basin) is an alpine ski area in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, in the Arapaho National Forest of Colorado. Arapahoe Basin is known for its extended season and its extreme terrain. Arapahoe Basin is located south of Loveland Pass on U.S. Highway 6 in Summit County. The resort&#x27;s terrain spans over 1,400 acres, serving up a mix of groomed runs, moguls, cornices, and glades. It features a lift-served vertical drop of 2,270 feet and is served by 9 lifts, with easy access to 145 trails. Additionally, there is a significant amount of hike-to terrain which expands the in-bounds area appeal.
There is also an abundance of non-winter activities available.

==Geography and climate==
The Arapahoe Basin East Wall has a summit elevation of , which is among the highest in-bounds skiable terrain in North America. Due to its high elevation and its mostly north-to-northeast face, the Basin&#x27;s ski season is much longer than most resorts in North America. It often begins its ski operations in mid-October and continues to run lifts until June, sometimes into early July, once as late as August 10, 1995, making it one of the first resorts to open and often the last one to close.

Arapahoe Basin is located just below Loveland Pass and offers views of the Continental Divide (which it borders) from the lifts. From the top of the ski area there are views of Lake Dillon, Breckenridge, Keystone, Montezuma, and Loveland Pass.

The Basin is located about west of Denver.

==Ski area information==

===Lodges/Restaurants===
A-Basin has five day lodges. At the base is the &quot;6th Alley&quot;, a year-round, day and evening restaurant/bar with indoor and outdoor dining on a two-story deck. Also, is the &quot;Legends Cafe&quot;, a breakfast or lunch cafeteria. The &quot;Black Mountain Lodge&quot; sits mid-mountain, at the top of the Black Mountain Express, serving Barbecue and a day lodge style menu. &quot;Il Rifugio&quot; at 12,456 feet, is the highest-elevation restaurant in North America, offering a European-style bistro specializing in wine and charcuterie pairings featuring both imported and local-to-Colorado meats and cheeses. Near the top of Lenawee Lift, &quot;Steilhang Hut&quot; is Arapahoe Basin&#x27;s newest on-mountain restaurant, serving Colorado-made specialty sausages, Colorado-brewed German draft beer, soft pretzels, and strudel made by a local Denver bakery.

There is no overnight lodging at Arapahoe Basin. The nearest lodging is located at the Keystone ski area, 6 mi. west. It is a short drive from several towns including Breckenridge, Frisco, Dillon, Keystone, Silverthorne, Silver Plume, and Georgetown.

===Terrain services===

Arapahoe Basin is mostly known for advanced and expert terrain, but also has runs for the novice and intermediate skier, as well as a children&#x27;s program. The &quot;Black Mountain Express&quot;, &quot;Molly Hogan&quot;, and &quot;Pika Place&quot; &amp; &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Magic Carpet&quot; (both surface conveyors) lifts, service easy runs.

&quot;Pika Place&quot; is conveniently located close to the base area lodge and is a carpet conveyor for kids and never-evers.

&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Magic Carpet&quot;, on the bunny slope, is conveniently located adjacent to the closest base area parking area. It is for beginners getting prepared to ride the nearby Molly Hogan chair lift.

&quot;Molly Hogan&quot; is a slow lift running over the bunny slope, for use by those just learning to ride a chair lift.

&quot;Black Mountain Express&quot; services greens, blues, and four blacks: &quot;The Gulch&quot; which runs parallel to &quot;Black Mountain Express&quot;; &quot;Exhibition&quot; which runs under the chair and features bumps, steep terrain, and a fair number of jumps; &quot;Lower Standard&quot;, &amp; &quot;Lower International&quot; which can be accessed from the standard race traverse.

The &quot;Pallavicini&quot; double services mostly black and double black terrain on the west side of the mountain, though it is possible to take some difficult blues back to the base and to ski the &quot;WestWall&quot;. The &quot;Pallavicini&quot; face itself, a group of very steep and seemingly endless mogul runs, is rated double black diamond. It provides gated access to &quot;Steep Gullies&quot;, an even more challenging area.
The &quot;Lenawee Express&quot; takes skiers to the top of the mountain, where they can access blues, blacks, and the &quot;East and West Walls&quot;. On the West Wall there is a blue called &quot;Cornice Run&quot; where skiers can take leaps from windblown cornices. The &quot;East Wall&quot; has some of the most difficult terrain at &quot;Arapahoe Basin&quot;. The &quot;Lower East Wall&quot; is rated black diamond and can be reached without hiking. Open primarily in late winter and spring, the &quot;Upper East Wall&quot; is rated double black diamond extreme and is only accessible on foot. A hike of approximately 30 minutes will take guests to the &quot;North Pole&quot;, a very steep descent through rocky terrain over avalanche-blasted territory. Along the ridge prior to the &quot;North Pole&quot; is a group of chutes accessed through notches in the cliff band. One chute actually requires some rock downclimbing to reach skiable snow, an interesting experience in ski boots while holding a pair of skis. These chutes are often only a couple of ski widths wide and require mountaineering skiing ability. Most of the terrain is prone to avalanches and is regularly blasted by the ski patrol before they declare the wall open. The &quot;Lower&quot; and &quot;Upper East Wall&quot; is bisected by the &quot;East Wall Traverse&quot; which is quite long and accesses a lot of difficult-to-reach territory from above and below, leaving prime snow conditions available for those willing to make the trek. The entire &quot;East Wall&quot; is not groomed and should not be taken lightly since evacuation by the ski patrol in this area is a difficult undertaking.

The &quot;Zuma&quot; lift services blue, black and double black trails over the backside of Arapahoe Basin in &quot;Montezuma Bowl&quot;. Montezuma Bowl offers everything from groomed intermediate runs to advanced cornice runs. It has mostly southern exposure.

The &quot;Beavers Area&quot; is 468 acres of terrain serviced by a fixed grip quad. It is a bowl to the northwest of Pallavinci, with blue and black rated runs. The full terrain includes open powder bowls, tree skiing, and rocky chutes, as well as two intermediate groomed runs.

==Expansion==
The &quot;Steep Gullies&quot; was included in the opening of the &quot;Beavers Area&quot; and has the most challenging skiing at Arapahoe Basin. These steep, narrow chutes vary in pitch and width, and are rated as &quot;extreme&quot; (double-black diamond). All terrain in The Steep Gullies is designated as &quot;hike back,&quot; meaning that guests must hike or skin back to the bottom of the Pallavicini Lift upon completion of their run.

==History==
Larry and Marnie Jump, Max Dercum, and Sandy Shaufler started Arapahoe Basin in 1945. The first year it was open for skiing was 1946. The ski area was sold in 1972 to Joe Jankovsky. He in turn sold the area to Ralston Purina in 1978. Alterra Mountain Company is now the owner. 

Arapahoe Basin became the first ski resort in the United States to open for the 2006–2007 season on October 13. It repeated for the 2007–2008 ski area by opening at 9:00 a.m. on October 10. This was the area&#x27;s earliest opening in 61 years and the earliest opening in North America for the season. Arapahoe Basin opened for the 2009–2010 season on Friday, October 9, the earliest start in its history.

During the 2007–2008 season, Arapahoe Basin expanded into Montezuma Bowl, with the largest terrain expansion in the nation for that season. Facing southwest towards Keystone, it provided a back bowl.
In 2010, Leitner-Poma replaced the Exhibition lift on the lower mountain with a high speed quad, the Black Mountain Express lift, Arapahoe Basin&#x27;s first detachable lift.
In November 2016, 468 acres were approved by the Forest Service and added to the ski area. Of those 468 acres, 329 opened for the 2017–2018 season; 232 in the Beavers section and 129 in the Steep Gullies section. Initially, the terrain was accessible by a 30-minute hike and contained expert and extreme terrain only. A fixed-grip quad chair lift was built in the summer of 2018. 
Opening date for 2016–2017 Season announced on Wednesday, October 19, 2016, with First Chair at 9:00am on Friday, October 21, 2016.
For the 2020–2021 season, Arapahoe Basin&#x27;s last two Yan double chairlifts were replaced with new lifts from Leitner-Poma. Pallavicini was replaced with a double, while Molly Hogan was replaced with a fixed grip quad.
For the 2022–2023 season, the ski area received its second high speed lift with the replacement of Lenawee Mountain with a high speed six pack.

In February 2019, Arapahoe Basin announced it was ending its 20+ year partnership with Vail Resorts and its Epic Pass at the end of the 2018–19 season. On August 2, 2019, Arapahoe Basin announced it would join the Ikon Pass starting with the 2019–2020 winter season.

In February 2024, Alterra entered into an agreement to purchase Arapahoe Basin from its previous Canadian Owner, DREAM. The deal officially closed on November 19, 2024. Alan Henceroth, the ski resorts&#x27; President &amp; COO will continue to manage it.

<doc id="231554" wikidata="Q1073880" url="?curid=231554" title="SNK">
<text>is a Japanese video gaming and interactive entertainment company. It was founded in 1978 as Shin Nihon Kikaku by Eikichi Kawasaki and began by developing coin-op games. SNK is known for its Neo Geo arcade system on which the company produced many in-house games and now-classic franchises during the 1990s, including &quot;Aggressors of Dark Kombat&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;, &quot;Metal Slug&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;The Last Blade&quot;, &quot;Twinkle Star Sprites&quot;, and &quot;World Heroes&quot;; they continue to develop and publish new titles in some of these franchises on contemporary arcade and home platforms. Since the 2000s, SNK have diversified from their traditional arcade focus into pachislot machines, mobile game development, and recently character licensing.

In 2001, due to financial troubles, the original SNK Corporation was forced to close. Anticipating the end of the company, founder Kawasaki established Playmore Corporation, which acquired all of the intellectual property of the SNK Corporation. In 2003, Playmore Corporation was renamed to SNK Playmore Corporation. In 2016, SNK dropped the name Playmore from its logo and reintroduced its old slogan, &quot;The Future Is Now&quot;, officially changing its corporate name back to SNK. It has been owned by the Saudi Arabian MiSK Foundation since 2022.

==History==
===Beginnings (1973–1981)===

SNK was founded in 1973 as Shin Nihon Kikaku and reorganized on July 22, 1978 as a stock company (&quot;kabushiki gaisha&quot;) under the name &quot;Shin Nihon Kikaku Corporation&quot;. When Eikichi Kawasaki noticed rapid growth in the coin-operated video game market, he expanded Shin Nihon Kikaku to include the development and marketing of stand-alone coin-op games.

The company was nicknamed &quot;Shin Nihon Kikaku&quot; in katakana at first; however, since 1981, it has been changed to &quot;SNK&quot; by taking the initials from the Roman alphabet (Shin Nihon Kikaku). The English copyright notation was also &quot;SNK CORPORATION&quot;. It established itself in Sunnyvale, California, to deliver its own brand of coin-operated games to arcades in North America. SNK chose John Rowe to head its American operation.

The first two titles that SNK released were &quot;Ozma Wars&quot; (1979), a vertical space shooter, and &quot;Safari Rally&quot; (1980), a maze game. Game quality improved over time, most notably with &quot;Vanguard&quot; (1981), a side-scrolling space shooter. SNK licensed the game to Centuri for distribution in North America. Centuri started manufacturing and distributing the game by itself when profits exceeded projections. In part due to the success of &quot;Vanguard&quot;, SNK began to gain fame and reputation. An American branch opened on October 20, 1981, named SNK Electronics Corporation.

===SNK Corporation (1986–1999; first incarnation)===
In April 1986, the company name was changed to the nickname &quot;SNK&quot;, but the registered trade name had to be SNK Corporation. This is because the Ministry of Justice at the time did not allow the registration of business names in alphabets. In November 1986, the American subsidiary SNK Corporation of America was born in Sunnyvale, California. In March 1988, SNK staff moved to a building in Suita, Osaka, Japan.

At this point, the Japanese operations of SNK Corporation had shifted their focus solely toward developing and licensing video games for arcade use and later for early consoles. Between 1979 and 1986, SNK produced 23 stand-alone arcade games. Highlights from this period include &quot;Mad Crasher&quot; (1984), &quot;Alpha Mission&quot; (1985), and &quot;Athena&quot; (1986), a game that gained a large following when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1987. SNK&#x27;s most successful game from this time was &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, released in 1986. It was licensed and ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Commodore 64, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and NES. After &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, SNK released two sequels: &quot;Victory Road&quot; and &quot;Ikari III: The Rescue&quot;.

At the time, Japan was affected by the video game crash of 1983. The console manufacturer Nintendo remained in business throughout and after the crash. SNK became a third-party licensee for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom (alternative name for the NES) system in 1985. It opened a second branch in the US, called SNK Home Entertainment, based in Torrance, California. The branch handled the North American distribution and marketing of the company&#x27;s products for home consoles. John Rowe had already left the company to form Tradewest, which went on to market the &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; series in North America. Paul Jacobs took over Rowe&#x27;s position over both halves of SNK America. He is known for having helped launch the company&#x27;s Neo Geo system outside of Asia.

In response to strong sales of the company&#x27;s NES ports, SNK began to dabble in the development of original software designed specifically for the NES console. Two games came out of this effort: &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; (1989) and &quot;Crystalis&quot; (1990; known as &quot;God Slayer&quot; in Japan). In 1989, two home video game consoles were released in North America: the Sega Genesis, and NEC and Hudson Soft&#x27;s TurboGrafx-16. Nintendo followed suit with a new system in 1991, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES, SNES). SNK as a whole did not become involved in the &quot;system wars&quot; of the early 1990s. Instead, it refocused its efforts on arcades. Other third parties, such as Romstar and Takara, were left to license and port SNK&#x27;s properties to the various home consoles of the time with help from SNK&#x27;s American home entertainment division. With console ports mainly handled outside the company, it moved on to developing SNK-branded arcade equipment. SNK also licensed Tiger Electronics to market handheld electronic games from some of its brands.

In 1988, SNK created the idea of a modular cabinet for arcades. Up to that point, arcade cabinets typically contained only one game. When an arcade operator wanted to switch or replace that game, it would have to completely remove the internals of the existing cabinet or exchange the entire setup for another game. SNK&#x27;s new system, called the Neo Geo MVS (short for Multi Video System), developed by Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters director Takashi Nishiyama, featured multiple games in a single cabinet and used a cartridge-based storage mechanism. The system debuted in 1990 and could contain one, two, four, or six separate games in a single cabinet. To swap in a new game, all the operator had to do was remove one cartridge and exchange it for another. The MVS was an immediate success. It greatly shortened the setup time needed for each game, minimized floor space for cabinets, and reduced costs for new cartridges to US$500—less than half of what a traditional arcade unit cost at the time.

SNK wanted to bring arcade games to people&#x27;s homes without making CPU and memory performance compromises that typical home consoles were forced to make. In 1990, the Neo Geo family was created. The company released a home version of the MVS, a single cartridge unit called the Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System (Neo Geo AES). Initially, the AES was only available for rent or for use in hotel settings, but SNK quickly began selling the system through stores when customer response indicated that people were willing to spend money on home versions. Several franchises of games derived from it, including &quot;Sengoku&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;The Last Blade&quot;, &quot;Super Sidekicks&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Metal Slug&quot;, &quot;Burning Fight&quot;, &quot;Savage Reign&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. The &quot;King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, and &quot;Metal Slug&quot; series were continued on later consoles. SNK also helped publish third-party Neo Geo games such as ADK&#x27;s &quot;World Heroes&quot; and &quot;Aggressors of Dark Kombat&quot;, Visco&#x27;s &quot;Breakers&quot; and &quot;Ganryu&quot;, Noise Factory&#x27;s &quot;Rage of the Dragons&quot; and &quot;Sengoku 3&quot;, Sunsoft&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors&quot; and &quot;Waku Waku 7&quot;, Sammy&#x27;s &quot;Viewpoint&quot;, NMK&#x27;s &quot;Zed Blade&quot;, Psikyo&#x27;s &quot;Strikers 1945 Plus&quot;, Aiky/Taito&#x27;s &quot;Pochi and Nyaa&quot;, Paon/Eleven/Gavaking&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare in the Dark&quot;, Face&#x27;s &quot;Money Puzzle Exchanger&quot;, Data East&#x27;s &quot;Spinmaster&quot; and &quot;Street Slam&quot;, and Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer&quot;. During this time, SNK also released stand-alone arcade games, some of which were ported to home consoles, including &quot;Vanguard&quot;, &quot;Alpha Mission&quot;, &quot;Athena&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot;, &quot;Touch Down Fever&quot;, &quot;Time Soldiers&quot;, &quot;P.O.W.: Prisoners of War&quot;, &quot;Beast Busters&quot;, and &quot;Street Smart&quot;.

Compared to other consoles at the time, the Neo Geo AES had much better graphics and sound; It debuted at $599 (), sold with two joystick controllers and a game (either &quot;Baseball Stars Professional&quot; or &quot;NAM-1975&quot;). Within a few months of the system&#x27;s introduction in North America, SNK increased the cost to $649 and changed the pack-in game to &quot;Magician Lord&quot;. Alternatively, the console could be bought for $399 with one control stick and without an accompanying game. Other games cost at least $200 each. Joystick controllers contained the same four-button layout as the arcade MVS cabinet. The quality of AES games varied. Some, such as the &quot;Super Sidekicks&quot; series, were all-new creations, while others were updated versions of earlier successes, such as &quot;Baseball Stars Professional&quot;. SNK games were graphically bold and bright. Games such as &quot;Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy&quot; and the famous &quot;Metal Slug&quot; series were distinctive and instantly recognizable, contributing to the system&#x27;s success in arcades.

SNK also produced the Neo Geo CD home console, the Hyper Neo-Geo 64 arcade system, and two handheld game consoles, the Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color. Several more famous franchise titles, originally created for the MVS and AES systems, have been ported to other consoles such as the Genesis, Saturn and Dreamcast; SNES; PlayStation and PlayStation 2; Xbox; and Wii.

The Neo Geo Pocket was SNK&#x27;s original handheld system. It was released in Japan in late 1998 and featured a monochrome (one-color) display. Because its sales were fewer than the expected number, it was discontinued in 1999 in favor of the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which was later released in North America and Europe.

In 1999, SNK opened the Neo Geo World Tokyo Bayside amusement park as part of the Palette Town entertainment complex in Odaiba, Tokyo equipped with attractions such as Ferris wheels and roller coasters. A large-scale tie-in was established with the Fujisankei Communications Group, owners of the nearby television station Fuji TV, and was frequently promoted in various media.

However, by the late 1990s, the 2D fighting game boom, which had been behind much of SNK&#x27;s recent success, had come to an end, and both the Neo Geo CD and Hyper Neo Geo 64 failed to meet sales expectations. At the same time, the Neo Geo Pocket, while initially selling well, began to fall behind in the market after the release of the Game Boy Color, and Neo Geo World Tokyo Bayside quickly lost attendance after the re-opening of Yokohama Cosmo World a few months later, with the park considered to be a massive failure. In addition, the arcade game magazine &quot;Gamest&quot;, one of the biggest promoters of SNK titles, ceased publication after its publisher Shinseisha declared bankruptcy in 1999.

===Bankruptcy (2000–2001)===
SNK had focused on the booming arcade industry for the 1990s, but as interest in arcades fell in favor of home and portable consoles going into the 2000s, as well as the move to 3D, they were unable to adjust to the changing market. Their newer 3D hardware Hyper Neo Geo 64 was a large failure and the amusement parks opened in Japan also proved to be failing.

SNK tried to develop more titles for the third-party home console market, such as &quot;Shinsetsu Samurai Spirits Bushidō Retsuden&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Koudelka&quot;, and &quot;Cool Cool Toon&quot;, but as none of them sold well it left the company&#x27;s financial situation in a dire state. In January 2000, SNK&#x27;s poor financial status led to its acquisition by Aruze, a company known for its pachinko machines and the parent company of its competitor SETA. Instead of developing video games using SNK&#x27;s intellectual properties, Aruze manufactured pachinko machines that featured popular series such as &quot;King of Fighters&quot;. SNK saw little success in the video game market.

The same year, Capcom agreed to create a series of fighting games featuring both companies&#x27; fighting game characters. The &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; games were a success, however most of the profits went to Capcom because it developed and published the games. SNK released &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; on the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Combined, the two games sold around 50,000 copies.

SNK closed all American, Canadian and European operations, on June 13, 2000. The company sold rights to distribution in North America for MVS arcade systems and Neo Print photo systems. It licensed North American localizations of some console releases to outside companies. With low morale and an unclear future, many of the company&#x27;s employees left their jobs. Some joined rivals Capcom and Arc System Works, and others moved on to found the developer Dimps. Kawasaki, along with five other former SNK executives, funded the formation of BrezzaSoft, which continued to develop Neo Geo games such as &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;.

With a total debt of about 38 billion yen, SNK gave up on voluntary reconstruction, and on April 2, 2001, SNK applied for the application of the Civil Rehabilitation Law to the Osaka District Court. The application was accepted, and the revitalization procedures were once proceeded, and the head office returned to Suita City, Osaka Prefecture. The district court decided to abolish the civil rehabilitation proceedings on October 1, of the same year, and declared bankruptcy on October 30. Licenses for SNK&#x27;s game production and development rights to its franchises were sold to several other companies. These included BrezzaSoft, which produced &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, such as South Korean-based Eolith, which produced &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; franchise between 2001 and 2002, and Mega Enterprise, which produced &quot;Metal Slug 4&quot;.

===Playmore and SNK Playmore (2001–2016)===
Established as Playmore Corporation on August 1, 2001. It was originally an affiliate of the former SNK. Initially, it was a legal company specializing in copyright management services, and it would be incorrect to refer to the former SNK as its predecessor company. On October 30, of the same year, the company won the company&#x27;s intellectual property rights in a bid made during the bankruptcy of the former SNK.

To re-establish its presence in the gaming market, Playmore acquired BrezzaSoft and its former SNK developers, as well as Japan-based Neo Geo developer Noise Factory. Sun Amusement, a Japanese commercial games distributor, was acquired by SNK to provide the company with an arcade distribution outlet in Japan. International offices were established in South Korea, Hong Kong, and the United States under the name SNK NeoGeo for commercial and, later, consumer gaming distribution. In July 2003, with the permission of Eikichi Kawasaki, the founder of the former SNK company, and after it reacquired the rights to SNK trademark from Aruze, the company changed its name to SNK Playmore Corporation. In the same year, SNK purchased ADK shortly after it filed for bankruptcy. Previously, ADK was a third-party company that had been heavily associated with SNK since the late 1980s. SNK Playmore&#x27;s operations in Japan already largely resembled the original company: SNK employed many employees who left after its bankruptcy filing and occupied its former building.

In October 2002, Kawasaki sued Aruze for copyright infringement, claiming 6.2 billion Japanese yen (US$) in damages. He cited that Aruze had continued to use SNK&#x27;s intellectual properties after Playmore re-acquired them. A preliminary decision in January 2004 by the Osaka District Court favored SNK Playmore, awarding it 5.64 billion yen (US$).
In the fall and winter of 2003, SNK Playmore obtained an injunction against a group of four different companies, causing hundreds of AES cartridges to be seized. In the following year, SNK Playmore struck a compromise with two of the companies. The two were allowed to sell AES cartridges, under the conditions that the cartridges would not be modified again and that any legitimate materials would be returned to SNK Playmore.

Within the same year, SNK Playmore would discontinue the AES system, preferring to publish video games in cooperation with Sammy. Using its arcade board Atomiswave, SNK Playmore gained a more secure and modern platform for new arcade releases. In 2004, SNK Playmore officially became licensed to manufacture pachislot machines (Japanese slot machines played in pachinko parlors). The company released its first two machines that year: &quot;Metal Slug&quot; and &quot;Dragon Gal&quot;. Pachislots would be more heavily featured in SNK Playmore&#x27;s product lineup for the next decade.

In September 2006 at the Tokyo Game Show (TGS), SNK Playmore announced that it had ceased producing games on the Atomiswave, favoring Taito&#x27;s Type X2 arcade platform. To counter the decline in the commercial gaming industry, the company shifted some of its development focus to consumer games, including original games for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, mobile phones, and other platforms. Games continue to be ported to the PlayStation 2, mostly in Europe because Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA) did not approve most SNK Playmore games, and more rarely to the Xbox. In Japan, SNK Playmore released the &quot;NeoGeo Online Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2, which contained some of its older games. It featured emulations, and online play was available through the KDDI matching service. The company also released original titles based on existing franchises such as &quot;Metal Slug&quot; and the &quot;&quot; series.

In 2007, SNK Playmore USA released its first game on the Xbox Live Arcade, titled &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;. SNK Playmore also began supporting Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service on the Wii in the US with &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, and &quot;World Heroes&quot;. In 2007, &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; and &quot;Neo Geo Battle Coliseum&quot; were released. SNK Playmore also released its first adult-themed game franchise, &quot;Doki Doki Majo Shinpan!&quot;, the first for any handheld console. In 2009, the company released &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;, which was not well-received by the public and critics alike due to polemic changes in the game&#x27;s graphics and structure. In 2010, SNK Playmore released a sequel, &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, which was considered a much better game than its immediate predecessor. It either won or was nominated to multiple Game of the Year awards.

SNK has developed a great number of mobile games since 2009. It has licensed its characters for Chinese and other Asian games, mostly mobile.

In December 2012, SNK Playmore released the Neo Geo X, a relaunched mobile Neo Geo console. On October 2, 2013, SNK Playmore terminated its licensing agreement with the console&#x27;s manufacturer, Tommo, effectively ending production of the Neo Geo X less than a year after its release. Tommo disputed the termination, stating that its contract was extended until 2016 and that it performed every obligation of the licensing agreement.

In June 2013, the VIGAMUS, a museum of video games in Rome, hosted an event dedicated to the history of SNK, tracing back the origins of the company and explaining the evolution of its games. Yamamoto Kei, Kiyoji Tomita, and Ogura Eisuke participated at the event and were interviewed. Ogura also drew two original illustrations to exhibit at the museum.

=== Leyou acquisition and second incarnation of SNK Corporation (2016–2019)===
In March 2015, Leyou Technologies Holdings submitted a disclosure of interest document to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, highlighting a &quot;possible investment in a renowned Japanese video game developer&quot;. Later in August, it was announced that Chinese web and mobile game giant 37Games, and asset management firm Orient Securities had formed a joint venture to invest in Ledo Millennium, a subsidiary of Leyou. Through Ledo, the venture acquired Kawasaki&#x27;s 81.25% stake in SNK Playmore for $63.5 million. The reason given for the acquisition was to gain rights to SNK Playmore&#x27;s intellectual property, and further develop them by following Marvel Entertainment&#x27;s approach to mass media. The joint venture planned to integrate games, comics, film, and television in a media franchise.

With the purchase completed, SNK Playmore signaled a shift in the company&#x27;s strategy, which had previously been focused more on the production of pachislot and mobile games than its traditional area, console and arcade games. In November 2015, SNK Playmore announced that it was withdrawing from the pachislot market, choosing instead to focus on console and mobile gaming, as well as character licensing using its popular characters such as Mai Shiranui, Ukyou Tachibana, Nakoruru, and Haohmaru. Additionally, all of the aforementioned characters made their appearance as guest characters in a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), &quot;Wangzhe Rongyao&quot;, roughly translated to English as &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, which is the world highest-grossing game of all time as well as the most downloaded mobile app globally.

On April 25, 2016, SNK officially dropped the &quot;Playmore&quot; name from its corporate logo and reintroduced its old slogan, &quot;The Future Is Now&quot;, to signify &quot;a return to SNK&#x27;s rich gaming history&quot;. A legal name change from SNK Playmore Corporation to SNK Corporation followed on December 1, 2016, to more firmly establish SNK Playmore as the successor to the old SNK brand and legacy. &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, the first entry in its series in more than half a decade, was released in 2016. In July 2018, SNK released the NEOGEO Mini, a miniature console based on the design of the company&#x27;s Japanese arcade machines. It was pre-loaded with forty classic Neo Geo games.

In June 2019, the 12th entry in the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, followed by an arcade version in October and a Nintendo Switch version later in the year.

On September 4, 2019, Nintendo announced that &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; protagonist and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; character Terry Bogard would be added as a downloadable, playable character to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, with a planned release in November 2019. Terry was made available on November 6, alongside a &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;-based stage and 50 songs from various SNK series.

=== Misk Foundation acquisition (2020–present)===
In November 2020, the MiSK Foundation, a non-profit organization owned by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, acquired a 33.3% share of SNK from the Chinese company Ledo Millenium through its subsidiary, Electronic Gaming Development Company (EGDC), with the intention to acquire a further 17.7% share at a later time as to gain controlling interest in the company.

In April 2021, three board members dispatched from Saudi Arabia were appointed. EGDC announced its intention to acquire 51% through additional purchases. In February 2022, EGDC&#x27;s ownership share was increased to 96.18%. In May, of the same year, SNK notifies the delisting of its shares on the Korea Exchange (KOSDAQ) and EGDC&#x27;s future plans to acquire all of the company&#x27;s shares becoming its wholly owned subsidiary. On March 20, 2023, SNK relocated its main headquarters to Yodogawa-ku, Osaka.

In June 28, 2024, SNK opened a Singaporean branch called SNK Games Singapore, and is currently re-expanding its global reach.

On December 30, 2024, SNK announced the establishment of a new division known as KOF Studio to develop future projects in their fighting game franchises.

SNK is best recognized for its 2D fighting arcade games, most of which were released during the 1990s on their own Neo Geo arcade system. The first of these was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot; — the first title of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series — after which numerous other fighting games were released including &quot;World Heroes&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Aggressors of Dark Kombat&quot;, and the popular &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;. This then led to what is often seen as the company&#x27;s most famous franchise, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; — the first title in this series was 1994&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;. These franchises also consist of numerous notable characters that have since become icons of SNK, such as Terry Bogard, Kyo Kusanagi and Mai Shiranui. In other genres, the &quot;Metal Slug&quot; run and gun series is also one of SNK&#x27;s most well known franchises.

=== Neo Geo and other hardware ===

SNK designed and released the Neo Geo (stylized NEOGEO) on April 26, 1990, an arcade cabinet that could store multiple games in one. It used swappable cartridges as opposed to other arcade machines at the time, and this was a factor in its popularity, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. The system, known as MVS (Multi Video System), was a big success for SNK and it was the platform from which many of SNK&#x27;s big franchises originated from. The hardware features comparatively colorful 2D graphics. The hardware was in part designed by Alpha Denshi (later ADK).

The Neo Geo also had a video game console variant, often named the AES (Advanced Entertainment System), using the same cartridge media. Initially, the home system was only available for rent to commercial establishments, such as hotel chains, bars and restaurants, and other venues. When customer response indicated that some gamers were willing to buy a US$650 console, SNK expanded sales and marketing into the home console market. A CD-based equivalent home console was later released, called Neo Geo CD. SNK produced the Neo Geo until 1997 while new software continued to be released for it until 2004. Reincarnations of the Neo Geo continue to be made to this day both by SNK and officially licensed third-parties; the first of these was the Neo Geo X handheld released in 2012, followed by the Neo Geo Mini in 2018.

The company developed and produced a number of other hardware during the 1990s after the Neo Geo, all of which were short-lived and commercially unsuccessful. The Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade board, released in 1997, was designed to be a modern follow-up to Neo Geo with 3D graphical capabilties, however it was a significant failure and few games were made for the platform. SNK then developed and released the handheld game device Neo Geo Pocket for the Japanese market, and its follow-up Neo Geo Pocket Color with a color display, released globally; both of these were discontinued by 2000 in the West, and then in 2001 when the original SNK went bankrupt.

<text>Marko Mrnjavčević (, ;  – 17 May 1395) was the &quot;de jure&quot; Serbian king from 1371 to 1395, while he was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of territory in western Macedonia centered on the town of Prilep. He is known as Prince Marko (; , &quot;Kraljević Marko&quot;, ) and King Marko (; ; ) in South Slavic oral tradition, in which he has become a major character during the period of Ottoman rule over the Balkans. Marko&#x27;s father, King Vukašin, was co-ruler with Serbian Tsar Stefan Uroš V, whose reign was characterised by weakening central authority and the gradual disintegration of the Serbian Empire. Vukašin&#x27;s holdings included lands in north-western Macedonia and Kosovo. In 1370 or 1371, he crowned Marko &quot;young king&quot;; this title included the possibility that Marko would succeed the childless Uroš on the Serbian throne.

On 26 September 1371, Vukašin was killed and his forces defeated in the Battle of Maritsa. About two months later, Tsar Uroš died. This formally made Marko the king of the Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko&#x27;s Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Later, Marko became an Ottoman vassal and died on 17 May 1395, fighting against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.

Although a ruler of modest historical significance, Marko became a major character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians, remembered in Balkan folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and confronted the Turks during the Ottoman occupation.

==Life==
===Until 1371===
Marko was born about 1335 as the first son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his wife Alena. The patronymic &quot;Mrnjavčević&quot; derives from Mrnjava, described by 17th-century Ragusan historian Mavro Orbin as a minor nobleman from Zachlumia (in present-day Herzegovina and southern Dalmatia). According to Orbin, Mrnjava&#x27;s sons were born in Livno in western Bosnia, where he may have moved after Zachlumia was annexed from Serbia by Bosnia in 1326. The Mrnjavčević family may have later supported Serbian Emperor (tsar) Stefan Dušan in his preparations to invade Bosnia as did other Zachlumian nobles, and, fearing punishment, emigrated to the Serbian Empire before the war started. These preparations possibly began two years ahead of the invasion, which took place in 1350. From that year comes the earliest written reference to Marko&#x27;s father Vukašin, describing him as Dušan&#x27;s appointed &quot;župan&quot; (district governor) of Prilep, which was acquired by Serbia from Byzantium in 1334 with other parts of Macedonia. In 1355, at about age 47, Stefan Dušan died suddenly of a stroke.

Dušan was succeeded by his 19-year-old son Uroš, who apparently regarded Marko Mrnjavčević as a man of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the Ragusan Republic after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from Prizren who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević. An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of Tikveš, mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.

Dušan&#x27;s death was followed by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including Epirus, Thessaly, and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357. However, the core of the state (the western lands, including Zeta and Travunia with the upper Drina Valley; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš. Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš&#x27; authority even in the part of the state that remained Serbian. Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain. Serbian lords also fought each other for territory and influence.

Vukašin Mrnjavčević was a skilful politician, and gradually assumed the main role in the empire. In August or September 1365 Uroš crowned him king, making him his co-ruler. By 1370, Marko&#x27;s potential patrimony increased as Vukašin expanded his personal holdings from Prilep further into Macedonia, Kosovo and Metohija, acquiring Prizren, Pristina, Novo Brdo, Skopje and Ohrid. In a charter he issued on 5 April 1370, Vukašin mentioned his wife (Queen Alena) and sons (Marko and Andrijaš), signing himself as &quot;Lord of the Serb and Greek Lands, and of the Western Provinces&quot; (). In late 1370 or early 1371, Vukašin crowned Marko &quot;Young King&quot;, a title given to heirs presumptive of Serbian kings to secure their position as successors to the throne. Since Uroš was childless, Marko could thus become his successor, beginning a new—Vukašin—dynasty of Serbian sovereigns, and ending the two-century Nemanjić dynasty. Most Serbian lords were unhappy with the situation, which strengthened their desire for independence from the central authority.

Vukašin sought a well-connected spouse for Marko. A princess from the Croatian House of Šubić of Dalmatia was sent by her father, Grgur, to the court of their relative Tvrtko I, the ban of Bosnia. She was supposed to be raised and married by Tvrtko&#x27;s mother Jelena. Jelena was the daughter of George II Šubić, whose maternal grandfather was Serbian King Dragutin Nemanjić. The ban and his mother approved of Vukašin&#x27;s idea to join the Šubić princess and Marko, and the wedding was imminent. However, in April 1370 Pope Urban V sent Tvrtko a letter forbidding him to give the Catholic lady in marriage to the &quot;son of His Magnificence, the King of Serbia, a schismatic&quot; (&quot;filio magnifici viri Regis Rascie scismatico&quot;). The pope also notified King Louis I of Hungary, nominal overlord of the ban, of the impending &quot;offence to the Christian faith&quot;, and the marriage did not occur. Marko subsequently married Jelena (daughter of Radoslav Hlapen, the lord of Veria and Edessa and the major Serbian nobleman in southern Macedonia).

During the spring of 1371, Marko participated in the preparations for a campaign against Nikola Altomanović, the major lord in the west of the Empire. The campaign was planned jointly by King Vukašin and Đurađ I Balšić, lord of Zeta (who was married to Olivera, the king&#x27;s daughter). In July of that year Vukašin and Marko camped with their army outside Scutari, on Balšić&#x27;s territory, ready to make an incursion towards Onogošt in Altomanović&#x27;s land. The attack never took place, since the Ottomans threatened the land of Despot Jovan Uglješa (lord of Serres and Vukašin&#x27;s younger brother, who ruled in eastern Macedonia) and the Mrnjavčević forces were quickly directed eastward. Having sought allies in vain, the two brothers and their troops entered Ottoman-controlled territory. At the Battle of Maritsa on 26 September 1371, the Turks annihilated the Serbian army; the bodies of Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa were never found. The battle site, near the village of Ormenio in present-day eastern Greece, has ever since been called as &quot;Sırp Sındığı&quot; (&quot;Serbian rout&quot;) in Turkish. The Battle of Maritsa had far-reaching consequences for the region, since it opened the Balkans to the Turks.

===After 1371===
When his father died, &quot;young king&quot; Marko became king and co-ruler with Emperor Uroš. The Nemanjić dynasty ended soon afterwards, when Uroš died on 2 (or 4) December 1371 and Marko became the formal sovereign of Serbia. Serbian lords, however, did not recognise him, and divisions within the state increased. After the two brothers&#x27; deaths and the destruction of their armies, the Mrnjavčević family was left powerless. Lords around Marko exploited the opportunity to seize significant parts of his patrimony. By 1372, Đurađ I Balšić took Prizren and Peć, and Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović took Pristina. By 1377, Vuk Branković acquired Skopje, and Albanian magnate Andrea Gropa became virtually independent in Ohrid; however, he may have remained a vassal to Marko as he had been to Vukašin. Gropa&#x27;s son-in-law was Marko&#x27;s relative, Ostoja Rajaković of the clan of Ugarčić from Travunia. He was one of Serbian noblemen from Zachlumia and Travunia (adjacent principalities in present-day Herzegovina) who received lands in the newly conquered parts of Macedonia during Emperor Dušan&#x27;s reign.
The only sizable town kept by Marko was Prilep, from which his father rose. King Marko became a petty prince ruling a relatively small territory in western Macedonia, bordered in the north by the Šar mountains and Skopje; in the east by the Vardar and the Crna Reka rivers, and in the west by Ohrid. The southern limits of his territory are uncertain. Marko shared his rule with his younger brother, Andrijaš, who had his own land. Their mother, Queen Alena, became a nun after Vukašin&#x27;s death, taking the monastic name Jelisaveta, but was co-ruler with Andrijaš for some time after 1371. The youngest brother, Dmitar, lived on land controlled by Andrijaš. There was another brother, Ivaniš, about whom little is known. When Marko became an Ottoman vassal is uncertain, but it was probably not immediately after the Battle of Maritsa.

At some point, Marko separated from Jelena and lived with Todora, the wife of a man named Grgur, and Jelena returned to her father in Veria. Marko later sought to reconcile with Jelena but he had to send Todora to his father-in-law. Since Marko&#x27;s land was bordered on the south by Hlapen&#x27;s, the reconciliation may have been political. Scribe Dobre, a subject of Marko&#x27;s, transcribed a liturgical book for the church in the village of Kaluđerec, and when he finished, he composed an inscription which begins as follows:

Marko&#x27;s fortress was on a hill north of present-day Prilep; its partially preserved remains are known as &quot;Markovi Kuli&quot; (&quot;Marko&#x27;s towers&quot;). Beneath the fortress is the village of Varoš, site of the medieval Prilep. The village contains the Monastery of Archangel Michael, renovated by Marko and Vukašin, whose portraits are on the walls of the monastery&#x27;s church. Marko was ktetor of the Church of Saint Sunday in Prizren, which was finished in 1371, shortly before the Battle of Maritsa. In the inscription above the church&#x27;s entrance, he is called &quot;young king&quot;.

The Monastery of St. Demetrius, popularly known as Marko&#x27;s Monastery, is in the village of Markova Sušica (near Skopje) and was built from c. 1345 to 1376 (or 1377). Kings Marko and Vukašin, its &quot;ktetors&quot;, are depicted over the south entrance of the monastery church. Marko is an austere-looking man in purple clothes, wearing a crown decorated with pearls. With his left hand he holds a scroll, whose text begins: &quot;I, in the Christ God the pious King Marko, built and inscribed this divine temple ...&quot; In his right hand, he holds a horn symbolizing the horn of oil with which the Old Testament kings were anointed at their coronation (as described in 1 Samuel ). Marko is said to be shown here as the king chosen by God to lead his people through the crisis following the Battle of Maritsa.

Marko minted his own money, in common with his father and other Serbian nobles of the time. His silver coins weighed 1.11 grams, and were produced in three types. In two of them, the obverse contained a five-line text: (&quot;In the Christ God, the pious King Marko&quot;). In the first type, the reverse depicted Christ seated on a throne; in the second, Christ was seated on a mandorla. In the third type, the reverse depicted Christ on a mandorla; the obverse contained the four-line text (&quot;Pious King Marko&quot;), which Marko also used in the church inscription. He omitted a territorial designation from his title, probably in tacit acknowledgement of his limited power. Although his brother Andrijaš also minted his own coins, the money supply in the territory ruled by the Mrnjavčević brothers primarily consisted of coins struck by King Vukašin and Tsar Uroš. About 150 of Marko&#x27;s coins survive in numismatic collections.

By 1379, Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, the ruler of Moravian Serbia, emerged as the most-powerful Serbian nobleman. Although he called himself Autokrator of all the Serbs (), he was not strong enough to unite all Serbian lands under his authority. The Balšić and Mrnjavčević families, Konstantin Dragaš (maternally a Nemanjić), Vuk Branković and Radoslav Hlapen continued ruling their respective regions. In addition to Marko, Tvrtko I was crowned King of the Serbs and of Bosnia in 1377. Maternally related to the Nemanjić dynasty, Tvrtko had seized western portions of the former Serbian Empire in 1373.
On 15 June 1389, Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko&#x27;s nobleman Vlatko Vuković of Zachlumia, confronted the Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad I at the Battle of Kosovo, the best-known battle in medieval Serbian history. With the bulk of both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, the outcome of the battle was inconclusive. In its aftermath the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Ottomans had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.

In 1394, a group of Ottoman vassals in the Balkans renounced their vassalage. Although Marko was not among them, his younger brothers Andrijaš and Dmitar refused to remain under Ottoman dominance. They emigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary, entering the service of King Sigismund. They travelled via Ragusa, where they withdrew two-thirds of their late father&#x27;s store of of silver, leaving the remaining third for Marko. Although Andrijaš and Dmitar were the first Serbian nobles to emigrate to Hungary, the Serbian northward migration would continue throughout the Ottoman occupation.

In 1395, the Ottomans attacked Wallachia to punish its ruler, Mircea I, for his incursions into their territory. Three Serbian vassals fought on the Ottoman side: King Marko, Lord Konstantin Dragaš, and Despot Stefan Lazarević (son and heir of Prince Lazar). The Battle of Rovine, on 17 May 1395, was won by the Wallachians; Marko and Dragaš were killed. After their deaths the Ottomans annexed their lands, combining them into an Ottoman province centred in Kyustendil. Thirty-six years after the Battle of Rovine, Konstantin the Philosopher wrote the &quot;Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarević&quot; and recorded what Marko said to Dragaš on the eve of the battle: &quot;I say and pray to the lord to help the Christians and for me to be among the first to die in this war.&quot; The chronicle goes on to state that Marko and Dragaš were killed in the battle. Another medieval source that mentions Marko&#x27;s death at the Battle of Rovine is the Dečani Chronicle.

==In folk poetry==

===Serbian epic poetry===
Marko Mrnjavčević is the most popular hero of Serbian epic poetry, in which he is called &quot;Kraljević Marko&quot; (with the word &quot;kraljević&quot; meaning &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;king&#x27;s son&quot;). This informal title was attached to King Vukašin&#x27;s sons in contemporary sources as a surname (Marko Kraljević), and it was adopted by the Serbian oral tradition as part of Marko&#x27;s name.

Poems about Kraljević Marko do not follow a storyline; what binds them into a poetic cycle is the hero himself, with his adventures illuminating his character and personality. The epic Marko had a 300-year lifespan; 14th- to 16th-century heroes appearing as his companions include Miloš Obilić, Relja Krilatica, Vuk the Fiery Dragon and Sibinjanin Janko and his nephew, Banović Sekula. Very few historical facts about Marko can be found in the poems, but they reflect his connection with the disintegration of the Serbian Empire and his vassalage to the Ottomans. They were composed by anonymous Serbian poets during the Ottoman occupation of their land. According to American Slavicist George Rapall Noyes, they &quot;combine tragic pathos with almost ribald comedy in a fashion worthy of an Elizabethan playwright.&quot;

Serbian epic poetry agrees that King Vukašin was Marko&#x27;s father. His mother in the poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, the lord of the Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is described as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him with the help of the voivode&#x27;s young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima&#x27;s self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. They had two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a &quot;vila&quot; (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.

As Marko matured, he became headstrong; Vukašin once said that he had no control over his son, who went wherever he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes, his black moustache was the size of a six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko&#x27;s pernach weighed 66 okas () and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle&#x27;s right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.

The hero&#x27;s inseparable companion was his powerful, talking piebald horse ; Marko always gave him an equal share of his wine. The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive &quot;vila&quot; Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.

Marko is portrayed as a protector of the weak and helpless, a fighter against Turkish bullies and injustice in general. He was an idealised keeper of patriarchal and natural norms: in a Turkish military camp, he beheaded the Turk who dishonourably killed his father. He abolished the marriage tax by killing the tyrant who imposed it on the people of Kosovo. He saved the sultan&#x27;s daughter from an unwanted marriage after she entreated him, as her blood brother, to help her. He rescued three Serbian voivodes (his blood brothers) from a dungeon and helped animals in distress. Marko was a rescuer and benefactor of people, and a promoter of life; &quot;Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year&quot;.

Characteristic of Marko was his reverence and love for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, following it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good on the path of moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko&#x27;s honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.

Marko is represented as a loyal vassal of the Ottoman sultan, fighting to protect the potentate and his empire from outlaws. When summoned by the sultan, he participated in Turkish military campaigns. Even in this relationship, however, Marko&#x27;s personality and sense of dignity were apparent. He occasionally made the sultan uneasy, and meetings between them usually ended like this:

Marko&#x27;s fealty was combined with the notion that the servant was greater than his lord, as Serbian poets turned the tables on their conquerors. This dual aspect of Marko may explain his heroic status; for the Serbs he was &quot;the proud symbol expressive of the unbroken spirit that lived on in spite of disaster and defeat,&quot; according to translator of Serbian epic poems David Halyburton Low.

In battle, Marko used not only his strength and prowess but cunning and trickery. Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.

With his comic appearance and behaviour, and his remarks at his opponents&#x27; expense, Marko is the most humorous character in Serbian epic poetry. When a Moor struck him with a mace, Marko said laughingly, &quot;O valiant black Moor! Are you jesting or smiting in earnest?&quot; Jevrosima once advised her son to cease his bloody adventures and plough the fields instead. He obeyed in a grimly humorous way, ploughing the sultan&#x27;s highway instead of the fields. A group of Turkish Janissaries with three packs of gold shouted at him to stop ploughing the highway. He warned them to keep off the furrows, but quickly wearied of arguing:

Marko, age 300, rode the 160-year-old Šarac by the seashore towards Mount Urvina when a &quot;vila&quot; told him that he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the &quot;vila&quot;″s words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.

===Epic poetry of Bulgaria and North Macedonia===
&quot;Krali Marko&quot; has been one of the most popular characters in Bulgarian (more generally Eastern South Slavic) folklore for centuries. These epic tales of Marko seem to originate from the present-day North Macedonia, therefore also being an important part of the ethnic heritage of Macedonians.

According to local legend Marko&#x27;s mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), sister of the Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled territory in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko&#x27;s birth three &quot;narecnitsi&quot; (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting that he would be a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A &quot;samodiva&quot; named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the &quot;samodiva&quot;″s milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia (&quot;dappled&quot;) and a stepsister, the &quot;samodiva&quot; Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.
Bulgarian folklorists who collected stories about Marko included educator Trayko Kitanchev (in the Resen region of western Macedonia) and Marko Cepenkov of Prilep (throughout the region).

==In legend==
South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are primarily based on myths much older than the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He was said to have helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija (&quot;Iron Gate&quot;) with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.

Legend also has it that Marko acquired his strength after he was suckled by a &quot;vila&quot;. King Vukašin threw him into a river because he did not resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a &quot;vila&quot; suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a &quot;vila&quot;″s children lost in a mountain and shaded them against the sun (or gave them water). As a reward the &quot;vila&quot; suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An Istrian version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the &quot;vila&quot;″s breast became a snake.

Marko was associated with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; the boulders were said to be thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.

In some legends, Marko&#x27;s wonder horse was a gift from a &quot;vila&quot;. A Serbian story says that he was looking for a horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him . He became an enormously powerful horse and Marko&#x27;s inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a &quot;vila&quot;″s advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse&#x27;s skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.

According to folk tradition Marko never died; he lives on in a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, &quot;Oh God, what am I going to do now?&quot; God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls on the ground and Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank &quot;eagle&#x27;s water&quot;, which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.

==In modern culture==

During the 19th century, Marko was the subject of several dramatizations. In 1831 the Hungarian drama &quot;Prince Marko&quot;, possibly written by István Balog, was performed in Buda and in 1838, the Hungarian drama &quot;Prince Marko – Great Serbian Hero&quot; by Celesztin Pergő was staged in Arad. In 1848 Jovan Sterija Popović wrote the tragedy &quot;The Dream of Prince Marko&quot;, in which the legend of sleeping Marko is its central motif. Petar Preradović wrote the drama &quot;Kraljević Marko&quot;, which glorifies southern Slav strength. In 1863 Francesco Dall&#x27;Ongaro presented his Italian drama, &quot;The Resurrection of Prince Marko&quot;. In her collection of short stories from 1978, Nouvelles Orientales, Marguerite Yourcenar imagined an alternative, inexplicable end to Marko&#x27;s life (La Fin de Marko kraliévitch).

Of all Serbian epic or historical figures, Marko is considered to have given the most inspiration to visual artists; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors. His oldest known depictions are 14th-century frescoes from Marko&#x27;s Monastery and Prilep. An 18th-century drawing of Marko is found in the Čajniče Gospels, a medieval parchment manuscript belonging to a Serbian Orthodox church in Čajniče in eastern Bosnia. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint and reminiscent of stećci reliefs. Vuk Karadžić wrote that during his late-18th-century childhood he saw a painting of Marko carrying an ox on his back.
Nineteenth-century lithographs of Marko were made by Anastas Jovanović, Ferdo Kikerec and others. Artists who painted Marko during that century include Mina Karadžić, Novak Radonić and Đura Jakšić. Twentieth-century artists include Nadežda Petrović, Mirko Rački, Uroš Predić and Paja Jovanović. A sculpture of Marko on by Ivan Meštrović was reproduced on a Yugoslavian banknote and stamp. Modern illustrators with Marko as their subject include Alexander Key, Aleksandar Klas, Zuko Džumhur, Vasa Pomorišac and Bane Kerac.

Princ Marko, and his Sabre was also inspiration for Current Serbian National Anthem &quot;Boze Pravde&quot;. The song was taken from a theatre piece Markova Sablja, very popular among Serbs in 1872.

Motifs in multiple works are Marko and Ravijojla, Marko and his mother, Marko and Šarac, Marko shooting an arrow, Marko plowing the roads, the fight between Marko and Musa and Marko&#x27;s death. Also, several artists have tried to produce a realistic portrait of Marko based on his frescoes. In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, &quot;Krali Marko&quot;.

==Footnotes==
The family name &quot;Mrnjavčević&quot; was not mentioned in contemporary sources, nor was any other surname associated with this family. The oldest known source mentioning the name &quot;Mrnjavčević&quot; is &quot;Ruvarčev rodoslov&quot; &quot;The Genealogy of Ruvarac&quot;, written between 1563 and 1584. It is unknown whether it was introduced into the Genealogy from some older source, or from the folk poetry and tradition.
This liturgical book, acquired in the 19th century by Russian collector Aleksey Khludov, is kept today in the State Historical Museum of Russia.
The name Despotović (&quot;despot&#x27;s son&quot;) was applied in a similar way to Uglješa, the son of Despot Jovan Uglješa, King Vukašin&#x27;s younger brother.

<doc id="231570" wikidata="Q770873" url="?curid=231570" title="Desi">
<text>Desi ( or or ; Hindustani: देसी , , ) also Deshi, is a loose term used to describe the peoples, cultures, and products of the Indian subcontinent and their diaspora, derived from Sanskrit (), meaning &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;country&#x27;. Desi traces its origin to the people from the South Asian republics of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and may also sometimes include people from Afghanistan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 

==Etymology==
The ethnonym belongs in the endonymic category (i.e., it is a self-appellation). &quot;&quot; (/ &quot;desī&quot;) is a Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) word, meaning &#x27;national&#x27;, ultimately from Sanskrit &#x27;, derived from &#x27; () &#x27;region, province, country&#x27;. The first known usage of the Sanskrit word is found in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (~200 BCE), where it defines the regional varieties of folk performing arts, as opposed to the classical, pan-Indian &quot;margi&quot;. Thus, &#x27; () refers to one&#x27;s own country or homeland, while &#x27; () refers to another&#x27;s country or a foreign land.

==Usage==
The word &quot;Desi&quot; is widely used by South Asians, as well those of the South Asian diaspora, to describe themselves; those of South Asian origin, especially Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, use the term &quot;as a means of asserting or reclaiming a sense of pride&quot; in being South Asian, &quot;particularly in the face of racism, discrimination, and stigmatization&quot; of minorities in various parts of the world. With regard to usage of the word &quot;Desi&quot;, Helen Kim writes:

Among teenagers who have ancestral roots in the Indian subcontinent, the term &quot;Desi&quot; is &quot;embraced to elucidate a new inclusive identity of South Asians in the US, who participate as &#x27;public consumers and producers of a distinctive, widely circulating cultural and linguistic forms&#x27;.&quot; To this end, channels such as MTV Desi have recognized &quot;the transnational nature of Desi youth culture, writers, producers, and VJs&quot; and have shared &quot;a range of topics relating to life in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora worldwide&quot;.

&quot;Desi&quot; is sometimes perceived as offensive among some South Asian expatriates, as they claim that it erases the diversity of cultural identities within the South Asian community, and that it primarily identifies the dominant North Indian community while excluding other South Asian groups. Some resist the label, citing historical Indian imperialism and cultural hegemony. They believe that terms like &quot;Desi&quot; impose a homogenous identity and fail to acknowledge the pluralistic nature of South Asian communities. Alternatives like &quot;South Asian&quot; or &quot;Brown&quot; have been proposed, but they also have their limitations and can be perceived as misleading or exclusive. While some individuals find the term &quot;South Asian&quot; inclusive and encompassing, others feel it does not fully capture their specific backgrounds. The complexity and diversity of the diaspora necessitate recognizing multiple identities and resisting the tendency to homogenize or erase particular communities.

Among non-diasporic South Asians, the term &quot;Desi&quot; is sometimes used to indicate that a person is rural, unexposed to foreign/modern culture, and more deeply steeped in native South Asian culture.

==History==
The word &quot;Desi&quot; comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;Desh&quot; meaning &quot;country&quot;. The word &quot;Desi&quot; is used to refer to something &quot;from the country&quot; and with time its usage shifted towards referring to people, cultures, and products of a specific region; for example, desi food, desi calendars, and desi dress.

Desi contrasts with the Bengali and Hindustani language word &quot;vilāyati&quot; (Anglicised as &quot;Blighty&quot;) meaning &#x27;foreign&#x27;, which more specifically came to mean &#x27;European&#x27;, and &#x27;British; English&#x27; during the time of the British Raj in colonial India. The word is a loan of Indian Persian (), from () meaning &#x27;Iran&#x27; and later &#x27;Europe&#x27; or &#x27;Britain&#x27;, ultimately from Arabic meaning &#x27;state, province&#x27;.

After the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the United States dramatically increased immigration from the subcontinent. As increasing numbers of students from the subcontinent arrived in the US and UK, their countries of origin were colloquially referred to as &quot;&quot;. For example, all things Indian including Indian expatriates were referred to as &quot;desi&quot;.

==Culture==

Frank Anthony, an Anglo-Indian Christian leader who helped write the Constitution of India stated that unlike Europe, “[colonial] India had achieved a basic ethnic and cultural unity.” (the boundaries of colonial India include the modern-day republics of independent India, as well as what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh.)

In the United States, as in other countries, some diaspora desis are creating a &quot;fusion&quot; culture, in which foods, fashions, music, and the like from many areas of South Asia are &quot;fused&quot; both with each other and with elements from Western culture. For example, Urban Desi is a genre of music formed by the fusion of traditional South Asian music and Western urban music. The growing demand of popular programming for South Asians caused MTV to launch the desi-targeted television channel MTV Desi.

In the United Kingdom, desi communities have continued the fusion culture which first emerged during the 89 year rule of the British Raj in colonial India, influencing British music, art, fashion and food. There are now dedicated radio stations catering to British-South Asians such as the BBC Asian Network.

In Canada, desis have established sizable ethnic enclaves in areas such as Brampton, Ontario (suburban Toronto) and Surrey, British Columbia (suburban Vancouver).

===Performing arts===
The Natya Shastra refers to the regional varieties of folk dance and music elements as &quot;desi&quot;, and states that these are meant as pure entertainment for common people, while the pan-Indian &quot;margi&quot; elements are to spiritually enlighten the audience. The medieval developments of the classical Indian dance and music led to the introduction of desi gharanas, in addition to the classical gharanas codified in Natya Shastra. The &quot;desi&quot; gharanas further developed into the present-day adavus. There is raga in Indian classical music known as &quot;Desi&quot;.

===Food and drink===
In regions of South Asia, &quot;desi&quot; in the context of food, implies &quot;native&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;. For example, &quot;Desi chicken&quot; may refer to a native breed of chicken. This word is also usually restricted to Sanskrit-derived (Indo-Aryan) languages.

Heritage varieties of vegetables and other produce can also be qualified as &quot;desi&quot;. &quot;Desi diet&quot; refers to a diet and food choices followed by Indians around the world. &quot;Desi daru&quot; refers to &quot;country liquor&quot;, such as fenny, toddy and arrack. It is differentiated from Indian-made foreign liquor such as Indian-made whisky, rum, or vodka.

===Desi pubs===
In the United Kingdom, the term Desi pub is used to describe a pub which is owned or managed by an Indian landlord, or which serves Punjabi food. They developed during the 1960s and 1970s at a time when some British pubs enforced color bars to prevent Indians and other immigrants from drinking there. Desi pubs are especially common in the Black Country and surrounding areas of the West Midlands. As well as drinking places, they also act as community hubs and meeting places for people from different backgrounds and are considered to be an example of successful integration of Indian immigrants into British culture.

<text>Mavis Beacon is a fictional character created for the &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot; line of computer software.

== History ==
Developed to be a personification of a The Software Toolworks instructional typing program, Mavis Beacon debuted as simply a photo of a model on the software&#x27;s packaging in 1987. The model chosen to be the face of Mavis was Haitian-born Renée L&#x27;Espérance, who was discovered working behind the perfume counter at Saks Fifth Avenue Beverly Hills by former talk-show host and partner at The Software Toolworks Les Crane in 1985. Mavis&#x27;s name comes from a combination of Mavis Staples (one of the software developer&#x27;s favorite singers) and the word &quot;beacon&quot; (an allusion to her role as a guide to typing).

There have been several models chosen to represent the confident efficiency of Mavis Beacon; her image changes to represent a &quot;modern professional typing instructor.&quot;

According to an opinion article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, author J.D. Biersdorfer opined, &quot;Due to Mavis Beacon being portrayed by a black woman, some retailers were initially reluctant to display the product. However, once the popularity of the program became evident, many distributors reversed their decision and began to display the line of software bearing Mavis Beacon&#x27;s image.&quot;

Since its introduction, &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot; has been the best-selling instructional typing software.

== Fame ==
Mavis Beacon has been seen as groundbreaking for being one of the first computer instruction characters and for being a female African-American embodiment of computer software. Throughout the 1990s, Mavis Beacon served as the virtual typing instructor at numerous U.S. schools. As of 1998, she had instructed 6,000,000 school children. Mavis has been compared to U.S. cultural icon Betty Crocker and has been called &quot;the Betty Crocker of cyberspace&quot;.

=== Confusion ===
Mavis Beacon is often thought to be a living or historical figure by the public. This confusion has led many to contact the software developers seeking to speak to, interview, or book Mavis for an event. Furthermore, as a result of Mavis Beacon&#x27;s continuous use in computer typing software, and her image on millions of software boxes, many consumers have reported confabulations (i.e. false memories) of Mavis Beacon winning typing contests or appearing on talk shows.

<text>Henohenomoheji ( ) or hehenonomoheji () is a face known to be drawn by Japanese schoolchildren using hiragana characters. It became a popular drawing during the Edo period.

==Composition==
The word breaks down into seven hiragana characters: &quot;he&quot; (), &quot;no&quot; (), &quot;he&quot; (), &quot;no&quot; (), &quot;mo&quot; (), &quot;he&quot; (), and &quot;ji&quot; (). The first two &quot;he&quot; are the eyebrows, the two &quot;no&quot; are the eyes, the &quot;mo&quot; is a nose, and the last &quot;he&quot; is the mouth. The outline of the face is made by the character &quot;ji&quot;, its two short strokes (&quot;dakuten&quot;) forming the ear or cheek.

Henohenomoheji is often used to symbolize a nondescript or generic human face, such as the faces of &quot;kakashi&quot; (scarecrows) and teru teru bōzu. The characters are often sung as they are drawn, making the an .

<doc id="231591" wikidata="Q1358273" url="?curid=231591" title="José Nápoles">
<text>José Ángel Nápoles (April 13, 1940 – August 16, 2019) was a Cuban-born Mexican professional boxer. He was a two-time undisputed welterweight champion, having held the WBA, WBC, and &quot;The Ring&quot; welterweight titles between 1969 and 1975. He is frequently ranked as one of the greatest fighters of all time in that division and is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. His record of the most wins in unified championship bouts in boxing history, shared with Muhammad Ali, was unbeaten for 40 years. After debuting professionally in Cuba, he fought out of Mexico and became a Mexican citizen.

==Mexico==

Nápoles debuted as a professional boxer on August 2, 1958, in Cuba, knocking out Julio Rojas in the first round. Nápoles&#x27; first 21 bouts were in Cuba, against mostly unknown competition. He did beat Ángel García and Leslie Grant, but lost to Hilton Smith (in his first defeat).

After beating Enrique Carabeo in March 1961, Nápoles found himself a new challenge, outside of the ring; Cuban president Fidel Castro banned professional boxing in Cuba, and Nápoles soon found his career in jeopardy.

He found asylum in Mexico, where he soon found himself back inside the ring, beating Enrique Camarena by a knockout in two rounds on July 21, 1962. He won all four of his fights that year.

In 1963, he won seven bouts and lost two. He was defeated by Tony Perez and Alfredo Urbina, both by decision, but he beat JC Morgan, by knockout in seven rounds, in Venezuela.

1964 was a successful year for Nápoles. He travelled to Japan, where he beat Taketeru Yoshimoto by knockout in round one, and he beat future world champion Carlos Morocho Hernández by knockout in round seven, this time back in Venezuela. In addition to those wins, he avenged his loss to Urbina by knocking him out twice, the first time in the first round and the second time in the third.

He won three more fights in 1965, including another win against Morgan, before seeing a raise in opposition quality when he faced the former world Junior Welterweight champion Eddie Perkins, beating him by decision in ten rounds. For his next fight, he met his own future world title challenger, Adolph Pruitt, beating him by knockout in round three.

In 1966, he won five fights, all by knockout, and lost one, to arch-rival Morgan, who knocked him out in round four. This would be his last loss in four years.

==Welterweight champion==
Nápoles began a streak of 20 wins in a row, 13 of them before challenging for the world&#x27;s welterweight title. These included avenging the loss to Morgan with a two-round knockout. During this period, Nápoles also became a fan favorite in southern California, and, after beating Fate Davis, on February 15, 1969, in Mexico, he was given an opportunity to win the world championship when he faced the then-current champion Curtis Cokes in Inglewood, on April 18. Nápoles beat Cokes by a knockout in round 13 to become world welterweight champion, and, as was becoming common place for him, he wore a sombrero after the fight. On June 29, he retained the title in a rematch with Cokes by a knockout in round 10 in his hometown of Mexico City, and on October 12, he outpointed former world champion Emile Griffith in 15, also retaining the title.

==Loss of title==
Nápoles began the 1970s, by defeating Ernie &quot;Indian Red&quot; Lopez by a knockout in round 15 in front of an audience that included former world champion Sugar Ray Robinson on February 14, 1970. But after winning two non-title bouts, he suffered an upset when he was stopped due to being cut in four rounds by Carmen Basilio&#x27;s nephew Billy Backus, who took the world&#x27;s Welterweight title from Nápoles on December 3 at Syracuse.

==Regaining the title==
After winning one more fight, he and Backus fought again, for the world welterweight title now in Backus&#x27; hands. This time, it was held in Los Angeles, and Nápoles recovered the world championship via an 8th round stoppage. After three non-title wins, including one over Jean Josselin, he faced Hedgemon Lewis on December 14, retaining the world title with a decision in 15 rounds, but Nápoles&#x27; training habits were suffering; he was alleged to be coming into the gym stinking of alcohol with an attitude towards his seconds.

In 1972, he retained the title knocking out Ralph Charles in seven in England, and then, Pruitt resurfaced again, this time with the world Welterweight title on the line. Nápoles retained his crown by knockout in round two.

World traveller Nápoles began 1973 by retaining the title against Lopez again, by knockout in seven, then he visited Grenoble, France, where he retained the crown with a 15-round decision over Roger Menetrey, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he beat Clyde Gray, once again retaining the world title with a 15-round decision.

==Middleweight==

After this, many boxing fans were asking for a fight between Nápoles and world middleweight champion Carlos Monzón. The fight was made possible when Nápoles moved in weight to challenge Monzon for Monzon&#x27;s title, so the two dueled on February 9, 1974, at a ring set up inside a circus tent that had been erected in the Paris suburb of Puteaux. This would be Nápoles&#x27; only bout at the middleweight division, as he was defeated by quitting the match, officially losing by a seventh-round technical knockout. He then went back to the welterweight division, and retained the title twice before the year ended, with a knockout in nine over Lewis, and with a knockout in three over Horacio Saldaño.

In 1975, Nápoles had two wins over Armando Muniz, both times to retain his world title. The first time, a technical decision win in 12 rounds at Acapulco was a controversial win, so a return match was fought in Los Angeles, where Nápoles prevailed by decision.

==Retirement==
On December 6 of that year, however, Nápoles lost his title to British boxer John H. Stracey, who won over Nápoles by a technical knockout in round six at Mexico City despite being floored by Nápoles in round one. After this fight, Nápoles announced his retirement. He was able to stay away from the temptation of a comeback.

Nápoles had a final record of 81 wins and 7 losses, with 54 wins by knockout, which makes him a member of the exclusive group of boxers that won 50 or more fights by knockout in their careers.

==Personal life==
Napoles was the son of Pedro Napoles, a schoolteacher, and his wife Rosa. He had a brother, Pedro Napoles Jr. and nine children. He resided in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, with his wife Bertha.

Napoles co-starred with superstar Santo in a 1974 Mexican wrestler/horror film called &quot;Santo en la venganza de la llorona&quot;, aka &quot;Santo and Mantequilla Napoles in the Revenge of the Crying Woman&quot;.

Nápoles died on August 16, 2019, in Mexico City, after a long-illness at the age of 79.

==Honours==
In 1985, Nápoles was inducted into &quot;The Ring&quot; boxing hall of fame, and in 1990 into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="231593" wikidata="Q902984" url="?curid=231593" title="Wagner tuba">
<text>The Wagner tuba is a four-valve brass instrument commissioned by and named after Richard Wagner. It combines technical features of both standard tubas and French horns, though despite its name, the Wagner tuba is more similar to the latter, and usually played by horn players. Wagner commissioned the instrument for his four-part opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, where its purpose was to bridge the acoustical and textural gap between the French horn and trombone.

The sound produced by this instrument has been variously described as &quot;smoky&quot;, &quot;metallic&quot;, &quot;unearthly&quot; and &quot;majestic&quot;. Wagner tubas (or &quot;Tenortuben&quot; and &quot;Basstuben&quot;) are also referred to as Wagnertuben, Waldhorntuben, Bayreuth-tuben, Ring-tuben, or Horn-tuben by German writers, but it is most common to refer to them in English as Wagner tubas. Wagner&#x27;s published scores usually refer to these instruments in the plural, &quot;Tuben&quot;, but sometimes in the singular, &quot;Tuba&quot;.

== History ==
The Wagner tuba was originally created for Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen,&quot; which was based on Nordic mythology. He was attempting to perfect the Valhalla motive, as this was the first opera in which he attempted to conceive pitch, rhythm, and instrumentation in a single step. He first planned to use trombones for the motive, but ultimately decided to create new instruments, which he called &quot;Tuben.&quot; He planned to use four pairs of horn players; the last two pairs would double on the new instruments, a pair pitched in F (bass tuben) and a pair in Bb (tenor tuben). Wagner wanted a sound that would invoke Norse legends and create a better blend in the brass section. He wanted an instrument that had the sound of a lur, which is an ancient Nordic natural horn. In 1797, archeologists had unearthed ancient lurs that were still in playable condition. Through this, Wagner knew it was the sound he was searching for, but the natural horns were not chromatic. This meant that Wagner needed the flexibility of a saxhorn, which were valved instruments that allowed for chromatic range. 

In 1853, Wagner visited the shop of Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone and saxhorn. The saxhorn had a more cylindrical and larger bore, used the parabolic cupped mouthpiece, and thus had a more brassy tone that wasn&#x27;t quite suitable for Wagner&#x27;s tonal intent. Instead, Wagner&#x27;s wanted aural effect was obtained by a conical bore, similar to a horn, and the use of the horn mouthpiece (tapered and conical, as opposed to the parabolic cup mouthpiece such as on a trombone). Finally, with the help of the C. W. Moritz firm in Berlin, Wagner was able to develop his idea into a finished product. Another important figure in the development of the Wagner Tuba was Belgian Writer and Musician, Victor-Charles Mahillon. Mahillon designed a Wagner Tuba to be specifically played by trombonists, contrasting Adolphe Sax&#x27;s Wagner Tuba that is meant to be played by horn players.

Since then, other composers have written for it, most notably Anton Bruckner, in whose Symphony No. 7 a quartet of them is first heard in the slow movement in memory of Wagner, and Richard Strauss, who composed several works that used the Wagner tuba, including his Alpine Symphony.

The Paxman Musical Instruments horn manufacturer continues to produce Wagner tubas in F and B. The workshop of Engelbert Schmid also produces Wagner tubas. Some other companies that manufacture Wagner tubas include Hans Hoyer, Wessex, and Alexander.

== Design ==
The Wagner tuba is built with rotary valves, which (like those on the horn) are played with the left hand. Horn players traditionally double on Wagner tubas because the mouthpiece and fingering are identical, though the size of the bore of the Wagner tuba is midway between that of a euphonium and a horn. The Wagner tuba&#x27;s bore size is similar to that of a cornophone, which results in a similar sound.

The Wagner tuba nominally exists in two sizes, tenor in B and bass in F, with ranges comparable to those of horns in the same pitches while being less adept at the highest notes. Several 20th-century and later manufacturers have, however, combined the two instruments into a double Wagner tuba that can easily be configured in either B or F.

Wagner tubas are normally written as transposing instruments, but the notation used varies considerably and is a common source of confusion—Wagner himself used three different and incompatible notations in the course of the &quot;Ring&quot;, and all three of these systems (plus some others) have been used by subsequent composers. 

An additional source of confusion is that the instruments are invariably designated in orchestral scores simply as &quot;tubas&quot;, sometimes leaving it unclear whether the score means true bass tubas or Wagner tubas. (For example, orchestras sometimes assume the two tenor tubas in Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; are Wagner tubas, when the score means euphoniums.)

The name &quot;Wagner tuba&quot; is considered problematic, and possibly incorrect, by many theorists. Kent Kennan says they are poorly named, since &quot;they are really modified horns&quot; rather than actual tubas.

== Impact ==

Composers such as Wagner who made use of this instrument would later inspire future composers to also write for the Wagner tuba. Wagner tubas appear in the work of composers such as Richard Strauss, Anton Bruckner, Béla Bartók, and many more. Anton Bruckner employed Wagner tubas in his Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Symphonies. In these symphonies, the four Wagner tubas are played by players who alternate between horn and Wagner tuba, which is the same procedure Wagner used in the &quot;Ring&quot;. This change is simplified by the fact that the horn and Wagner tuba use the same mouthpiece and same fingering. 

As time passed, the availability and convenience of including Wagner tubas in concert programs became a reoccurring problem. In the 20th century, prominent composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky began to write sparingly for the instrument, while other composers attempted to continue writing for it in the 1960s. These composers would continue to face the same difficulties as their predecessors, which would ultimately lead to composers avoiding writing for the instrument altogether. 

Rued Langgaard, a great admirer of Bruckner, wrote for eight horns in his First Symphony (1908-11); four of these parts were written for tenor and bass Wagner tubas. When this work was eventually premiered, the orchestra decided against using Wagner tubas, instead playing the parts on horn. This experience led to a frustrated Langgaard to exclude Wagner tubas from future works.

== Repertoire ==
Wagner tubas are typically played by players who are also playing a horn. In an orchestral score, the staves for the Wagner tubas then logically go below those of the horns and above the standard tubas. If they are played by players who are not also playing a horn, they are placed below the trombones, above the regular tuba, which is then called a &quot;contrabass tuba.&quot;

<text>Lover is an Australian fashion label launched in 2001 by designers Susien Chong and Nic Briand. The label began as a weekend stall at Bondi Markets with a ten-piece collection of random separates. Since then, Lover has risen to prominence in Australia and internationally.

In November, 2017, it went into voluntary administration while administrators Ferrier Hodgson assess the financial position of the company ahead of the pursuit of a prospective sale.

==Background==
Lover&#x27;s collections all draw upon inspirations from the worlds of art, music, film and pop culture. Designer Nic Briand says each collection &quot;has a narrative and central character&quot;. Influences on the duo include Jean-Luc Godard, early Woody Allen films, Black Flag, Marianne Faithfull. Nic Briand&#x27;s influences tend to be &quot;heavier&quot; such as the Wu-Tang Clan, comic books and Jimi Hendrix, whereas Susien Chong&#x27;s are &quot;softer&quot; elements such as &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, ballet and Roberta Flack.

== Collections ==
=== Melodies (SS 2004) ===
Features a palette of cream, pale blue and black with polka-dot motifs and the Lover trademark oversized buttons. 
&quot;Influences:&quot;
*Meg White
*Françoise Hardy

=== Miss Francoise (AW 2004) ===
Black, white, red and midnight blues are used, with oversized buttons and satin. The collection has a masculine edge with pieces such as crisp white shirts, cuffed wide-legged pants and suspenders.

=== Broken Hearts (SS 2005) ===
The Broken Hearts collection features tailored, classic, simple staples in a basic palette of black and white with splashes of red and pink. Lace began to creep into their designs with an off the shoulder number that was featured in Nylon magazine (US). Chong has commented that she was inspired by &quot;lovelorn girls working their way through the crowds at gigs around Sydney&quot;.

=== Performance (AW 2005) ===
Performance tells &quot;the story of a shy schoolgirl violin player who is awakened by the sounds of her brother&#x27;s Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath records&quot; according to Nic Briand. &quot;Influences:&quot;
*Freaks and Geeks
*Ballet
*1970s Rock

=== Black Magick (SS 2006) ===
Pinstriped denim cuffed shorts and the &quot;it&quot; dress of the season, the white lace Black Magick dress. Velvets, denim and folk-influenced floral trimmings made this collection hippie.
&quot;Influences:&quot;
*Folk music
*Charles Manson
*Tarot Cards
*1960s

=== Lover Loves Levi&#x27;s (March 2006) ===
The jeans featured an oversized button to fasten the jeans, a black Levi&#x27;s patch on the back, contrast stitching and a Lover monogrammed lining along the inner waistband. The jeans were made in a limited edition of 1,000 pairs. The jeans were accompanied by a tote bag featuring the Lover monogram and a key ring with a large button motif. Lover was drawn to the collaboration with the denim giant due to the fact that &quot;Levis rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll youth culture heritage was a perfect fit with the mood of&quot; their A/W About A Girl collection.

=== About a Girl (AW 2006) ===
About A Girl featured bleached-out white, grey/purple plaids and black. Patterned lace tights and skivvies were the base for many of the collection&#x27;s looks. Vests, pinafores, floaty blouses, playsuits, oversized buttons, cuffed shorts and a stand-out white lacy dress were the threads that linked Lover with their past collections. &quot;Influences:&quot;
*Kurt Cobain

=== Black Rose Army (SS 2007) ===
The Black Rose Army collection depicts a transformation from innocent and &quot;rich heiress to sex-bomb renegade&quot;; this is the Patty Hearst story. Set to a discordant and raw soundtrack by the Kills the runway show depicts four periods in the Patty Hearst kidnapping saga. The first is innocence; represented via the use of white dresses, blouses and frocks. The next phase is Hearst at college; slogan tees, cuffed shorts, bandanas, denim and louder colour accents such as red, yellow and blue highlight this change, while the slow seeping of black into the palette suggests the darkness which will come. The third period is during her period as a fighter with the SLA; uniform-like khakis drench this radical phases pallet. The last phase is purely black, featuring black corsages to symbolise the death of Patty&#x27;s innocence. &quot;Influences:&quot;
*Patty Hearst
*Symbionese Liberation Army, (SLA)
*Berkeley in the 1960s
*Nic Briand commented that Black Rose Army was influenced by the last half of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot; about Bob Dylan, The Kills, &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, the first two Public Enemy albums, Glen E. Friedman&#x27;s photos of the LA punk scene, the box set of &quot;Peanuts&quot; with Charlie Brown, Joseph Szabo&#x27;s &quot;Teenage&quot;, early blues players Son Lightnin Hopkins and Robert Johnson and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

=== Altamont (AW 2007) ===
&quot;Influences:&quot;
*Altamont music festival
*The Rolling Stones
*1970s

=== One Plus One (SS 2008) ===
This was a swimwear line featuring 12 styles in lace knit, French stripe or denim. Reflecting the interest in 1970s skate culture the line was intended to be &quot;At home on the bleachers of a lazy suburban swimming pool mixed with denim jeans or sitting on the beach&quot;. To accompany the collection Lover used All-white Vans hi-tops and Authentic Vans in white. &quot;Influences:&quot;
*Dogtown and Z-Boys
*California in the 1970s
* The Z-Boys skating crew
* 1970s skating culture
*Robert Altman&#x27;s 3 Women
*Harvest by Neil Young
*Prayer of Death by Entrance
* Electric Ladyland, Jimi Hendrix
*Imagine Our Love, Lavender Diamond
*Brightblack Morning Light

=== Electric Ladyland (AW 2008) ===

=== Love Bomb (FW 2008/SS 2008.09) ===
The collection includes bell sleeves, velveteen jackets, leather short pants, neck detailing and a tailored jumpsuit.

=== Sacred Hearts College (FW 2008/SS 2008.09) ===
=== White Moon Rising (FW 2009/SS 2009.10) ===
=== The Harvest (SS 2010/AW 2010) ===
=== Untitled (FW 2010/SS 2010.11) ===

<doc id="231616" wikidata="Q13584039" url="?curid=231616" title="United States Federal Witness Protection Program">
<text>The United States Federal Witness Protection Program (WPP), also known as the Witness Security Program or WITSEC, is a witness protection program codified through 18 U.S. Code § 3521 and administered by the United States Department of Justice.

The program is operated by the United States Marshals Service and is designed to protect threatened witnesses and their family members before, during, and after a trial when those witnesses have an association with the federal government.

The program was originally authorized by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and later amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The amended issues included bail, sentencing reform, pleas for insanity, and penalties for drug offenses. 

==History==
The WITSEC program was formally established under Title V of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, which states that the United States Attorney General may provide for the relocation and protection of a witness or potential witness of the federal government or a state government in an official proceeding concerning organized crime or other serious offenses. See 18 U.S.C. 3521, &quot;et seq.&quot; The Federal government also gives grants to the states to enable them to provide similar services.

The precursor to WITSEC was the Federal Witness Protection Program, created in the mid-1960s by Gerald Shur, the attorney in charge of the Intelligence and Special Services Unit of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the United States Department of Justice. 

Most witnesses are protected by the United States Marshals Service under the Department of Justice, while the protection of incarcerated witnesses is the duty of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

From the WITSEC program, the Emergency Witness Assistance Program was created in 1997 to fill &quot;the need for immediate, non-protective, short-duration witness assistance not available through the Witness Security Program and the Short-Term Protection Program&quot;.

==Operations==
A handful of states—California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Virginia—and Washington, D.C., have their own witness protection programs for crimes not covered by the federal program. These state-run programs provide less extensive protections, in part because state governments lack the ability to issue federal documents such as Social Security cards to verify the new identity of protected witnesses. Another benefit of the federal program is that the Marshals Service provides payments to participants of about $60,000 on average, while also assisting them with finding housing and stable jobs under their new identities. 

There are two main types of witnesses who can be eligible for the program, &quot;fact witnesses&quot; and &quot;expert witnesses.&quot; Fact witnesses provide factual information and/or personal knowledge to a case. Oftentimes, but not always, these witnesses were present at the scene of a crime. Expert witnesses provide technical or scientific testimony. Both types of witnesses will be compensated based on negotiations with a federal government attorney.

As of 2020, approximately 19,000 witnesses and family members had been protected by the U.S. Marshals Service since the program began in 1971. The program has a 100% success rate; no witness that has followed the rules and guidelines set out by the U.S. Marshals Service has ever died in WITSEC.

According to Gerald Shur, who created the federal program, about 95% of witnesses in the program are &quot;criminals&quot;. They may be intentional criminals, or people who are doing business with criminals, such as one engineer who bought off a mayor because that&#x27;s how you do business in the city.&#x27; In his mind, he wasn&#x27;t doing anything criminal,&quot; Shur said. A witness who agrees to testify for the prosecution is generally eligible to join the program, which is entirely voluntary. Witnesses are permitted to leave the program and return to their original identities at any time, although this is discouraged by administrators.

In both criminal and civil matters involving protected witnesses, the U.S. Marshals cooperate fully with local law enforcement and court authorities to bring witnesses to justice or to have them fulfill their legal responsibilities.

The program is highly secretive in order to ensure the safety of its participants. The leaking or sharing of information on these participants is taken seriously. A former federal law enforcement officer, John Thomas Ambrose, was convicted in 2009 of leaking information about a federal witness in the Witness Protection Program, Chicago Outfit hitman Nicholas Calabrese.

==Recidivism==
Recidivism is described as a person&#x27;s relapse into the criminal justice system without a new sentence within a three-year period. Fewer than 17% of protected witnesses who have committed crimes are caught committing other crimes. While this is far lower than the national average, notable instances of protected witnesses returning to a life of crime exist, such as Sammy Gravano.

== Emergency Witness Assistance Program ==
The process of entering the Witness Protection Program can be prolonged for numerous reasons. The Emergency Witness Assistance Program, created in 1997, provides services more quickly, but participation is limited to a 30-day period. Its services include housing, transportation, subsistence payments, and child/elder care.

<text>The TNC connector (initialism of &quot;Threaded Neill–Concelman&quot;) is a threaded version of the BNC connector. 

==Description==
The interface specifications for the TNC and many other connectors are referenced in MIL-STD-348. The connector has a 50 Ω impedance and operates best in the 0–11 GHz frequency spectrum. It has better performance than the BNC connector at microwave frequencies. Invented in the late 1950s and named after Paul Neill of Bell Labs and Carl Concelman of Amphenol, the TNC connector has been employed in a wide range of radio and wired applications. 
The TNC connector features a 7/16&quot;-28 thread, not to be confused with a 7/16 DIN connector, which is the diameter of the mating surfaces as specified in millimeters.

== Variations ==

=== Reverse-polarity TNC ===

Reverse-polarity TNC (RP-TNC, sometimes RTNC) is a variation of the TNC specification which reverses the polarity of the interface. A reverse polarity connector will have the opposite pin of standard connector. Gender is determined by the threading of the connector. On a male connector, the threading will be on the inside. On a female connector the threading is on the outside.

Because they were not readily available, RP-TNC connectors have been widely used by Wi-Fi equipment manufacturers to comply with specific local regulations, such as those from the FCC, which are designed to prevent consumers from connecting antennas which exhibit gain and therefore breach compliance. The FCC considered that the RP-TNC was acceptable in preventing consumers changing the antenna; but by 2000 it regarded them as readily available, though delaying its ruling indefinitely. As of 2013, leading manufacturers are still using RP-TNC connectors on their Wi-Fi equipment.
=== TNCA ===
The TNCA connector is a variant of the TNC connector specified in MIL-STD-348 designed to provide an air gap in the dielectric region between the male and female connectors. The female TNCA connector is nearly identically to the standard TNC female connector, while the male TNCA connector provides the air cavity differentiating it from a standard male TNC connector. As such, TNCA connectors are mechanically compatible with standard TNC connectors.

===75 ohm TNC===
Most TNC connectors are 50-ohm type even when used with coaxial cable of other impedances, but a 75-ohm series is also available, providing a good SWR to about 1 GHz. These can be recognized by a reduced amount of dielectric in the mating ends. They are intermatable with standard types.

<text>Mesklin is a fictional planet created by Hal Clement and used in a number of his hard science fiction stories, starting with &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; (1954). Alongside the novel&#x27;s original 1953 serialization in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, Clement published an essay titled &quot;Whirligig World&quot; detailing the process of designing the planet to have the properties he wanted. The idea came from an object that was at the time believed to exist in the 61 Cygni system, and which might represent an extrasolar planet. 

The planet Mesklin is distinctive for the interaction of its strong gravity with the centrifugal force due to its fast rotation, giving it a gradient in the perceived force of gravity from 3 &quot;g&quot; on the equator to 665 &quot;g&quot; on the planet&#x27;s poles. It is inhabited by native lifeforms, including an intelligent centipede-like species, the Mesklinites.

Mesklin is considered a prototypical example of hard science fiction worldbuilding, an exotic milieu that nevertheless accords with known facts and laws of physics. While the planet itself is vastly dissimilar to Earth, its inhabitants are commonly regarded to be noticeably humanlike in behaviour if not in appearance. Mesklin is sometimes viewed as the main character of &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot;.

==Fictional description==

Mesklin is a planet in the 61 Cygni binary star system. Its mass is sixteen times that of Jupiter, or 4,800 times Earth mass. It has a very high rate of rotation, one day on the planet lasting only eighteen minutes. As a result, the planet is significantly flattened with a large equatorial bulge: the diameter at the equator is while the diameter between the poles is slightly below ; the diameter of Earth, for comparison, is roughly . The planet thus has a significantly higher mass than Jupiter within a much smaller volume, and its core is made up of collapsed matter. The surface gravity is very high at 665 times Earth gravity at the poles, but the rapid rotation produces a significant centrifugal force that cancels most of this at the equator, resulting in a net gravity at three times Earth gravity there. 

Mesklin orbits its star in an elongated ellipse, completing a full revolution in 1,800 Earth-days. The high orbital eccentricity combines with a pronounced axial tilt to result in an uneven seasonal cycle with very long springs and summers (at 28 months each) and much briefer autumns and winters (2 months each) for the southern hemisphere and vice versa for the northern; the two hemispheres thus have significantly different climates. The planet is cold, with average temperatures ranging from −50 °C at the closest approach to its star to −180 °C at the furthest point in its orbit. Mesklin is itself orbited by two small moons and a large ring system. 

The surface is covered mostly by methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3), both mainly in the liquid state; the oceans are primarily made up of methane, while the ammonia is also present as snow. The atmosphere is principally composed of hydrogen, and its density decreases with increasing altitude to such a degree that atmospheric refraction through the successive layers produces the optical illusion that an observer on the surface perceives the ground as curving upwards, as if living on the concave inside of a bowl rather than the convex surface of a spheroid.

The planet is inhabited by various lifeforms. The intelligent native inhabitants, the Mesklinites, resemble centipedes or caterpillars. They are long and wide, with eighteen pairs of legs ending in suckers as well as a forward pair of pincers for manipulation and a rear pair for attaching to the ground. They have four eyes and mandibles. They have a tough exoskeleton that allows them to withstand the planet&#x27;s strong gravity. They have no lungs but breathe hydrogen by absorbing it directly from the atmosphere in a manner similar to that used by the respiratory system of insects, whereas oxygen is toxic to them. They are able to survive while submerged for extended periods of time by breathing dissolved gases. Their lifespans are much longer than those of humans. They have a strong fear of heights and of being underneath objects, owing to the danger posed by such things in a high-gravity environment. For similar reasons, they have no concept of flying or throwing things. Their society is pre-industrial with rudimentary technology including seafaring vessels.

==Appearances==
The planet first appeared in Hal Clement&#x27;s novel &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; (1954), which was first serialized in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (April–July 1953); in the June 1953 issue, alongside the third of the four serial instalments, was included a 13-page article by Clement titled &quot;Whirligig World&quot; describing the planet and the process of creating it in detail. Clement later wrote an additional three fictional works using the planet or its denizens: the sequel novel &quot;Star Light&quot; (1971; originally serialized in &quot;Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;, June–September 1970) and the short stories &quot;Lecture Demonstration&quot; (1974) and &quot;Under&quot; (2000). The book &quot;Heavy Planet&quot; (2002) is a collection of these five Mesklin-related works. In &quot;Whirligig World&quot;, Clement encouraged other authors to use Mesklin as a setting for their stories provided that they stay within &quot;reasonable scientific standards&quot;, while acknowledging that to be &quot;certainly an elastic requirement in the field of science fiction&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==

Clement drew inspiration from astronomical work published in 1943 by Kaj Aage Gunnar Strand, whose analysis of the motion of the two known stars in the 61 Cygni system indicated the presence of a third, unseen object of relatively small size and mass. This was the first evidence—albeit indirect—of what might be an extrasolar planet; the discovery has since come to be regarded as likely erroneous. Clement used what was thought to be known about the object, dubbed 61 Cygni C by astronomers, and tried to create an interesting setting for a story within those bounds.

The observed mass of the object, at approximately 16 Jupiter-masses, meant that it was expected to be somewhat smaller than Uranus as a result of gravitational compression. At the time, it was unclear whether the object would behave more like a very low-mass and faint star (a brown dwarf) or a high-mass planet (Super-Jupiter); Clement elected to depict Mesklin as the latter in order to be able to use it as a setting for his story. Given this size and mass, the surface gravity would be about 300 times Earth gravity (300 &quot;g&quot;). Clement decided to reduce the effective gravity by providing the planet with a rapid rate of rotation to make it possible for humans to land on it in the story. He settled on an effective equatorial gravity of 3 &quot;g&quot; and worked backwards from there to calculate the spin that would result in the centrifugal force necessary to offset the correct amount of the planet&#x27;s gravitational pull. A high rate of rotation was deemed plausible given what was known about planet formation and the fact that the more massive planets in the Solar System spin more rapidly than the less massive ones such as Earth. The rapid spin also meant that Mesklin would have to be significantly flattened due to its matter being redistributed over time as a result of that same centrifugal force.

The combined effect of the difference between the polar radius and the equatorial one and the centrifugal force decreasing from its maximum at the equator to zero at the poles would result in a great difference between the gravitational pulls experienced at the two locations, which was one of Clement&#x27;s goals: he wanted to challenge the assumption—present in planetary science and science fiction alike—that while different planets might have stronger or weaker gravity, the gravitational field of a single planet would not display a large degree of variation across its surface. Clement calculated the gravity at the poles to be 665 &quot;g&quot;, but noted a low degree of confidence in this figure as the standard methods used for calculating the gravity of a spherical object would not be applicable to such a distorted shape, and stated that formulae different from the ones he used suggested that his figure might be too high by a factor of two; Clement redid his calculations years later with the aid of a computer rather than the slide rule he had originally used, coming up with a figure around 275 &quot;g&quot; for the polar gravity.

Based on the observed orbit of 61 Cygni C and the known properties of the stars in the system, Clement calculated that the planet would be very cold at an average temperature of −170 °C throughout the majority of its year, with a low of −180 °C and a high of −50 °C. Clement wanted his imagined planet to have native lifeforms, and reasoned that this would necessitate a substance that is liquid under these temperature conditions to play the role in the living tissue that water plays in life as we know it. He enlisted the help of biochemistry teacher and fellow science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, and together they worked through various alternatives such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) before settling on methane and developed a basic outline for the kind of ecosystem and lifeforms that could plausibly exist in such a chemical environment.

== Analysis ==
=== Hard science fiction ===

Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl, in a 1993 study of the history of hard science fiction, noted &quot;Whirligig World&quot; as both &quot;the first article about a piece of writing firmly identified&quot; as belonging to the subgenre and the first outline of the process of hard science fiction worldbuilding by collecting as much scientific data as possible and extrapolating from it, noting that while Clement rejected the notion of the article being a how-to guide, such texts were later written both by Clement and others such as Poul Anderson. In &quot;Science Fiction Literature through History: An Encyclopedia&quot; (2021), Westfahl further commented that &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; and &quot;Whirligig World&quot; together &quot;effectively launched&quot; the hard science fiction subgenre a few years before the term was coined in 1957. Basil Davenport, writing in 1955, commented that the only aspect not in line with current scientific knowledge was that humans had sent a spaceship to the planet; , writing in 1973, similarly called this level of human spaceflight &quot;one of the few imaginary science details&quot;. Clement himself, in &quot;Whirligig World&quot;, described his approach to writing (hard) science fiction as a game between the author and the reader, wherein the latter attempts to spot scientific errors and the former attempts to avoid making them; Westfahl commented that this was probably the first description of this &quot;game&quot;, and that it has since come to be intimately associated with hard science fiction. In a 1980 interview with , Clement recalled science fiction fans at MIT using university computers to calculate the shape of Mesklin, determining that it would actually have a sharp edge at the equator; Clement described having mixed feelings about this, being dismayed at having been caught making an error but heartened that his writing had inspired readers to go to such lengths.

=== Setting ===

Clement&#x27;s stories about Mesklin were the first set on a planet outside the Solar System believed (then) to actually exist. , writing in &quot;The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; (2005), described Mesklin as the prototypical example of an alien world vastly dissimilar to Earth. John J. Pierce, writing in 1987, commented that it far surpassed the exotic settings imagined in works like Stanley G. Weinbaum&#x27;s &quot;Parasite Planet&quot; (1935) and E. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lensman&quot; series in terms of its alienness. In &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot;, the peculiar properties of the planet Mesklin—its high gravity, short day, unusual chemical environment, and so on—are revealed indirectly rather than being explained outright; Neil Barron and viewed this as one of the novel&#x27;s strengths, while Westfahl instead considered it a shortcoming. Westfahl noted that while Clement&#x27;s &quot;Whirligig World&quot; outlines the creation of the fictional location in detail, it does not discuss the decision to set a story on the world or the process of creating that story. Clement stated that the story came after the setting and the lifeforms that could plausibly inhabit it had already been invented; Westfahl considered this to be a half-truth, reasoning that the purpose behind the lower and thus human-tolerable gravity at the equator and the presence of a chemical environment conducive to life was evidently to facilitate an encounter between humans and aliens and that this basic story idea must thus have been present from the outset even if the details were worked out later.

=== Mesklinites ===
The Mesklinites are generally regarded as similar to humans in the way they act, think, and speak—even if their appearance is inhuman—and this is often regarded as a flaw in Clement&#x27;s creation. , writing in 1999, described the Mesklinites&#x27; value system as resembling that of Victorian-era England, while Barron, writing in 1979, found the main Mesklinite character Barlennan to most of all resemble a Yankee trader. Morgan further commented upon the Mesklinites&#x27; human-like thought processes and their desire to gain scientific knowledge while at the same time seeking to avoid giving up their independence. In Morgan&#x27;s view, these things make the Mesklinites more reminiscent of an &quot;emerging third world country&quot; than a wholly alien species; Barron similarly identified a native–colonist analogy. Barron also commented that the depiction of Mesklinite psychology suggests that understanding of the world is shaped by sensory input related to one&#x27;s physical environment and compared the Mesklinites&#x27; perception of their world as a bowl to the human perception of the Earth as flat. Hassler noted that while the Mesklin stories are narrated from a third-person omniscient perspective, the viewpoint characters are Mesklinites a majority of the time, meaning readers learn things about them from their reactions to things like the much longer duration of Earth days than the Mesklin days they are used to. Hassler further compared the depiction of the Mesklinites to the works of Jonathan Swift, both in terms of the size differential as in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726)—calling them &quot;Lilliputians in a Brobdingnagian world&quot;—and their use as a vehicle for social commentary.

=== The planet itself as a character ===
Westfahl, writing in 1996 in the context of the notion that the Mesklinites are too human-like to be interesting as aliens, investigated the argument that Mesklin itself may be considered the main character of &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot;, as well as the most interesting one. Westfahl compared the situation to Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot; (1961), where the imperilled characters that might intuitively be viewed as the main characters are less developed than the ones who come to their aid. In his view, the description of the planet in the first line of the novel—&quot;The wind came across the bay like something living&quot;—suggests that this was in fact Clement&#x27;s intention. More broadly, said Westfahl, one might consider writers of hard science fiction to be applying character writing skills to objects rather than traditional characters, as opposed to neglecting characterization altogether in their stories. Nevertheless, Westfahl did not find Mesklin to be characterized effectively in the novel, which he attributed to Clement&#x27;s decision to reveal information about the planet piecemeal in an indirect and roundabout way.

<text>Uttar Pradesh ( ; UP) is a state in northern India. With over 241 million inhabitants, it is the most populated state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world – more populous than all but four other countries outside of India (China, United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan) – and accounting for 16.5 percent of the population of India or around 3 percent of the total world population. The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to the south. It is the fourth-largest Indian state by area covering , accounting for 7.3 percent of the total area of India. Lucknow serves as the state capital, with Prayagraj being the judicial capital. It is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts.

Uttar Pradesh was established in 1950 after India had become a republic. It is a successor to the United Provinces, established in 1935 by renaming the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, in turn established in 1902 from the North-Western Provinces and the Oudh Province. Though long known for sugar production, the state&#x27;s economy is now dominated by the services industry. The service sector comprises travel and tourism, hotel industry, real estate, insurance and financial consultancies. The economy of Uttar Pradesh is the third-largest state economy in India, with in gross domestic product and a per capita GSDP of . The High Court of the state is located in Prayagraj. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and 31 seats and the upper house Rajya Sabha.

On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was created from Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s western Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna, meet at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, a Hindu pilgrimage site. Other notable rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1 percent of the state&#x27;s geographical area. The cultivable area is 82 percent of the total geographical area, and the net area sown is 68.5 percent of the cultivable area.

Inhabitants of the state are called Awadhi, Brajwasi, or Bundeli, depending upon their region of origin. Hinduism is practised by more than three-fourths of the population, followed by Islam. Hindi is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state, along with Urdu. Uttar Pradesh was home to most of the mainstream political entities that existed in ancient and medieval India including the Maurya Empire, Harsha Empire, Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire as well as many other empires. At the time of the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were three major princely states in Uttar Pradesh – Ramgadi, Rampur and Benares and served as a focal point for the 1857 rebellion against British rule. The state houses several holy Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres. Along with several historical, natural and religious tourist destinations, including Agra, Aligarh, Ayodhya, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Kushinagar, Lucknow, Mathura, Meerut, Prayagraj, Varanasi, and Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh is also home to three World Heritage sites.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Modern human hunter-gatherers have been in Uttar Pradesh since between around 85,000 and 72,000 years ago. There have also been prehistorical finds in the state from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old and Mesolithic/Microlithic hunter-gatherer settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BCE. Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BCE, and gradually developed between c. 4000 and 1500 BCE beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age.

=== Ancient and classical period ===
Out of the sixteen &quot;mahajanapadas&quot; (lit. &#x27;great realms&#x27;) or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India, seven fell entirely within the present-day boundaries of the state. The kingdom of Kosala, in the Mahajanapada era, was also located within the regional boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh. According to Hinduism, the divine King Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala. Krishna, another divine king of Hindu legend, who plays a key role in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation (Avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have been born in the city of Mathura. The aftermath of the Kurukshetra War is believed to have taken place in the area between the Upper Doab and Delhi, (in what was Kuru Mahajanapada), during the reign of the Pandava King Yudhishthira. The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in northwest India, around 1000 BCE.

Control over Gangetic plains region was of vital importance to the power and stability of all of India&#x27;s major empires, including the Maurya (320–200 BCE), Kushan (100–250 CE), Gupta (350–600), and Gurjara-Pratihara (650–1036) empires. Following the Huns&#x27; invasions that broke the Gupta empire, the Ganges-Yamuna Doab saw the rise of Kannauj. During the reign of Harshavardhana (590–647), the Kannauj empire reached its zenith. It spanned from Punjab in the north and Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east and Odisha in the south. It included parts of central India, north of the Narmada River and it encompassed the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain. Many communities in various parts of India claim descent from the migrants of Kannauj. Soon after Harshavardhana&#x27;s death, his empire disintegrated into many kingdoms, which were invaded and ruled by the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, which challenged Bengal&#x27;s Pala Empire for control of the region. Kannauj was several times invaded by the South Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty, from the 8th century to the 10th century. After the fall of the Pala empire, the Chero dynasty ruled from the 12th century to the 18th century.

==== Delhi Sultanate ====
Uttar Pradesh was partially or entirely ruled by the Delhi Sultanate for 320 years (1206–1526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526).

The first Sultan of Delhi, Qutb ud-Din Aibak, conquered some parts of Uttar Pradesh, including Meerut, Aligarh, and Etawah. His successor, Iltutmish, expanded the Sultanate&#x27;s rule over Uttar Pradesh by defeating the King of Kannauj. During the reign of Sultan Balban, the Mamluk dynasty faced numerous rebellions in the state, but he was able to suppress them and establish his authority. Alauddin Khilji, extended his conquests to various regions in the state, including Varanasi and Prayagraj. Apart from the rulers, the Delhi Sultanate era also saw the growth of Sufism in Uttar Pradesh. Sufi saints, such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, lived during this period and their teachings had a significant impact on the people of the region. Sultanat era in the state also witnessed the construction of mosques and tombs, including the Atala Masjid in Jaunpur, the Jama Masjid in Fatehpur Sikri, and the Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq&#x27;s Tomb in Tughlaqabad.

=== Medieval and early modern period ===
In the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering India, along with modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture). In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire. Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi. In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal King Humanyun. Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior. After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal. He was bestowed the title of &quot;Hemchandra Vikramaditya&quot; (title of Vikramāditya adopted from Vedic period) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Qila in Delhi on 7 October 1556. A month later, Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar&#x27;s rule. Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri.

In the 18th century, after the fall of Mughal authority, the power vacuum was filled by the Maratha Empire, in the mid-18th century, the Maratha army invaded the Uttar Pradesh region, which resulted in Rohillas losing control of Rohilkhand to the Maratha forces led by Raghunath Rao and Malha Rao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18 December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia. In 1803–04, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when the British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, much of the region came under British suzerainty.

==== British India era ====
Starting from Bengal in the second half of the 18th century, a series of battles for north Indian lands finally gave the British East India Company accession over the state&#x27;s territories. Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the &quot;North-Western Provinces&quot; (of Agra). Although UP later became the fifth-largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire. Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad.

Due to dissatisfaction with British rule, a serious rebellion erupted in various parts of North India, which became known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857; Bengal regiment&#x27;s sepoy stationed at Meerut cantonment, Mangal Pandey, is widely considered as its starting point. After the revolt failed, the British divided the most rebellious regions by reorganising their administrative boundaries, splitting the Delhi region from &#x27;NWFP of Agra&#x27; and merging it with Punjab Province, while the Ajmer–Marwar region was merged with Rajputana and Oudh was incorporated into the state. The new state was called the North Western Provinces of Agra and Oudh, which in 1902 was renamed as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. It was commonly referred to as the United Provinces or its acronym UP.

In 1920, the capital of the province was shifted from Allahabad to Lucknow. The high court continued to be at Allahabad, but a bench was established at Lucknow. Allahabad continues to be an important administrative base of today&#x27;s Uttar Pradesh and has several administrative headquarters. Uttar Pradesh continued to be central to Indian politics and was especially important in modern Indian history as a hotbed of the Indian independence movement. The state hosted modern educational institutions such as the Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and Darul Uloom Deoband. Nationally known figures such as Ram Prasad Bismil and Chandra Shekhar Azad were among the leaders of the movement in Uttar Pradesh, and Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Govind Ballabh Pant were important national leaders of the Indian National Congress. The All India Kisan Sabha was formed at the Lucknow session of the Congress on 11 April 1936, with the famous nationalist Sahajanand Saraswati elected as its first president, to address the longstanding grievances of the peasantry and mobilise them against the zamindari landlords attacks on their occupancy rights, thus sparking the Farmers movements in India. During the Quit India Movement of 1942, Ballia district overthrew the colonial authority and installed an independent administration under Chittu Pandey. Ballia became known as &quot;Baghi Ballia&quot; (Rebel Ballia) for this significant role in India&#x27;s independence movement.

==== Post-independence ====
After India&#x27;s independence, the United Provinces were renamed &quot;Uttar Pradesh&quot; (), preserving UP as the abbreviation of the state&#x27;s name, with the change coming into effect on 24 January 1950. The new state was formed after the merger of several princely states and territories, including the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and the Delhi territory. The state has provided nine of India&#x27;s prime ministers which is more than any other state and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. Despite its political influence since ancient times, its poor record in economic development and administration, poor governance, organised crime and corruption have kept it among India&#x27;s backward states. The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste-related and communal violence. In December 1992 the disputed Babri Mosque located in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu activists, leading to widespread violence across India. In 2000, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand.

== Geography ==
Uttar Pradesh, with a total area of , is India&#x27;s fourth-largest state in terms of land area and is roughly of same size as United Kingdom. It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region are in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western, are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.

Cultivation is intensive in the state. Uttar Pradesh falls under three agro-climatic zones viz. Middle Gangetic Plains region (Zone–IV), Upper Gangetic Plains region (Zone–V) and Central Plateau and Hills region (Zone–VIII). The valley areas have fertile and rich soil. There is intensive cultivation on terraced hill slopes, but irrigation facilities are deficient. The Siwalik Range which forms the southern foothills of the Himalayas, slopes down into a boulder bed called &#x27;bhabhar&#x27;. The transitional belt running along the entire length of the state is called the terai and bhabhar area. It has rich forests, cutting across it are innumerable streams which swell into raging torrents during the monsoon.

=== Climate ===
Uttar Pradesh has a humid subtropical climate and experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September. Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between in parts of the state coupled with dry hot winds called the &quot;Loo&quot;. The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from in the southwest corner of the state to in the eastern and south eastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. After summer it is the southwest monsoon which brings most of the rain here, while in winters rain due to the &quot;western disturbances&quot; and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.


The rain in Uttar Pradesh can vary from an annual average of in hilly areas to in Western Uttar Pradesh. Given the concentration of most of this rainfall in the four months of the monsoon, excess rain can lead to floods and shortage to droughts. As such, these two phenomena, floods and droughts, commonly recur in the state. The climate of the Vindhya Range and plateau is subtropical with a mean annual rainfall between , most of which comes during the monsoon. Typical summer months are from March to June, with maximum temperatures ranging from . There is a low relative humidity of around 20% and dust-laden winds blow throughout the season. In summer, hot winds called &quot;loo&quot; blow all across Uttar Pradesh.

=== Flora and fauna ===
Uttar Pradesh has an abundance of natural resources. In 2011, the recorded forest area in the state was which is about 6.9% of the state&#x27;s geographical area. In spite of rapid deforestation and poaching of wildlife, a diverse flora and fauna continue to exist in the state. Uttar Pradesh is a habitat for 4.2% of all species of Algae recorded in India, 6.4% of Fungi, 6.0% of Lichens, 2.9% of Bryophytes, 3.3% of Pteridophytes, 8.7% of Gymnosperms, 8.1% of Angiosperms. Several species of trees, large and small mammals, reptiles, and insects are found in the belt of temperate upper mountainous forests. Medicinal plants are found in the wild and are also grown in plantations. The Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands support cattle. Moist deciduous trees grow in the upper Gangetic plain, especially along its riverbanks. This plain supports a wide variety of plants and animals. The Ganges and its tributaries are the habitat of large and small reptiles, amphibians, fresh-water fish, and crabs. Scrubland trees such as the Babool (&quot;Vachellia nilotica&quot;) and animals such as the Chinkara (&quot;Gazella bennettii&quot;) are found in the arid Vindhyas. Tropical dry deciduous forests are found in all parts of the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state.

Uttar Pradesh is known for its extensive avifauna. The most common birds which are found in the state are doves, peafowl, junglefowl, black partridges, house sparrows, songbirds, blue jays, parakeets, quails, bulbuls, comb ducks, kingfishers, woodpeckers, snipes, and parrots. Bird sanctuaries in the state include Bakhira Sanctuary, National Chambal Sanctuary, Chandra Prabha Wildlife Sanctuary, Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaimoor Wildlife Sanctuary, and Okhla Sanctuary.

Other animals in the state include reptiles such as lizards, cobras, kraits, and gharials. Among the wide variety of fishes, the most common ones are mahaseer and trout. Some animal species have gone extinct in recent years, while others, like the lion from the Gangetic Plain, the rhinoceros from the Terai region, Ganges river dolphin primarily found in the Ganges have become endangered. Many species are vulnerable to poaching despite regulation by the government.

== Divisions, districts and cities ==


Uttar Pradesh is divided into 75 districts under these 18 divisions:

The following is a list of top districts from state of Uttar Pradesh by population, ranked in respect of all India.
Each district is governed by a District Magistrate, who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed Government of Uttar Pradesh and reports to Divisional Commissioner of the division in which his district falls. The Divisional Commissioner is an IAS officer of high seniority. Each district is divided into subdivisions, governed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and again into Blocks. Blocks consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. These blocks consists of urban units viz. census towns and rural units called gram panchayat.

Uttar Pradesh has more metropolitan cities than any other state in India. The absolute urban population of the state is 44.4 million, which constitutes 11.8% of the total urban population of India, the second-highest of any state. According to the 2011 census, there are 15 urban agglomerations with a population greater than 500,000. Uttar Pradesh has a complex system of municipalities. Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) are urban local bodies in large cities such as Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and cities having population more than 4 million. These governed by a mayor and councilors elected from wards. Nagar Palika Parishad or Municipal Council, serves medium-sized towns like Bela Pratapgarh, Jalaun, or Bisalpur and are governed by a chairperson and councilors. Nagar Panchayat which operate in smaller towns and semi-urban areas like Badlapur, Jaunpur, Bikapur, or Chilkana Sultanpur, are governed by a chairman and councilors. There are 14 Municipal Corporations, while Noida and Greater Noida in Gautam Budha Nagar district are specially administered by statutory authorities under the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Development Act, 1976.

In 2011, state&#x27;s cabinet ministers headed by the then Chief Minister Mayawati announced the separation of Uttar Pradesh into four different states of Purvanchal, Bundelkhand, Avadh Pradesh and Paschim Pradesh with twenty-eight, seven, twenty-three and seventeen districts, respectively, later the proposal was turned down when the Akhilesh Yadav–lead Samajwadi Party came to power in the 2012 election.

== Demographics ==


Uttar Pradesh has a very large population and a high population growth rate. From 1991 to 2001 its population increased by over 26 per cent. It is the most populous state in India, with 199,581,477 people on 1 March 2011. The state contributes to 16.2 per cent of India&#x27;s population. As of 2021, the estimated population of the state is around 240 million people. The population density is 828 people per square kilometre, making it one of the most densely populated states in the country. It has the largest scheduled caste population whereas scheduled tribes are less than 1 per cent of the total population.

The sex ratio in 2011, at 912 women to 1000 men, was lower than the national figure of 943. The low sex ratio in Uttar Pradesh, is a result of various factors, such as sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, and discrimination against girls and women. The state&#x27;s 2001–2011 decennial growth rate (including Uttrakhand) was 20.1 per cent, higher than the national rate of 17.64 per cent. It has a large number of people living below the poverty line. As per a World Bank document released in 2016, the pace of poverty reduction in the state has been slower than the rest of the country. Estimates released by the Reserve Bank of India for the year 2011–12 revealed that the state had 59 million (59819,000) people below the poverty line, the most for any state in India. The central and eastern districts in particular have very high levels of poverty. The state is also experiencing widening consumption inequality. As per the report of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released in 2020, the state per capita income is below per annum.

== Governance and administration ==
The state is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy. Uttar Pradesh is one of the seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms. The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years. The state sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament.

The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister by the governor, and the council of ministers is appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. The governor remains a ceremonial head of the state, while the chief minister and his council are responsible for day-to-day government functions. The Council of Ministers consists of Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State (MoS). The Secretariat headed by the Chief Secretary assists the council of ministers. The Chief Secretary is also the administrative head of the government. Each government department is headed by a minister, who is assisted by an Additional Chief Secretary or a Principal Secretary, who is usually an officer of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary serves as the administrative head of the department they are assigned to. Each department also has officers of the rank of Secretary, Special Secretary, Joint Secretary etc. assisting the Minister and the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary.

For administration, the state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts. Divisional Commissioner, an IAS officer is the head of administration on the divisional level. The administration in each district is headed by a District Magistrate, who is also an IAS officer, and is assisted by several officers belonging to state services.

The judiciary in the state consists of the Allahabad High Court in Prayagraj, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court, district courts and session courts in each district or Sessions Division, and lower courts at the tehsil level. The president of India appoints the chief justice of the High Court of the Uttar Pradesh judiciary on the advice of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India as well as the governor of Uttar Pradesh. Subordinate Judicial Service, categorised into two divisions viz. Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services and Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service are another vital part of the judiciary of Uttar Pradesh. While the Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services comprise the Civil Judges (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistrates and civil judges (Senior Division)/Chief Judicial Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service comprises civil and sessions judges. The Subordinate judicial service (viz. The district court of Etawah and the district court of Kanpur Dehat) of the judiciary at Uttar Pradesh is controlled by the District Judge.

Politics in Uttar Pradesh has been dominated by four political parties – the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Indian National Congress. The political landscape of the state is often characterized by intense competition and polarization, leading to caste-based tensions and communal conflicts. Critics often suggest that despite Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s significant political legacy of producing eight Prime Ministers, the state continues to struggle with issues that hinder its overall advancement.

=== Crime and accidents ===
According to the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states of encounter killings and custodial deaths. In 2014, the state recorded 365 judicial deaths out of a total 1,530 deaths recorded in the country. NHRC further said, of the over 30,000 murders registered in the country in 2016, Uttar Pradesh had 4,889 cases. A data from Minister of Home Affairs (MHA) avers, Bareilly recorded the highest number of custodial death at 25, followed by Agra (21), Allahabad (19) and Varanasi (9).

<text>A super-Jupiter is a gas giant exoplanet that is more massive than the planet Jupiter. For example, companions at the planet–brown dwarf borderline have been called super-Jupiters, such as around the star Kappa Andromedae.

By 2011 there were 180 known super-Jupiters, some hot, some cold. Even though they are more massive than Jupiter, they remain about the same size as Jupiter up to 80 Jupiter masses. This means that their surface gravity and density go up proportionally to their mass. The increased mass compresses the planet due to gravity, thus keeping it from being larger. In comparison, planets somewhat lighter than Jupiter can be larger, so-called &quot;puffy planets&quot; (gas giants with a large diameter but low density). An example of this may be the exoplanet HAT-P-1b with about half the mass of Jupiter but about 1.38 times larger diameter.

CoRoT-3b, with a mass around 22 Jupiter masses, is predicted to have an average density of 26.4 g/cm3, greater than osmium (22.6 g/cm3), the densest natural element under standard conditions. Extreme compression of matter inside it causes the high density, because it is likely composed mainly of hydrogen. The surface gravity is also high, over 50 times that of Earth.

In 2012, the super-Jupiter Kappa Andromedae b was imaged around the star Kappa Andromedae, orbiting it about 1.8 times the distance at which Neptune orbits the Sun.

<doc id="231630" wikidata="Q58392" url="?curid=231630" title="Plasmon">
<text>In physics, a plasmon is a quantum of plasma oscillation. Just as light (an optical oscillation) consists of photons, the plasma oscillation consists of plasmons. The plasmon can be considered as a quasiparticle since it arises from the quantization of plasma oscillations, just like phonons are quantizations of mechanical vibrations. Thus, plasmons are collective (a discrete number) oscillations of the free electron gas density. For example, at optical frequencies, plasmons can couple with a photon to create another quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.

The field of study and manipulation of plasmons is called plasmonics.

== Derivation ==
The plasmon was initially proposed in 1952 by David Pines and David Bohm and was shown to arise from a Hamiltonian for the long-range electron-electron correlations.

Since plasmons are the quantization of classical plasma oscillations, most of their properties can be derived directly from Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

== Explanation ==

Plasmons can be described in the classical picture as an oscillation of electron density with respect to the fixed positive ions in a metal. To visualize a plasma oscillation, imagine a cube of metal placed in an external electric field pointing to the right. Electrons will move to the left side (uncovering positive ions on the right side) until they cancel the field inside the metal. If the electric field is removed, the electrons move to the right, repelled by each other and attracted to the positive ions left bare on the right side. They oscillate back and forth at the plasma frequency until the energy is lost in some kind of resistance or damping. Plasmons are a quantization of this kind of oscillation.

===Role===
Plasmons play a huge role in the optical properties of metals and semiconductors. Frequencies of light below the plasma frequency are reflected by a material because the electrons in the material screen the electric field of the light. Light of frequencies above the plasma frequency is transmitted by a material because the electrons in the material cannot respond fast enough to screen it. In most metals, the plasma frequency is in the ultraviolet, making them shiny (reflective) in the visible range. Some metals, such as copper and gold, have electronic interband transitions in the visible range, whereby specific light energies (colors) are absorbed, yielding their distinct color. In semiconductors, the valence electron plasmon frequency is usually in the deep ultraviolet, while their electronic interband transitions are in the visible range, whereby specific light energies (colors) are absorbed, yielding their distinct color which is why they are reflective. It has been shown that the plasmon frequency may occur in the mid-infrared and near-infrared region when semiconductors are in the form of nanoparticles with heavy doping.

The plasmon energy can often be estimated in the free electron model as

:formula_1formula_2formula_3formula_4formula_5

where formula_6 is the conduction electron density, formula_7 is the elementary charge, formula_8 is the electron mass, formula_9 the permittivity of free space, formula_4 the reduced Planck constant and formula_11 the plasmon frequency.

== Surface plasmons ==

Surface plasmons are those plasmons that are confined to surfaces and that interact strongly with light resulting in a polariton. They occur at the interface of a material exhibiting positive real part of their relative permittivity, i.e. dielectric constant, (e.g. vacuum, air, glass and other dielectrics) and a material whose real part of permittivity is negative at the given frequency of light, typically a metal or heavily doped semiconductors. In addition to opposite sign of the real part of the permittivity, the magnitude of the real part of the permittivity in the negative permittivity region should typically be larger than the magnitude of the permittivity in the positive permittivity region, otherwise the light is not bound to the surface (i.e. the surface plasmons do not exist) as shown in the famous book by Heinz Raether. At visible wavelengths of light, e.g. 632.8 nm wavelength provided by a He-Ne laser, interfaces supporting surface plasmons are often formed by metals like silver or gold (negative real part permittivity) in contact with dielectrics such as air or silicon dioxide. The particular choice of materials can have a drastic effect on the degree of light confinement and propagation distance due to losses. Surface plasmons can also exist on interfaces other than flat surfaces, such as particles, or rectangular strips, v-grooves, cylinders, and other structures. Many structures have been investigated due to the capability of surface plasmons to confine light below the diffraction limit of light. One simple structure that was investigated was a multilayer system of copper and nickel. Mladenovic &quot;et al.&quot; report the use of the multilayers as if its one plasmonic material. Oxidation of the copper layers is prevented with the addition of the nickel layers. It is an easy path the integration of plasmonics to use copper as the plasmonic material because it is the most common choice for metallic plating along with nickel. The multilayers serve as a diffractive grating for the incident light. Up to 40 percent transmission can be achieved at normal incidence with the multilayer system depending on the thickness ratio of copper to nickel. Therefore, the use of already popular metals in a multilayer structure prove to be solution for plasmonic integration.

Surface plasmons can play a role in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and in explaining anomalies in diffraction from metal gratings (Wood&#x27;s anomaly), among other things. Surface plasmon resonance is used by biochemists to study the mechanisms and kinetics of ligands binding to receptors (i.e. a substrate binding to an enzyme). Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance can be used not only to measure molecular interactions but also nanolayer properties or structural changes in the adsorbed molecules, polymer layers or graphene, for instance.

Surface plasmons may also be observed in the X-ray emission spectra of metals. A dispersion relation for surface plasmons in the X-ray emission spectra of metals has been derived (Harsh and Agarwal).
More recently surface plasmons have been used to control colors of materials. This is possible since controlling the particle&#x27;s shape and size determines the types of surface plasmons that can be coupled into and propagate across it. This, in turn, controls the interaction of light with the surface. These effects are illustrated by the historic stained glass which adorn medieval cathedrals. Some stained glass colors are produced by metal nanoparticles of a fixed size which interact with the optical field to give glass a vibrant red color. In modern science, these effects have been engineered for both visible light and microwave radiation. Much research goes on first in the microwave range because at this wavelength, material surfaces and samples can be produced mechanically because the patterns tend to be on the order of a few centimeters. The production of optical range surface plasmon effects involves making surfaces which have features &lt;400 nm. This is much more difficult and has only recently become possible to do in any reliable or available way.

Recently, graphene has also been shown to accommodate surface plasmons, observed via near field infrared optical microscopy techniques and infrared spectroscopy. Potential applications of graphene plasmonics mainly addressed the terahertz to midinfrared frequencies, such as optical modulators, photodetectors, biosensors.

== Possible applications ==
The position and intensity of plasmon absorption and emission peaks are affected by molecular adsorption, which can be used in molecular sensors. For example, a fully operational device detecting casein in milk has been prototyped, based on detecting a change in absorption of a gold layer. Localized surface plasmons of metal nanoparticles can be used for sensing different types of molecules, proteins, etc.

Plasmons are being considered as a means of transmitting information on computer chips, since plasmons can support much higher frequencies (into the 100 THz range, whereas conventional wires become very lossy in the tens of GHz). However, for plasmon-based electronics to be practical, a plasmon-based amplifier analogous to the transistor, called a plasmonstor, needs to be created.

Plasmons have also been proposed as a means of high-resolution lithography and microscopy due to their extremely small wavelengths; both of these applications have seen successful demonstrations in the lab environment.

Finally, surface plasmons have the unique capacity to confine light to very small dimensions, which could enable many new applications.

Surface plasmons are very sensitive to the properties of the materials on which they propagate. This has led to their use to measure the thickness of monolayers on colloid films, such as screening and quantifying protein binding events. Companies such as Biacore have commercialized instruments that operate on these principles. Optical surface plasmons are being investigated with a view to improve makeup by L&#x27;Oréal and others.

In 2009, a Korean research team found a way to greatly improve organic light-emitting diode efficiency with the use of plasmons.

A group of European researchers led by IMEC began work to improve solar cell efficiencies and costs through incorporation of metallic nanostructures (using plasmonic effects) that can enhance absorption of light into different types of solar cells: crystalline silicon (c-Si), high-performance III-V, organic, and dye-sensitized. However, for plasmonic photovoltaic devices to function optimally, ultra-thin transparent conducting oxides are necessary.
Full color holograms using &quot;plasmonics&quot; have been demonstrated.
==Plasmon-soliton==
Plasmon-soliton mathematically refers to the hybrid solution of nonlinear amplitude equation e.g. for a metal-nonlinear media considering both the plasmon mode and solitary solution. A soliplasmon resonance is on the other hand considered as a quasiparticle combining the surface plasmon mode with spatial soliton as a
result of a resonant interaction. To achieve one dimensional solitary propagation in a plasmonic waveguide while the surface plasmons should be localized at the interface, the lateral distribution of the field envelope should also be unchanged.

A graphene-based waveguide is a suitable platform for supporting hybrid plasmon-solitons due to the large effective area and huge nonlinearity. For example, the propagation of solitary waves in a graphene-dielectric heterostructure may appear as in the form of higher order solitons or discrete solitons resulting from the competition between diffraction and nonlinearity.

<doc id="231631" wikidata="Q347194" url="?curid=231631" title="Lewis Hine">
<text>Lewis Wickes Hine (September 26, 1874 – November 3, 1940) was an American sociologist and muckraker photographer. His photographs that were taken during times such as the Progressive Era and the Great Depression, which captured the result of young children working in harsh conditions, played a role in bringing about the passage of the first child labor laws in the United States.

==Early life==
Hine was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on September 26, 1874. After his father was killed in an accident, Hine began working and saved his money for a college education. He studied sociology at the University of Chicago, Columbia University and New York University. He became a teacher in New York City at the Ethical Culture School, where he encouraged his students to use photography as an educational medium.
Hine led his sociology classes to Ellis Island in New York Harbor, photographing the thousands of immigrants who arrived each day. Between 1904 and 1909, Hine took over 200 plates (photographs) and came to the realization that documentary photography could be employed as a tool for social change and reform.

==Documentary photography==
In 1907, Hine became the staff photographer of the Russell Sage Foundation; he photographed life in the steel-making districts and people of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the influential sociological study called The Pittsburgh Survey.

In 1908, Hine became the photographer for the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC), leaving his teaching position. Over the next decade, Hine documented child labor, with focus on the use of child labor in the Carolina Piedmont, to aid the NCLC&#x27;s lobbying efforts to end the practice. In 1913, he documented child laborers among cotton mill workers with a series of Francis Galton&#x27;s composite portraits.

Hine&#x27;s work for the NCLC was often dangerous. As a photographer, he was frequently threatened with violence or even death by factory police and foremen. At the time, the immorality of child labor was meant to be hidden from the public. Photography was not only prohibited but also posed a serious threat to the industry. To gain entry to the mills, mines and factories, Hine was forced to assume many guises. At times he was a fire inspector, postcard vendor, bible salesman, or even an industrial photographer making a record of factory machinery.
During and after World War I, he photographed American Red Cross relief work in Europe. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Hine made a series of &quot;work portraits,&quot; which emphasized the human contribution to modern industry. In 1930, Hine was commissioned to document the construction of the Empire State Building. He photographed the workers in precarious positions while they secured the steel framework of the structure, taking many of the same risks that the workers endured. To obtain the best vantage points, Hine was swung out in a specially-designed basket 1,000 ft above Fifth Avenue. At times, he remembered, he hung above the city with nothing below but &quot;a sheer drop of nearly a quarter-mile.&quot;
During the Great Depression, Hine, once again, worked for the Red Cross, photographing drought relief in the American South, and for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), documenting life in the mountains of eastern Tennessee. He also served as chief photographer for the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s National Research Project, which studied changes in industry and their effect on employment. Hine was also a faculty member of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School.

==Later life==
In 1936, Hine was selected as the photographer for the National Research Project of the Works Projects Administration, but his work there was not completed.

The last years of his life were filled with professional struggles by loss of government and corporate patronage. Hine hoped to join the Farm Security Administration photography project, but despite writing repeatedly to Roy Stryker, Stryker always refused. Few people were interested in his work, past or present, and Hine lost his house and applied for welfare. He died on November 3, 1940, at Dobbs Ferry Hospital in Dobbs Ferry, New York, after an operation. He was 66 years old.

==Legacy==
Hine&#x27;s photographs supported the NCLC&#x27;s lobbying to end child labor, and in 1912 the Children&#x27;s Bureau was created. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 eventually brought child labour in the US to an end.

After Hine&#x27;s death, his son Corydon donated his prints and negatives to the Photo League, which was dismantled in 1951. The Museum of Modern Art was offered his pictures and did not accept them, but the George Eastman Museum did.

In 1984, PBS produced a one-hour documentary, &quot;America and Lewis Hine&quot;, about Hine&#x27;s life and work. The film was directed by Nina Rosenblum, written by Dan Allentuck and narrated by Jason Robards, Maureen Stapleton, and John Crowley.

In 2006, author Elizabeth Winthrop Alsop&#x27;s historical fiction middle-grade novel &quot;Counting on Grace&quot; was published by Wendy Lamb Books. The latter chapters center on 12-year-old Grace and her life-changing encounter with Hine, during his 1910 visit to a Vermont cotton mill known to have many child laborers. On the cover is the iconic photo of Grace&#x27;s real-life counterpart, Addie Card (1897–1993), taken during Hine&#x27;s undercover visit to the Pownal Cotton Mill.

In 2016, &quot;Time&quot; published altered (colorized) versions of several of Hine&#x27;s original photographs of child labor in the US.

<doc id="231632" wikidata="Q1877187" url="?curid=231632" title="Lulav">
<text>Lulav (; ) is a closed frond of the date palm tree. It is one of the Four Species used during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. The other Species are the &quot;hadass&quot; (myrtle), &quot;aravah&quot; (willow), and &quot;etrog&quot; (citron). When bound together, the &quot;lulav&quot;, &quot;hadass&quot;, and &quot;aravah&quot; are commonly referred to as &quot;the lulav&quot;.

==Codification in the Torah==
The Torah mentions the commandments to obtain a &quot;lulav&quot; for the &quot;Sukkot&quot; holiday once in Leviticus:

&quot;Leviticus 23:40&quot;
:&quot;And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.&quot;

In the Oral Torah, the &quot;Mishnah&quot; comments that the biblical commandment to take the &quot;lulav&quot;, along with the other three species, is for all seven days of &quot;Sukkot&quot; only in and around the Temple Mount when the Holy Temple in Jerusalem is extant, as indicated by the verse as &quot;in the presence of Hashem, your God, for seven days.&quot; In the rest of the Land of Israel, as well as in the Diaspora, the four species are biblically mandated only on the first day of &quot;Sukkot&quot;. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai legislated a rabbinical enactment to take the four species for the entire seven days of the holiday in all locations as a commemoration of what was done in the Temple.

===Classical Jewish Biblical commentators===
As with all Biblical verses, Jewish law derives numerous details and specifications relating to the commandments by interpreting the manner in which words are utilized, spelled and juxtaposed in the verses of the Torah.

Rashi explains the pertinent verse in the Bible based on the Talmud&#x27;s erudition. which focuses on the spelling of the words in the verse that refer to the &quot;lulav&quot;: &quot;kapot t&#x27;marim&quot; (כפת תמרים, &quot;palms [of] dates&quot;). The first word refers to date stalks (the strands on which the dates sprout) and is written in plural form (&quot;kapót&quot; - כּפוֹת) instead of singular form (&quot;kaf&quot; - כף), in order to indicate that the commandment is not to take merely a single leaf of the entire palm. However the word is written in a deficient manner, without the letter &quot;vav&quot;, as the plural word would normally contain (כפת instead of כפות). Rashi further elucidates based on the Talmud&#x27;s erudition, that the missing letter &quot;vav&quot; is to indicate that only a single palm is to be taken. The Talmud also uses this spelling irregularity to suggest according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah in the name of Rabbi Tarfon, that the &quot;lulav&quot; must be bound if its leaves spread away from the spine of the palm. This teaching is derived from the similarity between the spelling of the Hebrew words for &quot;palm&quot; and &quot;binding&quot;, which would not be a viable teaching had the word for palm been written in its strictly singular form of &quot;kaf&quot;.

The &quot;Keli Yakar&quot; comments that the words verse in Psalms 96:12 &quot;az yeranenu kol atzei ya&#x27;ar&quot; (אז ירננו כל עצי יער, &quot;then all the trees of the forest will sing with joy&quot;), is not only a reference to the shaking of the four species but a hint to this Biblical specification: the Hebrew word &quot;az&quot; (אז, &quot;then&quot;) is composed of two letters, an &quot;aleph&quot; (א), with a numerical value of 1, and a &quot;zayin&quot; (ז), with a numerical value of 7, hinting that the four species are to be taken 1 day outside of the Temple area and seven days in the Temple.

==Regulations of the &quot;lulav&quot;==

A &quot;lulav&quot;, as with all &quot;mitzvah&quot; articles (those used to fulfill biblical and rabbinical requirements within Judaism), must meet certain specifications in order to be kosher and permissible to be used to fulfill the commandment of the four species.

Ideally, a &quot;lulav&quot; consists of a tightly closed frond of the date palm tree.
To qualify, the &quot;lulav&quot; must be straight, with whole leaves that lie closely together, and not be bent or broken at the top. The twin middle-most leaves, which naturally grow together and are known as the &quot;tiyomet&quot; (, &quot;twin&quot;), should ideally not be split at all; however, the &quot;lulav&quot; remains kosher as long as the twin middle leaves are not split more than a handbreadth, approximating 3-4 inches. This rule applies on the first day of &quot;Sukkot&quot; in the Land of Israel, and on the first two days elsewhere. On Chol HaMoed, the disqualifications arising from using a &quot;lulav&quot; with a split middle leaf do not apply.

The term &quot;lulav&quot; also refers to the &quot;lulav&quot; in combination with two of the other species—the &quot;aravah&quot; and the &quot;hadass&quot;—that are bound together to perform the mitzvah of waving the &quot;lulav.&quot; These three species are held in one hand while the &quot;etrog&quot; is held in the other. The user brings his or her hands together and waves the species in all four directions, plus up and down, to attest to God&#x27;s mastery over all of creation. This ritual also symbolically voices a prayer for adequate rainfall over all the Earth&#x27;s vegetation in the coming year. &quot;(See Four Species for the complete description and symbolism of the waving ceremony.)&quot;

Although Jews are commanded to take the four species together, the rabbinically ordained blessing mentions only the &quot;lulav&quot; because it is the largest and most evident of the four species.

The biblical reference to the four species in Sukkot can be found in Leviticus Chapter 23, verse 40. The etrog is referred to as &quot;Citrus fruit&quot; (Etz Hadar), and the Lulav is referred to as &quot;Palm branches&quot; (Kapot t&#x27;marim).

Each species is said to kabbalistically represent an aspect of the user&#x27;s body; the lulav represents the spine, the myrtle the eyes, the willow the lips, and the etrog represents the heart.

<doc id="231635" wikidata="Q5318870" url="?curid=231635" title="Dyna-Flytes">
<text>Dyna-Flites was a brand of die-cast toy model airplanes sold in the 1970s, &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s by Zee Toys of California. The line was part of a series of &quot;Dyna&quot; die-cast products that included toy cars, construction vehicles, bikes and tanks. The Dyna-Flites range included 79 aircraft with over 206 color and marking variations released until production ceased in 1996.

== Corporate basis, manufacturing arrangements, branding and product range ==

ZEE Toys of Hong Kong produced the line, and the US distribution was picked up by Intex in 1981. Intex would remain the US distributor until 1992, when ZEE would assume direct US distribution. The toys themselves were manufactured in Hong Kong. Although generally released as Dyna-Flites, their branding was changed to suit some international markets. Modern Toys of Japan distributed them as &quot;Hot Wings&quot;; &quot;Superwings&quot; in the United Kingdom and in Australia; &quot;Vento Caldo&quot; in Italy and &quot;Hot Wings&quot; elsewhere. These early &quot;Hot Wings&quot; issues must not be confused with the current &quot;Hot Wings&quot; line from another vendor although it does include some ZEE moulds. The Dyna-Flite line consisted of a variety of subjects, including many WWII airplanes (including a &quot;WWII Historical Series&quot; in 1996 with new colors), modern jets both from the US, Europe and the Soviet Union, a biplane and a number of helicopters.

Most models featured raised rivets or moulded-in lines and relatively robust &#x27;dumbbell-type&#x27; metal wheels. Unfortunately, the rotors and clear parts of earlier helicopters (especially the Bell 47) were made from very brittle plastic that broke easily during play. Zee took action to fix this with later releases (e.g. the Kaman Seasprite) by changing the rotors to flexible vinyl.

== Marketing ==

Dyna-Flites reached their peak in the late 1980s, with most mass retailers carrying the line (including Target, Woolworths/Woolco, WalMart and ToysRUs in the United States, and K-Mart, Toy World and Franklins in Australia). They were often available for purchase for $1 or less each, a feature that often saw them marketed as an impulse purchase line at checkouts and newsagents. Dyna-Flites were also sold in at least two dedicated aircraft giftsets, as well as other giftsets with various themes (e.g. the Emergency and Police Giftsets included H-19 and the Bell-47 or Cayuse helicopters, respectively). Notably, the Dyna-Flites Bell 47 and Chinook helicopters were released in a variety of forms under a media tie-in with the M*A*S*H franchise.

Dyna-Flites has been credited with being the first brand that had commercial airlines license them to produce die-cast models for them. Among the airlines that had models released by Dyna-Flites included FedEx, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Pan Am, TWA and Braniff. Additional airlines in the Dyna-Flite range included Austrian, Hawaiian, ANA, Japan Airlines, BOAC, United Airlines CP Airlines, Western Airlines, KLM, British Airways and more. However, ZEE did issue an authorized gift set for United Air Lines in 1993.

== Demise and current product releases by Red Box Toys ==

ZEE Toys ceased production in 1996, but the line was purchased by Red Box Toys of Hong Kong in 1997. Production continues to this day, but are sold under the brand Hot Wings, In Air and sometimes under generic brands, often with cast-in marks removed. Former Dyna-Flites pieces can be identified by the &quot;Axxx&quot; reference number moulded into the body. Twenty six of the original moulds have now been retired, being either updated or replaced by other subjects. Red Box Toys went on to release 3 new pieces in 1999 which continued the series&#x27; numbering sequence. Those aircraft were an F-19, U-2 &#x27;Senior Span&#x27; and Me 262. The Me 262 was a new cast, not re-release of the earlier mold in the line.
In 2006 Red Box added four WWII Japanese aircraft to the line up. They were released in at least 3 different color combinations:
A180 Ki-45 Nick
A181 B5N2 Kate
A182 Ki-43 Oscar
A183 D4Y3 Judy

Zee also released a line called &quot;Super Dyna-Flites&quot;, which can be distinguished by a mould numbering sequence of &quot;A2xx&quot;. Some of these aircraft continue to be released in the In Air and Hot Wings lines. Often these 3rd party releases include the original ZEE cast in identifiers; sometimes it is edited and on some it is removed entirely.

== List of Dyna Flites aircraft by manufacturing number and sales name ==

Some aircraft in the Dyna-Flites series were issued using an incorrect name (e.g. the Sikorsky S-55 was actually an S-58) or omitted the manufacturer&#x27;s name (e.g. the &#x27;Huey copter&#x27; is correctly a Bell UH-1B Iroquois/Huey). In addition, some moulds were withdrawn and their number assigned to a new mould. Additionally, a number of the early casts were retired and replaced with newer, finer casts. This would include the B707 and B727 as examples. Some details are provided in brackets after each aircraft&#x27;s entry. It should also be noted that the original issue numbers did NOT include the &quot;A&quot; suffix. This would become standard in later years, but it is also a way to distinguish between the A102 F-100 and its replacement, the A102A C-5 Galaxy. In time ZEE would use different suffixes to distinguish different paint releases. For instance the A106 DC-3 would eventually be issued with A, B, C and D suffix versions. These suffixes were not included (except for the A) on the item itself, but were listed in catalogs. For clarity the suffix&#x27; are deleted from the following list.

The identity of the A113 biplane is not resolved. It was officially released as a &quot;SPAD&quot;, although the cast looks more like a Sopwith Camel. It would return in a variety of guises over the years, with its final release coming as a &quot;Crop Duster&quot;. It is the only biplane in the line. 
&quot;NB: Errors exist in the following list. It is both exclusionary and contains some spurious information. It is also incomplete to later issues and liveries. This list is only good through the end of ZEE ownership in 1996.&quot;

<text>A workbench is a sturdy table at which manual work is done. They range from simple flat surfaces to very complex designs that may be considered tools in themselves. Workbenches vary in size from tiny jewellers benches to the huge benches used by staircase makers. Almost all workbenches are rectangular in shape, often using the surface, corners and edges as flat/square and dimension standards. Design is as varied as the type of work for which the benches are used but most share these attributes:

* A comfortable height for working with provisions for seated or standing work
* A way to fix the workpiece to the surface so that it may be worked with both hands
* Provisions for mounting, storing and accessing tools

Workbenches are made from many different materials including metal, wood, stone, and composites depending on the needs of the work.

==Types==
Workbench types may be divided according to the particular work they are designed to accommodate:

;Multi-purpose/portable: These benches are small, light, collapsible, and typically have built in clamps. Epitomized by the Black &amp; Decker Workmate, a bench invented and patented by Ron Hickman, they can be used for a wide range of manual work.
;Woodworking: May be used for general woodworking but may be specialized for joinery, cabinetmaking, patternmaking, stairbuilding, carving, carpentry or trim work. They are usually made from solid wood and have integral clamping mechanisms. 
;Metalworking (e.g. welding table): Metalworkers need benches built to handle grinding, welding, light casting and forging, and layout. Most of these benches include a metalworker&#x27;s vise mounted to the top.
;Gardening: Gardener&#x27;s benches must be resistant to moisture and dirt. They are used for potting, seeding, and grooming, and usually have built-in shelving and storage.
;Electronics: Formally a fixture in radio shacks, now used for assembly and repair of all sorts of electronic equipment including communication, computer, and home entertainment items. These benches usually have sources of power built in, along with shelves and task lighting. The height of most electronics benches are set for a seated worker and are equipped with electrically dissipative materials for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection.
;Software: Software used the metaphor of a workbench for exposing file management and application launching functionality, like in the AmigaOS workbench, or for designing processes connecting data sources to operations and models.
;Industrial: These workbenches offer the benefits of traditional workbenches but on a stronger and larger scale. They&#x27;re built to withstand heavy-duty projects and made with materials like steel that are designed for such purposes.
;General repair: Almost all family farms have one of these. Also found in small engine repair shops. Used for sharpening, cleaning, lubricating, assembly/disassembly, and light metal work.
;Laboratory work: Utilized, especially with the chemical and biological sciences. Surfaces are typically made of chemical resistant materials such as epoxy resin, phenolic resin, high-density polyethene, and stainless steel. Some of these benches have integrated services like water, gas, and power, built in or near at hand.
;Art and sculpture: These benches are most likely to be used in the round. They are designed so that the workpiece can be mounted firmly, usually from underneath, and accessed from all sides. Used by wood and stone carvers.
;Jewelers and watchmakers: Purpose-built benches which generally have a &quot;bench pin&quot; – a small wooden work surface protruding out towards the worker, allowing for working on small parts. In addition, there is usually a tray or leather apron underneath to catch precious metal filings or dropped items. They are designed so that when the worker is seated the work is at or near eye level.
;Fitting and assembling: Used by machinists, pipefitters, electricians, textile workers, handloaders, and piece workers, these benches usually have space for layout and built-in tools, jigs and measuring devices to facilitate the work.

== Workbench surfaces ==
The workbench surface is a vital part of the workbench. Workbench surface can be mainly divided as 4 types. They are:

* Particleboard: Tiny wood particles that are glued and pressure-bonded together. Most of the tops are also coated with melamine or laminate making them easy to wipe clean.
* Wood: Typically built of thick and solid maple.
* Plastic or laminate
* Steel

<text>Gaetano Alberto &quot;Guy&quot; Lombardo (June 19, 1902 – November 5, 1977) was a Canadian and American bandleader, violinist, and hydroplane racer whose unique &quot;sweet jazz&quot; style remained popular with audiences for nearly five decades.

Lombardo formed the Royal Canadians in 1924 with his brothers Carmen, Lebert and Victor, and other musicians from his hometown. They billed themselves as creating &quot;the sweetest music this side of Heaven&quot;. The Lombardos are believed to have sold between 100 and 300 million records during their lifetimes, many featuring the band&#x27;s lead singer from 1940 onward, Kenny Gardner.

==Early life==
Lombardo was born in London, Ontario, Canada. His parents were Italian immigrants: Gaetano Alberto who was born in Lipari, Italy (1873–1954), and Angelina Lombardo. Gaetano Sr. was employed as a tailor but was also an amateur baritone singer. He encouraged four of his five young sons to study musical instruments so that they could serve as his accompanists. Consequently, even as a young student in grammar school, Lombardo joined with his brothers to form their first orchestra. Rehearsals took place behind the family&#x27;s tailor shop. Lombardo&#x27;s first public appearance with his brother Carmen occurred during an outdoor lawn party at a church in London, Ontario, in 1914. The Lombardo quartet made its first significant debut at an outdoor dance pavilion in Grand Bend, Ontario, during the summer of 1919.

By 1920, Lombardo&#x27;s band showcased the talents of several of his brothers including: Carmen, who led the reed section while also composing and arranging, Lebert, who played lead trumpet, and subsequently Victor who played baritone sax. Guy played violin but not with his orchestra. The ensemble spent the winter season during 1922–1923 at the Winter Garden in London and the summer season of 1923 in Port Stanley, Ontario. By 1923 the Lombardo Brothers&#x27; Orchestra now included: Archie Cunningham, (saxophone), Jim Dillon (trombone), Eddie &quot;Muff&quot; Mashurette (tuba) and Francis Henry (guitar). In late 1923, the band ventured outside Canada on tour to Cleveland, Ohio. By 1924, the band was known as Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians and a two-year residency started at the Claremont Tent nightclub in Cleveland. The owner of the club (Louis Bleet) is credited with coaching Lombardo&#x27;s band and assisting in developing its unique performance style. While in Cleveland, Lombardo arranged to perform on an unsponsored program for WTAM radio, which contributed to the development of a strong following for his appearances in the area. His band&#x27;s first recording session occurred in Richmond, Indiana, at the Gennett Studios in early 1924. This is also where cornetist Bix Beiderbecke made his recordings in the same year.

==Royal Canadians==
Subsequently, Lombardo&#x27;s orchestra recorded twice for Brunswick. The first session took place in Cleveland in late 1926 but the recording was rejected. The second recording was accepted for the Vocalion label in early 1927. Lombardo&#x27;s ensemble left the Cleveland area in 1927 for Chicago, where it appeared at the Granada Cafe and broadcast on the radio station WBBM. Soon thereafter, several lucrative recording contracts emerged. Between 1927 and 1931 Lombardo made forty five recordings on 78&#x27;s for the Columbia label. These were followed by forty additional recordings upon his return to the Brunswick label in 1932 which lasted until 1934, when he joined forces with Decca (1934–35). By late 1935 an opportunity with Victor records emerged and Lombardo stayed with the label until the middle of 1938. Subsequently, he returned to Decca until 1957. Total sales from Lombardo&#x27;s recordings exceeded 300 million copies by the early 1970s and supported his reputation as the leader of the most popular dance band of his era. Between 1941 and 1948, Lombardo&#x27;s sister Rose Marie, the youngest of all seven Lombardo siblings, also joined the band as its first female vocalist.

In 1929, Lombardo began a series of appearances at the Roosevelt Grill in the Roosevelt Hotel which lasted for over three decades. He also performed in Los Angeles during the 1930s, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1938. He continued to tour in major cities within both Canada and the United States after leaving the Roosevelt Hotel in 1962. Yet, despite his success as a recording artist, some jazz critics described Lombardo&#x27;s &quot;sweet&quot; big-band style as &quot;boring, mainstream pap.&quot; The legendary jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong disagreed and often described Lombardo&#x27;s band as his favorite orchestra. In fact, Lombardo&#x27;s band enjoyed remarkable broad appeal which crossed racial boundaries. While performing at the famed Savoy Ballroom in Harlem his band even set a new attendance record in 1930.
After Guy Lombardo&#x27;s death in 1977, his surviving brothers Victor and Lebert took over the Royal Canadians, though Victor left the band early in 1978 over creative differences. From 1980, the name was franchised out to various band leaders. Lebert died in 1993, passing rights to the band name to three of his six children. The band was revived in 1989 by Al Pierson and remained active .

===New Year&#x27;s Eve radio and TV programs===

Lombardo is perhaps best remembered for his big band remote broadcasts which were carried on several national radio and television networks for nearly fifty years. Starting in 1929, the Royal Canadians began broadcasting live from the Roosevelt Grill in the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City as &quot;radio&#x27;s first nationwide New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast&quot;. Invariably, each broadcast closed with Lombardo&#x27;s rendition of the song Auld Lang Syne as part of the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition. The broadcasts proved to be immensely popular and continued from this venue until 1959 when they were transferred to the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel where they continued until 1976. These radio and television broadcasts soon played a central role in New Year&#x27;s celebrations across North America as millions of celebrants enjoyed the festivities within the comfort of their own homes.&quot;Time&quot; magazine even reported that the American public would simply not believe it was New Year&#x27;s Day until Guy Lombardo heralded its arrival from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Due to his widespread popularity, Lombardo was nicknamed &quot;Mr. New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; and received a citation of recognition from the United States Congress for his musical message of hope, peace and happiness for all mankind.

The band&#x27;s first New Year&#x27;s Eve radio broadcast was in 1929; within a few years, they were heard live on the CBS Radio Network before midnight Eastern Time, then on the NBC Radio Network after midnight. As a result, by 1954 Lombardo&#x27;s popularity soared and sales of his recordings with the Royal Canadians Orchestra soon exceeded 100 million copies. He had already played in Washington D.C. at the inaugural balls for every U.S. president from Franklin Roosevelt to Dwight Eisenhower and would later play at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inaugural ball in 1985.

On December 31, 1956, the Lombardo&#x27;s first New Year&#x27;s TV special aired on the CBS network. The program showcased live segments from New York City&#x27;s Times Square and continued on New Year&#x27;s Eve for two decades. CBS continued to broadcast most of Lombardo&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s television specials on its national network between 1965 and 1970 and the special was also syndicated live to individual TV stations. By the mid-1970s, however, competition emerged for younger audiences who preferred &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;. Nevertheless, Lombardo remained popular among older viewers.

Following Lombardo&#x27;s death in 1977, his New Year&#x27;s TV specials continued for an additional two years on CBS. Subsequently, &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; came into prominence. The Royal Canadians&#x27; recording of the traditional song &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is also played as the first song of the new year in Times Square followed by &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot; by Frank Sinatra, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; by Ray Charles, &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; by Louis Armstrong, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; by Israel Kamakawiwoʻole, and Kenny G&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. The 1979-80 edition of New Year&#x27;s Eve with Guy Lombardo&#x27;s Royal Canadians moved back to syndication and only featured the celebration at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, with nephew Bill Lombardo leading the band for the second year. This was the Royal Canadians&#x27; final New Year&#x27;s Eve special to air on television. 

===Other radio===
In the early 1940s Lombardo appeared as a guest on NBC&#x27;s Red Network in the weekly broadcast of the &quot;I&#x27;m An American&quot; radio show. Presented by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, the program included interviews with prominent naturalized American citizens of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds who made exceptional contributions to American society within literature, politics, the arts and sciences. When asked to reflect upon the advantages of citizenship within America&#x27;s democracy, Lombardo adeptly replied, &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be millionaires or even well-to-do to dance to good dance music in America&quot;. Also included among the honorees on the program were: Frank Capra, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann and Kurt Weill.

Beginning June 14, 1953, Guy Lombardo and his orchestra had &quot;Guy Lombardo Time&quot;, the summer replacement for Jack Benny&#x27;s radio program.
===Other television===
In 1954, Lombardo briefly hosted a half-hour syndicated series called &quot;The Guy Lombardo Show&quot;, and in 1956 Lombardo hosted a show on CBS for three months called &quot;Guy Lombardo&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee&quot;.

Guy Lombardo played himself in the hit series &quot;Route 66&quot; in the 1963 episode “But What Do You Do in March?” In 1975, Lombardo played himself again, in the first regular episode of &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne,&quot; which was set at a Dec. 31, 1946 New Year&#x27;s Eve gathering.

===Film===
As early as 1933, Lombardo appeared with his brothers Carmen, Lebert and Victor performing in the film &quot;Rambling &#x27;Round Radio Row&quot; for Warner Brothers&#x27; Vitaphone division. Lombardo and his orchestra were also part of the 1934 film &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;.

===Jones Beach Theater===
At the express invitation of Robert Moses, Lombardo served for two decades, as the impresario for numerous summer stock revivals of leading Broadway musicals at the Jones Beach Theater on the south shore of New York&#x27;s Long Island. Beginning in 1954 with a production of &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; starring the operatic tenor Lauritz Melchior, Lombardo also collaborated with the producer Arnold Spector and choreographer June Taylor in 1964 to produce &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; and continued to create opulent revivals of several Broadway musicals until 1977. He would often commute from his home in Freeport, Long Island to the lagoon adjacent to the theater on his yacht &quot;The Tempo IV&quot; to conduct his Royal Canadians Orchestra for dances in the Schaeffer Beer Tent after the shows.

Lombardo&#x27;s productions at the seaside theater were noted for their glamorous and realistic waterborne set designs as well as their lush musical scores which were sometimes arranged by his brother Carmen. His early revival of &quot;Song of Norway&quot; in 1958 featured an actual iceberg floating down the lagoon toward the stage along with an authentic Viking ship. His 1961 rendition of the Hawaiian musical fantasy &quot;Paradise Island&quot; featured 32 native Hawaiian dancers diving off towers into the lagoon adjacent to the theater along with a 100 foot high waterfall. The 1965 production of &quot;Mardis Gras&quot; incorporated a floating set which ushered Louis Armstrong onstage for musical performances with his own band.

Over the decades, Lombardo also collaborated with leading musical artists in his revivals including: Nancy Dussault in the 1968 production of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, Constance Towers in the 1970 production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. and Norman Atkins in the 1974 production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. From the realm of grand opera, Lombardo recruited such luminaries as: Jerome Hines and James McCracken along with members of the New York City Ballet. He also enlisted talented actors from the Broadway stage including William Gaxton and Arthur Treacher for his production of &quot;Paradise Island&quot; in 1961 and the film actor Jules Munshin for his 1960 production of &quot;Hit the Deck&quot;. During the early years, members of Lombardo&#x27;s fifteen original Royal Canadians were augmented by professional musicians recruited from the New York City area to serve within the pit orchestra as well as on stage. As a result, the orchestra itself often included between thirty and forty accomplished instrumentalists.

Lombardo often faced many challenges in the course of producing extravaganzas in such an outdoor venue during the summer season. The fickle weather conditions which prevailed near the shoreline often featured spontaneous drenching downpours which discouraged concertgoers. Still others balked at the prospect of making a long road trip from New York City onto Long Island for a show. In addition, complex negotiations with a variety of unions representing the stagehands, carpenters and electricians contributed to mounting production costs. Ultimately, the Lombardo brothers only broke even financially, despite years of dedicated service. Lombardo, however, did not have any regrets. In the final analysis his primary objective was to provide ordinary members of the general public with musical entertainment of the highest possible caliber, while also ensuring memorable nights of dancing pleasure to the strains of &quot;the sweetest music this side of heaven&quot;.

==Hydroplane racing==

Lombardo&#x27;s talents also extended beyond the realm of jazz music. He was also an active nautical enthusiast and participated in the sport of Step Boat speedboat racing. In 1946, he piloted his speedboat &quot;Tempo VI&quot; to victory, winning the Gold Cup. For a time, Lombardo even reigned as the U.S. national champion (1946–1949), utilizing a boat designed specifically for him and manufactured by John L. Hacker. He subsequently achieved victory in several other important races including: the Ford Memorial competition (1948), President&#x27;s Cup (1952) as well as the Silver Cup in 1952. By the late 1950s, Lombardo had won every trophy in the field and retired from active competition. This followed his attempt in 1959 to utilize a jet engine-powered Tempo Alcoa to exceed the absolute water speed record. During a test run, the radio-controlled craft was destroyed while it surpassed a velocity of 250 mph. These numerous achievements led to his induction into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 2002.

Lombardo also unveiled a robust line of fiberglass boats in 1958. Branded as the &quot;Guy Lombardo Royal Fleet&quot;, these crafts were both manufactured and marketed by a subsidiary of the U. S. Pools Co. in Newark, New Jersey. in accordance with a license from the Skagit Plastics Co. of La Conner, Washington. Several years later, however, in 1961 the project was abandoned and Skagit Plastics discontinued production.

Later in life, Lombardo retired near the seashore at his home on the south shore of New York&#x27;s Long Island in Freeport, where he docked his speedboats:&quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Tempo VI&quot;, and &quot;Tempo VII&quot;. The home has been designated as a historical landmark. In keeping with his nautical interests, he also invested in a nearby seafood restaurant called &quot;Liota&#x27;s East Point House&quot; that eventually became &quot;Guy Lombardo&#x27;s East Point House&quot;.

== Life==
While playing at the Music Box in Cleveland, Lombardo met Lillibeth Glenn. They married in 1926.

==Death==
On November 5, 1977, Lombardo died of a heart attack. Another source says he died &quot;of a lung ailment&quot; following heart surgery. His wife, who died in 1982, was at his bedside when he died in Houston Methodist Hospital. He is interred at the Pinelawn Memorial Park in East Farmingdale, New York.

==Tributes==

In 1971 the United States Congress honored Guy Lombardo with an official recognition of his humanitarian accomplishments. In the same year he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Western Ontario.

The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame inducted Guy Lombardo in 2008.

Lombardo was featured on a postage stamp issued on December 17, 1999, as part of Canada Post&#x27;s Millennium Collection.

Guy Lombardo has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles.

In 2002, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and had a star on its Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 1978, the Canadian Music Hall of Fame also inducted Guy Lombardo.

In his later home of Freeport, New York, there is Guy Lombardo Avenue. There is a bridge named after Lombardo in London, Ontario, near Wonderland Gardens, as well as Lombardo Avenue in north London near the University of Western Ontario.

The Guy Lombardo Society was created to preserve the music and history of Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.

==Guy Lombardo museum==

From the mid-1980s until 2007, there was a museum dedicated to Guy Lombardo in London, Ontario, near the intersection of Wonderland Road and Springbank Drive. In September 2007, lacking visitors and funding, the museum was closed. Although the city owned many of the exhibits, most of the collection can be found at the private home of former part-time curator Douglas Flood. City staff recommended that the museum not be reopened. In early 2015 Flood scheduled an auction of remaining items from the collection, under protest from members of the Lombardo family.

Lebert Lombardo&#x27;s children also have an extensive collection of artifacts, including photographs, record albums, sheet music, awards, and the band&#x27;s framed first paycheck from 1918 in their homes and storage units in Fort Myers and Sanibel, Florida. They have tried to donate the collection to various universities and museums but have had no takers. The Library of Congress has a collection of Lombardo films.

==Performance style==
Over the decades, performances and recordings by Guy Lombardo&#x27;s Royal Canadians Orchestra were reviewed by critics in such noted magazines as: &quot;The Billboard,&quot; the &quot;New York Times&quot; Theater Reviews. and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; Book Reviews. Lombardo was cited for his skillful use of muted drums, trumpets and clarinets, bright tempos and smooth, flowing melodic lines. While emphasizing a sedate performance style, Lombardo also discouraged the use of solo improvisations, rifts and driving swing rhythms in his arrangements. He also adopted the use of the tuba instead of the double bass in a harmonic role.

In a 1973 interview with CBC radio, Lombardo credited his brother Carmen with utilizing his talents as a self-taught flautist to develop a unique &quot;round&quot; sound for the saxophones as well as the influence of Paul Whiteman&#x27;s band on his style. His &quot;sweet&quot; jazz style frequently incorporated lilting arrangements, much to the dismay of &quot;serious&quot; jazz devotees who favored &quot;hot&quot; jazz. Ironically, even the executives at Columbia Records were inclined to reject a sample recording submitted by Lombardo&#x27;s band in 1927 on the grounds that it lacked the fast staccato tempo popularized by dance bands in the 1920s and was therefore not suitable for dancing.

Nevertheless, even Lombardo&#x27;s detractors praised his orchestra for the skill and musicianship of its members. In fact, Lombardo&#x27;s band was highly respected throughout the industry for its professionalism. Milt Gabler of Decca Records praised the band as &quot;the most completely responsible band I ever knew.&quot; The legendary Louis Armstrong even singled out Lombardo&#x27;s band as one of his favorites.

While Benny Goodman insisted that sweet music in general was &quot;a weak sister incapable of holding its own in any artistic encounter with the real music of America&quot;, Lombardo&#x27;s style continued to reign as the dominant influence among dance bands from the late 1920s until the arrival of the Swing Era in the mid-1930s and served as the foundation for the styles developed by Hal Kemp, Kay Kyser, Freddie Martin (who studied technique on the saxophone with Carmen Lombardo) and Sammy Kaye. In fact, Lombardo&#x27;s smooth, mellow, lyrical style never quite disappeared even after World War II ended and helped to influence the subsequent development of various musical genres including easy listening.

The music critic Winthrop Sargeant brushed aside all doubts about Lombardo&#x27;s music In his &quot;Jazz: Hot and Hybrid&quot; (1959:53) by asserting that it was &quot;unquestionably a variety of jazz, a hybrid variety that has come as close as anything does to being the folk-music of the great mass of Americans&quot;. In the final analysis, Lombardo&#x27;s simple direct interpretation of easily understood melodies continued to consistently attract huge audiences both in the dance halls and concert halls of America in a manner which remained popular with the public for five decades.

==Singles discography==
Over the decades, Lombardo and his Royal Canadians Orchestra recorded extensively on the Brunswick, Victor, Columbia and Decca record labels. Before the start of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 40 charts in 1940, Lombardo had over 140 hits from 1927 to 1940, including twenty-one No. 1 singles. The five biggest being &quot;Charmaine&quot;, &quot;It Looks Like Rain in Cherry Blossom Lane&quot;, &quot;Boo-Hoo&quot;, &quot;We Just Couldn&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;.

<doc id="231656" wikidata="Q7719571" url="?curid=231656" title="The Box (Australian TV series)">
<text>The Box is an Australian soap opera that ran on ATV-0 from 11 February 1974 until 11 October 1977 and on 0–10 Network affiliates around Australia.

&quot;The Box&quot; was produced by Crawford Productions which at the time was having great success producing police drama series in Australia. &quot;The Box&quot; was Crawfords&#x27; first soap opera, and was launched as a reaction to the enormous success of another adult soap opera &quot;Number 96&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Box&quot; was a drama set in a fictional Melbourne television station, called UCV Channel 12, and explored the workings of the company and the professional and personal lives of its staff. It featured elements that satirised the Australian television industry.

Characters in the series were said to be modelled on Australian television figures of the day. Sir Henry Usher was based on media mogul Sir Frank Packer and Sir Reginald Ansett, owner of Ansett Airlines and the O/10 network. The tea lady Mrs Hopkins (Lois Ramsay) was based on the company&#x27;s own tea lady.

&quot;The Box&quot; featured many self-referential elements. Like &quot;Number 96&quot; it was famous for its adult storylines, nude glimpses, and sexual content. Also like &quot;Number 96&quot; it was spun off into a feature film adaptation, &quot;The Box&quot;.

==Storylines==
&quot;The Box&quot; presented various fictional programs produced by UCV-12 that mirrored real-life Australian programs. Police procedural &quot;Manhunt&quot;, which was lumbered with dim and accident-prone lead actor Tony Wild (Ken James), was much like the police series produced by Crawfords at that time. Variety program &quot;Big Night Out&quot; was an &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; style production. Aborted medical drama &quot;Mercy Flight&quot; seemed connected to early British series &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; (1959). Other programs produced by the station included children&#x27;s show &quot;Holliday Farm&quot; and later, period drama &quot;Gully Rider&quot;.

The initial episodes of &quot;The Box&quot; emphasised sex, scandal, the political machinations of station personnel, and featured several nude scenes. The first episode showed a sexy young woman named Felicity (played by 20-year-old Helen Hemingway) seducing &quot;Big Night Out&quot; host Gary Burke (Peter Regan). Felicity then announced she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl, causing the station to try to avoid the scandal. Scheming bisexual television magazine journalist Vicki Stafford (Judy Nunn) exploited the situation and had Felicity pose for a nude centrefold with Tony Wild. Vicki also kissed Felicity, in Australian TV&#x27;s first ever lesbian kiss. Felicity was soon revealed to be over 18, and schemed her way into the station to appear on &quot;Big Night Out&quot;. Vicki soon switched to working for the station, producing and presenting daytime chat show &quot;Girl Talk&quot; before hitting the big time with evening current affairs series &quot;Newsmakers&quot;.

&quot;The Box&quot; featured an openly gay television producer, the flamboyant Lee Whiteman (Paul Karo), and garrulous tea lady Mrs. Hopkins (Lois Ramsey). Mrs. Hopkins&#x27; son Wayne (Bruce Kilpatrick) was released from prison during the show&#x27;s first year. When he fell in love with Lee, Mrs. Hopkins was forced to accept that her son was a homosexual. Lee also clashed with Gary Burke upon taking over as producer of &quot;Big Night Out&quot;. Gary continually schemed to retain his position on the show.

A feature film adaptation of &quot;The Box&quot; made at the end of the first year of production featured most of the regular series characters but had a stand-alone story. The film emphasised comedy to a greater degree than the series version at that time.
The program&#x27;s second year (1975) increasingly emphasised comedy, much of it focused on Tony Wild. Enid Parker (Jill Forster) arrived as a jolly but frumpish spinster secretary. Enid was perturbed when her glamorous sister, the scheming Emma (also played by Forster), showed up and impersonated her. Lee had a brief relationship with closeted newsreader John Barnett (Donald McDonald). Cheryl Rixon appeared on a recurring basis in 1975–1976 as television starlet Angela O&#x27;Malley, and appeared nude in the series several times.

For the 1976 season, Jock Blair returned as the program&#x27;s producer and announced his plans to refocus the series to emphasise adult drama as it had done in its first year.

==Production==
The Crawford Productions series was created and written by Ian Jones and Tom Hegarty and commenced at the studios of Melbourne&#x27;s ATV-0 in October 1973. The premiere 90-minute episode screened on ATV-0 on 11 February 1974 at 9.00pm. 

The program was initially shot in black and white, before switching to colour production in late 1974.

&quot;The Box&quot; was proposed with the title &quot;The Dream Makers&quot;. Crawfords&#x27; head executive Hector Crawford, believed network owner Reginald Ansett would reject the series due to its adult themes and risqué content. The series was therefore offered to the Seven Network who turned it down. The series was put on hold then re-pitched to the 0-10 Network under new title &quot;The Box&quot;, and purchased in a deal by Ansett on 14 July 1973.

&quot;The Box&quot; proved to be a huge hit, ranking as Australia&#x27;s second most popular show in 1974. (&quot;Number 96&quot; was Australia&#x27;s highest rating television production that year.)

A feature film adaptation of the series was produced in January 1975 and released later that year. It placed a greater emphasis on comedy than the series at that time, and featured several scenes featuring full frontal nudity. The film&#x27;s sets were later moved to the television studios to be used in the series. In the show&#x27;s storyline an office fire in October 1975 explained the change in appearance.

Production of the series was in half-hour episodes for the first two years. In some regions two episodes were aired consecutively in one-hour blocks. Other regions broadcast the serial as five half-hour instalments each week, stripped across each weekday evening. Starting with the 1976 season episodes were compiled in one-hour instalments.

In Melbourne episodes screened as two, one-hour episodes each week throughout 1976.

Production on the series ended 1 April 1977 due to declining ratings. The closing episodes screened through 1977 in a late-night timeslot. The final episode, 603, was broadcast in Melbourne on 11 October 1977.

==Regular cast 1974-1975==

===Guest cast===

Colleen Hewett appeared as herself resident singer on &#x27;Big Night Out&#x27; singing Roberta Flack song &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; in the TV pilot movie episode. Hewett was also featured in episode 351 in 1975, again as herself singing on &#x27;Big Night Out&#x27;.

Deborra-Lee Furness appeared as a recurring one-line extra in episodes produced in late 1974.

===Cast notes===

Judy Nunn, Barrie Barkla, Ken James, Ken Snodgrass and Lois Ramsay appeared throughout the series&#x27; entire run. Barrie Barkla actually worked at a TV station (CTC-7 in Canberra) before moving to Melbourne to play his role as the station manager in &quot;The Box.&quot; After &quot;The Box&quot; finished up, Barkla moved to Perth where he worked as a presenter for the Nine Network station STW-9

Peter Regan, who played the part of TV host Gary Burke, went on to become host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Quest&quot; variety series in 1976–78.

==Scriptwriters==
Key writers for the early episodes included Tom Hegarty (born c. 1934-1935 - 22 September 2023), Don Battye and Jonathan Dawson.

==Awards==
George Mallaby won the Best Australian Actor-National Logie Award in 1975 for his portrayal of television executive Paul Donovan in &quot;The Box&quot;.

Paul Karo won the Best Australian Actor-National Logie Award in 1976 for his portrayal of gay producer Lee Whiteman.

==Feature film==
A 1975 feature film, &quot;The Box&quot;, was produced based on the series, and featuring much of the same cast. The film also features Graham Kennedy playing himself, and Cornelia Frances in the key role of Dr. S. M. Winter, an efficiency expert brought in to improve operations at UCV-12.

A DVD release of the feature film was announced in 2023 and was made available on 1 February 2024.

==DVD releases==

In late 2014 Volume 1 of The Box, featuring a selection of episodes from the first year, was released by Crawford Productions. In 2015 Volume 2, which features another selection of episodes from the first year of the series, was released. The releases are described as containing a &quot;selection&quot; of episodes due to a small number of episodes that are excluded as the original tapes were missing or damaged. Each release contains the equivalent of 50 thirty-minute episodes (the first episode is feature length). From the first DVD of 50 episodes, six are excluded as they were missing or damaged. One episode is missed in volumes 2&#x27;s run of 50 episodes.

The run of episodes continues in Volume 3 which was released in September 2015. Volume 3 contains 50 episodes and there are no missing episodes in this run. Volume 4 was released in January 2017, also with no missing episodes.

After more than a six year hiatus, Crawfords released Volume 5 at the end of September 2023. Volume 6 of the series was released through Crawfords in October 2023 and Volume 7 was released in December 2023. A further seven volumes are still to be released as of February 2024. The Box movie was released in February 2024.

October 11, 2024 sees the final Volume 14 of The Box TV series released.

<doc id="231658" wikidata="Q333461" url="?curid=231658" title="John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan">
<text>John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan (born 8 May 1947) is a British politician. A member of the Labour Party, he has held various Cabinet positions under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 1999 to 2007, lastly as Home Secretary from 2006 to 2007. He was also a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1987 to 2010, and has been a Member of the House of Lords since 2010.

Born in Bellshill to working-class, Roman Catholic parents, Reid first became involved in politics when he joined the Young Communist League in 1972. He later joined the Labour Party, working for them as a senior researcher before being elected to the House of Commons in 1987 as the MP for Motherwell North. He served as a junior minister in two departments from 1997, before he was promoted to the Cabinet in 1999; he served continuously in the Cabinet until Blair resigned in 2007. Reid served as Scottish Secretary from 1999 to 2001, Northern Ireland Secretary from 2001 to 2002, Chairman of the Labour Party and Minister without Portfolio from 2002 to 2003, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council in 2003, Health Secretary from 2003 to 2005, Defence Secretary from 2005 to 2006, and Home Secretary from 2006 to 2007.

He retired from frontline politics in 2007 following Gordon Brown&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister, taking on a role as the Chairman of Celtic Football Club. After stepping down as an MP in 2010, he was nominated for a life peerage in the Dissolution Honours and elevated to the House of Lords. Reid took a leading role in the campaign for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the 2011 AV referendum, appearing alongside Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, and also took a leading role in the campaign opposing Scottish independence.

==Background==
Reid was born in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, to working-class Roman Catholic parents; his grandparents were of mixed denomination. His grandfather was &quot;a staunch Church of Scotland Presbyterian and his grandmother a poor and illiterate Irish peasant.&quot; His mother, Mary, was a factory worker and his father, Thomas, was a postman.

Reid attended St Patrick&#x27;s High School, Coatbridge. The adolescent Reid showed an early talent for organisation and political activism by leading a student strike in protest at a school rule. Reid initially decided not to go to university but instead took a series of jobs, including construction work on an oil pipeline and another in insurance; at the latter job, which Reid later claimed opened his eyes politically, he was assigned to the tenements in the East End of Glasgow after the city was hit by storms in late-1968 and saw poverty of a kind he did not know existed. Soon after this experience, he joined the Labour Party.

Around this time Reid&#x27;s passion for history was kindled when his girlfriend (and later wife), Cathie McGowan, bought him a copy of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; by William L. Shirer. Reid was spellbound. Following this he attended the Open University in his mid-twenties to study a Foundation Course and then later attended the University of Stirling, becoming rector of the Students&#x27; Union and gaining a BA in history and a PhD in economic history, with a thesis on the slave trade written as a critique of the Marxist model of historical change, titled &quot;Warrior Aristocrats in Crisis: the political effects of the transition from the slave trade to palm oil commerce in the nineteenth century Kingdom of Dahomey&quot;.

From 1979 to 1983, Reid was a research officer for the Labour Party in Scotland, and from 1983 to 1985, was a political adviser to Labour leader Neil Kinnock. From 1986 to 1987, he was Scottish Organiser of Trade Unionists for Labour. He entered parliament at the 1987 general election as MP for the Motherwell North constituency. After boundary changes, he was returned at the 1997 election for the new constituency of Hamilton North and Bellshill; and after further boundary changes in 2005, he was returned at the 2005 election for the new constituency of Airdrie and Shotts with 59% of the votes cast.

Reid was married to Cathie McGowan from 1969 until her sudden death from a heart attack in 1998. They had two sons, Kevin and Mark. In 2002, he married film director Carine Adler.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in 1991, Reid arrived at the House of Commons &quot;drunk one day and tried to force his way on to the floor to vote. When an attendant stepped forward to stop him, Reid threw a punch&quot;. Reid stopped drinking in 1994 and gave up his 60-a-day cigarette habit in 2003.

==Political ideology==
At university, Reid was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. With the support of Communist and Labour students, he became president of the students&#x27; union. After leaving university, he became a professional Labour Party activist, linked politically with Neil Kinnock.

As an advisor to Neil Kinnock, Reid was one of the earliest advocates for reforms to the Labour Party. In 1983, after the Labour Party&#x27;s worst electoral defeat in 65 years, and at Kinnock&#x27;s request, he put on a single sheet of paper what he thought had made Labour unelectable: &quot;Leaderless, unpatriotic, dominated by demagogues, policies fifteen years out of date&quot;. Elected to Parliament in 1987 as the Member of Parliament for Motherwell North, within two years he was appointed to the Shadow Front Bench as spokesperson for Children. In 1990, Reid was appointed as Defence spokesperson.

When the former Yugoslavia was breaking up in the 1990s, Reid was in dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs. During the Bosnian War, Reid struck up a friendship with Radovan Karadžić, later to be indicted as a war criminal. Reid admitted he spent three days at a luxury Geneva lakeside hotel as a guest of Karadžić in 1993.

==Government career==

=== Minister of State for the Armed Forces ===
After Labour came to power at the 1997 general election, Reid became Armed Forces Minister, where he played a key role in the Defence Secretary George Robertson&#x27;s Strategic Defence Review. Reid gained considerable praise for the review; with some commentators going so far as to describe his success in cutting military expenditure at the same time as winning over the defence chiefs as &quot;brilliant&quot;. As Minister he lobbied for the release of two Scots Guards convicted of murdering teenager Peter McBride in Belfast in 1992. At the same time he refused requests to meet the McBride family. Reid eventually met with the McBride family whilst he was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

===Minister for Transport===
In 1998, Reid moved from Defence to become Minister of State for Transport. Prime Minister Tony Blair then sent Reid to the Department of Transport to ensure the late-running and over-budget London Underground Jubilee Line Extension was completed by the end of 2000. He and John Prescott brought in Bechtel as Project Managers, ensuring Phase 1 was opened on 1 May 1999, and the whole Jubilee line with the exception of one station (Westminster) was ultimately open for business by the Millennium. Reid demonstrated several aspects: he negotiated strongly; he was a political fighter; he had a &quot;capacity for non-dogmatic adaptability and reliability&quot;; and was described as &quot;a safe pair of hands&quot;.

===Secretary of State for Scotland===
Having impressed at both Transport and Defence Reid was promoted to Secretary of State for Scotland on 17 May 1999 and a full place at the cabinet table.

In his first month, the Scottish Parliament was re-established after an interval of 300 years. The reconstituted Scotland Office had been much reduced in importance with devolution but Reid used the position to build his profile, prepared to put the government&#x27;s case on any issue against TV interviewers.

After Donald Dewar, Scotland&#x27;s respected First Minister, died in 2000 Reid&#x27;s name was even mentioned as a possible replacement. In fact Reid was left to deal with much of the fall-out after the death and would be increasingly at loggerheads with the new Labour First Minister, Henry McLeish, whom Reid felt was taking the Parliament down a nationalist path. The situation became so strained between the two that in an unguarded moment McLeish publicly labelled Reid &quot;a patronising bastard&quot;.

===Secretary of State for Northern Ireland===
Reid became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in January 2001 following the resignation of Peter Mandelson. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the position. While dismissing the personal significance of this, he used it to insist that every person in Northern Ireland, from whatever background or tradition, wanted a prosperous future.

Throughout his period of office he was continually engaged in talks with all side of the community in an attempt to reduce the level of inter-community troubles. He blamed paramilitaries from both sides of the community for the ongoing violence. He confronted both, on the ground, at a violent east Belfast interface, where he met loyalist residents of Cluan Place and then had talks with nationalist residents in the nearby Short Strand.

Reid ruled that ceasefires proclaimed by the Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Volunteer Force could no longer be recognised by the government because of their involvement in sectarian attacks and murders. At the same time he put pressure on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) to make a move on arms decommissioning to help end the political impasse, whilst acknowledging that putting its weapons beyond use would be a difficult step to take.

It was in this context that, in October 2001 he welcomed a Gerry Adams speech as a &quot;highly significant&quot; step which he hoped would pave the way for a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; move by the IRA to disarm which would transform the political situation. And following the IRA&#x27;s decision Reid responded by announcing the immediate demolition of British Army security bases and announcing a reduction in troop levels as the security situation improved, effectively beginning a process which culminated in September 2005, when the disarmament monitor for Northern Ireland, the Canadian General John de Chastelain announced that the IRA had given up its entire arsenal of weapons after more than three decades of armed struggle against British rule.

Reid oversaw the final stages of the transformation of the RUC into the Police Service Northern Ireland, and the first endorsement of the service by representatives of the Nationalist community.

Political problems continued, resulting in the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly a year later in October 2002. The peace process was to be put on hold until there was a &quot;clear and unequivocal commitment&quot; that the IRA would disband. Reid made an emergency statement to Parliament announcing direct rule in the interim.

In the interim, Reid also had to deal with continuing domestic problems; including those with loyalist ceasefires, sectarian murders and the tinderbox of Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast (that ignited the worst rioting in the city in years). But, so far as 10 Downing Street was concerned, Reid had gone a long way to delivering the rarest of political commodities – success in Northern Ireland.

===Chairman of the Labour Party and Minister without Portfolio===
Reid was appointed Chairman of the Labour Party and Minister Without Portfolio on 24 October 2002.

In this purely political post, his trouble-shooting skills were employed as the Labour Government&#x27;s chief spokesperson; this earned him the nickname &quot;Minister for the &quot;Today&quot; Programme&quot;.

One of Reid&#x27;s key challenges was to keep the trade unions (the Labour Party&#x27;s main funders) onside despite the antipathy shown by the unions to many of the Government&#x27;s proposals. As part of this, Reid agreed to look at proposals to stop private contractors exploiting low-paid workers (a key union demand).

===Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council===
In March 2003, Robin Cook resigned as Leader of the House of Commons due to his objections to the legality of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War. Reid was appointed to take over the role on 4 April; it was thought that a heavyweight figure was more likely to ensure the Commons&#x27; continued support for the war. He held the position for only a little over two months and was succeeded by a more junior member of the Government, Peter Hain.

===Secretary of State for Health===
Reid was made Secretary of State for Health in June 2003, replacing Alan Milburn after the latter&#x27;s resignation. He was reportedly less than happy with the appointment. He was reported by &quot;Private Eye&quot; at the time as reacting &quot;Oh fuck, not health.&quot; But Reid had established himself as one of Tony Blair&#x27;s most trusted ministers, and his appointment as Health Secretary took him into his fourth cabinet job in less than a year.

At Health, Reid saw himself as a reformer, controversially increasing capacity by introducing private companies to run treatment centres for knee, hip and eye operations. He claimed this provided extra staff and extra capacity to help treat more patients in the NHS at an unprecedented rate.

Reid also introduced plans to increase the number of smoke-free workplaces and improve diet and sexual health as part of a major drive to improve public health in England and began a major public consultation as a precursor to parliamentary proposals aimed at improving the nation&#x27;s health. He also encouraged volunteer engagement in the health service.

Many of his changes caused criticism and controversy, which Reid was not afraid to take head on, delivering a staunch defence of Labour&#x27;s reform programme to the party&#x27;s annual conference. He made the case for extending to all the choices normally only available to those who could afford them. Reid&#x27;s management style was considered autocratic by some and he came under considerable fire from National Health Service (NHS) leaders. He was criticized for giving GPs a 22% pay rise while also allowing them to opt out of providing weekend and evening treatment.

As Health Secretary, Reid had been in favour of limiting the government&#x27;s proposed smoking ban as much as possible. In their 2005 election manifesto, he introduced a pledge to ban smoking in all places where food was served. His successor Patricia Hewitt favoured a complete ban. Reid won in the cabinet, gaining an exemption for private clubs and pubs that did not serve food. The House of Commons rebels proposing a complete ban were successful when MPs were given a free vote on the issue. Patricia Hewitt voted with the rebels against the Cabinet&#x27;s proposals.

===Secretary of State for Defence===

Following the incumbent Labour Party&#x27;s 2005 general election victory, Reid was appointed Secretary of State for Defence. He replaced Geoff Hoon.

At Defence, Reid questioned &quot;the adequacy of the international legal framework in the light of modern developments in conflict&quot;. He suggested that &quot;the body of relevant international rules and conventions should, where beneficial, be strengthened&quot;, especially &quot;to cope with conflict against non-state actors such as the international terrorist… this means extending, not reducing, such conventions&quot;.

Reid committed 3,300 troops to Helmand province, Afghanistan in January 2006. Despite a lack of detailed intelligence, the Army anticipated the Helmand mission would be straightforward compared to its difficult mission in Basra it was withdrawing from, with short small patrols from fixed bases. In speaking to the media Reid said &quot;We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years and without firing one shot because our job is to protect the reconstruction.&quot; In the first year about 4 million bullets and 25,000 artillery rounds had been fired by the British armed forces.

Reid took an aggressive approach to defending his government&#x27;s international policy. Speaking ahead of a conference on NATO modernisation in Germany on 4 February 2006, Reid asserted in a press interview that &quot;no institution has the divine right to exist&quot;. Similarly on 19 March 2006, in response to former interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi&#x27;s claim that Iraq is in the grip of civil war, Reid defended the British Government&#x27;s contrary view. He stated: &quot;Every single politician I have met here [in Iraq] from the prime minister to the president, the defence minister and indeed Iyad Allawi himself said to me there&#x27;s an increase in the sectarian killing, but there&#x27;s not a civil war and we will not allow a civil war to develop&quot;.

By the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict, Reid was no longer Defence Secretary, having been succeeded by Des Browne.

On 3 February 2010, Reid gave evidence about his role as Defence Secretary to the Iraq Inquiry. He said that America&#x27;s experience of the Vietnam War had impacted negatively on US post-invasion planning in Iraq because US military chiefs &quot;weren&#x27;t thinking of detailed nation-building&quot;. Reid also said he had &quot;deep sadness at the loss of life&quot; in Iraq.

===Home Secretary===
Reid was appointed Home Secretary on 5 May 2006, replacing Charles Clarke after the latter was removed in the wake of a Home Office scandal involving the release of foreign national prisoners.

On 2 July 2006, Reid proposed a Bill for the autumn Queen&#x27;s Speech, to be brought into law at the next session of Parliament. He proposed a new Official Secrets Act, the first since the 1989 OSA, to punish with longer prison sentences intelligence officers who blow the whistle on government policy by leaking secret information. To remove their key legal defence of necessity and/or defence of public interest.

By the time he arrived at the Home Office, Reid was seen as one of the government&#x27;s most effective performers over the previous decade, being described by many commentators as a bruiser, but with a strong academic leaning.

At the Home Office Reid hit the ground running. He contended that rapid global change and the associated challenges of mass migration, terrorism and organised crime had overwhelmed the outdated Home Office approach. Reid caused considerable controversy by attacking the leadership and management systems previously in place in the Home Office. He infamously declared it to be &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;, adding the phrase to the British political lexicon, and vowed to &quot;make the public feel safe&quot;.

Reid&#x27;s comments were rebuffed by Clarke, who criticised his comments in a defence of his own period in office.

Within 100 days of joining the Department, he had published three reform plans for a radical transformation. They included 8,000 more prison places; a 40 per cent reduction in headquarters staff by 2010; a commitment to making the Immigration and Nationality Directorate an agency with a uniformed border staff and tough new powers. radical overhaul of the core systems and structures within the Home Office itself, reform of IND, re-balancing of the criminal justice system, reform of the probation service and the review of counter-terrorist capabilities.

He condemned the probation service for letting people down, and argued for fundamental reform. An early decision during his time at the Home Office was to move child molesters living in hostels near schools further away from them. Reid also caused controversy in August 2006 by calling for the creation of an independent committee to impose a national annual limit on the number of immigrants entering the UK. &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that Reid was &quot;playing to the racist gallery&quot; and compared his plans to Soviet-style central planning of the economy.

Because of the prisons&#x27; overcrowding crisis in Birmingham, on 9 October 2006 he announced emergency measures amid fears that the prison population was nearing maximum capacity. Reid has announced his support of measures to restrict the ability of extremist messages to be disseminated on the Internet so as to make the web a more hostile place for terrorists.

In 2006 Reid and the Home Office lost their appeal against the High Court ruling in the Afghan hijackers case 2006. In this controversial case, a group of nine Afghan men who hijacked a Boeing 727 in February 2000, while fleeing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, were granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom. The original ruling in 2004 ruled that returning the men to Afghanistan would breach their human rights under the Human Rights Act 1998. The Home Office granted the men &quot;temporary leave to remain&quot;, which involved restricting their freedom of movement and did not allow them to work; in 2006, the High Court ruled that the men must be granted &quot;discretionary leave to remain&quot;, which includes the right to work. Reid challenged the ruling in the Court of Appeal, arguing that the Home Office &quot;should have the power to grant only temporary admission to failed asylum seekers who are only allowed to stay in the UK due to their human rights&quot;.

Reid accused government&#x27;s critics of putting national security at risk by their failure to recognise the serious nature of the threat facing Britain. and called for reform of the human rights laws.

From 1 August 2006, Reid introduced a new warning system to alert the public to the threat of attacks by al-Qaeda and other terror groups in order to increase public understanding and awareness of the terrorist threat. Announcing the plans, Reid told MPs that the terrorist threat would only be overcome by &quot;united action by all of us&quot; and urged the public to remain vigilant at all times. The threat level, already at &quot;Severe&quot;, the second highest level, then moved even higher.

On 10 August, Reid announced that the UK had been put on its highest state of security alert, after police said they&#x27;d thwarted a terrorist plot to simultaneously blow up several aircraft flying between the UK and the US using explosives smuggled in carry-on luggage. Extreme security measures had been put in place at all the country&#x27;s airports.

Reid revealed that the alleged terror plot could have caused civilian casualties on an &quot;unprecedented scale&quot; and security sources said an attack was believed to have been imminent. With 21 people in custody, Reid said he believed the &#x27;main players&#x27; had been &#x27;accounted for&#x27; but emphasised that that still left possible &quot;unknown&quot; players. Reid also revealed that at least four major plots had been thwarted in the previous year and security sources confirmed that two dozen major terrorist conspiracies were under investigation. Reid issued a dire warning against losing the &quot;battle of ideas&quot; with al-Qa&#x27;eda, and called for an urgent but controversial escalation in the propaganda war, saying that the government needed to do much more to win the battle of ideas.

Reid then led European Ministers in efforts to make the Internet a &quot;more hostile&quot; place for terrorists and crack down on people using the web to share information on explosives or spread propaganda.

In September 2006, Reid addressed Muslims in a run-down part of east London, warning them that fanatics were looking to groom and brainwash children for suicide bombings. During the speech he was confronted and barracked by Abu Izzadeen, also known as Omar or Trevor Brooks. Mr Brooks is a leader of the UK-banned Al Ghurabaa, an offshoot of the terrorist-supporting Al-Muhajiroun – a man who many accuse of glorifying terrorism and inciting racial hatred during nightly conversations (often using the nom de plume Abu Baraa) on a New York-based chatroom service.

After the high-profile at the Home Office, his tough stance on terrorism and his domination of the headlines in the aftermath of the alleged terror plot, Reid was increasingly tipped by Labour MPs to run for the party&#x27;s leadership.

In fact, Reid kept everyone guessing about his leadership intentions until the very end. Ultimately the surprise was that, having decided not to stand, he announced his intention to quit frontline politics and return to the backbenches. It was speculated that, as a true Blairite believer, he either wanted to carry the torch of reform himself as Labour leader or else quit the scene altogether to make way for new blood.

===Resignation from government===
In May 2007, Reid announced his intention to resign from the Cabinet when Tony Blair left office, and stated his plans to return to the Labour backbenches. He stated he would support Gordon Brown in the leadership election and his administration. 
Reid left office as Home Secretary on 27 June 2007 and was replaced by Jacqui Smith the next day.

In September 2007 he announced that he would not seek re-election at the next general election.

Reid was linked with a return to cabinet in June 2009 under Gordon Brown but reportedly turned down the offer.

==Votes==
In December 2004 and October 2005, Reid voted in favour of a bill to introduce a compulsory British national identity card. He voted for the NHS foundation trust proposal. He also voted in favour of allowing unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to adopt, and for lowering the age of consent for gay sex to 16. Reid voted for the replacement of the Trident system. He voted against all the House of Lords reform options except a fully appointed House of Lords.

On the introduction of Labour&#x27;s anti-terrorism laws, he opposed an amendment that would have limited the fingerprinting and strip-searching of persons detained at a police station to those detained in connection with a terrorism investigation. He voted against changing the text in the Prevention of Terrorism Bill from &quot;The Secretary of State may make a control order against an individual&quot; to &quot;The Secretary of State may &quot;apply to the court&quot; for a control order...&quot;

In March 2003, he voted against a motion that the case had not yet been made for war against Iraq, and voted for the declaration of war against Iraq. In June 2007, he voted against a motion calling for an independent inquiry by a committee of Privy Counsellors into the Iraq War.

==After cabinet==
On 10 May 2010, Reid argued on BBC television that David Cameron should become the next Prime Minister in the interests of honouring the democratic wishes of the British people, with the Conservative Party having received more votes than any other party. Had Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed an alliance, their combined votes would outnumber Conservative votes at the 2010 general election, but Reid noted that a Labour/Liberal Democrat alliance would not have the numbers to form a parliamentary majority by themselves.

The same month, it was announced that Reid had been made a life peer in the dissolution honours following the 2010 election. He was created Baron Reid of Cardowan, &quot;of Stepps in Lanarkshire&quot; on 16 July 2010.

In April 2011, to the discomfort of Labour colleagues, he campaigned with the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and others against changes to the UK&#x27;s voting system. During the campaign, he made the claim that the alternative vote would violate the principle of one person one vote. He wrote that &quot;it gives the supporters of unpopular fringe candidates numerous votes, while mainstream voters only get one&quot;. The referendum on the Alternative Vote was won decisively by Reid&#x27;s &quot;No&quot; side.

In April 2013, Reid said that Labour had made a mistake with immigration while in government, and now in opposition was not providing an alternative.

In June 2014, Reid appeared in a full-page advert in the &quot;Scottish Catholic Observer&quot;, encouraging readers to vote against Scottish independence in the September referendum. The advert failed to state who had paid for it, which is a breach of Electoral Commission rules, and following complaints, Reid revealed that it had been paid for by an organisation led by Willie Haughey. The referendum resulted in a &quot;No&quot; vote.

==Expenses==
Following the political scandal over MP expenses in 2009, Sir Thomas Legg requested Reid repay £2,731.88 of his claimed expenses. Reid chose to repay a total of £7,336.51. He was later one of 23 MPs who asked for a refund of some of the money they had repaid, and received £4,604.63 back.

==Outside politics==

===Football===
On 28 September 2007, it was announced Reid would become Chairman of Celtic Football Club taking over from Brian Quinn. His appointment was ratified by Celtic&#x27;s shareholders on 19 November 2007. Sports journalist Graham Spiers found him &quot;an engaging and intriguing Celtic chairman&quot;.

Reid is a lifelong supporter of the club, and described the appointment as &quot;an honour and a privilege&quot;.

===University of London===
In late 2008 it was announced that Reid would be taking up the post of honorary Professor at the University College London and become the chairman of the newly created Institute of Security and Resilience Studies (ISRS) at UCL.

===G4S===
On 18 December 2008, G4S (Group 4 Securicor) announced that Reid would be taking up a post with the company as group consultant.

===Top Level Group===
Reid is currently a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

==Awards==
In June 2009, Reid was awarded an honorary degree from Stirling University &quot;for his contribution to public affairs&quot;.

<doc id="231659" wikidata="Q254872" url="?curid=231659" title="Etrog">
<text>Etrog (, plural: ; Ashkenazi Hebrew: , plural: ) is the yellow citron (&quot;Citrus medica&quot;) used by Jews during the weeklong holiday of Sukkot as one of the four species. Together with the &quot;lulav&quot;, &quot;hadass&quot;, and &quot;aravah&quot;, the &quot;etrog&quot; is taken in hand and held or waved during specific portions of the holiday prayers. Special care is often given to selecting an &quot;etrog&quot; for the performance of the Sukkot holiday rituals.

==Etymology==
The romanization of the Hebrew as &quot;etrog&quot; from Sephardi Hebrew is widely used. The Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation is &quot;esrog&quot; or &quot;esrig&quot;. It has been transliterated as &quot;etrog&quot; or &quot;ethrog&quot; in scholarly works. The Hebrew word is thought to derive from the Persian name for the fruit, &quot;wādrang&quot;, which first appears in the Vendidad. Related words are () and . It has also made its way into Arabic as &quot;utrujjah&quot; notably in a hadith collected in the &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot;. A rare Aramaic form, &quot;eṯrungā&quot; (), is significant because it retains the alveolar nasal sound (as indicated by the &quot;nun&quot;) of &quot;wādrang&quot;, also observable in the English word &#x27;&#x27;.

==Taxonomy==
In Modern Hebrew, &quot;etrog&quot; is the name for any variety or form of citron, whether kosher for the ritual or not. In general usage, though, the word is often reserved to refer only to those varieties and specimens used ritually as one of the four species. Some taxonomic experts, like Hodgson and others, have mistakenly treated &quot;etrog&quot; as one specific variety of citron. The various Jewish rites utilize different varieties, according to their tradition or the decision of their respective &quot;posek&quot;.

While the biblical phrase &quot;peri eitz hadar&quot; () (translated above as &quot;fruit of majestic trees&quot;) may be interpreted or translated in a number of ways, the Talmud derives that the phrase refers to the etrog.
In modern Hebrew, &quot;hadar&quot; refers to the genus &quot;Citrus&quot;. Nachmanides (1194 – c. 1270) suggests that the word was the original Hebrew name for the citron. According to this view, the word &quot;etrog&quot; was introduced over time and adapted from Aramaic. The Arabic name for the citron fruit, &quot;itranj&quot; (اترنج), mentioned in hadith literature, is also adapted from Aramaic.

==Historical cultivation==
&quot;Etrogim&quot; were extensively cultivated in the Holy Land at the time of the Second Temple, and images of &quot;etrogim&quot; are found at many archaeological sites of that era, including mosaics at the Maon Synagogue, Beth Alpha Synagogue, and Hamat Tiberias Synagogue. At all of those sites, the &quot;etrog&quot; is depicted alongside other important religious symbols, like the &quot;shofar&quot; or &quot;menorah&quot;. The &quot;etrog&quot; is also found on numerous Bar Kokhba coins.

Archaeological evidence for Citrus fruits is limited, as neither seeds nor pollen are likely to be routinely recovered in archaeology. The earliest evidence of &quot;etrogim&quot; in Israel is the 2012 discovery of citron pollen from the second century BCE in excavations at the Ramat Rachel site.

===In diaspora===
After the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, exiled Jews planted citron orchards wherever the climate allowed: in Southern Europe (Spain, Greece, and Italy) as well as in North Africa and Asia Minor. Jews who settled north of the warmer citron-growing areas depended on imported &quot;etrogim&quot;, which caused much anxiety given the dangers and uncertainties of sea travel. By the seventeenth century, some of the most popular sources for &quot;etrogim&quot; were the islands of Corsica and Corfu.

Since the late 1850s, the &quot;Fruit of the Goodly Tree Association&quot; in Mandatory Palestine represented &quot;etrog&quot; farmers who marketed their crops to Jews in Europe. Some Jewish communities still preferred citrons from Italy, Greece, Morocco, or Yemen, but many Jews seeking citrons turned back to &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot;, the land of Israel.

American Jews continue to import the majority of their holiday &quot;etrogim&quot; from Israel, except during shmita when there are halachic complications in exporting the produce of Israel. The only commercial grower of etrogs in the United States is John Kirkpatrick, the former chairman of the Citrus Research Board, on a ranch in the town of Exeter in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Kirkpatrick, who is not Jewish, began growing etrogs in 1980 following a phone call with Yisroel Weisberger, an employee at a Judaica store in Brooklyn. In 1995, Weisberger&#x27;s brother, Yaakov Shlomo Rothberg, became involved in the operation and has since become Kirkpatrick&#x27;s business partner. , Kirkpatrick has 250 etrog trees and produces 3,000 suitable etrogs per year, with 9,000 that do not qualify due to halakhic requirements. While there are other growers in California, such as Inga Dorosz and David Sleeth in the town of Gorda near Big Sur, these are not rabbinically supervised and are therefore not kosher.

==Cosmetic requirements==

===&quot;Pitam&quot;===

A &quot;pitam&quot; or &quot;pitom&quot; (Hebrew: ; plural &quot;pitamim&quot;) is composed of a style (Hebrew: &quot;&quot; &quot;dad&quot;), and a stigma (Hebrew: &quot;&quot; &quot;shoshanta&quot;), and usually falls off during the growing process. An &quot;etrog&quot; with an intact &quot;pitam&quot; is considered especially valuable, but varieties that naturally shed their &quot;pitam&quot; during growth are also considered kosher. When only the stigma breaks off, even post-harvest, the citron can still be considered kosher as long as part of the style has remained attached. If the whole &quot;pitam&quot;, i.e. the stigma and style, are unnaturally broken off in their entirety, the &quot;etrog&quot; is not kosher for ritual use.

=== &quot;Pitam&quot; preservation technique ===
Many more &quot;pitamim&quot; are preserved today due to an auxin discovered by Eliezer E. Goldschmidt, emeritus professor of horticulture at the Hebrew University. While working with the picloram hormone in a citrus orchard, he unexpectedly discovered that some of the Valencia oranges found nearby had perfectly preserved &quot;pitamim&quot;. Citrus fruits, other than an &quot;etrog&quot; or citron hybrid like the bergamot, usually do not preserve their &quot;pitam&quot;. On the occasions that they do, their &quot;pitamim&quot; tend to be dry, sunken and very fragile. In Goldschmidt&#x27;s observation, the &quot;pitamim&quot; were all fresh and solid like those of the Moroccan or Greek citron varieties.

Experimenting with picloram in a laboratory, Goldschmidt eventually found the correct &quot;dose&quot; to achieve the desired effect: one droplet of the chemical in three million drops of water.

==Purity==
In order for a citron to be kosher, it must be neither grafted nor hybridized with any other species. Only a few traditional varieties are therefore used. To ensure that no grafting is performed, preferred plantations are kept under strict rabbinical supervision.

===Genetic research===
The citron varieties traditionally used as &quot;etrog&quot; are the Diamante citron from Italy, the Greek citron, the Balady citron from Israel, the Moroccan and Yemenite citrons.

A general DNA study was conducted by Eliezer E. Goldschmidt and colleagues which tested and positively identified twelve famous accessions of citron for purity and being genetically related.

The fingered and Florentine citrons, although they are also citron varieties or maybe hybrids, are not used for the ritual. The Corsican citron fell into disfavor but has recently been reintroduced for ritual use.

===Selection and cultivation===
In addition to the above, there are rabbinical indicators used to distinguish pure &quot;etrogim&quot; from possible hybrids. These traditional indicators have been preserved by continuous selection performed by professional farmers.

The most accepted indicators are: 1) a pure &quot;etrog&quot; has a thick rind, contrasting with its sparing pulp segments which are also almost dry, 2) the outer surface of an &quot;etrog&quot; is ribbed and warted, and 3) the &quot;etrog&quot; peduncle is somewhat buried inward. By contrast, a lemon or different citron hybrid is missing one or all of the specifications.

A later and not as widely accepted indicator is the orientation of the seed. In a pure &quot;etrog&quot;, the seeds are oriented vertically, unless crowded by neighboring seeds; in lemons and hybrids, the seeds are oriented horizontally even when they are not crowded.

The &quot;etrog&quot; is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old. The tree begins to bear fruit about four years after planting the cuttings. If the tree is germinated from seed, it will not bear fruit for about seven years, and there may be some genetic change to the tree or fruit.

==Customs==

To protect the &quot;etrog&quot; during the holiday, it is traditionally wrapped in silky flax fibers and stored in a special decorative box, often made from silver.

After the holiday, eating the &quot;etrog&quot; or &quot;etrog&quot; jam is considered a &quot;segula&quot; (efficacious remedy) for a woman to have an easy childbirth. A common Ashkenazi custom is to save the &quot;etrog&quot; until Tu BiShvat and eat it in candied form or as succade, while offering prayers that the worshipper merit a beautiful &quot;etrog&quot; next Sukkot. Some families make jam or liqueur out of the &quot;etrog&quot; or make a pomander by inserting cloves into the skin for use as &quot;besamim&quot; at the havdalah ceremony after Shabbat.

&quot;Etrogim&quot; grown in Israel are not classified as food and are therefore not recommended to be eaten due to the large amount of pesticides used in their agriculture.

<doc id="231673" wikidata="Q1527023" url="?curid=231673" title="Seduction">
<text>In sexuality, seduction means enticing someone else into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity. Strategies of seduction include conversation and sexual scripts, paralingual features, non-verbal communication, and short-term behavioural strategies.

The word &quot;seduction&quot; stems from Latin and means, literally, &#x27;leading astray&#x27;. As a result, the term may have a negative connotation. Seen negatively, seduction involves temptation and , often sexual in nature, to coerce someone into a behavioural choice they would not have made if they were not in a state of sexual arousal. Seen positively, seduction is synonymous for the act of charming someone—male or female—by an appeal to the senses, often with the goal of reducing unfounded fears and leading to &quot;sexual emancipation&quot;. Some sides in contemporary academic debate state that the morality of seduction depends on the long-term impacts on the individuals concerned, rather than the act itself, and may not necessarily carry the negative connotations expressed in dictionary definitions.

Famous seducers from history or legend include Lilith, Giacomo Casanova, and the fictional character Don Juan. The emergence of the internet and technology has supported the availability and the existence of a seduction community, which is based on discourse about seduction. This is predominantly by &quot;pickup artists&quot; (PUA). Seduction is also used within marketing to increase compliance and willingness.

==History==

Seduction is a popular motif in history and fiction, both as a warning of the social consequences of engaging in the behaviour or becoming its victim, and as a salute to a powerful skill. In the Bible, Eve offers the forbidden fruit to Adam. Eve herself was verbally seduced by the serpent, believed in Christianity to be Satan; later, Chapter 7 of Proverbs warns of the pitfalls of seduction. Sirens of Greek mythology lured sailors to their death by singing them to shipwreck; Cleopatra beguiled both Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, Dionysus was the Greek god of seduction and wine. Famous male seducers, their names synonymous with sexual allure, range from Genji to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester and James Bond.

In biblical times, because unmarried females who lost their virginity had also lost much of their value as marriage prospects, the Old Testament Book of Exodus specifies that the seducer must marry his victim or pay her father to compensate him for his loss of the marriage price: &quot;And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.&quot;

The Book of Judges in the Old Testament describes Delilah seducing Samson who was given great strength by God, but ultimately lost his strength when she allowed the Philistines to shave his hair off during his slumber.
== Use in sexual relationships ==
Males and females both implement the strategy of seduction as a method of negotiating their sexual relationships. This can often involve manipulation of other individuals. This is primarily based on desire, normally physical, as well as attraction towards them. Popular phrases often used include; &#x27;the language of love is universal&#x27;. These phrases help to demonstrate the extensively pervasive and ubiquitous strategy use within love and relationships amongst humans. Individuals employing such strategies often do so subconsciously and will merely report the feelings and thoughts that they subjectively experienced and are colloquially comparable to &#x27;attraction&#x27; or &#x27;love&#x27;.

Research has indicated that seduction could substitute or equate to a form of collapsed or condensed courtship. Evolutionary psychology suggests that this form of sexual enticement can be used in order to cajole desired individuals to engage in sexual intercourse and ultimately reproduce. This behaviour is also aimed at persuading someone to develop a short-term or long-term sexual relationship with them. Males declare that they adopt the strategy of seduction statistically more frequently than females. From an evolutionary perspective, this has been linked with females&#x27; higher parental investment and the lack of guarantee of male parental investment, although evolutionary science cannot draw a causal relationship between the two factors. Females therefore need to be seduced more prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. Men more commonly wish to engage in more frequent short-term mating, which may require this strategy of seduction used to access the female for intercourse. However, this finding has been contradicted by non-verbal seduction results which indicate that females have more control within this area. Other potential strategies individuals employ to gain access to a mate include courting or having relatives select mates for socioeconomic reasons. Ultimately, both males and females have reported preferring seduction above all other strategies, such as the use of power or aggression, for making a potential partner agree to sexual intercourse.

== Human mate poaching ==
Seduction is related to human mate poaching. Human mate poaching refers to when either a male or female purposefully entices another individual who is already in an established relationship into sexual relations with them. This is akin to the definition of seduction in the introduction. This is a psychological mechanism which had unconscious and conscious manifestations, that in relation to evolutionary psychology has been adaptive to our ancestors in the past and has continued to be functional in modern society.

Human mate poaching is a form of seduction, and can be used as a short-term and long-term mating strategy among both sexes. Moreover, there are associated costs and benefits to poaching. Schmitt and Buss (2001) investigated the potential costs and benefits across sexes in relation to human mate poaching. 
Costs for engaging in poaching behaviours include unwanted pregnancy, transmitted infection and diseases, and insecurity about provisions (shelter, food, and financial security) and/or resource depletion, violence and aggression from the current partner, who takes part in human mate guarding behaviours (behaviours used to protect their mate from other potential males or females). 
However, the associated benefits include emotional support that may not be received from a current partner, and access to &#x27;good genes&#x27;, such as facial symmetry. The associated benefits also include increased sexual variety, access to physically attractive mates, and non-committal copulations.

Evolutionarily speaking, we are descended from our reproductively-successful ancestors who managed to solve the adaptive problem of finding a mate with the required characteristics needed at that time in their lives, e.g., plenty of resources, physical attractiveness, and showing signs of honest fertility. Therefore, our ancestors would have deployed this tactic (for enticing a suitable mate), which remains in our psychology. Some evolved poaching behaviours may not be suitable for current environmental problems. Leftover by-products from human evolution, such as preferences for fat and sugar, are not adaptive in western cultures at present, and thus similar poaching behaviours could still remain.

=== Short term ===
==== In males ====
Short-term strategies involved in seduction are associated with the dark triad, however predominantly in males. Short-term strategies are those used by an individual to obtain a mate for a short term sexual encounter. 
The dark triad is made up of three personality traits, psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism and was proposed by Paulhus and Williams (2002). The three traits are exploitative in nature and are used for sexually coercive behaviours, useful in the seduction process. Typically these three traits are deemed maladaptive for the individual and society. Nevertheless, these traits have been found to be adaptive in an exploitative strategy in short term mating. Dark triad traits are adaptive for an unrestricted sociosexuality and promiscuous behaviours. The three traits are associated with impulsivity, manipulative behaviours and lack of empathy. These personality traits would be useful in seducing a partner for a short term encounter. From an evolutionary perspective, these would have been particularly beneficial to our ancestral males who wanted to increase their reproductive success, through seducing many women and therefore increasing their chance of passing on their genes. These particular traits may be used as a tactic for increasing success in mating.

The dark triad traits are seen more in males where the parental investment is lower. Having numerous copulations with many women increases the likelihood their genes will be passed on. Comparatively, a woman has to invest time and a lot of energy in carrying an infant and looking after him/her for many years subsequently.

==== In females ====
The triad of traits ancestrally would not have been adaptive for women, because females were and still are less likely or less willing to engage in casual sex, because of the lack of certainty of resources to provide for her and her offspring.

Additionally, there are other potential considerations of the implication of short-term strategies. Males cannot employ such strategies without there being willing females to engage in sexual intercourse within a short-term relationship with them. Therefore, benefits from engaging in multiple short-term mating must also exist for females. These matings enable females to practice and enhance their skills, specifically within attraction and seduction. This often occurs during extra-pair mating when females have sexual intercourse with males other than their husband. There are potential benefits for females to engage in these matings, including the ability to acquire more resources. For example, females are better able to access meats, goods or services in exchange for sexual intercourse or if she were to give birth to a child whose father has better genes than her husband. Females use these short-term matings to hone their mating and seduction skills and increase their protection. This is because males often provide increased protection against other males exploitation or from non-humans for the females they mate with and their offspring. However, this willingness to make the first move towards seduction and engage in a sexual relationship may be subtle. For example, females may simply stand close to their target.

Improving attraction and seduction skills can also help a female with acquiring a better or more desirable male according to the &#x27;Mate Switching Hypothesis&#x27;. This is because, females are able to assess their potential mate before committing to a long-term relationship. Alternatively, according to this hypothesis females are also able to get rid of an unwanted husband through mate expulsion using short-term strategies, such as by seducing another man into a short-term sexual relationship. Females may also be more equipped at deterring male partners from future infidelity, demonstrated by the &#x27;Mate Manipulation Hypothesis&#x27;. This hypothesis suggests that females are able to use revenge to deter future infidelity. This can be achieved by a female partaking in a short-term affair, incorporating the use of seduction, with another male as a revenge tactic for her husband&#x27;s previous affair, which aims to increase commitment of her intended long-term mate. These hypotheses indicate the benefits for females of developing and expanding on their seduction skills within sexual relationships.

=== Long term ===
&#x27;Strategies are defined as evolved solutions to adaptive problems&#x27;. Men and women differ in the adaptive problems that they face, and therefore deploy different strategies. Women strongly desire the resources and commitment that comes with paternal parental investment and therefore impose a longer period of time for courtship and use of seduction prior to engaging in a long-term sexual relationship. Women also spend time seeking and seducing men that are willing to invest and commit in the long run. It is likely that exploitative strategies will not be used when seducing a long-term partner. The traits associated within the dark triad (Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism) are not useful for long term mating strategies because they are negatively correlated with agreeableness, empathy and reciprocation, which are traits promoting a healthy relationship.

== Biosocial theory ==
Kenrick and Trost (1987) have formulated a Biosocial theory of heterosexual relationships which encompasses several stages of seduction. This includes five stages of natural progression:
# Individuals identify a potential partner based on desired characteristics such as physical attraction
# Both individuals establish contact
# Other traits of the individual that are not necessarily explicit are analysed to determine fitness
# A physical relationship is established
# The relationship is either successful and progresses or discontinued

Within these stages, both individuals are interacting in a game which is never explicit, this is because if either individual were to be rejected this would damage their self-esteem. Therefore, when seducing, the overarching aims and goals are never vocalised to the other desired individual. This is sometimes referred to as paradoxical exhibition.

The main goal of seduction whether it is active under conscious or unconscious mechanisms is to impress the desired partner and display positive characteristics that are likely to be attractive, and to repress undesirable characteristics.

=== Non-verbal communication ===
Within the interactive seduction game, non-verbal communication is a prominent feature in accessing the desirable potential mate. The purpose of this communication is to reduce the interpersonal distance between the desired individuals.

Physiological features such as pupil dilation are a salient cue, expressing attraction. Leading on from this, eye contact is a very notable sign of attraction. Although there are cross cultural differences in whether eye contact is used or not, in Western cultures, the duration of eye contact and the exchange between two individuals is important in the first stages of the biosocial model.
Another non-verbal cue in the process of seduction are facial expressions. Smiling is considered another prominent feature in seduction, as it signifies willingness to engage in a social interaction, and in the case of seduction, to participate in creating an intimate bond. These non-verbal behaviours become synchronised between the two individuals which can then lead to the last two stages of the biosocial model.

=== Paralingual features ===
Paralingual features are those associated with the voice, such as pitch, tone and rhythm. These features of verbal communication change in different stages of the seduction process. Studies have shown that when initiating an interaction with a female, the seductive characteristics of the voice will begin with slightly higher pitch and increased articulation in the first meeting. However, whilst seducing, the paralanguage will alter gradually. His voice will eventually become softer with lower pitch and modulated voice. These characteristics of the voice are akin to those adults use when speaking to children, in infant directed speech. This is vocal exhibition, which has been found mostly in males. The aim of modulating the voice is to attract the desired female and become intimate.

==Contemporary law==

English common law defined the crime of seduction as a felony committed &quot;when a male person induced an unmarried female of previously chaste character to engage in an act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage.&quot; A father had the right to maintain an action for the seduction of his daughter (or the enticement of a son who left home), since this deprived him of services or earnings.

In more modern times, Frank Sinatra was charged in New Jersey in 1938 with seduction, having enticed a woman &quot;of good repute to engage in sexual intercourse with him upon his promise of marriage. The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the woman was already married.&quot;

Seduction is also associated with organized crime, particularly with the Italian-American Mafia, Russian mafia, Polish mob, and to a lesser extent, the Irish mob and Jewish mob. They often use attractive women from their gang in order to bribe, get money from, or damage the careers of male politicians, police officers, or government agents, as well as members of the general public.

<text>The 2003–04 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Barclaycard]] Premiership) was the 12th season of the Premier League. Arsenal were crowned champions ending the season without a single defeat – the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season. Chelsea finished second to Arsenal.

==Season summary==

Having qualified for the Champions League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a £100 million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner Roman Abramovich. Manchester United&#x27;s attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the midfield was weakened following the £25 million pre-season sale of David Beckham to Real Madrid, and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after Rio Ferdinand was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the &quot;failure or refusal to take a drugs test&quot;. The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand&#x27;s club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine. City themselves had just moved from Maine Road to the City of Manchester Stadium.

Arsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 2003 close season, but French striker Thierry Henry was instrumental in Arsenal&#x27;s success. Away from the Premier League, Arsène Wenger&#x27;s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions; they were knocked-out by League Cup eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals, lost their grip on the FA Cup (which they held for two consecutive seasons) after being defeated by eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-finals, and were knocked out of the Champions League quarter-finals by Chelsea 3–2 on aggregate. These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal easily defeated Liverpool only days later.

In the end, Wenger led the North-London club to a first undefeated season, solidifying his managerial legacy and longevity to the Arsenal fanbase as they finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats, and 90 points, winning the title with an 11-point margin over Claudio Ranieri&#x27;s Chelsea. Thierry Henry proved decisive in the critical moments, inspiring comebacks against close rivals Liverpool and Chelsea, including a hat-trick to seal a 4-2 win having been 2-1 down.

The relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. Wolves and Leicester City followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. For Leicester City, they would not return to the top flight for another 10 years and became the league champions for the first time ever in their history just a season later, whilst Wolves were promoted back to the top flight in 2009 and slipped down again 3 years later. The other relegation place went to Leeds United, whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after David O&#x27;Leary was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football – just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals - and they would not return for another 16 years, during which time they suffered a further relegation to the third tier in 2007 and came close towards going out of business in the process.

In his third season as Middlesbrough manager, Steve McClaren guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy – sealed with a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided Aston Villa to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition – they would be competing in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Portsmouth, Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, returning to the top flight after an absence of fifteen, one and nineteen years respectively. This was also both Portsmouth&#x27;s and Wolverhampton Wanderers&#x27; first season in the Premier League. They replaced West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland, who were relegated to the First Division after spending time in the top flight for ten, one and four years respectively.

<doc id="231676" wikidata="Q2160801" url="?curid=231676" title="Skirt">
<text>A skirt is the lower part of a dress or a separate outer garment that covers a person from the waist downwards.

At its simplest, a skirt can be a draped garment made out of a single piece of fabric (such as pareos). However, most skirts are fitted to the body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with the fullness introduced by means of darts, gores, pleats, or panels. Modern skirts are usually made of light to mid-weight fabrics, such as denim, jersey, worsted, or poplin. Skirts of thin or clingy fabrics are often worn with slips to make the material of the skirt drape better and for modesty.

In modern times, skirts are very commonly worn by women and girls. Some exceptions include the izaar, worn by many Muslim cultures, and the kilt, a traditional men&#x27;s garment in Scotland, Ireland, and sometimes England.

The hemline of skirts can vary from micro to floor-length and can vary according to cultural conceptions of modesty and aesthetics as well as the wearer&#x27;s personal taste, which can be influenced by such factors as fashion and social context. Most skirts are complete garments, but some skirt-looking panels may be part of another garment such as leggings, shorts, and swimsuits.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and ancient history ===

Skirts have been worn since prehistoric times as the simplest way to cover the lower body. Figurines produced by the Vinča culture (–4500 BC) located on the territory of present-day Serbia and neighboring Balkans from the start of the Copper Age show women in skirt-like garments.

A straw-woven skirt dating to 3900 BC was discovered in Armenia at the Areni-1 cave. Skirts were the standard attire for men and women in all ancient cultures in the Near East and Egypt. The Sumerians in Mesopotamia wore kaunakes (, ultimately from ), a type of fur skirt tied to a belt. The term originally referred to a sheep&#x27;s fleece, but eventually came to be applied to the garment itself. Eventually, the animal pelts were replaced by &quot;kaunakes cloth&quot;, a textile that imitated fleecy sheepskin. Kaunakes cloth also served as a symbol in religious iconography, such as in the fleecy cloak of John the Baptist.

Ancient Egyptian garments were mainly made of linen. For the upper classes, they were beautifully woven and intricately pleated. Around 2130 BC, during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, men wore wraparound skirts (kilts) known as the shendyt. They were made of a rectangular piece of cloth wrapped around the lower body and tied in front. By the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, longer skirts, reaching from the waist to ankles and sometimes hanging from the armpits, became fashionable. During the New Kingdom of Egypt, kilts with a pleated triangular section became fashionable for men. Beneath these, a shente, or triangular loincloth whose ends were fastened with cord ties, were worn.

During the Bronze Age, in the Southern parts of Western and Central Europe, wraparound dress-like garments were preferred. However, in Northern Europe, people also wore skirts and blouses.

=== Early modern history ===

In the Middle Ages, men and women preferred dress-like garments. The lower part of men&#x27;s dresses were much shorter in length compared to those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated or gored so that horse riding was more comfortable. Even a knight&#x27;s armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate. Technological advances in weaving in the 13th–15th century, like foot-treadle floor looms and scissors with pivoted blades and handles, improved tailoring trousers and tights. They became fashionable for men and henceforth became standard male attire whilst becoming taboo for women.

One of the earliest known cultures to have females wear clothing resembling miniskirts were the Duan Qun Miao (), which literally means &quot;Short Skirt Miao&quot;. This was in reference to the short miniskirts &quot;that barely cover the buttocks&quot; worn by women of the tribe, and which were probably shocking to observers in premodern and early modern times.

In the Middle Ages, some upper-class women wore skirts over three meters in diameter at the bottom. At the other extreme, the miniskirts of the 1960s were minimal garments that may have barely covered the underwear when the woman was seated. Costume historians typically use the word &quot;petticoat&quot; to describe skirt-like garments of the 18th century or earlier.

=== 19th century ===

During the 19th century, the cut of women&#x27;s dresses in western culture varied more widely than in any other century. Waistlines started just below the bust (the Empire silhouette) and gradually sank to the natural waist. Skirts started fairly narrow and increased dramatically to the hoopskirt and crinoline-supported styles of the 1860s; then fullness was draped and drawn to the back by means of bustles. In the 1890s, the rainy daisy skirt was introduced for walking or sportswear. It had a significantly shorter hemline measuring as much as six inches off the ground and would eventually influence the wider introduction of shorter hemlines in the early 20th century.

In the 19th century, in the United States and United Kingdom, there was a movement against skirts as part of the Victorian dress reform movement, and in the United States, the National Dress Reform Association. There was also the invention of different ways to wear skirts. For example, in 1851, early women&#x27;s rights advocate Elizabeth Smith Miller introduced Amelia Bloomer to a garment initially known as the &quot;Turkish dress&quot;, which featured a knee-length skirt over Turkish-style pantaloons. Bloomer came to advocate and promote the dress, including instructions for making it, in &quot;The Lily&quot;, a newspaper dedicated to the &quot;Emancipation of Woman from Intemperance, Injustice, Prejudice, and Bigotry&quot;. This inspired a craze for the dress, which came to be known as bloomers. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, other early advocates for women&#x27;s rights, also adopted this style of dress in the 1850s, referring to it as the &quot;freedom dress&quot;. Concurrently, some female labourers, notably the pit brow women working at coal pits in the Wigan area, began wearing trousers beneath a short skirt as a practical component of their uniform. This attracted the attention of the public, and various photographers produced records of the women&#x27;s unconventional manner of dress through the mid to late 19th century.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

Fashion designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood, Kenzo and Marc Jacobs have also shown men&#x27;s skirts. Transgressing social codes, Gaultier frequently introduces the skirt into his men&#x27;s wear collections as a means of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong seen on David Beckham.

== Male wear ==

There are a number of garments marketed to men which fall under the category of &quot;skirt&quot; or &quot;dress&quot;. These go by a variety of names and form part of the traditional dress for men from various cultures. Usage varies – the dhoti is part of everyday dress on the Indian subcontinent while the kilt is more usually restricted to occasional wear and the fustanella is used almost exclusively as costume. Robes, which are a type of dress for men, have existed in many cultures, including the Japanese kimono, the Chinese cheongsam, the Arabic thobe, and the African Senegalese kaftan. Robes are also used in some religious orders, such as the cassock in Christianity and various robes and cloaks that may be used in pagan rituals. Examples of men&#x27;s skirts and skirt-like garments from various cultures include:

* The fustanella is a full-pleated skirt worn by men in Albania and Greece and other parts of the Balkans. By the mid-20th century, it was relegated to ceremonial use and as period or traditional costume. It is worn by the Evzones, or Evzoni (Greek: Εύζωνες, Εύζωνοι, pronounced [evˈzones, evˈzoni]), which is the name of several historical elite light infantry and mountain units of the Greek Army. Today, it refers to the members of the Presidential Guard who parade the presidential mansion wearing a short version of this historic costume. 
* The gho is a knee-length robe worn by men in Bhutan. They are required to wear it every day as part of national dress in government offices, in schools and on formal occasions.
* The hakama is worn in Japan. There are two types of hakama, divided umanori (馬乗り, &quot;horse-riding hakama&quot;) and undivided andon hakama (行灯袴, &quot;lantern hakama&quot;). The umanori type has wide and divided legs, similar to culottes. Some hakamas are pleated.
* The kilt is a skirt of Gaelic and Celtic history, part of the Scottish national dress in particular, and is worn formally and to a lesser extent informally. Irish and Welsh kilts also exist but are not so much a part of national identity.
* The sarong is a piece of cloth that may be wrapped around the waist to form a skirt-like garment. Sarongs exist in various cultures under various names, including the pareo and lavalava of the Hawaiian islands and Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, and Fiji), the Indian dhoti and lungi, and the South Indian and Maldivian mundu.

Aside from the wearing of kilts, in the Western world skirts, dresses, and similar garments are generally viewed exclusively as women&#x27;s clothing which, historically, was not always the case. However, some Western men have taken up skirts as forms of civil protest. Other Western men advocate skirts as a measure of co-equality between women and men.

== Norms and policies ==
The skirt is a part of uniforms for girls in many schools around the world, with lengths varying depending on local culture. The pleated tartan skirt began as a component of girls&#x27; school uniforms in the early twentieth century in the United Kingdom. Most UK schools now allow girls to wear trousers, but many girls still wear skirts in primary and secondary schools, even where the choice of trousers is given. In the late 20th and early 21st century, many schools began changing their uniform rules to allow trousers for girls amidst opposition to skirts-only policies - the most publicised possibly being Jo Hale vs Whickham Comprehensive in 2000. Although it is commonly accepted that girls may wear trousers to school, no test case is known to have been brought before the courts, making the legal position uncertain on requiring skirts as part of girls&#x27; uniforms. The rule is still enforced in many schools, particularly independent and selective state schools. In fact, United Kingdom government guidelines expressly state the decision of allowing girls to wear trousers is with individual schools.

In the 1980s in Puerto Rico, Ana Irma Rivera Lassén was not allowed to enter court in trousers and was told to wear a skirt. She sued the judge and won.

In 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled against the Charter Day School in North Carolina, which had required girls to wear skirts due to the idea that girls are &quot;fragile vessels&quot; deserving &quot;gentle&quot; treatment from boys. The court ruled the requirement was unconstitutional.

Since 2004, the International Skating Union has allowed women to wear trousers instead of skirts in competition if they wish.

== Dancing ==

Many forms of dancing require women to wear skirts or dresses, either by convention or competition rules. In Scottish highland dancing, for example, women wear the Aboyne dress, which actually involves a skirt, for the national dances, and wear a kilt-based outfit for the Highland dances.

<text>The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU; ) is a public research university in Norway and the largest in terms of enrollment. The university&#x27;s headquarters is located in Trondheim, with regional campuses in Gjøvik and Ålesund.

NTNU was inaugurated by the King-in-Council in 1996 as a result of the merger of the former University of Trondheim and other university-level institutions, with roots dating back to 1760. Later, some former university colleges were also incorporated. Depending on the ranking publication, the university typically ranks within a range of 101 and 400 globally. As of November 2022, the university boasts an approximate 9,000 employees and 42,000 students.

NTNU has the main national responsibility for education and research in engineering and technology. This is likely attributable to the fact that it is the successor of Norway&#x27;s pre-eminent engineering university, the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) which was established by Parliament in 1910 as Norway&#x27;s national engineering university. In addition to engineering and natural sciences, the university offers higher education in other academic disciplines ranging from medicine, psychology, social sciences, the arts, teacher education, architecture and fine art. The university&#x27;s academics include three Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine: Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser and John O&#x27;Keefe.

==History==

NTNU is a young institution with a long history. The university, in its current form, was established in 1996 by the merger of six research and higher education institutions in Trondheim, as follows:

* Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), established in 1910 
* Museum of Natural History and Archaeology (VM), established in 1767
* Norwegian College of General Sciences (AVH), established in 1922
* Faculty of Medicine (DMF), established in 1975
* Trondheim Academy of Fine Art (KiT), established in 1987
* Trondheim Conservatory of Music, established in 1973

Prior to the merger, NTH, NLHT, DMF, and VM together constituted the &quot;University of Trondheim&quot;, which was a much looser organization. However, the university&#x27;s root goes back to 1760, with the foundation of &quot;Det Trondhiemske Selskab (Trondheim Academy)&quot;, which in 1767 became the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.

The engineering education in Trondheim began with &quot;Trondhjems Tekniske Læreanstalt (Trondheim Technical College)&quot; in 1870, and in 1910, Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) opened officially. In 2010, NTNU celebrated the 250th anniversary of Trondheim Academy. NTNU also celebrated the 100th anniversary of NTH in the same year. The centennial was also celebrated by the publication of several books, among them a history of the university, entitled &quot;Turbulens og tankekraft. Historien om NTNU&quot; which translates as &quot;Turbulence and mindpower: The history of NTNU&quot;.

===1700s===
Det Trondhiemske Selskab (Trondheim Academy), Norway&#x27;s first academic society, was founded in 1760. In 1767, it changed its name to the Royal Norwegian Society of Science and Letters (DKNVS) upon receiving recognition from the Danish-Norwegian king. DKNVS library – today known as NTNU Gunnerus Library – was founded in 1768, and is Norway&#x27;s oldest library.

===1800s===
First proposal for a Norwegian Polytechnical Institute was made in 1833. &quot;Trondhjems Tekniske Læreanstalt (Trondheim Technical College)&quot; or &quot;TTL&quot; was founded in 1870. The newly formed school educated engineers of various fields. In 1898, TTL moved to a larger building in Munkegata. TTL was disbanded in the 1900s, giving a way to a Norwegian Institute of Technology.

===1900–1968===
In 1900, the Norwegian Parliament passed a resolution supporting the establishment of &quot;Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH)&quot; in Trondheim. NTH was officially opened on 15 September 1910. Five academical departments were originally present in the parliament&#x27;s resolution of 31 May 1900, such as Architecture and Urban Planning, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering (a. General and b. Naval, i.e. ship and ship engine construction), Electrical engineering, and Chemistry (a. General and b. Electro-chemistry).

In 1922, &quot;Norwegian College of Teaching in Trondheim (NLHT)&quot; opened at Lade gård.

In 1950, &quot;Stiftelsen for industriell og teknisk forskning (Industrial and Technical Research Centre)&quot; or SINTEF was founded as part of NTH and as its link to Norwegian industry.

===1968–1996===
The &quot;University of Trondheim (UNiT)&quot; was established in 1968, and the Department of Medicine (later the Faculty of Medicine) was established as part of UNiT in 1974. It was designed by the architect Henning Larsen. In 1984, NLHT also absorbed the &quot;Norwegian College of General Sciences (AVH)&quot; as part of UNiT.

===1996–2016===
On 1 January 1996, the University of Trondheim became the &quot;Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)&quot;. As early as 1989, NTH Rector Karsten Jakobsen had broached the idea of a Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. On 21 March 1995 the Parliament, with barely a majority after a long debate, decided to establish NTNU in Trondheim. In 2012 the popular trivia game Kahoot was founded in by Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker and Morten Versvik in a joint project with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. They teamed up with Professor Alf Inge Wang and were later joined by Norwegian entrepreneur Åsmund Furuseth.

===2016–present===

In 2014, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research asked the country&#x27;s universities and university colleges to provide suggestions, observations, and ideas for rebuilding Norway&#x27;s institutions of higher education. The context of the request was that the Norwegian government wanted to cut back on the number of institutions in the sector.

The NTNU board decided on 28 January 2015 to merge NTNU with the University Colleges of Sør-Trøndelag, Ålesund and Gjøvik to form a new university that would retain the university&#x27;s current name, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The merger, which went into effect in January 2016, made NTNU Norway&#x27;s largest single university.

==Campus==

NTNU has several campuses in Trondheim; Gløshaugen – for engineering and natural sciences – and Dragvoll – for humanities and social sciences – are the main two campuses. Other campuses include Tyholt for marine technology, Øya for medicine, Kalvskinnet for archaeology, Midtbyen for the music conservatory and Nedre Elvehavn for the art academy. 
NTNU Gløshaugen is an artistic combination of historical NTH buildings and modern buildings. Combined, the campuses span a total area of 734,000 m2.

In addition to NTNU, the following research institutes are located at Gløshaugen, and cooperate closely with NTNU in several areas of research and development:

SINTEF, since its establishment in 1950, has its main departments at Gløshaugen. SINTEF was originally founded by NTH, but since 1980 has been an independent research institute.

In 1998, the Paper and Fibre Research Institute (PFI), an independent research institute, moved into a new building at Gløshaugen, relocating from Gaustad in Oslo.

In April 2013, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) moved into a new building south of the Natural Science building. NINA often works closely with SINTEF and NTNU.

NTNU has long considered the possibility of bringing the two largest campuses together at or near NTNU&#x27;s Gløshaugen campus. In 2013, the Rector initiated a vision project and charged it with defining different perspectives on future development in a 50-year perspective. The same year, 2013, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research initiated a &quot;choice of concept study&quot; for the future co-localization of NTNU&#x27;s two main campuses in Trondheim. The reports were presented in 2014, and both recommended bringing Dragvoll and Gløshaugen together, and better integrating them with the city. A unanimous NTNU board endorsed the recommendations in the vision report.

===Merger===
On 1 January 2016, the merger between NTNU and the university colleges in Gjøvik, Ålesund, and Sør-Trøndelag officially entered into force, and NTNU consequently had campuses in Ålesund and Gjøvik, as well as in Trondheim. 2016 was also a transitional year in terms of NTNU&#x27;s leadership. On 24 November 2015 the new Board met for the first time. It was then extended to include board members from each of the three former university colleges and an external representative appointed by the Ministry of Education.

==Organization==

NTNU is governed by a board of 11 members, in accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Norwegian Act relating to universities and university colleges&quot;. Two of the members are elected by and from the students.

NTNU&#x27;s overall budget in 2017 was 8.19 billion NOK, most of which came from the Norwegian Ministry of Education.

As a result of the university merger in 2016, the number of NTNU faculties increased from seven to nine – including the University Museum – with approximately 39,000 students and approximately 2,500 PhD students. The eight NTNU faculties are organized in 55 departments:

==Research==


NTNU&#x27;s history of research in engineering goes back to the early 20th century, when Norway&#x27;s first electric railway, known as Thamshavn Line, was developed and constructed in Trondheim as an AC-powered tramway, with Trondheim-based technologies. The tramway was launched in 1908 and remained in operation until 1974.

Now, research is part of the ongoing activities at NTNU faculties as well as the University Museum. The university has 4377 scientific staff who conduct research in more than 120 laboratories, and are at any time running more than 2,000 research projects. Students and staff can take advantage of roughly 300 research agreements or exchange programs with 58 institutions worldwide.

NTNU has identified four Strategic Research Areas for 2014–2023: NTNU Energy, NTNU Health, NTNU Oceans and NTNU Sustainability, which were chosen on the basis of social relevance, professional quality and the potential for interdisciplinary cooperation.

===Research centres===

The university hosts six National Centres of Excellence (SFF), 12 Centres for Research-based Innovation (SFI), and three Centres for Environment-friendly Energy Research (FME), which are mainly funded by The Research Council of Norway. NTNU is also a partner in several centres with SINTEF.

The Trøndelag Health Study, with the HUNT Research Centre and HUNT Biobank located in Levanger, is organized under the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.

===Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience===
The fifteenth Kavli Institute was inaugurated at NTNU in 2007, as the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, which was the fourth Kavli Institute in neuroscience in the world and the first Kavli Institute in Northern Europe. In 2012, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg opened the Norwegian Brain Centre as an outgrowth of NTNU&#x27;s Kavli Institute. It is one of the largest research laboratories of its kind in the world.

===Enabling technologies===
NTNU has funded the fundamental long-term research and infrastructure through three Enabling Technologies such as NTNU Biotechnology, NTNU Digital and Nano@NTNU.

===Research excellence===
NTNU Research Excellence is an initiative to develop elite researchers and research groups in international class, which was launched in 2013, and includes established and new initiatives. The established initiatives are financed by the Research Council of Norway, the EU, and private-sectors (R&amp;D), while the new initiatives are funded by NTNU&#x27;s own funds in light of strategic prioritization of NTNU&#x27;s resources. These cover a number of research funding schemes including Outstanding Academic Fellows Programme, Onsager Fellowship Programme, K.G. Jebsen Centres, EU projects, and ERC grants. NTNU participates in about 218 projects in the EU Horizon 2020 Framework Program.

==Publishing==
To increase Open Access publishing, NTNU has established a publishing fund.

In 2008 NTNU&#x27;s digital institutional repository was founded. The intention was to establish a full-text archive for the documentation of the scientific output of the institution and to make as much as possible of the material available online, both nationally and internationally.

In addition to the research articles and books, intended for academics and researchers both inside and outside the university, NTNU disseminates news to the public about the institution and its research and results.

&quot;Universitetsavisa&quot;, which translates to &quot;The University Newspaper&quot;, is the news and discussion paper of the university, available only in Norwegian. It was established in 1991. For a period it existed in both printed and digital editions, but since 2002 it is only available online.

&quot;GEMINI&quot; publishes research news from NTNU and the independent research group SINTEF in both English and Norwegian. It is published in both a printed and a digital version.

The Norwegian University of Science and Technology publishes the &quot;Nordic Journal of Science and Technology&quot;.

In addition to semester fees, the international students have to guarantee their living expenses if they are not offered a scholarship.

NTNU students have a clear presence in the city of Trondheim. The most famous student organization is the Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem, also known as &quot;the red round house&quot; after its architectural form; every other year it organizes a cultural festival UKA. Another festival organized by students is the International Student Festival in Trondheim ISFiT, which awards a student peace prize and draws internationally known speakers. EMECS-thon is a student driven embedded systems marathon competition, organized by students from NTNU and implemented in some of the top universities worldwide, where participants have 48 hours to develop an embedded project from scratch. The student sports organization, NTNUI, has roughly 10 000 members in its many branches, with the largest groups including orienteering, cross-country and telemark skiing, but there are also groups for sports less common in Norway, like American football, lacrosse and aikido. A cabin and cottage organization owns several cabins in the countryside, available for students wishing to spend a few days away. There are also student fraternities, some of which conduct voluntary hazing rituals, which provide contact with potential employers and for social interaction between students. There are also alumni associations; religious and political organizations; clubs devoted to various topics such as innovation, human rights, beer, oatmeal, anime and computers; and The Association for Various Associations, which is a parody of the university&#x27;s large number of student organizations. University recently started to offer &quot;roof over your head&quot; guarantee to the new coming student to Trondheim until they find proper housing.

NTNU is a pioneer with of the concept of &quot;Student Cabins&quot;, the NTNUI offers its students access to cabins on the outskirts of the city of Trondheim in which they can enjoy on vacations and weekends. In 2024 the number of cabins is 23 cabins that can be rented.
