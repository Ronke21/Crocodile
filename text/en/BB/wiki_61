<text>The Northwest Territory, also known as the Old Northwest and formally known as the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio, was formed from unorganized western territory of the United States after the American Revolution. Established in 1787 by the Congress of the Confederation through the Northwest Ordinance, it was the nation&#x27;s first post-colonial organized incorporated territory.

At the time of its creation, the territory included all the land west of Pennsylvania, northwest of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River below the Great Lakes, and what later became known as the Boundary Waters. The region was ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Throughout the Revolutionary War, the region was part of the British Province of Quebec and the western theater of the war. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual U.S. states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the northeastern part of Minnesota). Reduced to present-day Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of Indiana Territory July 4, 1800, it ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Ohio, and the remainder attached to Indiana Territory.
Initially, the territory was governed by martial law under a governor and three judges. As population increased, a legislature was formed as were a succession of counties, eventually totaling thirteen. At the time of its creation, the land within the territory was largely undisturbed by urban development. It was also home to several Native American cultures, including the Delaware, Miami, Potawatomi, Shawnee, and others. There were a handful of French colonial settlements remaining, plus Clarksville at the Falls of the Ohio. By the time of the territory&#x27;s dissolution, there were dozens of towns and settlements, a few with thousands of settlers, chiefly along the Ohio and Miami Rivers and the south shore of Lake Erie in Ohio. Conflicts between settlers and Native American inhabitants of the Territory resulted in the Northwest Indian War culminating in General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne&#x27;s victory at Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The subsequent Treaty of Greenville in 1795 opened the way for settlement particularly in southern and western Ohio.

==Area==
The Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of Pennsylvania, east of the Mississippi River, and northwest of the Ohio River. It incorporated most of the former Ohio Country except a portion in western Pennsylvania, and eastern Illinois Country. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota.

Lands west of the Mississippi River were the Louisiana Province of New Spain, formerly New France, acquired by the United States in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase. Lands north of the Great Lakes were part of the British Province of Upper Canada. Lands south of the Ohio River constituted Kentucky County, Virginia, admitted to the union as the state of Kentucky in 1792. The area included more than and comprised about 1/3 of the land area of the United States at the time of its creation.

It was inhabited by about 45,000 Native Americans and 4,000 non-native traders, mostly of French Canadian, British or Irish descent. Among the tribes inhabiting the region were the Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, Wyandot, Ojibwa, Ottawa and Potawatomi. Notably, the Miami tribal capital along with British trading posts was at Kekionga, at the site of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana. Neutralizing Kekionga became the focus of the Northwest Indian War, the driving events in the early evolution of the territory.

==History==

Integration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment of states&#x27; claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Native Americans. These objectives were accomplished correspondingly by the American Revolutionary War, provisions in the Articles of Confederation, and various treaties preceding the Northwest Indian War including Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784) and Treaty of Fort McIntosh (1785). The treaty process extended well beyond the War and existence of the Territory as a political entity.

===New France===
European exploration of the region began with French-Canadian voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer Jean Nicolet was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of Green Bay, Wisconsin (although Étienne Brûlé is stated by some sources as having explored Lake Superior and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as New France; among these was the post at Fort Detroit, founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain as part of the Indian Reserve in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, after being defeated in the French and Indian War.

===British control===
From the 1750s to the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812, the British had a long-standing goal of creating an Indian barrier state, a large Native American state that would cover most of the Old Northwest. It would be independent of the United States and allied with the British, who would use it to block American westward expansion and to build up their control of the North American fur trade headquartered in Montreal.

A new colony, named Charlotina, was proposed for establishment in the southern Great Lakes region before the events of Pontiac&#x27;s War, after which the Crown issued the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited white colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, via the Quebec Act, Britain annexed the region to the Province of Quebec in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the American Revolution.

In February 1779, George Rogers Clark, leading a force of Virginia militia, captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes from British commander Henry Hamilton. Virginia capitalized on Clark&#x27;s success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest, calling it Illinois County, Virginia, until 1784, when it ceded its land claims to the federal government. Britain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War with the Treaty of Paris (1783), but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the War of 1812.

===Cessions by the states===

Several states (Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut) had competing claims on the territory: Virginia claimed all of the portion that was formerly Illinois Country and Ohio Country; Massachusetts claimed the portion that is now southern Michigan and Wisconsin; Connecticut claimed a narrow strip across the territory just south of the Great Lakes; New York claimed an elastic portion of Iroquois lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The western boundary of Pennsylvania was also ill-defined. Virginia&#x27;s jurisdiction was limited to a few French settlements at the extreme western edge of the territory. Massachusetts&#x27;s and Connecticut&#x27;s claims were effectively lines on paper. New York had no colonial settlements or territorial government in the claimed lands.

The western border of Pennsylvania, previously assumed to run in a north by northeast zigzag, was resolved in 1780 by the Continental Congress. The Mason–Dixon line was extended westward to a point five degrees of longitude (about 260 miles) from the Delaware River and the western boundary extended to run due north from the westernmost extent of the Mason–Dixon line to the 43rd parallel. This incorporated the eastern part of Ohio Country as western Pennsylvania, and set the eastern boundary of federal lands.

&quot;Unlanded&quot; states, such as Maryland, refused to ratify the Articles of Confederation so long as these states were allowed to keep their western territory, fearing that those states could continue to grow and tip the balance of power in their favor under the proposed system of federal government. As a concession to obtain ratification, these states ceded their claims on the territory to the federal government: New York in 1780, Virginia in 1784, and Massachusetts and Connecticut in 1785. So the majority of the territory became public land owned by the U.S. government. Virginia and Connecticut reserved two areas to use as compensation to military veterans: the Virginia Military District and the Connecticut Western Reserve

Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Land Ordinance of 1784 was the first organization of the territory by the United States; it provided a process for dividing the territory into individual states. The Land Ordinance of 1785 established a standardized system for surveying the land into saleable lots, although Ohio was partially surveyed several times using different methods, resulting in a patchwork of land surveys in Ohio. Some older French communities&#x27; property claims based on earlier systems of long, narrow lots also were retained. The rest of the Northwest Territory was divided into roughly uniform square townships and sections, which facilitated land sales and development. The ordinance also stipulated that the territory would eventually form three to five new states.

===Founding===
Under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which created the Northwest Territory, General St. Clair was appointed governor. When the territory was divided in 1800, he briefly served as governor of the Northwest Territory remnant that included Ohio, the eastern half of Michigan, and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called &quot;The Gore&quot;.

St. Clair formally established the government on July 15, 1788, at Marietta. In 1790, he renamed the settlement of Losantiville Cincinnati, after the Society of the Cincinnati, and moved the administrative and military center to Fort Washington.

As Governor, he formulated the Maxwell&#x27;s Code (named after its printer, William Maxwell), the first written criminal and civil laws of the territory. Maxwell&#x27;s Code consisted of thirty-seven different laws with the stipulation that the laws had to have been passed previously in one of the original thirteen states. The laws restructured the court system then in effect in the Northwest Territory. They also protected residents against excessive taxes and declared that English common law would be the basis of legal decisions and laws in the Northwest Territory.

===Northwest Indian War===


The young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking authority to tax under the Articles of Confederation, planned to raise revenue from the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory. This plan necessarily called for the removal of both Native American villages and squatters from lands west of Appalachia, loosely, the territory called &quot;Ohio Country&quot; and beyond. Resistance from indigenous tribes, who were supported by the continued British presence in the Northwest Territory, presented a continuing obstacle for American expansion.

The area making up the Ohio Country had been contested for over a century, beginning with the 17th-century Beaver Wars. The Western Confederacy, or &quot;Western Indian Confederacy&quot;, was a loose confederacy of Native Americans in the Great Lakes region of the United States created following the American Revolutionary War. Congress passed the Proclamation of 1783, which recognized Native American rights to the land. A council held in 1785 at Fort Detroit declared that the confederacy would deal jointly with the United States, forbade individual tribes from dealing directly with the United States, and declared the Ohio River as the boundary between their lands and those of the American settlers.

The Northwest Territory&#x27;s first governor, Arthur St. Clair, sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and thus clear the way for white settlement. In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Native Americans to sign the Treaty of Fort Harmar, but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Native Americans&#x27; claims, the treaty provoked an escalation of the &quot;Northwest Indian War&quot; (or &quot;Little Turtle&#x27;s War&quot;). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General Josiah Harmar, whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Native Americans in October 1790.

A group of squatters had moved up to the area near present-day Stockport now in Morgan County, Ohio and settled along flood plain, or &quot;bottom&quot; land, of the Muskingum River, some 30 miles north of an Ohio Company of Associates settlement at Marietta, Ohio. The Big Bottom massacre occurred on January 2, 1791. Lenape and Wyandot warriors stormed the incomplete blockhouse and killed eleven men, one woman, and two children. (Accounts vary as to the number of casualties.) Rufus Putnam wrote to President Washington that &quot;we shall be so reduced and discouraged as to give up the settlement [Marietta following the Big Bottom disaster].&quot;

In March 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as commander of the United States Army and was commissioned as a major general. He led a punitive expedition involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, Fort Jefferson (Ohio), was built under his direction. Located in present-day Darke County in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day Fort Recovery, his force advanced to the location of Native American settlements near the headwaters of the Wabash River.

On November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by Miami Chief Little Turtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, known as &quot;St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat&quot; and many other names. It remains the greatest defeat of a US army by Native Americans in history. About 623 American soldiers were killed in action, and about 50 Native Americans were killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.
After St. Clair&#x27;s defeat, In June 1792, President Washington tapped revolutionary war hero Major General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne to avenge St. Clair and assert sovereignty over the western frontier. Wayne was commissioned to form a new army of 5120 professional soldiers, dubbed the &quot;Legion of the United States&quot;. Wayne recruited and trained his army in Pennsylvania, and moved them to southwestern Ohio in fall of 1793.

There they were joined by the Kentucky Militia under Major General Charles Scott. Over the next ten months, the armies marched north up the Great Miami and Maumee River valleys toward the Miami capital of Kekionga. Along the way Wayne&#x27;s legion built a series of outpost forts including Fort Greene Ville, Fort Recovery and Fort Defiance. Fierce battles occurred around some of these but none of Wayne&#x27;s forts were ever taken by the Native Americans.
In mid 1794, the British constructed Fort Miamis near what is today Toledo, Ohio, to forestall Wayne&#x27;s putative advance on the British stronghold at Detroit. The final battle of Wayne&#x27;s campaign occurred within the scope of this fort. The military campaign of Gen. Wayne against the Western Confederacy, who were supported by a company of troops from Lower Canada, culminated with victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. Following the battle, in fall 1794, Wayne&#x27;s army marched unopposed to Kekionga where they constructed Fort Wayne, a defiant symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Native American Country.

Jay&#x27;s Treaty, in 1794, temporarily helped to smooth relations with British traders in the region, where British subjects outnumbered Americans throughout the 1790s. The following year, the Treaty of Greenville secured peace on the western frontier and opened most of southern and eastern Ohio for American settlement.

===Settlement===


Sporadic westward emigrant settlements had already resumed late in the war after the Iroquois Confederacy&#x27;s power was broken and the tribes scattered by the 1779 Sullivan Expedition. Soon after the Revolution ended, land-hungry migrants started moving west. A gateway trading post developed as the town of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, which was a key outfitting center west of the mountains. Other wagon roads, such as the Kittanning Path surmounting the gaps of the Allegheny in central Pennsylvania, or trails along the Mohawk River in New York, enabled a steady stream of settlers to reach the near west and the lands bordering the Mississippi.

This activity stimulated the development of the eastern parts of the eventual National Road by private investors. The Cumberland–Brownsville toll road linked the water routes of the Potomac River with the Monongahela River of the Ohio/Mississippi riverine systems in the days when water travel was the only good alternative to walking and riding. Most of the territory and its successors was settled by emigrants passing through the Cumberland Narrows, or along the Mohawk Valley in New York State.

The Continental Congress&#x27; title to the lands north of the Ohio River was derived from the Treaty of Paris (1783), the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, and the cessions of four states. Settlement was through several means: squatters, direct U.S. government land sales to settlers, sales of tracts of land to land companies, and state sales of land to veterans in the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve. The first area to be surveyed was the Seven Ranges along the eastern border of Ohio in 1786–1789. Direct sales of federal lands to individual homesteaders started here. In some cases, the government granted or donated land for special purposes.

Settlement followed the forts, whether garrisoned or not. Lack of a garrison meant that threat of Native American attack had become negligible. This was true everywhere in Ohio before 1800 except the northwest sector above the Greenville Treaty line. It became true in Indiana after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811; by 1813 Battle of the Thames where Tecumseh was defeated and killed, the frontier had essentially moved to west of the Mississippi. The first U.S. military garrisons in the territory were Fort Patrick Henry, Vincennes, Indiana (1779), Fort Clark at Falls of the Ohio, Indiana (1783), and Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785). The first settlements were at these locations.

The first land grant was to George Rogers Clark in 1781 at Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side; he went on to found the settlement of Clarksville. The first two land purchases were large tracts of land sold to John Symmes (Symmes Purchase) in 1788 and two tracts sold to Ohio Company in 1787 and 1792 (Purchase on the Muskingum). Settlement of these areas was spearheaded by Losantiville and Marietta, respectively. In 1792, Congress donated 100,000 acres to Ohio Company as a buffer zone against Native American incursion around the settled area. The vexing land claims by inhabitants of the old French Vincennes Tract were resolved by what was dubbed the &#x27;Vincennes donation lands&#x27; embodied in a federal land act of 1791. Federal land sales in Indiana (then a part of Indiana Territory starting in 1800) began in 1801, through the Cincinnati land office.

After the Revolutionary War ended, Rufus Putnam (the &quot;Father of Ohio&quot;) and Manasseh Cutler were instrumental in creating the Northwest Ordinance, which opened up the Northwest Territory for settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans. It was at Putnam&#x27;s recommendation that the land was surveyed and laid out in townships of six miles square. He organized and led the first group of veterans to the territory. They settled at Marietta, Ohio, where they built a large fort called Campus Martius.
 
Putnam and Cutler insisted the Northwest Territory be a free territory, with no slavery. The Northwest Territory doubled the size of the United States, and establishing it as free of slavery proved to be of tremendous importance in the following decades. It encompassed what became Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota.

Putnam, in the Puritan tradition, was influential in establishing education in the Northwest Territory. Substantial amounts of land were set aside for schools. Putnam had been one of the primary benefactors in the founding of Leicester Academy in Massachusetts, and similarly, in 1798, he created the plan for the construction of the Muskingum Academy (now Marietta College) in Ohio. In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, he was commissioned by President George Washington as Surveyor-General of United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory&#x27;s first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio.

In the 1800 United States census, following the passage of an organic act by the 6th U.S. Congress creating the Indiana Territory in 1800, seven counties in the Northwest Territory reported the following population counts:

According to the 1800 Census of the United States, the Northwest Territory (i.e. the pending state of Ohio) had a population, excluding Native Americans, of over 45,000, and Indiana Territory, a population of about 5,600. By the time of Ohio statehood, there were as many as 50 named towns in Northwest and Indiana Territories, a few, like Vincennes, with thousands of settlers, and dozens of unnamed settlements below the Treaty Line in Ohio.

Following settlement of the frontier, the great wave of colonial immigration flowed westward, founding the great cities of the eventual 6 states of the Territory which is now the midwestern United States early in the 19th century: Detroit (&lt;1800), Cleveland (1796), Columbus (1812), Indianapolis (1822), Chicago (1833), Milwaukee (1846), Minneapolis (1847).

===Statehood for Ohio===
A Federalist, St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the old Ohio Country to increase Federalist power in Congress. He was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for his apparent partisanship, high-handedness and arrogance in office. In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President Thomas Jefferson to remove him from office as territorial governor. He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of Ohio in 1803. The first Ohio Constitution provided for a weak governor and a strong legislature, in part a reaction to St. Clair&#x27;s method of governance.

In preparation for Ohio&#x27;s statehood, Congress split the Northwest Territory into two sections in 1800. A new territory, Indiana Territory, encompassed all land west of the present Indiana–Ohio border and its northward extension to Lake Superior, except for a wedge-shaped area of present-day Indiana in the southeast known as &quot;the gore&quot;. It, along with everything east of the new territory, remained part of the Northwest Territory.

This legislation was signed into law by President John Adams on May 7, 1800, and became effective on July 4. On April 30, 1802, Congress passed an enabling act for Ohio that authorized the residents of the eastern portion of the Northwest Territory to form a state constitution and government, and be admitted to the Union. When Ohio was admitted as the 17th state on March 1, 1803, the land not included in the new state, including the gore, became part of Indiana Territory, and the Northwest Territory went out of existence.

Ongoing disputes with the British over the region were a contributing factor to the War of 1812. Britain irrevocably ceded claim to the former Northwest Territory with the Treaty of Ghent in 1814.

==Northwest Ordinance==
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, and defined its boundaries, form of government, and administrative structure. In particular, it defined the bodies of government, established the legal basis of land ownership, provided for abolition and transfer of state territorial claims, made rules for admission of new states, established public education, recognized and codified &#x27;natural rights&#x27;, prohibited slavery, and defined the land rights and applicability of laws to the Native Americans.

===Law and government===
At first, the territory had a modified form of martial law. The governor was also the senior army officer within the territory, and he combined legislative and executive authority. But a supreme court was established, and he shared legislative powers with the court. County governments were organized as soon as the population was sufficient, and these assumed local administrative and judicial functions. Washington County was the first of these, at Marietta in 1788. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.

As soon as the number of free male settlers exceeded 5,000, the territorial legislature was to be created, and this happened in 1798. The full mechanisms of government were put in place, as outlined in the Northwest Ordinance. A bicameral legislature consisted of a House of Representatives and a Council. The first House had 22 representatives, apportioned by population of each county. The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members. The nominations were sent to the U.S. Congress, which appointed five of them as the council. This assembly became the legislature of the Territory, although the governor retained veto power.

Article VI of the Articles of Compact within the Northwest Ordinance prohibited the owning of slaves within the Northwest Territory. Territorial governments evaded this law by use of indenture laws. The Articles of Compact prohibited legal discrimination on the basis of religion within the territory.

The township formula created by Thomas Jefferson was first implemented in the Northwest Territory through the Land Ordinance of 1785. The square surveys of the Northwest Territory became a hallmark of the Midwest, as sections, townships, counties (and states) were laid out scientifically, and land was sold quickly and efficiently (although not without some speculative aberrations).

====Officials====
Arthur St. Clair was the territory&#x27;s governor until November 1802, when President Thomas Jefferson removed him from office and appointed Charles Willing Byrd, who served the position until Ohio became a state and elected its first governor, Edward Tiffin, on March 3, 1803. The Supreme Court consisted of (1) John Cleves Symmes; (2) James Mitchell Varnum, who died in 1789, replaced by George Turner, who resigned in 1796, and was replaced by Return Jonathan Meigs Jr.; and (3) Samuel Holden Parsons, who died in 1789, replaced by Rufus Putnam, who resigned 1796, and was replaced by Joseph Gilman. There were three secretaries: Winthrop Sargent (July 9, 1788 – May 31, 1798); William Henry Harrison (June 29, 1798 – December 31, 1799); and Charles Willing Byrd (January 1, 1800 – March 1, 1803).

The territory&#x27;s first common pleas court opened at Marietta on September 2, 1788. Its first judges were General Rufus Putnam, General Benjamin Tupper, and Colonel Archibald Crary. Ebenezer Sproat was the first sheriff, Paul Fearing became the first attorney to practice in the territory, and Colonel William Stacy was foreman of the first grand jury. Griffin Greene was appointed justice of the peace.

====Legislature====
Once the population of free men living within the territory rose to 5000, the federal government allowed residents to elect a legislature. The legislature, or General Assembly, consisted of two houses, a Legislative Council (five members chosen by Congress) and a House of Representatives consisting of 22 members elected by the male freeholders in nine counties. The first session of the legislature was held in September 1799. Its first important task was to select a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress. Locked in a power struggle with Governor St. Clair, the legislature narrowly elected William Henry Harrison as the first delegate over the governor&#x27;s son, Arthur St. Clair Jr. Subsequent congressional delegates were William McMillan (1800–1801) and Paul Fearing (1801–1803).

===Land ownership===
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the concept of fee simple ownership, by which ownership was in perpetuity with unlimited power to sell or give it away.

===Prohibition of slavery===
The Northwest Ordinance was the first act of its kind in that it prohibited slavery throughout a U.S. territory. This act was less controversial than it may have seemed at the time, practically a rework of an earlier 1784 act that proposed gradual reduction of slavery throughout the territories. Both of these proposed acts were supported by a variety of influential members of congress including Thomas Jefferson in the hope that slavery would fade as the nation grew.

===Native American lands===
In regards to the Delaware (Lenape) Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided, on July 27, 1787, that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would &quot;be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Native Americans and promoting Christianity.&quot;

===Education===

The Northwest Ordinance called for a public university for the education, settlement and eventual statehood of the frontier of Ohio and beyond. Article 3 stated, &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot; The Land Ordinance of 1785 created an innovation in public education when it reserved resources for local public schools. The ordinance divided the territory into 36 mile2 townships, and each township was further divided into 36 one mile2 tracts for purposes of sale. The ordinance then stated that &quot;there shall be reserved from sale the lot No. 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools within the said township.&quot;

In 1801, Jefferson Academy was established in Vincennes. As Vincennes University, it remains the oldest public institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory.

The next year, American Western University was founded in Athens, Ohio, upstream of the Hocking River, due to its location directly between Chillicothe (an original capital of Ohio) and Marietta. It was formally established on February 18, 1804, as Ohio University.

==Settlements and forts==
Forts, garrisons and settlements established in the territory northwest of the River Ohio between 1778 and 1803 (excluding those established in Indiana Territory after 1800). They are listed by present-day location and year established or of U.S. possession. Most forts were military garrisons only. General Anthony Wayne, during his Ohio Country campaign 1792–1795, built or rebuilt 10 such forts: forts (in order by date) Lafayette, Greene Ville, Recovery, Adams, Defiance, Deposit, Wayne, Loramie, Piqua, and St. Mary&#x27;s. Early settlements were outside or nearby forts: Clarksville, Vincennes, Kaskaskia (French), Losantiville, and the Ohio Company settlements at Marietta and Waterford/Beverly. Later, after the Treaty of Greenville, settlements no longer needed to be spearheaded by forts, and sprang up quickly below the Treaty Line.

==Counties==


Thirteen counties were formed by Governor Arthur St. Clair during the territory&#x27;s existence:

* Washington County, with its seat at Marietta, was the first county formed in the territory, proclaimed on July 26, 1788, by territorial governor St. Clair. Its original boundaries were proclaimed as all of present-day Ohio east of a line extending due south from the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, but this did not take into account Connecticut&#x27;s still unresolved claim of the Western Reserve. It kept these boundaries until 1796.
* Hamilton County, with its seat at Cincinnati, was proclaimed on January 2, 1790. The same proclamation officially changed Cincinnati&#x27;s name from Losantiville into its present form. Its original boundaries claimed all land north of the Ohio River between the Great Miami River and Little Miami River as far north as Standing Stone Fork (now Loramie Creek), just north of present-day Piqua. In 1792 Hamilton County was expanded to encompass all lands between the mouths of the Great Miami and Cuyahoga Rivers, as well as all of what is now the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Its territory was reduced several times after 1796.
* St. Clair County, with its seat at Kaskaskia was proclaimed on April 27, 1790. It originally encompassed most of present-day Illinois south of the Illinois River. It lost most of its southern lands in the formation of Randolph County in 1795, necessitating the transfer of the county seat to Cahokia, but expanded to the north to take in northwest present-day Illinois and most of present-day Wisconsin in 1801 after becoming part of Indiana Territory.
* Knox County, with its seat at Vincennes, was proclaimed on June 20, 1790, and encompassed the majority of the territory&#x27;s land area – all land between St. Clair County and Hamilton County, extending north to Canada.
* Randolph County was formed October 5, 1795, with its seat at Kaskaskia and encompassed the southern half of what was St. Clair County.
* Wayne County was formed on August 15, 1796, out of portions of Hamilton County and unorganized land, with its seat at Detroit, which had been evacuated by the British five weeks previously. Wayne County originally covered all of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana and a small portion of the present Lake Michigan shoreline, including the site of present-day Chicago. On November 1, 1798, it was split into the four townships of Detroit, Hamtramck, Mackinaw, and Sargent. The lands west of the extension of the present Indiana-Ohio border became part of Indiana Territory in 1800; the eastern portion of the county&#x27;s land in Ohio were folded into Trumbull County that same year. The territory north of the Ordinance Line became part of Indiana Territory in 1803 as a reorganized Wayne County; the remainder reverted to unorganized status after Ohio statehood.
* Adams County was formed on July 10, 1797, with its seat at Manchester; it encompassed most of present-day south-central Ohio.
* Jefferson County was formed July 29, 1797, with its seat at Steubenville, carved out of Washington County and originally encompassed all of what is now northeastern Ohio.
* Ross County was organized on August 20, 1798, with its seat at Chillicothe and was carved out of portions of Knox, Hamilton and Washington counties.
Knox, Randolph and St. Clair counties were separated from the territory effective July 4, 1800, and, along with the western part of Wayne County, and unorganized lands in what are now Minnesota and Wisconsin, became the Indiana Territory.
* Trumbull County was proclaimed July 10, 1800, out of the Western Reserve portion of Jefferson and Wayne Counties, with its county seat at Warren, chosen over rivals Cleveland and Youngstown.
* Clermont County was formed December 6, 1800, out of Hamilton County, with its seat at Williamsburg. In contrast with most other Northwest Territory counties, Clermont County&#x27;s original boundaries are only slightly larger than its present-day limits.
* Fairfield County was proclaimed December 9, 1800, formed out of Ross and Washington counties, with its seat at Lancaster.
* Belmont County was proclaimed September 7, 1801, formed out of Washington and Jefferson counties, with its seat at St. Clairsville.

The Northwest Territory ceased to exist upon Ohio statehood on March 1, 1803; the lands in Ohio that were previously part of Wayne County but not included in Trumbull County reverted to an unorganized status until new counties could be formed. The remainder of Wayne County, roughly the eastern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula, was attached to Indiana Territory. A sliver of Hamilton County along the southwestern border (the Greenville Treaty line) comprising a portion of the Whitewater River drainage basin and known as &quot;The Gore&quot; was also ceded to Indiana Territory.

<text>Torii Kedar Hunter (; born July 18, 1975) is an American former professional baseball center fielder and right fielder. Hunter currently serves as Special Assistant to Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Detroit Tigers from 1997 through 2015. Hunter was a five-time All-Star, won nine consecutive Gold Glove Awards as a center fielder, and was a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner.

== High school career ==
Born and raised in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Hunter attended Pine Bluff High School. Hunter, along with his three brothers, lived in a downtown 
and fairly impoverished neighborhood just off Main Street. Hunter began playing baseball at the age of eight and football a few years later, excelling as both a quarterback and a free safety. At Pine Bluff High, Hunter excelled in baseball, football, basketball, and track. Early on in high school, Hunter was a stand-out in sports other than baseball, but would receive All-State honors for his junior and senior seasons. According to the head coach of the team, Hunter once hit a ball for a home run. In 1992, Hunter made the U.S. Junior Olympic team, and when he struggled to pay the $500 fee for the team, Hunter wrote then-governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton a letter asking for help, which Clinton accepted. Hunter had the option of attending The University of Arkansas to play baseball, but opted to play professional baseball instead.

== Professional career ==

=== Minnesota Twins ===
The Twins selected Hunter with the 20th overall pick in the 1993 draft using a compensation pick from the Cincinnati Reds for signing John Smiley. Hunter made his debut with the Twins as a pinch runner in Baltimore on August 22, 1997. It was not until 1999 that Hunter began starting regularly, playing in 135 games for the Twins. He finished with only one error in 292 chances in the outfield.

Hunter exploded onto the scene in the beginning of April in 2000, but his batting average dropped to .207 by the end of May. He was subsequently sent down to Triple-A Salt Lake to work on his mechanics at the plate; however with Hunter&#x27;s new approach at the plate, he caught fire in the month of June, capping it with a two-home run, seven-RBI game and being named the Twins&#x27; Minor League Player of the Week and Player of the Month. After a 16-game hitting streak, four consecutive games with home runs and three grand slams, Hunter was recalled by the Twins on July 28. Hunter was named both Best Defensive Outfielder and Most Exciting Player in Pacific Coast League by Baseball America for 2000.

 In 2001, Hunter led the Twins in at bats, home runs and outfield assists (with 14 – tied for second best in the league), and was second in RBI and total bases, leading the Twins to their first winning season since 1992. Hunter led all major league center fielders in range factor (3.29), and was named Best Defensive Outfielder in the American League by Baseball America. He also won his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2001.

In 2002, Hunter began to post near-MVP numbers, and was a contender for the award a good portion of the year. In the month of April, he went 39–105 (a .371 average) with nine home runs and 20 RBI, winning American League Player of the Month honors.

Hunter was selected by the fans to his first All-Star Game, in Milwaukee in 2002, becoming the first Twin since Kirby Puckett in 1995 to start an All-Star game in center field. One of the biggest moments came in the first inning, when, with two outs, Barry Bonds sent what appeared to be a towering home run to right-center field. Hunter, who had built a reputation for his outfield thievery in the American League, jumped and caught the ball over the wall (accomplishing a personal goal he set of robbing one from Bonds). Although there were no awards given at the All-Star game, because the game ended in a tie, the catch was later awarded as the This Year in Baseball Best Defensive Play of the Year by the fans.

Hunter, along with an improved team and solid bullpen pitching, led a resurgence in the latter half of the season which powered the Twins to win the American League Central Division. The team would advance to the ALCS, where they would lose to the Anaheim Angels four games to one. The Angels went on to win their first World Series championship.

Despite losing in the ALCS, it was still a very good year for the ballclub, and by far the best year for Hunter. He led the club in home runs, RBIs, and stolen bases, and was tied for the lead in games and doubles. Hunter won the team&#x27;s Calvin R. Griffith Award as Most Valuable Twin for 2002. He ended the season sixth in the MVP voting, and also earned his second Gold Glove in center field. Hunter was additionally voted baseball&#x27;s Best Defensive Player Award for 2002 by the fans.

Hunter struggled offensively in 2003. Although he played in a career high 154 games, he often struggled at the plate, achieving an OPS of .763 and a batting average of just .250, .039 lower than in 2002. He stole just six bases, while being thrown out seven times. His defense was still strong enough to win his third straight Gold Glove for his play in center field.

Hunter missed much of the 2005 season after breaking his ankle and tearing ligaments when he attempted to scale the right field wall in Fenway Park on July 29. Despite playing essentially only half a season, Hunter was awarded his fifth consecutive Gold Glove.

On the last day of the 2006 regular season, Hunter hit his career-high 31st home run, helping the Twins to their fourth division title in five years.

On October 10, the Twins notified Hunter that they had picked up his $12 million option for the 2007 season, keeping him from becoming a free agent.

=== Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ===

After turning down a three-year, $45 million deal in August 2007 from the Twins, Hunter signed a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim worth $90 million. He replaced Gary Matthews Jr. as the everyday center fielder.

In 2009, he was named #44 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot; list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, were polled to arrive at the list.

Hunter hit three home runs in one game against the San Diego Padres on June 13, 2009. It was the first time in his career he had accomplished the feat. Hunter was selected to represent Los Angeles in the 2009 All-Star Game, making his third appearance, but he was unable to participate. He was on the disabled list because he had crashed into the outfield wall at Dodger Stadium and at AT&amp;T Park, separating his right shoulder. This sidelined him for more than a month.

Hunter batted .299 with 22 homers and 90 RBIs in 2009. After the 2009 season, Hunter won his ninth consecutive Gold Glove award for the outfield, and a Silver Slugger Award.

On September 2, 2011, Hunter said in an interview with the &quot;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&quot; that he wanted to retire as a member of the Angels, but he became a free agent following the 2012 season.

=== Detroit Tigers ===

On November 14, 2012, it was announced that Hunter and the Detroit Tigers had reached a two-year agreement worth $26 million. He would be playing right field and batting second for most of the season. After Hunter signed with the Tigers, pitcher Rick Porcello let him have #48, which Hunter has worn for his entire career, and Porcello changed his uniform to #21.

On June 16, 2013, Hunter hit his 300th career home run in a game against the Minnesota Twins, in the city where his major league career started (Minneapolis). On July 1, Hunter was voted in as a reserve outfielder in the AL player voting for the 2013 Major League All-Star Game. It was his fifth career All-Star selection. As of the All-Star break, Torii was hitting .315 with seven home runs and 44 RBIs.

Hunter finished the 2013 regular season with a .304 batting average, 17 home runs and 84 RBIs. Batting in front of Miguel Cabrera for most of the season, Torii was walked only 26 times, helping him to the highest at-bats total of his major league career (606), as well as a career-high 184 hits.

In Game 2 of the ALCS Hunter injured himself flipping over the low Fenway Park bullpen wall in pursuit of a David Ortiz game-tying grand slam.
On May 12, 2014, the normally easygoing Hunter had a heated exchange with Baltimore Orioles hurler Bud Norris after Norris hit Hunter in the ribs with a fastball during a 4–1 Tiger win at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, sparking a bench-clearing incident. The two continued shouting at each other as Norris headed to the dugout after being ejected. Hunter was hitting .298 for the 2014 season at the conclusion of that contest.

Hunter finished the 2014 regular season with a .286 batting average, 17 home runs, and 83 RBIs.

=== Return to the Minnesota Twins ===
On December 2, 2014, Hunter agreed to a one-year deal worth $10.5 million with the Minnesota Twins, with whom he had previously played from 1997 to 2007. The deal became official on December 3, 2014. During a game on June 10, 2015, Hunter was ejected by umpire Mark Ripperger and reacted by heaving pieces of equipment and then taking off his uniform shirt and throwing it to the ground. Hunter received a two-game suspension for his actions. Over his final season, Hunter batted .240, hit 22 homers, and drove in 81 runs.

On October 26, 2015, Hunter announced his retirement from baseball.

===Career statistics===
In 2372 games over 19 seasons, Hunter posted a .277 batting average (2452-for-8857) with 1296 runs, 498 doubles, 39 triples, 353 home runs, 1391 RBI, 195 stolen bases, 661 bases on balls, .331 on-base percentage and .461 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage playing primarily at center and right field. In 48 postseason games, he hit .274 (51-for-186) with 26 runs, 12 doubles, 4 home runs, 20 RBI and 17 walks.

== Highlights, records, and notable statistics ==
Hunter began the 2007 season with one of the fastest starts to a season in his career, featuring a 23-game hitting streak starting in mid-April and ending on May 10. In 2007, Hunter also hit three grand slams: April 17 in Seattle, May 18 in Milwaukee, and August 15 again in Seattle.

Hunter has been awarded nine consecutive American League Gold Glove Awards (2001–2009) for his defensive talents in center field, and he has been selected to the All-Star Game five times.

On May 30, 2011, Hunter collected his 1,000th RBI off of Joakim Soria, which was also a go-ahead two-run home run to give the Angels a 9–8 lead, a game which they eventually won 10–8. Hunter was the 268th person to collect 1,000 RBI

On August 15, 2012, Hunter was sliding home when he accidentally slashed umpire Greg Gibson by his left eye with his rubber cleats. Gibson was not seriously injured. Hunter noted that he had been wearing metal cleats on Sunday and Monday, but had switched to rubber cleats the previous day.

On June 16, 2013, Hunter hit his 300th career home run off Twins pitcher P. J. Walters.


== Charity ==
Hunter contributes to many charities, including the &quot;Torii Hunter Project Education Initiative&quot;, which provides college scholarships to students in California, Arkansas, Nevada and Minnesota, the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a partnership with Major League Baseball to help maintain and improve baseball diamonds in inner cities, the Big Brothers and the Prostate Cancer Foundation, and in addition, Hunter helped fund construction of a youth softball field in Placentia, California in 2008. This work has resulted in Hunter being presented with the Branch Rickey Award in 2009, which rewards excellence in charity work.

== Controversy ==
In a discussion about the number of black players in the Major Leagues, Hunter said during a &quot;USA Today&quot;-hosted committee to improve baseball panel that black Latinos do not count. &quot;People see dark faces out there, and the perception is that they&#x27;re African-American. They&#x27;re not us. They&#x27;re impostors. Even people I know come up and say: &#x27;Hey, what color is Vladimir Guerrero? Is he a black player?&#x27; I say, &#x27;Come on, he&#x27;s Dominican. He&#x27;s not black.&#x27; ... As African-American players, we have a theory that baseball can go get an imitator and pass them off as us. It&#x27;s like they had to get some kind of dark faces, so they go to the Dominican or Venezuela because you can get them cheaper. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;Why should I get this kid from the South Side of Chicago and have Scott Boras represent him and pay him $5 million when you can get a Dominican guy for a bag of chips?&#x27; ... I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s sad.&quot; Though Hunter does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes, he has insisted that these statements merely distinguish between different cultures and do not reflect negative feelings toward other races.

== Personal life ==
Hunter resides during the off-season in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex suburb of Prosper, Texas with his wife Katrina, whom he met in high school. He is a cousin of former MLB outfielder Choo Freeman. Despite the same spelling, Hunter was not named after torii, the gates to a Japanese Shinto shrine. Hunter says jokingly, &quot;I think, when my mom filled out the paperwork after I was born, she accidentally put two &#x27;I&#x27;s.&quot; Hunter is a Christian.

His older son, Torii Jr., played football and baseball at Notre Dame beginning in 2013. Torii Jr. currently plays baseball professionally in the Angels organization after being selected by the team in the 23rd round of the 2016 MLB Draft. His younger son, Monshadrik Hunter, is a defensive back in the Canadian Football League.

In 2012, Hunter&#x27;s son, Darius McClinton-Hunter, was arrested and accused of sexual assault. A grand jury declined to indict McClinton-Hunter on the grounds of insufficient evidence. The accuser recanted her claims first in a recorded telephone conversation and again in a deposition for a $10 million lawsuit Darius McClinton-Hunter filed against her for her false allegations. Hunter, playing for the Angels at the time, took a 14-game hiatus in the wake of his son&#x27;s arrest.

Hunter endorsed gubernatorial candidate Asa Hutchinson in his successful attempt to become governor of Arkansas, citing their shared desire of &quot;keeping marriage between one man and one woman.&quot;

Hunter once indicated that he would be uncomfortable with having a homosexual teammate, due to his biblical upbringing. However, he later apologized for his comments.

<text>A radical (), or indexing component, is a visually prominent component of a Chinese character under which the character is traditionally listed in a Chinese dictionary. The radical for a character is typically a semantic component, but can also be another structural component or even an artificially extracted portion of the character. In some cases the original semantic or phonological connection has become obscure, owing to changes in the meaning or pronunciation of the character over time.

The use of the English term &quot;radical&quot; is based on an analogy between the structure of Chinese characters and the inflection of words in European languages. Radicals are also sometimes called &quot;classifiers&quot;, but this name is more commonly applied to the grammatical measure words in Chinese.

== History ==
In the earliest Chinese dictionaries, such as the &quot;Erya&quot; (3rd centuryBC), characters were grouped together in broad semantic categories.
Because the vast majority of characters are phono-semantic compounds, combining a semantic component with a phonetic component, each semantic component tended to recur within a particular section of the dictionary. In the 2nd centuryAD, the Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen organized his etymological dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; by selecting 540 recurring graphic elements he called &quot;bù&quot; (部, &quot;categories&quot;). Most were common semantic components, but they also included shared graphic elements such as a dot or horizontal stroke. Some were even artificially extracted groups of strokes, termed &quot;glyphs&quot; by Serruys (1984, p.657), which never had an independent existence other than being listed in &quot;Shuowen&quot;. Each character was listed under only one element, which is then referred to as the radical for that character. For example, characters containing 女 &quot;nǚ&quot; &quot;female&quot; or 木 &quot;mù&quot; &quot;tree, wood&quot; are often grouped together in the sections for those radicals.

Mei Yingzuo&#x27;s 1615 dictionary &quot;Zihui&quot; made two further innovations. He reduced the list of radicals to 214, and arranged characters under each radical in increasing order of the number of additional strokes—the radical-and-stroke method still used in the vast majority of present-day Chinese dictionaries. These innovations were also adopted by the more famous &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; of 1716. Thus the standard 214 radicals introduced in the &quot;Zihui&quot; are usually known as the Kangxi radicals. These were first called &quot;bùshǒu&quot; (部首 &#x27;section header&#x27;) in the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot;. Although there is some variation in such lists – depending primarily on what secondary radicals are also indexed – these canonical 214 radicals of the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; still serve as the basis for most modern Chinese dictionaries. Some of the graphically similar radicals are combined in many dictionaries, such as 月 &quot;yuè&quot; &quot;moon&quot; and the 月 form (⺼) of 肉 &quot;ròu&quot;, &quot;meat, flesh&quot;.

After the writing system reform in mainland China, the traditional set of Kangxi radicals became unsuitable for indexing Simplified Chinese characters. In 1983, the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language and the State Administration of Publication of China published &quot;The Table of Unified Indexing Chinese Character Components (Draft)&quot; (). In 2009, the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the State Language Work Committee issued &quot;The Table of Indexing Chinese Character Components&quot; (GF 0011-2009 ), which includes 201 principal indexing components and 100 associated indexing components (In China&#x27;s normative documents, &quot;radical&quot; is defined as any component or &quot;piānpáng&quot; of Chinese characters, while is translated as &quot;indexing component&quot;.).

== Shape and position ==
Radicals may appear in any position in a character. For example, 女 appears on the left side in the characters 姐, 媽, 她, 好 and 姓, but it appears at the bottom in 妾. Semantic components tend to appear on the top or on the left side of the character, and phonetic components on the right side or at the bottom. These are loose rules, however, and exceptions are plenty. Sometimes, the radical may span more than one side, as in 園 = 囗 &quot;enclosure&quot; + 袁, or 街 = 行 &quot;go, movement&quot; + 圭. More complicated combinations exist, such as 勝 = 力 &quot;strength&quot; + 朕—the radical is in the lower-right quadrant.

In many characters, the components (including radicals) are distorted or modified to fit into a block with other elements. They may be narrowed, shortened, or have different shapes entirely. Changes in shape, rather than simple distortion, may result in fewer pen strokes. In some cases, combinations may have alternates. The shape of the component can depend on its placement with other elements in the character.

The shape 阝 is indexed as two different radicals depending on where it appears in the character. Placed on the right, as in 都 (&quot;dū&quot; &quot;metropolis&quot;, also read as &quot;dōu&quot; &quot;all&quot;), it represents an abbreviated form of 邑 &quot;yì&quot; &quot;city&quot;; placed on the left, as in 陸 &quot;lù&quot; &quot;land&quot;, it represents an abbreviated radical form of 阜 &quot;fù&quot; &quot;mound, hill&quot;.

Some of the most important variant combining forms (besides 邑 → 阝 and 阜 → 阝per the above) are:
* 刀 &quot;knife&quot; → 刂 when placed to the right of other elements:
** examples: 分, 召 ~ 刖
** counter-example: 切
* 人 &quot;man&quot; → 亻 on the left:
** 囚, 仄, 坐 ~ 他
** counter-example: 从
* 心 &quot;heart&quot; → 忄 on the left:
** 杺, 您, 恭* ~ 快
* 手 &quot;hand&quot; → 扌 on the left:
** 杽, 拏, 掱 ~ 扡
** counter-example: 拜
* 水 &quot;water&quot; → 氵 on the left:
** 汆, 呇, 沊 ~ 池
** counter-example: 沝
* 火 &quot;fire&quot; → 灬 at the bottom:
** 伙, 秋, 灱 ~ 黑
** counter-example: 災
* 犬 &quot;dog&quot; → 犭 on the left:
** 伏, 状 ~ 狙
** counter-example: 㹜

=== Semantic components ===

Over 80% of Chinese characters are phono-semantic compounds (): a semantic component gives a broad category of meaning, while a phonetic component suggests the sound. Usually, the radical is the semantic component.

Thus, although some authors use the term &quot;radical&quot; for semantic components (義符 &quot;yìfú&quot;), others distinguish the latter as &quot;determinatives&quot; or &quot;significs&quot; or by some other term.

Many radicals are merely artificial extractions of portions of characters, some of which are further truncated or changed when applied (such as 亅 &quot;jué&quot; or &quot;juě&quot; in 了 &quot;liǎo&quot;), as explained by Serruys (1984), who therefore prefers the term &quot;glyph&quot; extraction rather than graphic extraction. This is even truer of modern dictionaries, which cut radicals to less than half the number in &quot;Shuowen&quot;, at which point it becomes impossible to have enough to cover a semantic element of every character. A sample of the &quot;Far Eastern Chinese English Dictionary&quot; of mere artificial extraction of a stroke from sub-entries:
* 一 in 丁 &quot;dīng&quot; and 且 &quot;qiě&quot;
* 乙 &quot;yǐ&quot; in 九 &quot;jiǔ&quot;
* 亅 &quot;jué/juě&quot; in 了 &quot;liǎo/le&quot;
* 二 &quot;èr&quot; in 亞 &quot;yà/yǎ&quot;
* 田 &quot;tián&quot; in 禺 &quot;yù&quot;
* 豕 &quot;shǐ&quot; in 象 &quot;xiàng&quot;.

=== Phonetic components ===
Radicals sometimes play a phonetic role instead of a semantic one:
In some cases, chosen radicals used phonetically coincidentally are in keeping, in step, semantically.

=== Simplified radicals ===
The character simplification pursued in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and elsewhere has modified a number of components, including those used as radicals. This has created a number of new radical forms. For instance, the character 金 &quot;jīn&quot;, when used as a radical, is written 釒(that is, with the same number of strokes, and only a minor variation) in traditional writing, but 钅in simplified characters. This means that simplified writing has resulted in significant differences not present in traditional writing. An example of a character using this radical is &quot;yín&quot; &quot;silver&quot;; traditionally: 銀, simplified: 银.

== Dictionary lookup ==
Many dictionaries support using radical classification to index and look up characters, although many present-day dictionaries supplement it with other methods. For example, modern dictionaries in PRC normally use the Pinyin transcription of a character to perform character lookup. Following the &quot;section-header-and-stroke-count&quot; method of Mei Yingzuo, characters are listed by their radical and then ordered by the number of strokes needed to write them.

The steps involved in looking up a character are as follows:
# Identify the radical under which the character is most likely to have been indexed. If in doubt, the component on the left side or at the top is often a good first guess.
# Find the section of the dictionary associated with that radical.
# Count the number of strokes in the remaining portion of the character.
# Find the pages listing characters under that radical that have that number of additional strokes.
# Find the appropriate entry or experiment with different choices for steps 1 and 3.

As a rule of thumb, components at the left or top of the character, or elements which surround the rest of the character, are the ones most likely to be used as radical. For example, 信 is typically indexed under the left-side component 人 instead of the right-side 言; and 套 is typically indexed under the top 大 instead of the bottom 長. There are, however, idiosyncratic differences between dictionaries, and except for simple cases, the same character cannot be assumed to be indexed the same way in two different dictionaries.

In order to further ease dictionary lookup, dictionaries sometimes list radicals both under the number of strokes used to write their canonical form and under the number of strokes used to write their variant forms. For example, 心 can be listed as a four-stroke radical but might also be listed as a three-stroke radical because it is usually written as 忄 when it forms a part of another character. This means that the dictionary user need not know that the two are etymologically identical.

It is sometimes possible to find one and the same character indexed under multiple radicals. For example, many dictionaries list 義 under both 羊 and (the radical of its lower part 我). Furthermore, with digital dictionaries, it is now possible to search for characters by cross-reference. Using this &quot;multi-component method&quot; a relatively new development enabled by computing technology, the user can select &quot;all&quot; of a character&#x27;s components from a table and the computer will present a list of matching characters. This eliminates the guesswork of choosing the correct radical and calculating the correct stroke count, and cuts down searching time significantly. One can query for characters containing both 羊 and 戈, and get back only five characters (羢, 義, 儀, 羬 and 羲) to search through. The Academia Sinica&#x27;s 漢字構形資料庫 Chinese character structure database also works this way, returning only seven characters for this query. Harbaugh&#x27;s Chinese Characters dictionary similarly allows searches based on any component. Some modern computer dictionaries allow the user to draw characters with a mouse, stylus or finger, ideally tolerating a degree of imperfection, thus eliminating the problem of radical identification altogether.

=== Sets of radicals ===
Though radicals are widely accepted as a method to categorize Chinese characters and locate a certain character in a dictionary, there is no universal agreement about either the exact number of radicals or the set of radicals to be used, due to the sometimes arbitrary nature of the selection process.

The Kangxi radicals are a &quot;de facto&quot; standard which, although not implemented exactly in every Chinese dictionary, few dictionary compilers can afford to completely ignore. They serve as the basis for many computer encoding systems. Specifically, the Unicode standard&#x27;s radical-stroke charts are based on the Kangxi set of radicals.

The count of commonly used radicals in modern abridged dictionaries is often less than 214. The &quot;Oxford Concise English–Chinese Dictionary&quot; has 188. A few dictionaries also introduce new radicals based on the principles first used by Xu Shen, treating groups of radicals that are used together in many different characters as a kind of radical.

In modern practice, radicals are primarily used as lexicographic tools and as learning aids when writing characters. They have become increasingly disconnected from semantics, etymology and phonetics.

=== Limitations and flexibility ===
Some of the radicals used in Chinese dictionaries, even in the era of Kangxi, were not stand-alone current-usage characters. Instead, they indexed unique characters that lacked more obvious qualifiers. The radical 鬯 (&quot;chàng&quot; &quot;sacrificial wine&quot;) indexes only a few characters. Modern dictionaries tend to eliminate these when it is possible to find some more widely used graphic element under which a character can be categorized. Some use a system where characters are indexed under more than one radical and/or set of key elements to make it easier to find them.

<text>The Albert Memorial is a Gothic Revival ciborium in Kensington Gardens, London, designed and dedicated to the memory of Prince Albert of Great Britain. Located directly north of the Royal Albert Hall, it was commissioned by Queen Victoria in memory of her beloved husband, who died in 1861. Designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, it takes the form of an ornate canopy or pavilion tall over the high altar of a church, sheltering a statue of the prince facing south. It took over ten years to complete, the £120,000 cost (the equivalent of about £10,000,000 in 2010) met by public subscription.

The memorial was opened in July 1872 by Queen Victoria, with the statue of Albert ceremonially &quot;seated&quot; in 1876.
It has been Grade I listed since 1970.

==Commission and design==

When Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861, at the age of 42, the thoughts of those in government and public life turned to the form and shape of a suitable memorial, with several possibilities, such as establishing a university or international scholarships, being mentioned. Queen Victoria, however, soon made it clear that she desired a memorial &quot;in the common sense of the word&quot;. The initiative was taken by the Lord Mayor of London, William Cubitt, who, at a meeting on 14 January 1862, appointed a committee to raise funds for a design to be approved by the Queen. The control and future course of the project, though, moved away from Mansion House, and ended up being controlled by people close to the Queen, rather than the Mayor. Those who determined the overall direction from that point on were the Queen&#x27;s secretary, General Charles Grey, and the keeper of the privy purse, Sir Charles Phipps. His assistant Doyne Bell was secretary of the committee and later published &quot;The National Memorial to His Royal Highness the Prince Consort&quot; (1873). 

Following the deaths of Grey and Phipps, their roles were taken on by Sir Henry Ponsonby and Sir Thomas Biddulph. Eventually, a four-man steering committee was established, led by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake. Eastlake had overall control for the project until his death in 1865. An initial proposal for an obelisk memorial failed, and this was followed in May 1862 by the appointment of a seven-strong committee of architects. A range of designs were submitted and examined. Two of the designs (those by Philip Charles Hardwick and George Gilbert Scott) were passed to the Queen in February 1863 for a final decision to be made. Two months later, after lengthy deliberations and negotiations with the government over the costs of the memorial, Scott&#x27;s design was formally approved in April 1863.

==Architectural influences==
The popularity of the Prince Consort led to the creation of several &quot;Albert Memorials&quot; around the United Kingdom. The Kensington memorial was not the earliest; the first memorial depicting the Prince to be erected was Thomas Worthington&#x27;s Albert Memorial in Albert Square, Manchester, unveiled in 1865. Both memorials present the figure of Prince Albert enclosed within a Gothic ciborium, and the similarities of design have been remarked on. (The earliest memorial to be erected was the Prince Albert Memorial in Swanage, in 1862, in the form of an obelisk.)

There is some controversy as to whether the memorial in Manchester was influenced by the publication of Scott&#x27;s design, or whether Scott was himself inspired by Worthington&#x27;s design, or whether both architects decided on their canopy designs independently.

Worthington&#x27;s design was published in &quot;The Builder&quot; on 27 September 1862, before Scott&#x27;s final design was unveiled. However, writing in his &quot;Recollections&quot;, Gilbert Scott suggested his own design was original: My idea in designing the Memorial was to erect a kind of ciborium to protect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was that the ciborium was designed in some degree on the principles of the ancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such as had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of these imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying, its enamels, etc. etc. ... this was an idea so new as to provoke much opposition.

The Albert Memorial was not the first revivalist design for a canopied statue in a Gothic style – the Scott Monument in Edinburgh had been designed by George Meikle Kemp over twenty years earlier, and may itself have influenced Worthington&#x27;s designs for Manchester.

==Statue of Albert==
The commission to make the seated figure of Prince Albert for the memorial was initially given to Baron Carlo Marochetti, a favourite sculptor of Queen Victoria. However, his first version was rejected by the architect of the monument, Sir George Gilbert Scott, and Marochetti died in late 1867, before a satisfactory second version could be completed. In May 1868, John Henry Foley, sculptor of the monument&#x27;s &quot;Asia&quot; group, was commissioned to make the portrait, and his sketch model approved in December of that year. A full-sized model was placed on the monument in 1870, and the design approved by the Queen. The final statue was cast in bronze by Henry Prince and Company, of Southwark; Foley died in August 1874 before casting was complete.

The gilt bronze statue was ceremonially &quot;seated&quot; in 1875, three years after the memorial opened. Albert is shown looking south, towards the Royal Albert Hall. He is robed as a Knight of the Garter, and holds a catalogue of the Great Exhibition, which was located nearby in Hyde Park.

==Frieze of Parnassus==

The central part of the memorial is surrounded by the elaborate sculptural &quot;Frieze of Parnassus&quot; (named after Mount Parnassus, the favorite resting place for the Greek muses), which depicts 169 individual composers, architects, poets, painters, and sculptors. Musicians and poets were placed on the south side, painters on the east side, sculptors on the west side, and architects on the north side. Henry Hugh Armstead carved the figures on the south and east side, the painters, musicians and poets (80 in total), and grouped them by national schools. John Birnie Philip carved the figures on the west and north side, the sculptors and architects, and arranged them in chronological order.

==Allegorical sculptures==
At the corners of the central area, and at the corners of the outer area, there are two programmes of allegorical sculpture, or at least sculptures of personifications: four groups depicting Victorian industrial arts and sciences (agriculture, commerce, engineering and manufacturing), and four more groups representing the traditional four continents: Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe at the four corners, each continent-group including several ethnographic figures and a large animal: A camel for Africa, a bison for the Americas, an elephant for Asia and a bull for Europe.
These groups represent something of a blend of traditional iconography for the continents personified, and an attempt to update them. 

==Canopy==
The form of the monument is derived from the Gothic Scaliger Tombs outside a church in Verona. The mosaics for each side and beneath the canopy of the Memorial were designed by Clayton and Bell and manufactured by the firm of Salviati of Murano, Venice.

The memorial&#x27;s canopy features several mosaics as external and internal decorative artworks. Each of the four external mosaics shows a central allegorical figure of the four arts (poetry, painting, architecture and sculpture), supported by two historical figures either side. The historical figures are: King David and Homer (&quot;POESIS&quot; – poetry), Apelles and Raphael (painting), Solomon and Ictinus (architecture), and Phidias and Michelangelo (sculpture). Materials used in the mosaics include enamel, polished stone, agate, onyx, jasper, cornelian, crystal, marble, and granite.

Around the canopy, below its cornice, is a dedicatory legend split into four parts, one for each side. The legend reads: &quot;Queen Victoria And Her People • To The Memory Of Albert Prince Consort • As A Tribute Of Their Gratitude • For A Life Devoted to the Public Good&quot;.

The pillars and niches of the canopy feature eight statues representing the practical arts and sciences: Astronomy, Geology, Chemistry, Geometry (on the four pillars) and Rhetoric, Medicine, Philosophy and Physiology (in the four niches).

Near the top of the canopy&#x27;s tower are eight statues of the moral and Christian virtues, including the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues. The virtues are: Faith, Hope, Charity and Humility, and Fortitude, Prudence, Justice and Temperance. Humility is considered to be annexed to the virtue of temperance. Above these, towards the top of the tower, are gilded angels raising their arms heavenwards. At the very top of the tower is a gold cross.

==Foundation==
Below the Memorial is a large undercroft, consisting of numerous brick arches, which serves as the foundation that supports the large weight of the stone and metal used to build the monument.

==Architects==

The memorial was planned by a committee of architects led by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The other architects, some of whom died during the course of the project, or were replaced, included Carlo Marochetti, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, William Tite, Sydney Smirke, James Pennethorne, Matthew Digby Wyatt, Philip C. Hardwick, William Burn and Edward Middleton Barry.

==Sculptors==

The sculptor Henry Hugh Armstead coordinated this massive effort among many artists of the Royal Academy, including Thomas Thornycroft (carved the &quot;Commerce&quot; group), Patrick MacDowell (carved the &quot;Europe&quot; group, his last major work), John Bell (carved the &quot;America&quot; group), John Henry Foley (carved the &quot;Asia&quot; group and started the statue of Albert), William Theed (carved the &quot;Africa&quot; group), William Calder Marshall, James Redfern (carved the four Christian and four moral virtues including &quot;Fortitude&quot;), John Lawlor (carved the &quot;Engineering&quot; group) and Henry Weekes (carved the &quot;Manufactures&quot; group). The Scottish sculptor William Calder Marshall carved the &quot;Agriculture&quot; group. The figure of Albert himself, although begun by Foley, was completed by Thomas Brock, in what was Brock&#x27;s first major work.

Armstead created some 80 of the figure sculptures on the southern and eastern sides of the memorial&#x27;s podium. The north and west sides were carved by the sculptor John Birnie Philip. Armstead also sculpted the bronze statues representing &quot;Astronomy&quot;, &quot;Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, and &quot;Medicine&quot;.

Henry Weekes carved the allegorical work &quot;Manufactures&quot; (1864–70). Although Weekes was not on Queen Victoria&#x27;s original list of sculptors, being selected to work on the project only after John Gibson declined to participate, his group occupies the preferable south side of the finished monument. A central female figure holds an hourglass, symbolising the critical nature of time to industry, while an ironworker stands at his anvil and a potter and weaver offer their wares.

==Later history==
By the late 1990s the Memorial had fallen into a state of some decay. A thorough restoration was led by Peter Inskip + Peter Jenkins Architects and the works were carried were out by Mowlem. These included cleaning, repainting, re-gilding the monument and structural repairs. In the process the cross on top of the monument, which had been put on sideways during an earlier restoration attempt, was returned to its correct position. Some of the restoration, including repairs to damaged friezes, were of limited success.

The centrepiece of the Memorial is a seated figure of Prince Albert, which is now covered in gold leaf. For eighty years the statue had been covered in black paint. Various theories had existed that it was deliberately blackened during World War I to prevent it becoming a target for Zeppelin bombing raids or domestic anti-German sentiment. English Heritage&#x27;s research prior to the restoration suggests that the black coating pre-dates 1914 and may have been a response to atmospheric pollution that had destroyed the original gold leaf surface. Further restoration work, including re-pointing the steps surrounding the memorial, commenced in the summer of 2006.

Public afternoon tours are held on the first Sunday each month allowing visitors a closer look at the Frieze of Parnassus.

<text>Nicoleta Alexandru (; born 5 November 1968), (stage name Nicola ()), is a Romanian singer. She is best known for representing Romania at the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest.

==Early life==

Nicoleta Alexandru was born in Bucharest, Romania. 

== Career ==
She began her solo career in 1992, touring extensively along with television, radio and stage appearances. In 2003, she was awarded the Woman of the Year award by &quot;Avantaje&quot; magazine, her song &quot;Lângă mine&quot; was awarded &quot;Song of the Year&quot; by București and Actualitati Radio stations, and she was awarded Mamaia and Love Song Festival trophies for that song.

On 1 March 2003, after a huge response to her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart,&quot; Alexandru won the Romanian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest at Riga. In the final, she came in 10th place. She released her fourth LP, &quot;Best Of Nicola&quot;, that year. Building on the recognition gained from the Eurovision Song Contest, the album was certified platinum. That year she also won &quot;Best Female&quot; at the TV K Lumea awards.

In January 2005, she released &quot;De mă vei chema&quot; which spawned two hit singles; &quot;De mă vei chema&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot;. She subsequently launched the video for lead single &quot;De mă vei chema&quot;. It featured her backing band, consisting of Andrei Stanoevici, Cătălin Dalvarea, Ștefan Corbu and her ex-husband Mihai Alexandru. 

She faced tough competition for &quot;Best Pop&quot; and &quot;Best Female&quot; at the MTV Romania Music Awards 2005; she won the latter award. 

In late 2005, she and Mihai divorced after 15 years. The divorce was featured in Romanian tabloids, partly because he was a high-profile music producer.

In summer 2007, Alexandru returned to the charts with &quot;Doar noi doi&quot;. The video was filmed on location in Barcelona, Spain. Later on in the year, she released &quot;Dacă-i tarziu,&quot; part of her fourth studio album. Her song, &quot;Fairytale Story&quot;, placed 7th out of 12 songs in the national final. Nicola then went on to release the single, &quot;Leave No Heart Behind,&quot; in fall 2008, written by Thomas Nichols, who co-wrote songs by Céline Dion and All Saints.

On 21 August 2009, Nicola launched her studio album, &quot;Thank You&quot;. The first single from the album was &quot;My Love&quot;, which was co-worked with Kord. The single had a music video, which was directed by Dragoș Buliga.

<text>Francis Nash (October 7, 1777) was a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Prior to the war, he was a lawyer, public official, and politician in Hillsborough, North Carolina, and was heavily involved in opposing the Regulator movement, an uprising of settlers in the North Carolina piedmont between 1765 and 1771. Nash was also involved in North Carolina politics, representing Hillsborough on several occasions in the colonial North Carolina General Assembly.

Nash quickly became engaged in revolutionary activities, and served as a delegate to the first three Patriot provincial congresses. In 1775, he was named lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Regiment under Colonel James Moore, and served briefly in the southern theater of the Revolutionary War before being ordered north. Nash was made a brigadier general in 1777 upon Moore&#x27;s death, and given command of the North Carolina brigade of the Continental Army under General George Washington. He led North Carolina&#x27;s soldiers in the Philadelphia campaign, but was wounded at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777, and died several days later. Nash was one of ten Patriot generals to die from wounds received in combat between 1775 and 1781. He is honored by several city and county names, including those of Nashville, Tennessee; Nashville, North Carolina; and Nash County, North Carolina.

==Early life and family==

Nash was born around 1742 in Amelia County, Virginia (in an area that would later become Prince Edward County) to John and Ann Owen Nash. His parents were originally from Wales, and several of his seven siblings, including at least one brother, were born there. One of Nash&#x27;s brothers was Abner Nash, who later became a statesman in North Carolina.
By 1763, Francis Nash had moved along with Abner to Childsburgh, which later became Hillsborough. There Francis started a law practice, and became a clerk of court in 1763, a position which paid an annual stipend of £100 sterling. The Nash brothers also owned substantial property in the town, and established a mill on the Eno River, while Francis invested in a local store. From 1764 to 1765, he served his first term in the North Carolina Assembly representing Orange County.

In 1770, Nash married Sarah Moore, the daughter of colonial jurist Maurice Moore, niece of James Moore, and sister of future United States Supreme Court Justice Alfred Moore. Their union produced two daughters: Ann, who went under the guardianship of Peter Mallett and James Gardiner in 1785, and later married James Wallace, and Sarah, who went on to marry John Waddell, the son of North Carolina colonial soldier Hugh Waddell. Sarah was the grandmother to American Civil War Confederate blockade runner James Iredell Waddell. Francis Nash had two children out of wedlock, one of whom some scholars identify as a son also named Francis Nash, possibly born in 1770 or 1771. The mother of one of the children was reported as Hillsborough barmaid Ruth Jackson. Francis Nash the elder provided Jackson with property west of Hillsborough, and several slaves.

==War of the Regulation and pre-Revolution politics==
Nash showed an interest in military affairs while living in Hillsborough, and received informal military training from a retired English soldier living there. He worked his way up through the Orange County militia ranks until he eventually became its commanding colonel. During the War of the Regulation, in 1768, he ordered the militia to put down several riots incited by the Regulators, but the militiamen were sympathetic towards the rioters and refused. Nash entered into a pact with others including Edmund Fanning, Adlai Osborne, and future governor Alexander Martin, to protect one another&#x27;s property against Regulator threats, but the parties to that agreement lived at great distances from each other, rendering the pact ineffective.

Along with Fanning, who was a personal friend, Nash was accused of extorting money from Hillsborough&#x27;s residents. Regulator leaders attempted to have Nash tried for corruption, but the charges against him were dismissed. In September 1770, a group of Regulators took control of Hillsborough, forcing Nash and other public officials to flee for fear of bodily harm. Nash subsequently fought alongside Governor William Tryon in the Battle of Alamance against the Regulator militia. He served in the &quot;Lower House&quot; of the colonial Assembly in 1771 and from 1773 to 1775 as a representative for Hillsborough.

In 1774, Royal Governor Josiah Martin postponed the scheduled convening of the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses to prevent the North Carolina Assembly from selecting delegates to the proposed Continental Congress, which was to begin in Philadelphia in September. In response, members of the Assembly, many of whom would later become Patriot supporters, convened the First North Carolina Provincial Congress in August 1774. Nash and his brother, Abner, were both elected to that body, along with 69 other North Carolinians, which then selected delegates to the Continental Congress. Governor Martin condemned the Provincial Congress as an extra-legal body not permitted to assemble and represent the people of North Carolina. In an attempt to quash its work, the Governor called the House of Burgesses to convene on April 5, 1775, but the Second North Carolina Provincial Congress met in a session several hours before the Assembly was set to open and many of the congressional delegates, including Nash, voted to support the work of the Continental and Provincial Congresses. In response, Martin dissolved the Assembly on April 8, 1775. Nash was a representative of the House of Burgesses that met until April 8. The Royal government would never again call an Assembly to session in North Carolina.

==American Revolutionary War==

===Southern theater===
In 1775, Nash served in the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress, which organized eight regiments of soldiers on instructions from the Continental Congress. Later that year, the Provincial Congress appointed Nash lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Regiment under the command of then-colonel James Moore. In November, the 1st North Carolina was formally integrated into the Continental Army organization. Nash served as an officer under Moore during the maneuvers that led up to the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge in February 1776 but, like Moore, did not participate in the battle, arriving after its conclusion.

During April 1776, Nash was promoted to colonel to replace Moore, who had been promoted to brigadier general. Nash took part in the expedition to aid Charleston in 1776, which culminated in the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island. Immediately prior to that engagement, Nash had been ordered by Major General Charles Lee, commander of the Southern Department, to relieve William Moultrie&#x27;s South Carolina troops on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, but the British assault prevented that relief. Moultrie would go on to successfully defend the island from a much larger British force, while Nash&#x27;s unit guarded the unfinished rear of Fort Sullivan.

===Philadelphia campaign===
Nash returned with his regiment to North Carolina in anticipation of joining General George Washington&#x27;s army in the north, but fears of British and Indian attacks in Georgia prevented any such action, and caused Nash to remain in his home state. On February 5, 1777, he was promoted to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. He was also tasked with recruiting more soldiers from the western part of the state, but was forced to abandon that task after James Moore&#x27;s death on April 15, 1777. Nash was then placed in command of the North Carolina brigade. Although fellow North Carolinian Robert Howe&#x27;s commission as a brigadier general predated Nash&#x27;s, Howe had been made commander of the Southern Department of the Continental Army, and he was forced to remain in command of the troops defending South Carolina. Nash marched north to join Washington&#x27;s army and commanded all nine North Carolina Continental Army regiments at the Battle of Brandywine.

===Battle of Germantown and death===

After the British captured Philadelphia on September 26, 1777, Washington took to the offensive and struck at the main part of the British Army near Philadelphia in the Battle of Germantown on October 4. Initially, the North Carolina brigade was intended to serve in the Continental Army&#x27;s reserve but Washington, out of a desire to defend his flank, ordered Nash into action. Nash was commanding a fighting retreat, slowly moving his unit backwards to stall the British advance, when he was mortally wounded by a cannonball that struck him in the hip and killed his horse. The same cannonball killed Major James Witherspoon, son of John Witherspoon, the president of Princeton University and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Nash may have also been blinded by a musket ball that struck him in the head. Thomas Paine, who saw him taken off the battlefield, later stated that Nash&#x27;s wounds had made him unrecognizable.

Nash was treated by Washington&#x27;s personal physician, James Craik, who could not stem his bleeding, which was reported to have fully soaked through two mattresses. Nash succumbed to his wounds on October 7 at a private residence near Kulpsville, Pennsylvania. His final words are alleged to have been &quot;From the first dawn of the Revolution I have been ever on the side of liberty and my country&quot;. He was buried in the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse Cemetery in Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania, on October 9, 1777, along with other officers who had perished at Germantown. Most of the Continental Army&#x27;s senior officers, including Washington himself, attended the funeral service. Nash&#x27;s friend and colleague Alexander Martin, who later became Governor of the State of North Carolina and who had witnessed Nash&#x27;s wounding, later composed a funeral poem in the fallen general&#x27;s honor.

==Legacy==

Nash was one of ten Patriot generals who died during the American Revolutionary War. After his death, on April 29, 1784, Congress awarded his heirs a land grant representing 84 months of Continental Army service, which exceeded Nash&#x27;s actual service time. Nashville, Tennessee (originally called &quot;Fort Nashborough&quot;), Nashville, North Carolina, the city of Nashville, Georgia, and Nash County, North Carolina, are named in his honor. In 1906, a stone arch was erected on the grounds of Guilford Courthouse National Military Park in Nash&#x27;s honor, but it was demolished in 1937. Nash&#x27;s home in Hillsborough is now known as the Nash-Hooper House, as it was purchased by William Hooper, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, after Nash&#x27;s death. In 1938, a historical marker was placed near the house commemorating Nash&#x27;s life and service. The Nash-Hooper House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. It is located in the Hillsborough Historic District.

<doc id="234999" wikidata="Q7574221" url="?curid=234999" title="Speak of the devil">
<text>&quot;Speak of the devil&quot; is the short form of the English-language idiom &quot;Speak of the devil and he doth appear&quot; (or its alternative form &quot;speak of the devil and he shall appear&quot;). The form &quot;talk of the devil&quot; is also in use in the United Kingdom. It is used when an object of discussion unexpectedly becomes present during the conversation. 
It can also be used about a topic that quickly becomes relevant, such as the onset of rain or a car breaking down.

A cognate of this phrase appears in the 15th century Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms as 说曹操，曹操到 or &quot;Speak of Cao Cao, Cao Cao arrives&quot;.

In many cultures a different, dangerous, person or character is referenced in the phrase. In Serbian, the phrase translates to, &quot;Speak of the wolf and he is at your door.&quot; French translates it to &quot;Speak of the wolf and you see its tail&quot;. In Czech it&#x27;s &quot;We talk about the Wolf, and the Wolf is at the door&quot;. In Scandinavia it&#x27;s &quot;When you speak of the trolls, they&#x27;re in the hallway&quot;. In Hungarian it is &quot;Emlegetett szamár&quot; meaning approximately &quot;Here is the mentioned donkey&quot;.

<doc id="235000" wikidata="Q652965" url="?curid=235000" title="Most valuable player">
<text>In team sports, a most valuable player (MVP) award is an honor typically bestowed upon an individual (or individuals, in the instance of a tie) whose individual performance is the greatest in an entire league, for a particular competition, or on a specific team. The purpose of the award is to recognize the contribution of the individual&#x27;s efforts amongst a group effort, and to highlight the excellence, exemplariness, and/or outstandingness of a player&#x27;s performance amidst the performance of their peers in question.

The term can have different connotations depending on the context in which it is used. A &#x27;League MVP&#x27; is the most valuable player in an entire league, and refers to the player whose performance is most excellent in the league. Similarly, a &quot;Team MVP&quot; is the most valuable player on a team, referring to the player whose team contribution is greatest amongst their teammates. In many sports, MVP awards are presented for a specific match—in other words, a player of the match award. This is particularly true for high profile matches like championship games. For example, during a finals championship series, a &#x27;Finals MVP&#x27; award would be bestowed upon the most valuable player in the finals game(s).

Ice hockey player, Wayne Gretzky, has been named MVP more times than any player in the history of the other three North American major professional leagues (MLB, NBA, and NFL). He won the award a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. Barry Bonds is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the National League of Major League Baseball (The American League also awards an MVP), although until the 1930s baseball players were only permitted to win the award one time which limited the number of times Babe Ruth could win. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the NBA MVP award six times, and Michael Jordan won the award five times. Peyton Manning won the NFL MVP five times. Only five other players have won more than two NFL MVP awards: Jim Brown, Johnny Unitas, Brett Favre, Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers.

An important distinction is that the MVP is not be conflated with the winningest player. Although the two are usually somewhat correlated, there are several (albeit rare) prime counterexamples. For instance, in professional basketball, Kareem-Abdul Jabbar won the 1975–76 MVP award even though his team did not qualify for the postseason. Additionally, several other NBA players in history have been awarded MVP, and proceeded to lose in the first round of the postseason. In another instance in professional basketball, Jerry West was awarded the 1969 NBA Finals MVP Award, despite having lost the finals. In the sport of professional football, Johnny Unitas won the 1967 MVP award, despite not qualifying for the playoffs. Likewise, O. J. Simpson won the 1973 MVP award, despite not qualifying for the playoffs. Similar to Jerry West in basketball, Chuck Howley in football won the 1971 Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award despite having lost the Super Bowl V. In 1960, Bobby Richardson won the World Series MVP Award, but lost the World Series. In ice hockey, three players, Al Rollins in 1954, Andy Bathgate in 1959 and Mario Lemieux in 1988 each won the NHL&#x27;s oldest MVP award, the Hart Trophy, with Lemieux also receiving the Ted Lindsay Award (introduced in 1970–71 and voted on by the league&#x27;s players), but did not make the playoffs. Also, Reggie Leach won the 1976 Conn Smythe Trophy, presented to the most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs, while breaking the league record for most playoff goals, but lost the finals. In baseball history, several MVPs have not made the playoffs, and in 2021, none of the six MVP finalists in Major League Baseball played for teams that reached the postseason.

The term is most common in the United States and Canada. In most other countries around the world, &quot;player of the year&quot; is used for a season-spanning award and &quot;player of the match&quot; for individual games. In Australia, Australian rules football clubs and leagues use the term &quot;best and fairest&quot;, while those playing rugby league use &quot;player of the year&quot;, such as the Dally M Medal.

==History==

The first most valuable player award given in North American sports can be traced back to professional baseball in the early 1900s. A group of sportswriters met after the 1911 baseball season to determine the &quot;most important and useful players to the club and to the league&quot;. These athletes would receive The Chalmers Award, named for Hugh Chalmers, a car manufacturer seeking to increase sales of his Chalmers Model 30 automobiles. The first recipients were Ty Cobb, playing for the Detroit Tigers, and Frank Schulte of the Chicago Cubs. The award was discontinued in 1955, after it failed to result in higher car sales. From 1922 to 1928 in the American League and from 1924 to 1929 in the National League, an MVP award was given to &quot;the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club&quot;. Prior winners were not eligible to win the MVP award again during this time. The MVP award, as it is known today in Major League Baseball, was first established in 1931.

==Selection process==

Generally, MVP awards are given at the conclusion of a multi-step process. In most professional sports leagues, the overall pool of players is initially narrowed down to a list of nominees, called finalists, forming a group from which the individual winner is decided based on regular season performance. This process is typically performing by way of a vote, wherein voters are usually either other players, members of the media and/or coaches. The specifics of this process varies across leagues. Some prominent examples of sports that conduct MVP awards are baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, handball and rugby.

===Baseball===

In MLB, MVP voting takes place before the postseason, but the results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what &quot;most valuable&quot; means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters.

===Basketball===

In the NBA, the protocol for selecting the MVP has shifted throughout the year. Through the 1979–80 season, the basketball players themselves comprised the MVP voting bloc up. Since the start of the 1980 NBA season, a panel of broadcasters and sportswriters are brought together to vote on the MVP award. Every person on the panel casts a vote for their first-place selection all the way to their fifth. A first-place vote nets a player 10 points while a second is worth seven, a third worth five, a fourth worth three, and a fifth worth one. At the end of the voting, the player with the most overall points wins the award. The current MVP is Nikola Jokić from the Denver Nuggets.

===American football===
In the NFL, the MVP award is voted upon by a panel of 50 sportswriters at the end of the regular season, before the playoffs, though the results are not announced to the public until the day before the Super Bowl. The sportswriters chosen regularly follow the NFL, and remain mostly consistent from year to year. They are chosen based on expertise and are independent of the league itself.

===Ice hockey===

In the NHL, the MVP award voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 point(s) system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.

===Field lacrosse===

In the PLL, the MVP award (and all other awards) are selected by a two-round voting process. In first round voting, players and coaches will vote to determine nominees for each award. In second round voting, Media, PLL Front Office, and PLL Lacrosse Advisory Board vote on nominees to determine winners. Award winners are announced during the Awards Ceremony at the end of the season.

===Box lacrosse===

In the NLL, the MVP award (and all other awards) nominees are voted on by select media. Each ballot allowed the voting members to rank their top five choices for the award. Each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 point(s) system (similar to the NHL system). The top three vote accumulating individuals will be announced as the finalists for the award. The finalist who accumulated the most points after the voting period ended will be the award winner. In the case of a tie, the tiebreaker is to be decided by the individual who received the most 1st Place votes, followed by the number of 2nd place votes, and so on, until a winner is decided.

===Association football===
MVP is more commonly referred to in association football as &quot;Player of the Season.” In the FIFA World Cup, the award is called the Golden Ball and is chosen by the FIFA Technical Study Group.

In the Premier League, Player of the Season is chosen by a panel assembled by the league&#x27;s sponsors consisting of members of &quot;football&#x27;s governing bodies, the media and fans,” and is announced in the second or third week of May.

==In philosophy of sport==

The concept of the &#x27;most valuable player&#x27; is discussed within the field of philosophy of sport. Philosophers Stephen Kershnar and Neil Feit argue that the concept of the MVP is a fundamentally vague concept, but still valuable in that it promotes the active discussion of different types of excellence found within a specific sport and the weight to be assigned these types, thus leading to a gain for the discussants. Stephen Kershnar termed this vagueness the &#x27;Most Valuable Player Problem&#x27;. He offered a solution to the problem, but later recanted it conceding that the problem remains unsolved.

<text>Santiago de Cuba is the second-largest city in Cuba and the capital city of Santiago de Cuba Province. It lies in the southeastern area of the island, some southeast of the Cuban capital of Havana.

The municipality extends over , and contains the communities of Antonio Maceo, Bravo, Castillo Duany, Daiquirí, El Caney, El Cobre, El Cristo, Guilera, Leyte Vidal, Moncada and Siboney.

Historically Santiago de Cuba was the second-most important city on the island after Havana, and remains the second-largest. It is on a bay connected to the Caribbean Sea and an important sea port. In the 2022, the city of Santiago de Cuba recorded a population of 507,167 people.

== History ==

Santiago de Cuba was the seventh village founded by Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar on 25 July 1515. The settlement was destroyed by fire in 1516, and was immediately rebuilt. This was the starting point of the expeditions led by Juan de Grijalba and Hernán Cortés to the coasts of Mexico in 1518, and in 1538 by Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition to Florida. The first cathedral was built in the city in 1528. From 1522 until 1589, Santiago was the capital of the Spanish colony of Cuba.

The city was plundered by French forces in 1553, and by English forces in 1603. More than 50 years later the English raided again in 1662 under Christopher Myngs.

The city had a huge influx of French and British immigrants in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Some eighteen thousand Saint Dominican refugees, both ethnic French whites and free people of color, and African freedmen, came from Saint-Domingue in the summer of 1803 during the last days of the Haitian slave revolt, which had started in 1791. Other refugees had emigrated from Saint-Domingue earlier in the revolution. Haiti declared its independence as a republic in 1804.

The French were withdrawing surviving troops after suffering heavy losses from warfare and yellow fever. The immigrants, who included freedmen as France had abolished slavery on Saint-Domingue, struggled to maintain their freedom in Cuba, which was still a slave society. Cuba initially allowed only white refugees, women of color, children, and loyal &quot;domestics&quot; to land; French troops and all men of color over the age of thirteen were held off shore, to be rapidly deported to the mainland, as they were considered a revolutionary threat. Some French soldiers joined other refugees in Charleston, South Carolina, or New York City; others went to New Orleans.

The refugees who stayed added to the city&#x27;s eclectic cultural mix, already rich with Spanish and African culture. Some of the women and children were impressed into slavery again, although they had been free. In 1809, after Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s forces invaded Spain, French citizens were ordered out of Cuba. Most went to the United States, and thousands settled in New Orleans, with the freedmen increasing its African culture, as most had been born in Africa. The ethnic French whites and free people of color, generally with longer ties to French culture, added their flavor to the culture of the city as well.

Near the end of the century, during the Spanish–American War, Santiago was the site of the major defeat of Spanish troops at San Juan Hill on 1 July 1898. After capturing the surrounding hills, United States General William Rufus Shafter laid siege to the city. Spain later surrendered to the United States after Admiral William T. Sampson destroyed the Spanish Atlantic fleet just outside Santiago&#x27;s harbor on 3 July 1898. Cuba had declared independence from Spain but was occupied by US troops for several years. Historians suggest they were there to ensure the sugar economy continued to be productive.

José Martí, a Cuban poet, writer, and national hero, is buried in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in this city.

=== Role in the Cuban Revolution ===
Santiago was the home of the 20th-century revolutionary hero Frank País. On 26 July 1953, the Cuban Revolution began with an ill-prepared armed attack on the Moncada Barracks by a small contingent of rebels led by Fidel Castro. Shortly after this disastrous incident, País began talking with students and young working people informally, drawing around him what became an extremely effective urban revolutionary alliance. He and his followers developed highly organized cells, coordinating a large-scale urban resistance that became instrumental in the success of the Cuban Revolution.

País&#x27; group prepared carefully, accruing weapons, collecting money and medical supplies. They published a cheap newsletter that reported news critical of the government, attempting to counter Batista&#x27;s censorship of the mainline press.

In the summer of 1955, País&#x27;s organization merged with Castro&#x27;s 26 July Movement. País became the leader of the new organization in Oriente province. Two years later he was betrayed to the police and was fatally shot after his capture.

On 1 January 1959, Fidel Castro proclaimed the victory of the Cuban Revolution from a balcony on Santiago de Cuba&#x27;s city hall. The ashes of País were interred in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, where Marti had been buried.

== Culture ==

Santiago de Cuba was the hometown of poet José María Heredia. The Teatro Heredia, which hosts theater and cultural events, is named in his honor. The mural relief portrait on the building façade depicts Juan Almeida Bosque, a commander of insurgent forces in the Cuban Revolution.

It is the birthplace of the world-famous Bacardi brand, which was started by Facundo Bacardi Masso in 1862. It now houses a museum that displays the extensive art collection of the Bacardí family.

Santiago de Cuba is well known for its cultural life. Some of Cuba&#x27;s most famous musicians, including Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer and Eliades Ochoa (all of whom participated in the film &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;) and trova composer Ñico Saquito (Benito Antonio Fernández Ortiz) were born in the city or in one of the villages surrounding it. They have contributed to the typical, country-like music of the city.

Santiago de Cuba is well known for its traditional music, most notably son, from which salsa has been derived. The city celebrates Carnival in July, although it typically precedes Lent. With the city preoccupied with the holiday, Castro chose 26 July to enter undetected into the city to assault the Moncada Barracks. During Carnival, traditional conga music is played in the streets on a traditional pentatonic trumpet, called the trompeta china.
A relatively high number of residents of the city adhere to Afro-Cuban religions, most notably santería. The city hosts an important community of descendants of immigrants from the early 19th century from what is now Haiti. Some aspects of the religious &quot;vodún&quot; heritage of the city can be traced back to this community.

The city features several historic architectural styles, from Baroque to neoclassical. Many colonial buildings have huge windows and balconies, where people can enjoy views of the steep streets and wooded hills. Preserved historical treasures include the first Spanish dwelling in the Americas, the first cathedral in Cuba, Cobre mine, the first copper mine opened in the Americas; and the first Cuban museum.

=== World Heritage Site ===

The local citadel of San Pedro de la Roca is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as &quot;the most complete, best-preserved example of Spanish-American military architecture, based on Italian and Renaissance design principles&quot;.

=== World Heritage Biosphere Reserve ===
The Baconao Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Biosphere Reserve List in 1987.

== Geography ==

Santiago de Cuba is located in the southeast of the island at coordinates 20° 01&#x27; 17.42&quot; N 75° 49&#x27; 45.75&quot; W, some of the capital, Havana. Historically Santiago de Cuba has been the second-largest city in Cuba, behind Havana. It features a bay connected to the Caribbean Sea and is a major port. The municipality of Santiago de Cuba, its capital city, is the most populated municipality of Cuba.

The city has developed at the foot of the bay and is surrounded on land by the Sierra Maestra. It has a hot and humid climate. The landscapes includes the complexity of urban elements, and natural greenery and marine settings, all at the same time. It has an irregular offset to the bay, which contributed to the development of an urban setting where the avenues and streets are steep or descend.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Santiago de Cuba has a tropical savanna climate with no significant wet and dry periods through the year.
== Demographics ==

In the 2012 population census the city of Santiago de Cuba recorded a population of 431,272 people.

== Transportation ==
Santiago is served by Antonio Maceo Airport. Cubana de Aviación connects the city with Havana, Port Au Prince, and Santo Domingo, with other airlines connecting to other cities in the Caribbean and North America.

The public transport in the city, as in Havana, is carried out by two divisions, Omnibus Metropolitanos (OM) and Metrobus. The Metrobus serves the inner-city urban area, with a maximum distance of . Omnibus Metropolitanos (OM) connects the adjacent towns and municipalities in the metropolitan area with the city center, with a maximum distance of .

Ferrocarriles de Cuba railways and ASTRO inter-city buses connect the city with Havana&#x27;s Central Railway Station and with most other main cities of Cuba. The main railway station, also known as &quot;General Senén Casas&quot;, is an important hub of the national railways. Located in the city centre, near the harbour, it was completely rebuilt in 1997.

The city of Santiago is also crossed by the Carretera Central highway and by the southern section of the A1 motorway, largely unbuilt, that will link it with Havana when it is completed.

<text>Ángela Altagracia Carrasco Rodríguez (born January 23, 1951) is a Dominican singer. Carrasco was born in Dajabón. At age 7, she first appeared in an advertising world, singing the theme for a drink to a tune that composed by Salvador Sturla. Carrasco was part of a group of Latin American divas in the 1970s, including Susana Giménez, Charytín Goyco, Iris Chacón, Ednita Nazario, and Yolandita Monge.

== Early life and career ==

Carrasco moved from her native country to Spain, where she enjoyed success. She had her first hit when she was chosen to play Mary Magdalene together with Camilo Sesto in the first Spanish version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in the mid-1970s. She also hit the airwaves in the late 1970s, with songs such as &quot;Cariño Mio&quot; (&quot;Love of Mine&quot;) and &quot;Quererte a Ti&quot; (&quot;Loving You&quot;). &quot;Quererte a Ti&quot; in particular gave her much exposure all over Latin America, in the United States and Europe. She later had a great comeback with albums such as &quot;Dama del Caribe&quot; and &quot;Candela&quot;, as well as &quot;Angela&quot;. Her single &quot;Boca Rosa&quot; peaked at number-one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart in late 1988.

Angela continued to make music, and after her &quot;A Puro Dolor&quot;, she released a new album, &quot;Muy Personal&quot;, which included some new songs in new styles as well as remakes of some of her most famous songs such as &quot;No, no hay nadie mas&quot; and &quot;No se como amarle&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; &quot;Superstar&quot;). She has also taken several steps into theater. In 1993, Carrasco earned the Lo Nuestro Award for Tropical Female Artist of the Year.

<doc id="235029" wikidata="Q601053" url="?curid=235029" title="Nth root">
<text>In mathematics, an th root of a number is a number which, when raised to the power of , yields : formula_1

The positive integer is called the &quot;index&quot; or &quot;degree&quot;, and the number of which the root is taken is the &quot;radicand.&quot; A root of degree 2 is called a &quot;square root&quot; and a root of degree 3, a &quot;cube root&quot;. Roots of higher degree are referred by using ordinal numbers, as in &quot;fourth root&quot;, &quot;twentieth root&quot;, etc. The computation of an th root is a root extraction.

For example, is a square root of , since , and is also a square root of , since .

The th root of is written as formula_2 using the radical symbol formula_3. The square root is usually written as , with the degree omitted. Taking the th root of a number, for fixed , is the inverse of raising a number to the th power, and can be written as a fractional exponent:

formula_4

For a positive real number , formula_5 denotes the positive square root of and formula_2 denotes the positive real th root. A negative real number has no real-valued square roots, but when is treated as a complex number it has two imaginary square roots, and , where is the imaginary unit.

In general, any non-zero complex number has distinct complex-valued th roots, equally distributed around a complex circle of constant absolute value. (The th root of is zero with multiplicity , and this circle degenerates to a point.) Extracting the th roots of a complex number can thus be taken to be a multivalued function. By convention the principal value of this function, called the principal root and denoted , is taken to be the th root with the greatest real part and in the special case when is a negative real number, the one with a positive imaginary part. The principal root of a positive real number is thus also a positive real number. As a function, the principal root is continuous in the whole complex plane, except along the negative real axis.

An unresolved root, especially one using the radical symbol, is sometimes referred to as a surd or a radical. Any expression containing a radical, whether it is a square root, a cube root, or a higher root, is called a radical expression, and if it contains no transcendental functions or transcendental numbers it is called an &quot;algebraic expression&quot;.

Roots are used for determining the radius of convergence of a power series with the root test. The th roots of 1 are called roots of unity and play a fundamental role in various areas of mathematics, such as number theory, theory of equations, and Fourier transform.

==History==
An archaic term for the operation of taking &quot;n&quot;th roots is &quot;radication&quot;.

==Definition and notation==
An &quot;th root&quot; of a number &quot;x&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, is any of the &quot;n&quot; real or complex numbers &quot;r&quot; whose &quot;n&quot;th power is &quot;x&quot;:

formula_7

Every positive real number &quot;x&quot; has a single positive &quot;n&quot;th root, called the principal &quot;n&quot;th root, which is written formula_2. For &quot;n&quot; equal to 2 this is called the principal square root and the &quot;n&quot; is omitted. The &quot;n&quot;th root can also be represented using exponentiation as &quot;x&quot;.

For even values of &quot;n&quot;, positive numbers also have a negative &quot;n&quot;th root, while negative numbers do not have a real &quot;n&quot;th root. For odd values of &quot;n&quot;, every negative number &quot;x&quot; has a real negative &quot;n&quot;th root. For example, −2 has a real 5th root, formula_9 but −2 does not have any real 6th roots.

Every non-zero number &quot;x&quot;, real or complex, has &quot;n&quot; different complex number &quot;n&quot;th roots. (In the case &quot;x&quot; is real, this count includes any real &quot;n&quot;th roots.) The only complex root of 0 is 0.

The &quot;n&quot;th roots of almost all numbers (all integers except the &quot;n&quot;th powers, and all rationals except the quotients of two &quot;n&quot;th powers) are irrational. For example,

formula_10

All &quot;n&quot;th roots of rational numbers are algebraic numbers, and all &quot;n&quot;th roots of integers are algebraic integers.

The term &quot;surd&quot; traces back to Al-Khwarizmi (), who referred to rational and irrational numbers as &quot;audible&quot; and &quot;inaudible&quot;, respectively. This later led to the Arabic word (, meaning &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot;) for &quot;irrational number&quot; being translated into Latin as (meaning &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;mute&quot;). Gerard of Cremona (), Fibonacci (1202), and then Robert Recorde (1551) all used the term to refer to &quot;unresolved irrational roots&quot;, that is, expressions of the form formula_11, in which formula_12 and formula_13 are integer numerals and the whole expression denotes an irrational number. Irrational numbers of the form formula_14 where formula_15 is rational, are called &quot;pure quadratic surds&quot;; irrational numbers of the form formula_16, where formula_15 and formula_18 are rational, are called &quot;mixed quadratic surds&quot;.

===Square roots===
A square root of a number &quot;x&quot; is a number &quot;r&quot; which, when squared, becomes &quot;x&quot;:

formula_19

Every positive real number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. For example, the two square roots of 25 are 5 and −5. The positive square root is also known as the principal square root, and is denoted with a radical sign:

formula_20

Since the square of every real number is nonnegative, negative numbers do not have real square roots. However, for every negative real number there are two imaginary square roots. For example, the square roots of −25 are 5&quot;i&quot; and −5&quot;i&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; represents a number whose square is .

===Cube roots===
A cube root of a number &quot;x&quot; is a number &quot;r&quot; whose cube is &quot;x&quot;:

formula_21

Every real number &quot;x&quot; has exactly one real cube root, written formula_22. For example,

formula_23

Every real number has two additional complex cube roots.

==Identities and properties==
Expressing the degree of an &quot;n&quot;th root in its exponent form, as in formula_24, makes it easier to manipulate powers and roots. If formula_15 is a non-negative real number,

formula_26

Every non-negative number has exactly one non-negative real &quot;n&quot;th root, and so the rules for operations with surds involving non-negative radicands formula_15 and formula_18 are straightforward within the real numbers:

formula_29

Subtleties can occur when taking the &quot;n&quot;th roots of negative or complex numbers. For instance:

formula_30

but, rather,

formula_31

Since the rule formula_32 strictly holds for non-negative real radicands only, its application leads to the inequality in the first step above.

==Simplified form of a radical expression==

A non-nested radical expression is said to be in simplified form if no factor of the radicand can be written as a power greater than or equal to the index; there are no fractions inside the radical sign; and there are no radicals in the denominator.

For example, to write the radical expression formula_33 in simplified form, we can proceed as follows. First, look for a perfect square under the square root sign and remove it:

formula_34

Next, there is a fraction under the radical sign, which we change as follows:

formula_35

Finally, we remove the radical from the denominator as follows:

formula_36

When there is a denominator involving surds it is always possible to find a factor to multiply both numerator and denominator by to simplify the expression. For instance using the factorization of the sum of two cubes:

formula_37

Simplifying radical expressions involving nested radicals can be quite difficult. In particular, denesting is not always possible, and when possible, it may involve advanced Galois theory. Moreover, when complete denesting is impossible, there is no general canonical form such that the equality of two numbers can be tested by simply looking at their canonical expressions. 

For example, it is not obvious that

formula_38

The above can be derived through:

formula_39

Let formula_40, with and coprime and positive integers. Then formula_41 is rational if and only if both formula_42 and formula_43 are integers, which means that both and are &quot;n&quot;th powers of some integer.

==Infinite series==
The radical or root may be represented by the infinite series:

formula_44

with formula_45. This expression can be derived from the binomial series.

==Computing principal roots==

===Using Newton&#x27;s method===

The th root of a number can be computed with Newton&#x27;s method, which starts with an initial guess and then iterates using the recurrence relation

formula_46

until the desired precision is reached. For computational efficiency, the recurrence relation is commonly rewritten 

formula_47

This allows to have only one exponentiation, and to compute once for all the first factor of each term.

For example, to find the fifth root of 34, we plug in and (initial guess). The first 5 iterations are, approximately:


(All correct digits shown.)

The approximation is accurate to 25 decimal places and is good for 51.

Newton&#x27;s method can be modified to produce various generalized continued fractions for the &quot;n&quot;th root. For example,

formula_48

=== Digit-by-digit calculation of principal roots of decimal (base 10) numbers ===

Building on the digit-by-digit calculation of a square root, it can be seen that the formula used there, formula_49, or formula_50, follows a pattern involving Pascal&#x27;s triangle. For the &quot;n&quot;th root of a number formula_51 is defined as the value of element formula_52 in row formula_12 of Pascal&#x27;s Triangle such that formula_54, we can rewrite the expression as formula_55. For convenience, call the result of this expression formula_56. Using this more general expression, any positive principal root can be computed, digit-by-digit, as follows.

Write the original number in decimal form. The numbers are written similar to the long division algorithm, and, as in long division, the root will be written on the line above. Now separate the digits into groups of digits equating to the root being taken, starting from the decimal point and going both left and right. The decimal point of the root will be above the decimal point of the radicand. One digit of the root will appear above each group of digits of the original number.

Beginning with the left-most group of digits, do the following procedure for each group:

# Starting on the left, bring down the most significant (leftmost) group of digits not yet used (if all the digits have been used, write &quot;0&quot; the number of times required to make a group) and write them to the right of the remainder from the previous step (on the first step, there will be no remainder). In other words, multiply the remainder by formula_57 and add the digits from the next group. This will be the current value &quot;c&quot;.
# Find &quot;p&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, as follows:
#* Let formula_58 be the part of the root found so far, ignoring any decimal point. (For the first step, formula_59 and formula_60).
#* Determine the greatest digit formula_61 such that formula_62.
#* Place the digit formula_61 as the next digit of the root, i.e., above the group of digits you just brought down. Thus the next &quot;p&quot; will be the old &quot;p&quot; times 10 plus &quot;x&quot;.
# Subtract formula_56 from formula_65 to form a new remainder.
# If the remainder is zero and there are no more digits to bring down, then the algorithm has terminated. Otherwise go back to step 1 for another iteration.

===Logarithmic calculation===

The principal &quot;n&quot;th root of a positive number can be computed using logarithms. Starting from the equation that defines &quot;r&quot; as an &quot;n&quot;th root of &quot;x&quot;, namely formula_66 with &quot;x&quot; positive and therefore its principal root &quot;r&quot; also positive, one takes logarithms of both sides (any base of the logarithm will do) to obtain

formula_67

The root &quot;r&quot; is recovered from this by taking the antilog:

formula_68

(Note: That formula shows &quot;b&quot; raised to the power of the result of the division, not &quot;b&quot; multiplied by the result of the division.)

For the case in which &quot;x&quot; is negative and &quot;n&quot; is odd, there is one real root &quot;r&quot; which is also negative. This can be found by first multiplying both sides of the defining equation by −1 to obtain formula_69 then proceeding as before to find |&quot;r&quot;|, and using .

==Geometric constructibility==

The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to use compass and straightedge to construct a length equal to the square root of a given length, when an auxiliary line of unit length is given. In 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved that an &quot;n&quot;th root of a given length cannot be constructed if &quot;n&quot; is not a power of 2.

==Complex roots==
Every complex number other than 0 has &quot;n&quot; different &quot;n&quot;th roots.

===Square roots===

The two square roots of a complex number are always negatives of each other. For example, the square roots of are and , and the square roots of are

formula_70

If we express a complex number in polar form, then the square root can be obtained by taking the square root of the radius and halving the angle:

formula_71

A &quot;principal&quot; root of a complex number may be chosen in various ways, for example

formula_72

which introduces a branch cut in the complex plane along the positive real axis with the condition , or along the negative real axis with .

Using the first(last) branch cut the principal square root formula_73 maps formula_74 to the half plane with non-negative imaginary(real) part. The last branch cut is presupposed in mathematical software like Matlab or Scilab.

===Roots of unity===

The number 1 has &quot;n&quot; different &quot;n&quot;th roots in the complex plane, namely

formula_75

where

formula_76

These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane, at angles which are multiples of formula_77. For example, the square roots of unity are 1 and −1, and the fourth roots of unity are 1, formula_52, −1, and formula_79.

===&quot;n&quot;th roots===

Every complex number has &quot;n&quot; different &quot;n&quot;th roots in the complex plane. These are

formula_80

where &quot;η&quot; is a single &quot;n&quot;th root, and 1, &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;, ... &quot;ω&quot; are the &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity. For example, the four different fourth roots of 2 are

formula_81

In polar form, a single &quot;n&quot;th root may be found by the formula

formula_82

Here &quot;r&quot; is the magnitude (the modulus, also called the absolute value) of the number whose root is to be taken; if the number can be written as &quot;a+bi&quot; then formula_83. Also, formula_84 is the angle formed as one pivots on the origin counterclockwise from the positive horizontal axis to a ray going from the origin to the number; it has the properties that formula_85 formula_86 and formula_87

Thus finding &quot;n&quot;th roots in the complex plane can be segmented into two steps. First, the magnitude of all the &quot;n&quot;th roots is the &quot;n&quot;th root of the magnitude of the original number. Second, the angle between the positive horizontal axis and a ray from the origin to one of the &quot;n&quot;th roots is formula_88, where formula_84 is the angle defined in the same way for the number whose root is being taken. Furthermore, all &quot;n&quot; of the &quot;n&quot;th roots are at equally spaced angles from each other.

If &quot;n&quot; is even, a complex number&#x27;s &quot;n&quot;th roots, of which there are an even number, come in additive inverse pairs, so that if a number &quot;r&quot;1 is one of the &quot;n&quot;th roots then &quot;r&quot;2 = –&quot;r&quot;1 is another. This is because raising the latter&#x27;s coefficient –1 to the &quot;n&quot;th power for even &quot;n&quot; yields 1: that is, (–&quot;r&quot;1) = (–1) × &quot;r&quot;1 = &quot;r&quot;1.

As with square roots, the formula above does not define a continuous function over the entire complex plane, but instead has a branch cut at points where &quot;θ&quot; / &quot;n&quot; is discontinuous.

==Solving polynomials==
It was once conjectured that all polynomial equations could be solved algebraically (that is, that all roots of a polynomial could be expressed in terms of a finite number of radicals and elementary operations). However, while this is true for third degree polynomials (cubics) and fourth degree polynomials (quartics), the Abel–Ruffini theorem (1824) shows that this is not true in general when the degree is 5 or greater. For example, the solutions of the equation

formula_90

cannot be expressed in terms of radicals. (&quot;cf.&quot; quintic equation)

== Proof of irrationality for non-perfect &quot;n&quot;th power &quot;x&quot; ==
Assume that formula_2 is rational. That is, it can be reduced to a fraction formula_92, where and are integers without a common factor.

This means that formula_93.

Since &quot;x&quot; is an integer, formula_94and formula_95must share a common factor if formula_96. This means that if formula_96, formula_98 is not in simplest form. Thus &quot;b&quot; should equal 1.

Since formula_99 and formula_100, formula_101.

This means that formula_102 and thus, formula_103. This implies that formula_2 is an integer. Since is not a perfect th power, this is impossible. Thus formula_2 is irrational.

<text>The word thou () is a second-person singular pronoun in English. It is now largely archaic, having been replaced in most contexts by the word &quot;you&quot;, although it remains in use in parts of Northern England and in Scots (). &quot;Thou&quot; is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is thee (functioning as both accusative and dative); the possessive is thy (adjective) or thine (as an adjective before a vowel or as a possessive pronoun); and the reflexive is thyself. When &quot;thou&quot; is the grammatical subject of a finite verb in the indicative mood, the verb form typically ends in &quot;-(e)st&quot; (e.g., &quot;thou goest&quot;, &quot;thou do(e)st&quot;), but in some cases just &quot;-t&quot; (e.g., &quot;thou art&quot;; &quot;thou shalt&quot;).

Originally, &quot;thou&quot; was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun &quot;ye&quot;, derived from an ancient Indo-European root. In Middle English, &quot;thou&quot; was sometimes represented with a scribal abbreviation that put a small &quot;u&quot; over the letter thorn: þͧ (later, in printing presses that lacked this letter, this abbreviation was sometimes rendered as yͧ). Starting in the 1300s, &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; were used to express familiarity, formality, or contempt, for addressing strangers, superiors, or inferiors, or in situations when indicating singularity to avoid confusion was needed; concurrently, the plural forms, &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, began to also be used for singular: typically for addressing rulers, superiors, equals, inferiors, parents, younger persons, and significant others. In the 17th century, &quot;thou&quot; fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in regional dialects of England and Scotland, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. The use of the pronoun is also still present in Christian prayer and in poetry.

Early English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to God in French (in Protestantism both in past and present, in Catholicism since the post–Vatican II reforms), German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Scottish Gaelic and many others (all of which maintain the use of an &quot;informal&quot; singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the King James Version of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic and Koine Greek between singular and plural second-person pronouns and verb forms, so they used &quot;thou&quot;, &quot;thee&quot;, &quot;thy&quot;, and &quot;thine&quot; for singular, and &quot;ye&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, and &quot;yours&quot; for plural.

In standard Modern English, &quot;thou&quot; continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in wedding ceremonies (&quot;I thee wed&quot;), in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language, and in certain fixed phrases such as &quot;&quot;. For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as &quot;yinz&quot;, &quot;yous&quot; and &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; or the colloquial &quot;you guys&quot; (&quot;you lot&quot; in England). &quot;Ye&quot; remains common in some parts of Ireland, but the examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.

==Grammar==
Because &quot;thou&quot; has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.

===Declension===
The English personal pronouns have standardized declension according to the following table:
===Conjugation===
Verb forms used after &quot;thou&quot; generally end in &quot;-est&quot; (pronounced ) or &quot;-st&quot; in the indicative mood in both the present and the past tenses. These forms are used for both strong and weak verbs.

Typical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow. The &quot;e&quot; in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized. In verse, the choice about whether to use the &quot;e&quot; often depended upon considerations of meter.

*to know: &quot;thou knowest&quot;, thou knewest
*to drive: &quot;thou drivest&quot;, thou drovest
*to make: &quot;thou makest&quot;, thou madest
*to love: &quot;thou lovest&quot;, thou lovedst
*to want: &quot;thou wantest&quot;, thou wantedst

Modal verbs also have &quot;-(e)st&quot; added to their forms:
*can: &quot;thou canst&quot;
*could: &quot;thou couldst&quot;
*may: &quot;thou mayest&quot;
*might: &quot;thou mightst&quot;
*should: &quot;thou shouldst&quot;
*would: &quot;thou wouldst&quot;
*ought to: &quot;thou oughtest to&quot;

A few verbs have irregular &quot;thou&quot; forms:
*to be: &quot;thou art&quot; (or &quot;thou beest&quot;), &quot;thou wast&quot; (or subjunctive &quot;thou wert&quot;; originally &quot;thou were&quot;)
*to have: &quot;thou hast&quot;, &quot;thou hadst&quot;
*to do: &quot;thou dost&quot; (or &quot;thou doest&quot; in non-auxiliary use) and &quot;thou didst&quot;
*shall: &quot;thou shalt&quot;
*will: &quot;thou wilt&quot;

A few others are not inflected:
*must: &quot;thou must&quot;

In Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was &quot;-es&quot;. This came down unchanged from Indo-European and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: Russian знаешь, &quot;znayesh&quot;, thou knowest; Latin &quot;amas&quot;, thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, &quot;znayet&quot;, he knoweth, Latin &quot;amat&quot; he loveth.) The from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related German and West Frisian languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the consonant of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou).

There are some speakers of modern English that use thou/thee but use thee as the subject and conjugate the word with is/was, i.e. &quot;thee is, thee was, thee has, thee speaks, thee spoke, thee can, thee could&quot;. However this is not considered standard.

==== Comparison ====
In Dutch, the equivalent of &quot;thou&quot;, &quot;du&quot;, also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of &quot;you&quot;, &quot;gij&quot; (later &quot;jij&quot; or &quot;u&quot;), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by &quot;jullie&quot; (&quot;compare&quot; English &quot;y’all&quot;).

In the subjunctive and imperative moods, the ending in &quot;-(e)st&quot; is dropped (although it is generally retained in &quot;thou wert&quot;, the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb &quot;to be&quot;). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after &quot;if&quot; and the poetic &quot;and&quot;.

:If thou be Johan, I tell it thee, right with a good advice ...;
:Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart ...
:I do wish thou wert a dog, that I might love thee something ...
:And thou bring Alexander and his paramour before the Emperor, I&#x27;ll be Actaeon ...
:O WERT thou in the cauld blast, ... I&#x27;d shelter thee ...

In modern regional English dialects that use &quot;thou&quot; or some variant, such as in Yorkshire and Lancashire, it often takes the third person form of the verb &quot;-s&quot;. This comes from a merging of Early Modern English second person singular ending &quot;-st&quot; and third person singular ending &quot;-s&quot; into &quot;-s&quot; (the latter a northern variation of &quot;-þ&quot; (&quot;-th&quot;)).

The present indicative form &quot;art&quot; (&quot;þu eart&quot;) goes back to West Saxon Old English (see OED &quot;s.v. be&quot; IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (&quot;e.g.&quot; in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from the North, &quot;cf.&quot; Icelandic &quot;þú ert&quot;. The preterite indicative of &quot;be&quot; is generally &quot;thou wast&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Thou&quot; originates from Old English , and ultimately via Grimm&#x27;s law from the Proto-Indo-European *&quot;tu&quot;, with the expected Germanic vowel lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an open syllable. &quot;Thou&quot; is therefore cognate with Icelandic and Old Norse , German and Continental Scandinavian , Latin and all major Romance languages, Irish, Kurdish, Lithuanian and Latvian or , Greek (), Slavic ты / &quot;ty&quot; or ти / &quot;ti&quot;, Armenian (/), Hindi तू (), Bengali: তুই (&quot;tui&quot;), Persian () and Sanskrit त्वम् (). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.

==History==
===Old and Middle English===

In Old English, &quot;thou&quot; was governed by a simple rule: &quot;thou&quot; addressed one person, and &quot;ye&quot; more than one. Beginning in the 1300s &quot;thou&quot; was gradually replaced by the plural &quot;ye&quot; as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, &quot;thou&quot; remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.

The practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the T–V distinction and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing kings and other aristocrats in the plural. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, &quot;tu&quot; was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form &quot;vous&quot; was reserved and formal.

===General decline in Early Modern English===
Fairly suddenly in the 17th century, &quot;thou&quot; began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in regional dialects of England and Scotland farther from London, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of &quot;thou&quot; in the 17th century include the increasing identification of &quot;you&quot; with &quot;polite society&quot; and the uncertainty of using &quot;thou&quot; for inferiors versus &quot;you&quot; for superiors (with &quot;you&quot; being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.

In the 18th century, Samuel Johnson, in &quot;A Grammar of the English Tongue&quot;, wrote: &quot;in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular&quot;, implying that &quot;thou&quot; was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while &quot;you&quot; could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the West Midlands (specifically, Lichfield, Staffordshire), where the usage of &quot;thou&quot; persists until the present day (see below), so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of southern British English, &quot;thou&quot; had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650. &quot;Thou&quot; persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.

One notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns &quot;thou&quot;, &quot;thy&quot;, and &quot;thee&quot; is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use &quot;thou&quot; (rather than &quot;you&quot;) when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend or family member, or a hated wrongdoer.

==Usage==
===Use as a verb===

Many European languages contain verbs meaning &quot;to address with the informal pronoun&quot;, such as German , French , Spanish and , Swedish , Dutch , Ukrainian (), Russian (), Polish , Romanian , Hungarian , Finnish , etc. Additionally, the Norwegian noun refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the // formal forms in common use. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603, when Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to insult Raleigh by saying,

:&quot;I thou thee, thou traitor!&quot;
::In modern English: &quot;I &quot;thou&quot; you, you traitor!&quot;

here using &quot;thou&quot; as a verb meaning &quot;to call (someone) &quot;thou&quot; or &quot;thee&quot;&quot;. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in Yorkshire dialect for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:

:&quot;Don&#x27;t thee tha them as thas thee!&quot; 
::In modern English: &quot;Don&#x27;t you &quot;tha&quot; those who &quot;tha&quot; you!&quot;
::In other words: &quot;Don&#x27;t use the familiar form &quot;tha&quot; towards those who refer to you as &quot;tha&quot;.&quot; (&quot;tha&quot; being the local dialectal variant of &quot;thou&quot;)

And similar in Lancashire dialect:

:&quot;Don&#x27;t thee me, thee; I&#x27;s you to thee!&quot;
::In standard English: &quot;Don&#x27;t &quot;thee&quot; me, you! I&#x27;m &quot;you&quot; to you!&quot;

===Religious uses===
====Christianity====
Many conservative Christians use &quot;Thee, Thou, Thy and Thine when addressing God&quot; in prayer; in the Plymouth Brethren catechism &quot;Gathering Unto His Name&quot;, Norman Crawford explains the practice:

When referring to God, &quot;thou&quot; (as with other pronouns) is often capitalized, e.g. &quot;For Thou hast delivered my soul from death&quot; ().

As William Tyndale translated the Bible into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his Hebrew and Greek originals. He used &quot;thou&quot; for the singular and &quot;ye&quot; for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the addressee. Tyndale&#x27;s usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible and the later King James Bible. But as the use of &quot;thou&quot; in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century, its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation. The Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun &quot;thou&quot; exclusively to address God, using &quot;you&quot; in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the Psalms and similar text in devotional use. The New American Standard Bible (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 Revised English Bible dropped all forms of &quot;thou&quot; that had appeared in the earlier New English Bible (1970). The New Revised Standard Version (1989) omits &quot;thou&quot; entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of &quot;thou&quot; in Bible translation to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity.

The 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which is still an authorized form of worship in the Church of England and much of the Anglican Communion, also uses the word &quot;thou&quot; to refer to the singular second person.

Quakers traditionally used &quot;thee&quot; as an ordinary pronoun as part of their testimony of simplicity—a practice continued by certain Conservative Friends; the stereotype has them saying &quot;thee&quot; for both nominative and accusative cases. This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by George Fox, who called it &quot;plain speaking&quot;, as an attempt to preserve the egalitarian familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the north Midlands area. The preservation of &quot;thee&quot; in Quaker speech may relate to this history. Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of &quot;plain speaking&quot; often use the &quot;thee&quot; form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, &quot;is thee&quot; or &quot;was thee&quot;.

In Latter-day Saint prayer tradition, the terms &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; are always and exclusively used to address God, as a mark of respect.

====Islam and Baháʼí Faith====
In many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the Ahmadiyya, the terms &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; are used. One particular example is The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation, translated by Maulvi Sher Ali.

In the English translations of the scripture of the Baháʼí Faith, the terms &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; are also used. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original Arabic or Persian to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.

===Literary uses===

====Shakespeare====
Like his contemporaries, William Shakespeare uses &quot;thou&quot; both in the intimate, French-style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other &quot;ye&quot; or &quot;you&quot; as often as they call each other &quot;thou&quot;, sometimes in ways that can be analysed for meaning, but often apparently at random.

For example, in the following passage from &quot;Henry IV&quot;, Shakespeare has Falstaff use both forms with Henry. Initially using &quot;you&quot; in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate &quot;thou&quot;.

:Prince: Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? ...

:Falstaff: Indeed, you come near me now, Hal ... And, I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art a king, as God save thy GraceMajesty, I should say; for grace thou wilt have none –

While in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet&#x27;s antagonism towards his mother.

:Queen Gertrude: Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. &quot;[she means King Claudius, Hamlet&#x27;s uncle and stepfather]&quot;

:Hamlet: Mother, you have my father much offended. &quot;[he means King Hamlet, his late father]&quot;

====More recent uses====
Except where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of &quot;thou&quot; has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn ritual occasions, in readings from the &quot;King James Bible&quot;, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as God, a skylark, Achilles, and even &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;. In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Darth Vader addresses the Emperor with the words: &quot;What is thy bidding, my master?&quot; In Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;, he promises his beloved that he will reform, saying &quot;I will make it all up to thee.&quot; In Diana Ross&#x27;s song, &quot;Upside Down&quot;, (written by Chic&#x27;s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) there is the lyric &quot;Respectfully I say to thee I&#x27;m aware that you&#x27;re cheatin&#x27;.&quot; In &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, Michael Jackson sings, &quot;Hold me / Like the River Jordan / And I will then say to thee / You are my friend.&quot; Notably, both Ross&#x27;s and Jackson&#x27;s lyrics combine &quot;thee&quot; with the usual form &quot;you&quot;.

The converse—the use of the second person singular ending &quot;-est&quot; for the third person—also occurs (&quot;So sayest Thor!&quot;―spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern parody and pastiche in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; are often transposed.

==Current usage==
&quot;You&quot; is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, &quot;thou&quot; has persisted, and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; in the Southern United States or &quot;yous&quot; by some Australians and heard in what are generally considered working class dialects in and near cities in the northeastern United States. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language. It also survives as a fossil word in the commonly-used phrase &quot;holier-than-thou&quot;.

===Persistence of second-person singular===
In traditional dialects, &quot;thou&quot; is used in the English counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and some western parts of Nottinghamshire. The Survey of Anglo-Welsh Dialects, which began in 1968, found that &quot;thou&quot; persisted in scattered sites across Clwyd, Dyfed, Powys, and West Glamorgan. Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person: for example, &quot;thee coost&quot; (standard English: &quot;you could&quot;, archaic: &quot;thou couldst&quot;), in northern Staffordshire. Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved. The possessive is often written as &quot;thy&quot; in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed &quot;tha&quot;, and the possessive pronoun has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming &quot;yours&quot; or the local word &quot;your&#x27;n&quot; (from &quot;your one&quot;):

The apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective, and genitive forms of this pronoun on the one hand, and the modern possessive form on the other, may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing &quot;tha&quot; to fall into disuse, although a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.

Some other variants are specific to certain areas: In Sheffield, the initial consonant was pronounced as /d/, which led to the nickname of the &quot;dee-dahs&quot; for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, &quot;ta&quot; was used as an unstressed shortening of &quot;thou&quot;, which can be found in the song &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;, although K.M. Petyt found this form to have been largely displaced from urban West Yorkshire in his 1970-1 fieldwork.

In rural North Lancashire between Lancaster and the North Yorkshire border &quot;tha&quot; is preserved in colloquial phrases such as &quot;What would &quot;tha&quot; like for &quot;thi&quot; tea?&quot; (What would you like for your dinner), and appen &quot;tha&quot; waint&quot; (&quot;perhaps you won&#x27;t&quot;&quot;happen&quot; being the dialect word for &quot;perhaps&quot;) and &quot;&quot;tha&quot; knows&quot; (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.

A well-known routine by comedian Peter Kay, from Bolton, Greater Manchester (historically in Lancashire), features the phrase &quot;Has tha nowt moist?”
(Have you got nothing moist?).

The use of the word &quot;thee&quot; in the song &quot;I Predict a Riot&quot; by Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs (&quot;Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee&quot;) caused some comment by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the Yorkshire dialect.

The word &quot;thee&quot; is also used in the song Upside Down &quot;Respectfully, I say to thee / I&#x27;m aware that you&#x27;re cheating&quot;.

The use of the phrase &quot;tha knows&quot; has been widely used in various songs by Arctic Monkeys, a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. Alex Turner, the band&#x27;s lead singer, has also often replaced words with &quot;tha knows&quot; during live versions of the songs.

The use persists somewhat in the West Country dialects, albeit somewhat affected. Some of the Wurzels&#x27; songs include &quot;Drink Up Thy Zider&quot; and &quot;Sniff Up Thy Snuff&quot;.

&quot;Thoo&quot; has also been used in the Orcadian Scots dialect in place of the singular informal &quot;thou&quot;. In Shetland dialect, the other form of Insular Scots, &quot;du&quot; and &quot;dee&quot; are used. The word &quot;thou&quot; has been reported in the North Northern Scots Cromarty dialect as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and by the time of its extinction only in occasional use.

<doc id="235047" wikidata="Q572173" url="?curid=235047" title="Issues (Korn album)">
<text>Issues is the fourth studio album by American nu metal band Korn. It was released on November 16, 1999, through Immortal Records. The album was promoted throughout 2000 by the band&#x27;s highly successful Sick and Twisted Tour.

==Recording and production==

During one of the band&#x27;s recording sessions, journalist Chris Connelly asked about how the recording was coming along, to which drummer David Silveria responded that it &quot;Sounds like the music is a little more simplified and heavier. Kind of heavier grooves, more than the last couple. So kind of more similar to the beginning, except Jon is a much better singer now, so it&#x27;s all coming together.&quot;

In October 1999, Korn posted &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; on their website as a free MP3 download, although it was against the advice of its attorneys. A statement on the band&#x27;s site relates: &quot;We&#x27;re so psyched about [the new album] that we wanted to give all you guys, the true Korn fans—a gift from us.&quot; Also at this time, the band attempted to start an online chain email, by posting the letter online and asking fans to email the letter to 10 other people and to then sign the &quot;I Downloaded the Korn Single for Free&quot; guestbook on the band&#x27;s site. For each person who signed, Korn donated 25 cents to the charities Childhelp USA and Children of the Night. It raised over $250,000.

The album featured four different covers each designed by Korn fans as part of an MTV contest (the winning cover, submitted in a pizza box, was designed by Alfredo Carlos; another album cover for special limited edition of the album features a cartoonish half-caricature for the band). There was also a fifth cover selected for the limited tour edition of the album.

==Release and commercial performance==

&quot;Issues&quot; went to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 575,000 copies, preventing both Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;2001&quot; (which sold 516,000) and Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; from going to number 1. To celebrate the release of &quot;Issues&quot;, Korn performed the entire album in its running order at Harlem&#x27;s famed Apollo Theater. On December 22, 1999, a month after the album&#x27;s release date, &quot;Issues&quot; was certified 3× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2003 According to Nielsen Soundscan, &quot;Issues&quot; sold at least 3,200,000 copies in the United States. On &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end chart for the year 2000, &quot;Issues&quot; was at number 19. As of 2023 &quot;Issues&quot; has sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide.

Three songs from &quot;Issues&quot; were released as singles: &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot;, &quot;Make Me Bad&quot;, and &quot;Somebody Someone&quot;. On December 25, 1999, &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; went to number 8 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; was on that chart for sixteen weeks. &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; also went to number 7 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. On April 22, 2000, &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; went to number 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; was on that chart for 12 weeks. &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; also went to number 9 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; went to number 1 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; many times during both November and December 1999.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed to positive reviews. According to the band in the booklet that comes with &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 1&quot; album, they did not want to be part of a popular trend and wanted to do their own thing. The band admits that with Brendan O&#x27;Brien working alongside them, they were more focused during recording because he didn&#x27;t let them just fool around and party, so there was a lot less drinking this time around.

In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

<text>Charles the Fat (839 – 13 January 888) was the emperor of the Carolingian Empire from 881 to 887. A member of the Carolingian dynasty, Charles was the youngest son of Louis the German and Hemma, and a great-grandson of Charlemagne. He was the last Carolingian emperor of legitimate birth and the last to rule a united kingdom of the Franks.

Over his lifetime, Charles became ruler of the various kingdoms of Charlemagne&#x27;s former empire. Granted lordship over Alamannia in 876, following the division of East Francia, he succeeded to the Italian throne upon the abdication of his older brother Carloman of Bavaria who had been incapacitated by a stroke. Crowned emperor in 881 by Pope John VIII, his succession to the territories of his brother Louis the Younger (Saxony and Bavaria) the following year reunited the kingdom of East Francia. Upon the death of his cousin Carloman II in 884, he inherited all of West Francia, thus reuniting the entire Carolingian Empire.

Usually considered lethargic and inept—he was frequently ill, and is believed to have had epilepsy—Charles twice purchased peace with Viking raiders, including at the infamous Siege of Paris, which led to his downfall.

The reunited empire did not last. During a coup led by his nephew Arnulf of Carinthia in mid-November 887, Charles was deposed in East Francia, Lotharingia, and the Kingdom of Italy. Forced into quiet retirement, he died of natural causes on 13 January 888, just a few weeks after his deposition. The Empire quickly fell apart after his death, splintering into five separate successor kingdoms; the territory it had occupied was not entirely reunited under one ruler until the conquests of Napoleon.

==Nickname and number==
The nickname &quot;Charles the Fat&quot; (Latin &quot;Carolus Crassus&quot;) is not contemporary. It was first used by the &quot;Annalista Saxo&quot; (the anonymous &quot;Saxon Annalist&quot;) in the twelfth century. There is no contemporary reference to Charles&#x27;s physical size, but the nickname has stuck and is the common name in most modern European languages (French &quot;Charles le Gros&quot;, German &quot;Karl der Dicke&quot;, Italian &quot;Carlo il Grosso&quot;).

His numeral is roughly contemporary. Regino of Prüm, a contemporary of Charles&#x27;s recording his death, calls him &quot;Emperor Charles, third of that name and dignity&quot; (Latin &quot;Carolus imperator, tertius huius nominis et dignitatis&quot;).

==Biography==
===Youth and inheritance===
Charles was the youngest of the three sons of Louis the German, first King of East Francia, and Hemma from the House of Welf. An incident of demonic possession is recorded in his youth, in which he was said to have been foaming at the mouth before he was taken to the altar of the church. This greatly affected him and his father. He was described as: &quot;… a very Christian prince, fearing God, with all his heart keeping His commandments, very devoutly obeying the orders of the Church, generous in alms-giving, practising unceasingly prayer and song, always intent upon celebrating the praises of God.&quot;

In 859, Charles was made Count of the Breisgau, an Alemannic march bordering southern Lotharingia. In 863, his rebellious eldest brother Carloman revolted against their father. The next year Louis the Younger followed Carloman in revolt and Charles joined him. Carloman received rule over the Duchy of Bavaria. In 865, the elder Louis was forced to divide his remaining lands among his heirs: the Duchy of Saxony (along with the Duchy of Franconia and the Duchy of Thuringia) went to Louis, Alemannia (the Duchy of Swabia along with Rhaetia) went to Charles, and Lotharingia was to be divided between the younger two.

When, in 875, the Emperor Louis II, who was also King of Italy, died having agreed with Louis the German that Carloman would succeed him in Italy, Charles the Bald of West Francia invaded the peninsula and had himself crowned king and emperor. Louis the German sent first Charles and then Carloman himself, with armies containing Italian forces under Berengar of Friuli, their cousin, to the Italian kingdom. These wars, however, were not successful until the death of Charles the Bald in 877.

In 876, Louis the German died and the inheritance was divided as planned after a conference at Ries, though Charles received less of his share of Lotharingia than planned. In his charters, Charles&#x27;s reign in &quot;Germania&quot; is dated from his inheritance in 876.

===Acquisition of Italy===

Three brothers ruled in cooperation and avoided wars over the division of their patrimony: a rare occurrence in the Early Middle Ages. In 877, Carloman finally inherited Italy from his uncle Charles the Bald. Louis divided Lotharingia and offered a third to Carloman and a third to Charles. In 878, Carloman returned his Lotharingian share to Louis, who then divided it evenly with Charles. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and divided his domains between his brothers: Bavaria went to Louis and Italy to Charles. Charles dated his reign in &quot;Italia&quot; from this point, and from then, he spent most of his reign until 886 in his Italian kingdom.

In 880, Charles joined Louis III of France and Carloman II, the joint kings of West Francia, in a failed siege of Boso of Provence in Vienne from August to September. Provence, legally a part of the Italian kingdom from 863, had rebelled under Boso. In August 882, Charles sent Richard, Duke of Burgundy, Count of Autun, to take the city, which he finally did in September. After this, Boso was restricted to the vicinity of Vienne.

===Imperial coronation===

On 18 July 880, Pope John VIII sent a letter to Guy II of Spoleto seeking peace, but the duke ignored him and invaded the Papal States. John responded by begging the aid of Charles in his capacity as king of Italy and crowned Charles emperor on 12 February 881. This was accompanied by hopes of a general revival in western Europe, but Charles proved to be unequal to the task. Charles did little to help against Guy II. Papal letters as late as November were still petitioning Charles for action.

As emperor, Charles began the construction of a palace at Sélestat in Alsace. He modelled it after the Palace at Aachen which was built by Charlemagne, whom he consciously sought to emulate, as indicated by the &quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot; of Notker the Stammerer. As Aachen was located in the kingdom of his brother, it was necessary for Charles to build a new palace for his court in his own power base of western Alemannia. Sélestat was also more centrally located than Aachen.

In February 882, Charles convoked a diet in Ravenna. The duke, emperor, and pope made peace and Guy and his uncle, Guy of Camerino, vowed to return the papal lands. In a March letter to Charles, John claimed that the vows went unfulfilled. In 883, Guy of Camerino, now duke of Spoleto as Guy III, was accused of treason at an imperial synod held at Nonantula late in May. He returned to Spoleto and made an alliance with the Saracens. Charles sent Berengar against Guy III. Berengar was initially successful until an epidemic of disease, which ravaged all of Italy, affecting the emperor and his entourage as well as Berengar&#x27;s army, forced him to retreat.

In 883, Charles signed a treaty with Giovanni II Participazio, Doge of Venice, granting that any assassin of a doge who fled to the territory of the Empire would be fined 100 lbs of gold and banished.

===Rule in East Francia===

In the early 880s, the remnants of the Great Heathen Army, defeated by Alfred the Great at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, began to settle in the Low Countries. Charles&#x27;s brother Louis the Younger had opposed them with some success, but he died after a short campaign on 20 January 882, leaving his throne to Charles, who reunited the whole East Frankish kingdom.

After returning from Italy, Charles held an assembly at Worms with the purpose of dealing with the Vikings. Armies from the whole East Francia were assembled in the summer under Arnulf, Duke of Carinthia, and Henry, Count of Saxony. The chief Viking camp was then besieged at Asselt. Charles then opened negotiations with the Viking chiefs Godfrid and Sigfred. Godfrid accepted Christianity and became Charles&#x27;s vassal. He was married to Gisela, daughter of Lothair II of Lotharingia. Sigfred was bribed off. Despite the insinuations of some modern historians, no contemporary account criticised Charles&#x27;s actions during this campaign. In 885, fearing Godfrid and his brother-in-law, Hugh, Duke of Alsace, Charles arranged for a conference at Spijk near Lobith, where the Viking leader fell into his trap. Godfrid was executed, and Hugh was blinded and sent to Prüm.

From 882 to 884, the Wilhelminer War engulfed the March of Pannonia (later March of Austria). Arnulf of Carinthia, Charles&#x27;s illegitimate nephew, made an alliance with the rebel Engelschalk II against Aribo of Austria, Charles&#x27;s appointed margrave of the region. Svatopluk I, ruler of Great Moravia, agreed to help Aribo and in 884 at Kaumberg took an oath of fidelity to Charles. Though the emperor lost his vassals of the Wilhelminer family and his relationship with his nephew was broken, he gained powerful new allies in the Moravian &quot;dux&quot; and other Slavic &quot;duces&quot; of the region.

===Rule in West Francia===

When Carloman II of West Francia died on 12 December 884, the nobles of the kingdom invited Charles to assume the kingship. Charles gladly accepted, it being the third kingdom to &quot;fall into his lap&quot;. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Charles succeeded to all of the kingdom of Carloman except Brittany, but this does not seem to have been true. It is likely that Charles was crowned by Geilo, Bishop of Langres, as &quot;rex in Gallia&quot; on 20 May 885 at Grand in the Vosges in southern Lorraine. Although Geilo even developed a special West Frankish seal for him, Charles&#x27;s government in the West was always very distant and he left most day-to-day business to the higher nobility.

Though West Francia (the future France) was far less menaced by the Vikings than the Low Countries, it was heavily hit nonetheless. In 885, a huge fleet led by Sigfred sailed up the Seine, for the first time in years, and besieged Paris. Sigfred demanded a bribe again, but this time Charles refused. He was in Italy at the time and Odo, Count of Paris, sneaked some men through enemy lines to seek his aid. Charles sent Henry of Saxony to Paris. In 886, as disease began to spread through Paris, Odo himself went to Charles to seek support. Charles brought a large army and encircled the army of Rollo and set up a camp at Montmartre. However, Charles had no intention of fighting. He sent the attackers up the Seine to ravage Burgundy, which was in revolt. When the Vikings withdrew from France next spring, he gave them 700 pounds of promised silver. Charles&#x27;s prestige in France was greatly diminished.

Charles issued a number of charters for West Frankish recipients during his stay in Paris during and after the siege. He recognised rights and privileges granted by his predecessors to recipients in the Spanish March and Provence, but especially in Neustria, where he had contact with Nantes at a time when the Breton duke Alan I was known to be powerful in the county of Nantes. It is probable that Charles granted Alan the right to be titled &quot;rex&quot;; as emperor he would have had that prerogative and Alan&#x27;s use of the title appears legitimate. A charter dated to between 897 and 900 makes reference to the soul of &quot;Karolus&quot;, on whose behalf Alan had ordered prayers to be said in the monastery of Redon. This was probably Charles the Fat.

===Succession problems===
Charles, childless by his marriage to Richgard, tried to have Bernard, his illegitimate son by an unknown concubine, recognised as his heir in 885, but this met with opposition from several bishops. He had the support of Pope Hadrian III, whom he invited to an assembly in Worms in October 885, but the pope died on the way there, just after crossing the river Po. Hadrian was going to remove the obstructing bishops for Charles, as he doubted he could do this himself, and legitimise Bernard. Based on the unfavorable attitude shown by the chronicler responsible for the Mainz continuation of the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;, the chief of Charles&#x27;s opponents in this matter was most likely Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz. Because Charles had called together the &quot;bishops and counts of Gaul&quot; as well as the pope to meet him at Worms, it is likely that he had plans to make Bernard King of Lotharingia. Notker the Stammerer, who considered Bernard as a possible heir, wrote in his &quot;Deeds of Charlemagne&quot;:

After the failure of this first attempt, Charles set about to try again. He had the term &quot;proles&quot; (offspring) inserted into his charters (it had not been in previous years), in a likely attempt to legitimise Bernard. In early 886 Charles met the new Pope Stephen V and probably negotiated for the recognition of his illegitimate son as heir. An assembly was planned for April and May of the following year at Waiblingen. Pope Stephen cancelled his planned attendance on 30 April 887. Nevertheless, at Waiblingen, Berengar, who after a brief feud with Liutward had lost the favour of the emperor, came in early May 887, made peace with the emperor and compensated for his actions of the previous year by dispensing great gifts.

Charles eventually abandoned his plans for Bernard and instead adopted Louis of Provence as his son at an assembly at Kirchen in May. It is possible, however, that the agreement with Louis was only designed to engender support for Bernard&#x27;s sub-kingship in Lotharingia. In June or July, Berengar arrived in Kirchen, probably pining to be declared Charles&#x27;s heir; he may in fact have been so named in Italy, where he was acclaimed (or made himself) king immediately after Charles&#x27;s deposition. Odo, Count of Paris, may have had a similar purpose in visiting Charles at Kirchen. On the other hand, the presence of these magnates at these two great assemblies may merely have been necessary to confirm Charles&#x27;s illegitimate son as his heir (Waiblingen), a plan which failed when the pope refused to attend, and then to confirm Louis instead (Kirchen).

===Deposition, death and legacy===
With Charles increasingly seen as spineless and incompetent, matters came to a head in late 887. In the summer of that year, having given up on plans for his son&#x27;s succession, Charles received Odo and Berengar, Margrave of Friuli, a relative of his, at his court. He may have accepted neither, one, or both of these as his heir in their respective kingdoms. His inner circle then began to fall apart. First, he accused his wife Richgard of having an affair with his chief minister and archchancellor, Liutward, bishop of Vercelli. She proved her innocence in an ordeal of fire and left him for the monastic life. He then turned against Liutward, who was hated by all, and removed him from office, appointing Liutbert, archbishop of Mainz, in his place.

In that year, his first cousin once removed, Ermengard of Provence, daughter of the Emperor Louis II and wife of Boso of Provence, brought her son Louis the Blind to him for protection. Charles confirmed Louis in Provence (he may even have adopted him) and allowed them to live at his court. He probably intended to make Louis heir to the whole realm and the &quot;imperium&quot;. On November, he called an assembly to Frankfurt. While there he received news that an ambitious nephew, Arnulf of Carinthia, had fomented a general rebellion and was marching into Germany with an army of Bavarians and Slavs. The next week saw the collapse of all his support in East Francia. The last to abandon him were his loyal Alemanni, though the men of Lotharingia never seem to have formally accepted his deposition. By 17 November, Charles was out of power, though the exact course of events is unknown. Aside from rebuking his faithlessness, he did little to prevent Arnulf&#x27;s move—he had recently been ill again—but assured that Bernard was entrusted to his care and possibly Louis too. He asked for a few estates in Swabia on which to live out his days and thus received Naudingen (Donaueschingen). There he died six weeks later, on 13 January 888.

The Empire fell apart, never to be restored. According to Regino of Prüm, each part of the realm elected a &quot;kinglet&quot; from its own &quot;bowels&quot;—the bowels being the regions inside the realm. It is probable that Arnulf desired the whole empire, but the only part he received other than East Francia was Lotharingia. The French elected Odo, although he was opposed at first by Guy III of Spoleto, who also opposed Arnulf in Lotharingia. Guy sought the kingship in Italy after his failures in Francia, despite Berengar having already been crowned. Louis was crowned in Provence, as Charles had intended, and he sought the support of Arnulf and gained it, probably through supplication to him. Odo would eventually submit to Arnulf&#x27;s supremacy as well. In Upper Burgundy, one Rudolph, a &quot;dux&quot; of the region, was elected as king in a distinctly non-Carolingian creation, probably the result of his failure to succeed in the whole of Lotharingia. In Aquitaine, Ranulf II declared himself king and took the guardianship of the young Charles the Simple, the Carolingian heir to the West, refusing to recognise Odo&#x27;s election.

It is unknown if these elections were a response to Charles&#x27;s East Frankish deposition or to his death. Only those of Arnulf and Berengar can be certainly placed before his death. Only the magnates of the East ever formally deposed him. He was buried with honour in Reichenau after his death and the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; heap praises on his piety and godliness. Indeed, contemporary opinion of Charles is consistently kinder than later historiography, though it is a modern suggestion that his lack of apparent successes is the excusable result of near constant illness and infirmity.

Charles was the subject of a hortative piece of Latin prose, the &quot;Visio Karoli Grossi&quot;, designed to champion the cause of Louis the Blind and warn the Carolingians that their continued rule was not certain if they did not have &quot;divine&quot; (i.e. ecclesiastical) favour.

<doc id="235056" wikidata="Q2348048" url="?curid=235056" title="J-Tull Dot Com">
<text>J-Tull Dot Com is the 20th studio album by the British band Jethro Tull, released in 1999 on Papillon, the Chrysalis Group&#x27;s late 1990s heritage record label. It was released four years after their 1995 album &quot;Roots to Branches&quot; and continues in the same vein, marrying hard rock with Eastern music influences. It is the first album to feature Jonathan Noyce on bass, who would remain with the band until 2007 in Jethro Tull&#x27;s longest ever unchanged line-up. This was the last Jethro Tull album to feature all original, new material for 23 years (until the release of &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot; in 2022), although the band did release a Christmas album in 2003, which contained a mixture of new material, re-recordings of Tull&#x27;s own suitably themed material and arrangements of traditional Christmas music.

==Track listing==

* On some versions of the CD there is a period of silence after &quot;A Gift of Roses&quot; followed by the title track of Anderson&#x27;s (at the time unreleased) solo album &quot;The Secret Language of Birds&quot;. The track is preceded by a brief spoken word introduction by Anderson. This extends the length of &quot;A Gift of Roses&quot; to 9:16.

==Personnel==
* Ian Anderson – vocals, flute, acoustic guitar, bouzouki
* Martin Barre – acoustic guitar, electric guitar
* Jonathan Noyce – bass guitar
* Andrew Giddings – piano, keyboards, Hammond organ, accordion
* Doane Perry – drums, percussion

;Additional personnel

* Najma Akhtar – backing vocals (on &quot;Dot Com&quot;)

<doc id="235077" wikidata="Q169526" url="?curid=235077" title="Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">
<text>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Confusion can arise because some authors use the acronym RT-PCR to denote real-time PCR. In this article, RT-PCR will denote Reverse Transcription PCR. Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings.

The close association between RT-PCR and qPCR has led to metonymic use of the term qPCR to mean RT-PCR. Such use may be confusing, as RT-PCR can be used without qPCR, for example to enable molecular cloning, sequencing or simple detection of RNA. Conversely, qPCR may be used without RT-PCR, for example, to quantify the copy number of a specific piece of DNA.

==Nomenclature==

The combined RT-PCR and qPCR technique has been described as quantitative RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR (sometimes even called quantitative real-time RT-PCR), has been variously abbreviated as qRT-PCR, RT-qPCR, RRT-PCR, and rRT-PCR. In order to avoid confusion, the following abbreviations will be used consistently throughout this article:
Not all authors, especially earlier ones, use this convention and the reader should be cautious when following links. RT-PCR has been used to indicate both real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).

==History==

Since its introduction in 1977, Northern blot has been used extensively for RNA quantification despite its shortcomings: (a) time-consuming technique, (b) requires a large quantity of RNA for detection, and (c) quantitatively inaccurate in the low abundance of RNA content. However, since PCR was invented by Kary Mullis in 1983, RT PCR has since displaced Northern blot as the method of choice for RNA detection and quantification.

RT-PCR has risen to become the benchmark technology for the detection and/or comparison of RNA levels for several reasons: (a) it does not require post PCR processing, (b) a wide range (&gt;107-fold) of RNA abundance can be measured, and (c) it provides insight into both qualitative and quantitative data. Due to its simplicity, specificity and sensitivity, RT-PCR is used in a wide range of applications from experiments as simple as quantification of yeast cells in wine to more complex uses as diagnostic tools for detecting infectious agents such as the avian flu virus and SARS-CoV-2.

== Principles ==

In RT-PCR, the RNA template is first converted into a complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse transcriptase (RT). The cDNA is then used as a template for exponential amplification using PCR. The use of RT-PCR for the detection of RNA transcript has revolutionized the study of gene expression in the following important ways:
* Made it theoretically possible to detect the transcripts of practically any gene
* Enabled sample amplification and eliminated the need for abundant starting material required when using northern blot analysis&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1677/jme.0.0290023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provided tolerance for RNA degradation as long as the RNA spanning the primer is intact

=== One-step RT-PCR vs two-step RT-PCR ===

The quantification of mRNA using RT-PCR can be achieved as either a one-step or a two-step reaction. The difference between the two approaches lies in the number of tubes used when performing the procedure. The two-step reaction requires that the reverse transcriptase reaction and PCR amplification be performed in separate tubes. The disadvantage of the two-step approach is susceptibility to contamination due to more frequent sample handling. On the other hand, the entire reaction from cDNA synthesis to PCR amplification occurs in a single tube in the one-step approach. The one-step approach is thought to minimize experimental variation by containing all of the enzymatic reactions in a single environment. It eliminates the steps of pipetting cDNA product, which is labor-intensive and prone to contamination, to PCR reaction. The further use of inhibitor-tolerant thermostable DNA polymerases, polymerase enhancers with an optimized one-step RT-PCR condition, supports the reverse transcription of the RNA from unpurified or crude samples, such as whole blood and serum. However, the starting RNA templates are prone to degradation in the one-step approach, and the use of this approach is not recommended when repeated assays from the same sample is required. Additionally, the one-step approach is reported to be less accurate compared to the two-step approach. It is also the preferred method of analysis when using DNA binding dyes such as SYBR Green since the elimination of primer-dimers can be achieved through a simple change in the melting temperature. Nevertheless, the one-step approach is a relatively convenient solution for the rapid detection of target RNA directly in biosensing.

=== End-point RT-PCR vs real-time RT-PCR ===
Quantification of RT-PCR products can largely be divided into two categories: end-point and real-time. The use of end-point RT-PCR is preferred for measuring gene expression changes in small number of samples, but the real-time RT-PCR has become the gold standard method for validating quantitative results obtained from array analyses or gene expression changes on a global scale.

==== End-point RT-PCR ====

The measurement approaches of end-point RT-PCR requires the detection of gene expression levels by the use of fluorescent dyes like ethidium bromide, P32 labeling of PCR products using phosphorimager, or by scintillation counting. End-point RT-PCR is commonly achieved using three different methods: relative, competitive and comparative.

; Relative RT-PCR: Relative quantifications of RT-PCR involves the co-amplification of an internal control simultaneously with the gene of interest. The internal control is used to normalize the samples. Once normalized, a direct comparison of relative transcript abundances across multiple samples of mRNA can be made. One precaution to note is that the internal control must be chosen so that it is not affected by the experimental treatment. The expression level should be constant across all samples and with the mRNA of interest for the results to be accurate and meaningful. Because the quantification of the results are analyzed by comparing the linear range of the target and control amplification, it is crucial to take into consideration the starting target molecules concentration and their amplification rate prior to starting the analysis. The results of the analysis are expressed as the ratios of gene signal to internal control signal, which the values can then be used for the comparison between the samples in the estimation of relative target RNA expression.
; Competitive RT-PCR: Competitive RT-PCR technique is used for absolute quantification. It involves the use of a synthetic “competitor” RNA that can be distinguished from the target RNA by a small difference in size or sequence. It is important for the design of the synthetic RNA be identical in sequence but slightly shorter than the target RNA for accurate results. Once designed and synthesized, a known amount of the competitor RNA is added to experimental samples and is co-amplified with the target using RT-PCR. Then, a concentration curve of the competitor RNA is produced and it is used to compare the RT-PCR signals produced from the endogenous transcripts to determine the amount of target present in the sample.
; Comparative RT-PCR: Comparative RT-PCR is similar to the competitive RT-PCR in that the target RNA competes for amplification reagents within a single reaction with an internal standard of unrelated sequence. Once the reaction is complete, the results are compared to an external standard curve to determine the target RNA concentration. In comparison to the relative and competitive quantification methods, comparative RT-PCR is considered to be the more convenient method to use since it does not require the investigator to perform a pilot experiment; in relative RT-PCR, the exponential amplification range of the mRNA must be predetermined and in competitive RT-PCR, a synthetic competitor RNA must be synthesized.

==== Real-time RT-PCR ====

The emergence of novel fluorescent DNA labeling techniques in the past few years has enabled the analysis and detection of PCR products in real-time and has consequently led to the widespread adoption of real-time RT-PCR for the analysis of gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;lww/cmj/2021/09050/rt-rt-pc.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from array analyses and gene expressions on a global scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;iaea/covid_rt-rt-pcr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: SYBR Green, TaqMan, molecular beacons, and scorpion probes. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes&#x27;, molecular beacons&#x27; and scorpions&#x27; generation of fluorescence depend on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.

; SYBR Green: When the SYBR Green binds to the double-stranded DNA of the PCR products, it will emit light upon excitation. The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.

; TaqMan probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5&#x27; end and a quencher to the 3&#x27; end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the amplicon and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5&#x27;- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed. Additionally, these probes are light sensitive and must be carefully frozen as aliquots to prevent degradation.
; Molecular beacon probes: Similar to the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons also make use of FRET detection with fluorescent probes attached to the 5&#x27; end and a quencher attached to the 3&#x27; end of an oligonucleotide substrate. However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.
; Scorpion probes: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5&#x27; end being quenched by the moiety on the 3&#x27; end of an oligonucleotide. With Scorpions, however, the 3&#x27; end also contains sequence that is complementary to the extension product of the primer on the 5&#x27; end. When the Scorpion extension binds to its complement on the amplicon, the Scorpion structure opens, prevents FRET, and enables the fluorescent signal to be measured.
; Multiplex probes: TaqMan probes, molecular beacons, and scorpions allow the concurrent measurement of PCR products in a single tube. This is possible because each of the different fluorescent dyes can be associated with a specific emission spectra. Not only does the use of multiplex probes save time and effort without compromising test utility, its application in wide areas of research such as gene deletion analysis, mutation and polymorphism analysis, quantitative analysis, and RNA detection, make it an invaluable technique for laboratories of many discipline.

Two strategies are commonly employed to quantify the results obtained by real-time RT-PCR; the standard curve method and the comparative threshold method.

== Application ==

The exponential amplification via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction provides for a highly sensitive technique in which a very low copy number of RNA molecules can be detected. RT-PCR is widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and, semiquantitatively, in the determination of the abundance of specific different RNA molecules within a cell or tissue as a measure of gene expression.

=== Research methods ===

RT-PCR is commonly used in research methods to measure gene expression. For example, Lin et al. used qRT-PCR to measure expression of Gal genes in yeast cells. First, Lin et al. engineered a mutation of a protein suspected to participate in the regulation of Gal genes. This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the mutation of this regulatory protein reduced Gal expression. Northern blot analysis is used to study the RNA&#x27;s gene expression further.

=== Gene insertion ===

RT-PCR can also be very useful in the insertion of eukaryotic genes into prokaryotes. Because most eukaryotic genes contain introns, which are present in the genome but not in the mature mRNA, the cDNA generated from a RT-PCR reaction is the exact (without regard to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptases) DNA sequence that would be directly translated into protein after transcription. When these genes are expressed in prokaryotic cells for the sake of protein production or purification, the RNA produced directly from transcription need not undergo splicing as the transcript contains only exons. (Prokaryotes, such as E. coli, lack the mRNA splicing mechanism of eukaryotes).

=== Genetic disease diagnosis ===
RT-PCR can be used to diagnose genetic disease such as Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. This genetic disease is caused by a malfunction in the HPRT1 gene, which clinically leads to the fatal uric acid urinary stone and symptoms similar to gout. Analyzing a pregnant mother and a fetus for mRNA expression levels of HPRT1 will reveal if the mother is a carrier and if the fetus will likely to develop Lesch–Nyhan syndrome.

=== Cancer detection ===
Scientists are working on ways to use RT-PCR in cancer detection to help improve prognosis, and monitor response to therapy. Circulating tumor cells produce unique mRNA transcripts depending on the type of cancer. The goal is to determine which mRNA transcripts serve as the best biomarkers for a particular cancer cell type and then analyze its expression levels with RT-PCR.

RT-PCR is commonly used in studying the genomes of viruses whose genomes are composed of RNA, such as Influenzavirus A, retroviruses like HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

== Challenges ==

Despite its major advantages, RT-PCR is not without drawbacks. The exponential growth of the reverse transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) during the multiple cycles of PCR produces inaccurate end point quantification due to the difficulty in maintaining linearity. In order to provide accurate detection and quantification of RNA content in a sample, qRT-PCR was developed using fluorescence-based modification to monitor the amplification products during each cycle of PCR. The extreme sensitivity of the technique can be a double-edged sword since even the slightest DNA contamination can lead to undesirable results. A simple method for elimination of false positive results is to include anchors, or tags, to the 5&#x27; region of a gene specific primer. Additionally, planning and design of quantification studies can be technically challenging due to the existence of numerous sources of variation including template concentration and amplification efficiency. Spiking in a known quantity of RNA into a sample, adding a series of RNA dilutions generating a standard curve, and adding in a no template copy sample (no cDNA) may used as controls.

==Protocol==

RT-PCR can be carried out by the one-step RT-PCR protocol or the two-step RT-PCR protocol.

===One-step RT-PCR===
One-step RT-PCR subjects mRNA targets (up to 6 kb) to reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification in a single test tube. Using intact, high-quality RNA and a sequence-specific primer will produce the best results.

Once a one-step RT-PCR kit with a mix of reverse transcriptase, Taq DNA polymerase, and a proofreading polymerase is selected and all necessary materials and equipment are obtained a reaction mix is to be prepared. The reaction mix includes dNTPs, primers, template RNA, necessary enzymes, and a buffer solution. The reaction mix is added to a PCR tube for each reaction, followed by template RNA. The PCR tubes are then placed in a thermal cycler to begin cycling. In the first cycle, the synthesis of cDNA occurs. The second cycle is the initial denaturation wherein reverse transcriptase is inactivated. The remaining 40-50 cycles are the amplification, which includes denaturation, annealing, and elongation. When amplification is complete, the RT-PCR products can be analyzed with gel electrophoresis.

(PCR Applications Manual and Biotools)

===Two-step RT-PCR===

Two-step RT-PCR, as the name implies, occurs in two steps. First the reverse transcription and then the PCR. This method is more sensitive than the one-step method. Kits are also useful for two-step RT-PCR. Just as for one-step PCR, use only intact, high-quality RNA for the best results. The primer for two-step PCR does not have to be sequence-specific.

==== Step one ====
First combine template RNA, primer, dNTP mix, and nuclease-free water in a PCR tube. Then, add an RNase inhibitor and reverse transcriptase to the PCR tube. Next, place the PCR tube into a thermal cycler for one cycle wherein annealing, extending, and inactivating of reverse transcriptase occurs. Finally, proceed directly to step two which is PCR, or store product on ice until PCR can be performed.

==== Step two ====
Add master mix which contains buffer, dNTP mix, MgCl2, Taq polymerase, and nuclease-free water to each PCR tube. Then add the necessary primer to the tubes. Next, place the PCR tubes in a thermal cycler for 30 cycles of the amplification program. This includes denaturation, annealing, and elongation. The products of RT-PCR can be analyzed with gel electrophoresis.

== Publication guidelines ==

Quantitative RT-PCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for measuring the number of copies of specific cDNA targets in a sample but it is poorly standardized. As a result, while there are numerous publications utilizing the technique, many provide inadequate experimental detail and use unsuitable data analysis to draw inappropriate conclusions. Due to the inherent variability in the quality of any quantitative PCR data, not only do reviewers have a difficult time evaluating these manuscripts, but the studies also become impossible to replicate. Recognizing the need for the standardization of the reporting of experimental conditions, the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE, pronounced mykee) guidelines have been published by an international consortium of academic scientists. The MIQE guidelines describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating quantitative PCR experiments that should be required for publication to encourage better experimental practice and ensuring the relevance, accuracy, correct interpretation, and repeatability of quantitative PCR data.

Besides reporting guidelines, the MIQE stresses the need to standardize the nomenclature associated with quantitative PCR to avoid confusion; for example, the abbreviation &quot;qPCR&quot; should be used for quantitative real-time PCR, while &quot;RT-qPCR&quot; should be used for reverse transcription-qPCR, and genes used for normalization should be referred to as &quot;reference genes&quot; instead of &quot;housekeeping genes&quot;. It also proposes that commercially derived terms like &quot;TaqMan probes&quot; should not be used, but instead referred to as &quot;hydrolysis probes&quot;. Additionally, it is proposed that the quantification cycle (Cq) be used to describe the PCR cycle used for quantification instead of the threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and takeoff point (TOP), which refer to the same value but were coined by different manufacturers of real-time instruments.

The guideline consists of the following elements: 1) experimental design, 2) sample, 3) nucleic acid extraction, 4) reverse transcription, 5) qPCR target information, 6) oligonucleotides, 7) protocol, 8) validation, and 9) data analysis. Specific items within each element carry a label of either E (essential) or D (desirable). Those labeled E are considered critical and indispensable while those labeled D are considered peripheral yet important for best practices.

== Research ==

In 2023, researchers developed a working prototype of an RT-LAMP lab-on-a-chip system, which provided results for SARS-CoV-2 tests within three minutes. The technology integrates microfluidic channels into printed circuit boards with, which may enable low-cost mass production.

<text>A dragon boat is a human-powered watercraft originating from the Pearl River Delta region of China&#x27;s southern Guangdong Province. These were made of teak, but in other parts of China different kinds of wood are used. It is one of a family of traditional paddled long boats found throughout Asia, Africa, the Pacific islands, and Puerto Rico. The sport of dragon boat racing has its roots in an ancient folk ritual of contending villagers, which dates back 2000 years throughout southern China, and even further to the original games of Olympia in ancient Greece. Both dragon boat racing and the ancient Olympiad included aspects of religious observances and community celebrations, along with competitions.

Dragon boat racing has been a traditional Chinese paddled watercraft activity for over 2000 years and began as a modern international sport in Hong Kong in 1976. These boats are typically made of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and other lightweight materials. For competition events, dragon boats are generally rigged with decorative Chinese dragon heads and tails. At other times (such as during training), decorative regalia is usually removed, although the drum often remains aboard for drummers to practice. For races, there are 18-20 people in a standard boat, and 8-10 in a small boat, not including the steersperson (sweep) and the drummer.

In December 2007, the central government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China added the Dragon Boat Festival, along with the Qingming and Mid-Autumn festivals, to the schedule of national holidays.

The International Dragon Boat Federation defines a dragon boat, within competition regulations, to be: &quot;a long displacement boat of an open design, that is based upon a rib-less carvel form of hull construction, with the following distinguishing characteristics; no stem, hard chine bilge; W in cross section, minimum freeboard, punt-like entry and exit; rocketed keel that is set back from the twin rail boards and curved sheet line with upsweep extremities&quot;.

Dragon boats vary in size: medium-sized boats can measure about 38 feet (11.5 meters), whereas larger boats can measure up to 90 feet (27.4 meters) in length. The width and depth of the boat also varies, changing according to factors like the boat&#x27;s length and purpose, as well as the number of people in its crew. Some dragon boat craftsmen may also alter the width of the boats depending on the expertise of its paddlers, with narrower boats being constructed for more skilled dragon boaters. 

The material used to build the main body of a dragon boat is diverse and has varied over the years. Before 1911, Ge wood, imported from countries like Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam was used. From 1911 towards the end of the 1990s, dragon boats had been built using pine wood imported from the United States. Since 2000, cedar wood from the Guizhou province of China had been used. Today, the standard materials used to build the hull of these dragon boats are usually either teak wood or fiberglass.

Teak wood is considerably adept at handling moisture. For a majority of the year, dragon boats are stored out of the water, on dry land, where they tend to shrink slightly once dried. When they are reintroduced back into the sea, teak allows their joints to expand, which allows the boat to close any gaps and further strengthen itself. Sometime in the 1990s, China began its advocacy for the protection of its forests, causing a shortage in large timber resources. Following this, China began to see a rise in fiberglass dragon boats which were often lighter and faster. Over time, dragon boats made of fiberglass surpassed those made of wood, becoming a popular choice and the national standard for dragon boats in China. As a result, while wooden paddles and teak wood boats are still used from time to time, dragon boat athletes often train regularly on fiberglass boats, with paddles made of carbon fiber.

The head and tail of a dragon is typically made of camphor wood. The design of the dragon heads vary according to its location, as each region has their own specific features and colors to dedicate to it. The head and tail are often hand-carved, likely with a chisel and hammer, before being hand-painted. Such heads usually feature a pair of bulging eyes, two jumbo nostrils, a long snout, a stuck out tongue, &#x27;feathers&#x27; or &#x27;hairs&#x27; that appear frozen in a wave-like motion, and ferocious jaws that feature sharp, white teeth. The head leads to the long, sleek, and low body of the dragon boat which represents the dragon&#x27;s back. This part also features a W-shaped belly that provides suction onto the water and helps to stabilize the boat. On its stern is a curled tail with minutely carved scales.

Many consider the building of these dragon boats to be a combination of various art forms, including carpentry work, wood carving, oil painting, and marine architecture theory. They also involve a fair amount of labor division where various craftsmen work on different parts of the boat. For example, wooden furniture makers would be engaged to carve the dragon&#x27;s head and tail, while ship builders would be engaged to work on the dragon&#x27;s body.

==History==

Similar to the use of outrigger canoes or Polynesian va&#x27;a, dragon boat racing has a rich background of ancient ceremonial, ritualistic and religious traditions, and thus, the modern competitive aspect is but one small part of this complex dragon boat culture. The use of dragon boats for racing and dragon ceremonies is believed by scholars, sinologists, and anthropologists to have originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago, in Dongting Lake and along the banks of the Chang Jiang (now called the Yangtze) during the same era when the games of ancient Greece were being established at Olympia. Dragon boat racing has been practiced continuously since this period as the basis for annual water rituals and festival celebrations, and for the traditional veneration of the Chinese dragon water deity. The celebration was an important part of the ancient Chinese agricultural society, celebrating the summer rice planting. Dragon boat racing was historically situated in the Chinese subcontinent&#x27;s southern-central &quot;rice bowl&quot;; where there were rice paddies, so too there were dragon boats.

Of the twelve animals which make up the traditional Chinese zodiac, only the Dragon is a mythical creature. All the rest are non-mythical animals, yet all twelve of the zodiac creatures were well known to members of ancient Chinese agrarian communities. Dragons were traditionally believed to be the rulers of water on earth: rivers, lakes, and seas; they were also thought to dominate the waters of the heavens: clouds, mists, and rains. There are earth dragons, mountain dragons, and sky or celestial dragons (Tian Long) in Chinese tradition. Mythical dragons and serpents are also found widely in many cultures around the world.

Traditional dragon boat racing, in China, coincides with the &quot;5th day of the 5th Chinese lunar month&quot; (varying from late May to June on the modern Gregorian Calendar). The summer solstice occurs around 21 June and is the reason why Chinese refer to their festival as &quot;Duan Wu&quot; or &quot;Duen Ng&quot;. Both the sun and the dragon are considered to be male (the moon and the mythical phoenix, however, are considered to be female). The sun and the dragon are thought to be most potent during this time of the year, which provides a cause for observing this through ritual celebrations such as dragon boat racing. It is also the time of year when rice seedlings must be transplanted in rice paddy fields to allow for wet rice cultivation. Wu or Ng refers to the sun at its highest position in the sky during the day, the meridian of &#x27;high noon&#x27;. Duan or Duen refers to upright or directly overhead. Thus, Duan Wu is an ancient reference to the maximum position of the sun in the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year or the summer solstice.

Venerating the dragon deity was meant to avert misfortune and calamity and to encourage rainfall, which is needed for the fertility of the crops and thus, the prosperity of an agrarian way of life. Celestial dragons were considered the controllers of rain, monsoons, winds, and clouds. The Emperor was &quot;The Dragon&quot; or the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, and Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;dragons&quot; because of its spirit of strength and vitality. Unlike dragons in European mythology, which are typically considered to be evil and demonic, Asian dragons are regarded as wholesome and benevolent, and thus worthy of veneration, not slaying. If rainfall is insufficient, however, drought and famine can result. Veneration of dragons in China seems to be associated with annual rituals to ensure life-giving water and bountiful rice harvests in south-central China.

Another ritual called &quot;Awakening of the Dragon&quot; involves a Taoist priest dotting the bulging eyes of the carved dragon head attached to the boat. Doing so symbolizes the dragon ending its slumber and reenergizing its spirit, or ch&#x27;i. In modern dragon boat festivals, a representative can be invited to step forward to dot the eyes on a dragon boat head with a brush dipped in red paint.
Not understanding the significance of Duanwu, 19th-century European observers of the racing ritual referred to the associated spectacle as a &quot;dragon boat festival&quot;. This is the term that has become known in the West. Dragon boat racing, like Duanwu, is observed and celebrated in many areas of east Asia with a significant population of ethnic Chinese such as Singapore, Malaysia, and the Riau Islands, as well as having been adopted by the Ryukyu Islands since ancient times. The date on which races were held is referred to as the &quot;double fifth&quot;, since Duanwu is reckoned as the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, which often falls in the Gregorian calendar month of June and occasionally in May or July. Duanwu is reckoned annually in accordance with the traditional calendar system of China, which is a combination of solar and lunar cycles, unlike the solar-based Gregorian calendar system.
The Khmer Empire used dragon boats in their naval battles. Today, Cambodia honors the use of dragon boats by the Khmer Empire&#x27;s navy by hosting dragon boat competitions at the Bon Om Touk water festival. Laos which emerged from the Khmer Empire organizes a similar dragon boat festival on the Mekong River called Boun Suang Huea. The world&#x27;s longest dragon boat is located in Cambodia and known as the Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei.

==Crew==
The crew of a standard dragon boat typically consists of 22 team members: 20 paddlers in pairs facing toward the bow of the boat, 1 drummer or caller at the bow facing toward the paddlers, and 1 steerer standing at the rear of the boat. Dragon boats, however, do vary in length and the crew size changes accordingly, from small dragon boats with only 10 paddlers up to traditional boats which have upwards of 50 paddlers, plus drummer(s) and steerer.

=== Drummer ===
The pulsation of the drum beats produced by the drummer may be considered the &quot;heartbeat&quot; of the dragon boat. The drummer leads the paddlers throughout a race using the rhythmic drum beat to indicate the frequency and synchronization of all the paddlers&#x27; strokes (that is, the cadence, picking up or accelerating the pace, slowing the rate, etc.). The drummer may issue commands to the crew through a combination of hand signals and voice calls, and also generally exhorts the crew to perform at their peak. A drummer is typically mandatory during racing events, but if he or she is not present during training, it is typical for the sweep to direct the crew during a race. The drummer&#x27;s role is both tactical and ceremonial. In official competitions, such as world championships, drummers must physically beat the drum, else the team may be issued a penalty. In other events or practices, the drummer of an experienced team may not hit the drum, as the team can paddle naturally together, without a drum beat.

Good drummers should be able to synchronize their drumming with the strokes of the leading pair of paddlers, rather than the other way around.

===Paddlers===
Pairs of paddlers sit facing forward in the boat, and use a specific type of paddle which, unlike equipment used in rowing, is not rigged to the boat in any way. The paddlers face the direction of boat-movement; dragon boaters thus &quot;paddle,&quot; like a canoe, while rowers &quot;row&quot;, travelling opposite the way they face as in Olympic sculling.

The paddle now accepted by the International Dragon Boat Organization has a standardized, fixed blade surface area and distinctive shape derived from the paddle shapes characteristic of that used by inhabitants of the Pearl River delta region of Guangdong Province, China adjacent to Hong Kong. The IDBF Paddle Specification 202a (PS202a) has straight flared edges and circular arced shoulders, based geometrically on an equilateral triangle positioned between the blade face and the neck of the shaft.

The first pair of paddlers, called &quot;pacers,&quot; &quot;strokes&quot; or &quot;timers,&quot; set the pace for the team and are responsible for synchronizing their strokes with one another, because it is critical that all paddlers are synchronized. The direction of the dragon boat while racing is set by the steerer, but for docking and other maneuvers, individual paddlers may be asked to paddle (while others either stop the boat or rest) according to the commands given by the drummer or steerer.

There are generally three different strokes used by paddlers: a (normal) forward stroke, a backstroke, and a draw stroke.

=== Steerer ===
The direction of a dragon boat&#x27;s movement is controlled by the steerer standing in the back of the boat. Many terms exist for the person steering the boat, such as steerer, steersperson, steerman, sweep, and helm.

The steerer manipulates a long (typically 9-feet) straight oar, called a steering oar. The steering oar is situated in a mechanism that holds the oar in place, called oar lock. The oar lock can be in a variety of designs, so long as it holds the oar in place and allows it to pivot. It is housed on top of the steering arm, which sticks out perpendicularly on the back-left of a dragon boat.

The oar is used to both steer the boat as it is moving and adjust the positioning of the boat. To steer, a steerer will put the blade of the oar into the water and either push the handle away from him/her, or pull it toward him/her. Doing so will turn the boat right or left, respectively.

A steerer can also use the steering oar to adjust the position of the boat by cranking. When a steerer cranks the steering oar, the stern of the boat moves either to the left or right, spinning the boat. This is typically executed to turn the boat around at practice or to ensure a boat is lined up straight and pointing directly down a racecourse.

A steerer uses calls to direct the paddlers. The steerer may call &quot;paddles up&quot; to prepare to paddle and &quot;take it away!&quot; to commence paddling. The steerer may use other calls such as &quot;hold the boat&quot; for the paddlers to brake using their paddles or &quot;let it ride&quot; for them to lift their paddles out of the water.

The steerer also calls the demands in the race for paddlers to better their placement and time in the event that they are participating in.

==Racing==
Modern dragon boat racing is organized at the international level by the International Dragon Boat Federation (IDBF), the world governing body for the sport. The IDBF is a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations and is a founding federation of the AIMS Group (Alliance of Independent Recognized Members of Sport) within GAISF. AIMS is an IOC-Recognized Multi Sports Organization. The International Canoe Federation (ICF) also has a dragon boat program for those of its Member Canoe Federations with an interest in dragon boat. Both Sport and Festival racing are very competitive and many paddlers train year round, using paddling machines or pools in addition to on-water sessions.

A festival race is typically a sprint event of several hundred meters, with 500 meters being the most common. Races measuring 200, 1000, and 2000 meters are also standard distances in international competition. Races measuring 2000 meters are normally held on a 500-meter course, requiring teams to do two loops. Teams start and end at the same end of the course, and complete three 180-degree turns. Other distances may also be used in local festivals, such as 100 or 250 meters, or another distance, depending on the size of the body of water.

==Organizations, recognition and popular culture==

The established International Federation for dragon boat sport is the International Dragon Boat Federation (IDBF). In 2007, the IDBF was recognized as a member of SportAccord (the former &quot;General Association of International Sports Federations&quot;, GAISF) which is part of the Olympic Movement, after SportAccord considered the historical and cultural backgrounds and identities of dragon boat sports.

IDBF member associations or federations have been established in 89 countries or territories since 1991. The IDBF is not presently an Olympic International Federation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but the IOC is currently considering the IDBF application for Olympic Federation status.

The International Canoe Federation, an IOC-recognized entity that governs many canoeing disciplines has also started to sanction Dragon Boat events. The ICF Dragon Boat World Championships have been held since 2006.

<text>A chainsaw (or chain saw) is a portable handheld power saw that cuts with a set of teeth attached to a rotating chain driven along a guide bar. 

Modern chainsaws are typically gasoline or electric and are used in activities such as tree felling, limbing, bucking, pruning, cutting firebreaks in wildland fire suppression, harvesting of firewood, for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills, for cutting concrete, and cutting ice. Precursors to modern chainsaws were first used in surgery, with patents for wood chainsaws beginning in the late 19th century.

A chainsaw comprises an engine, a drive mechanism, a guide bar, a cutting chain, a tensioning mechanism, and safety features. Various safety practices and working techniques are used with chainsaws.

== History ==

===In surgery===

A &quot;flexible saw&quot;, consisting of a fine serrated link chain held between two wooden handles, was pioneered in the late 18th century (–1785) by two Scottish doctors, John Aitken and James Jeffray, for symphysiotomy and excision of diseased bone, respectively. It was illustrated in the second edition of Aitken&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Midwifery, or Puerperal Medicine&quot; (1785) in the context of a pelviotomy. In 1806, Jeffray published &quot;Cases of the Excision of Carious Joints&quot;, which collected a paper previously published by H. Park in 1782 and a translation of an 1803 paper by French physician P. F. Moreau, with additional observations by Park and Jeffray. In it, Jeffray reported having conceived the idea of a saw &quot;with joints like the chain of a watch&quot; independently very soon after Park&#x27;s original 1782 publication, but that he was not able to have it produced until 1790, after which it was used in the anatomy lab and occasionally lent out to surgeons. Park and Moreau described successful excision of diseased joints, particularly the knee and elbow, and Jeffray explained that the chainsaw would allow a smaller wound and protect the adjacent muscles, nerves, and veins. While symphysiotomy had too many complications for most obstetricians, Jeffray&#x27;s ideas about the excision of the ends of bones became more accepted, especially after the widespread adoption of anaesthetics. For much of the 19th century the chainsaw was a useful surgical instrument, but it was superseded in 1894 by the Gigli twisted-wire saw, which was substantially cheaper to manufacture, and gave a quicker, narrower cut, without risk of breaking and being entrapped in the bone.

A precursor of the chainsaw familiar today in the timber industry was another medical instrument developed around 1830, by German precision mechanic and orthopaedist Bernhard Heine. This instrument, the osteotome, had links of a chain carrying small cutting teeth with the edges set at an angle; the chain was moved around a guiding blade by turning the handle of a sprocket wheel. As the name implies, this was used to cut bone.

===For cutting wood===


One of the earliest patents for an &quot;endless chain saw&quot; comprising a chain of links carrying saw teeth was granted to Frederick L. Magaw of Flatlands, New York in 1883, apparently for the purpose of producing boards by stretching the chain between grooved drums. A later patent incorporating a guide frame was granted to Samuel J. Bens of San Francisco on January 17, 1905, his intent being to fell giant redwoods. The first portable chainsaw was developed and patented in 1918 by Canadian millwright James Shand. After he allowed his rights to lapse in 1930, his invention was further developed by what became the German company Festo in 1933. The company, now operating as Festool, produces portable power tools. Other important contributors to the modern chainsaw are Joseph Buford Cox and Andreas Stihl; the latter patented and developed an electric chainsaw for use on bucking sites in 1926 and a gasoline-powered chainsaw in 1929, and founded a company to mass-produce them. In 1927, Emil Lerp, the founder of Dolmar, developed the world&#x27;s first gasoline-powered chainsaw and mass-produced them.

World War II interrupted the supply of German chainsaws to North America, so new manufacturers sprang up, including Industrial Engineering Ltd (IEL) in 1939, the forerunner of Pioneer Saws Ltd and part of Outboard Marine Corporation, the oldest manufacturer of chainsaws in North America.

The first one-man chainsaw was introduced in 1950, though it was relatively heavy. By 1959, the average weight was around 12 kg (today, chainsaws typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg, with heavy-duty models ranging from 7 to 9 kg), and it quickly gained attention.

McCulloch in North America started to produce chainsaws in 1948. The early models were heavy, two-person devices with long bars. Often, chainsaws were so heavy that they had wheels like dragsaws. Other outfits used driven lines from a wheeled power unit to drive the cutting bar.

Carburetors featuring swivel and floating diaphragms were developed after the war, enabling modern chainsaws to operate in any orientation without the risk of flooding or fuel starvation. Additionally, the use of lighter materials played a crucial role in the advancement of the modern hand-held chainsaw. 

While today&#x27;s logging operations use a variety of specialized machinery, hand felling with a cable skidder (where tractors and horses may still be utilized) continues to be a viable, cost-effective way to make a living as a logger.

They are made in many sizes, from small electric saws intended for home and garden use, to large &quot;lumberjack&quot; saws. Members of military engineer units are trained to use chainsaws, as are firefighters to fight forest fires and to ventilate structure fires.

Three main types of chainsaw sharpeners are used: handheld file, electric chainsaw, and bar-mounted.

The first electric chainsaw was invented by Stihl in 1926. Corded chainsaws became available for sale to the public from the 1960s onwards, but these were never as successful commercially as the older gas-powered type due to limited range, dependency upon the presence of an electrical socket, plus the health and safety risk of the blade&#x27;s proximity to the cable.

For most of the early 21st century petrol driven chainsaws remained the most common type, but they faced competition from cordless lithium battery powered chainsaws from the late 2010s onwards. Although most cordless chainsaws are small and suitable only for hedge trimming and tree surgery, Husqvarna and Stihl began manufacturing full size chainsaws for cutting logs during the early 2020s. Battery powered chainsaws should eventually see increased market share in California due to state restrictions planned to take effect in 2024 on gas powered gardening equipment.

== Construction ==
A chainsaw consists of several parts:

===Engine===

Chainsaw engines are traditionally either a two-stroke single-cylinder gasoline (petrol) internal combustion engine (usually with a cylinder volume of 30 to 120 cm3) or an electric motor driven by a battery or electric power cord. In a petrol chainsaw, fuel is generally supplied to the engine by a carburetor at the intake. Two-stroke engines have been preferred for chainsaws due to their higher power-to-weight ratio and simplicity. 

Hydraulic power may be used for chainsaws for underwater use.

To allow use in any orientation, modern gas chainsaws use a diaphragm carburetor, which draws fuel from the tank using the alternating pressure differential within the crankcase. Early engines used carburetors with gravity fed float chambers, which caused the engine to stall when tilted. The carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain an appropriate idle speed and air-fuel ratio, such as when moving to a higher/lower altitude or as the air filter clogs. Carburetors are adjusted either by the operator or, in some saws, automatically by an electronic control unit.

To prevent vibration induced injury and reduce user fatigue, saws generally have an anti-vibration system to physically decouple the handles from the engine and bar. This is achieved by constructing the saw in two pieces, connected by springs or rubber in the same way an automobile suspension isolates the chassis from the wheels and road. In cold weather, carburetor icing can occur, so many saws have a vent between the cylinders and carburetor which may be opened to allow hot air to pass. Cold temperature can also contribute to vibration-induced injury, and some saws have a small alternator connected to resistive heating elements in the handles and/or carburetor.

===Drive mechanism===
Typically, a centrifugal clutch and sprocket are used. The centrifugal clutch expands with increasing speed, engaging a drum. On this drum sits either a fixed sprocket or an exchangeable one. The clutch has three jobs: When the engine runs idle (typically 2500–2700 rpm) the chain does not move. When the clutch is engaged and the chain stops in the wood for another reason, it protects the engine. Most importantly, it protects the operator in case of a kickback. Here, the chain brake stops the drum, and the clutch releases immediately.

===Guide bar===
A guide bar, typically an elongated bar with a round end of wear-resistant alloy steel typically 40 to 90 cm (16 to 36 in) in length, is used. An edge slot guides the cutting chain. Specialized, loop-style bars, called bow bars, were also used at one time for bucking logs and clearing brush, although they are now rarely encountered due to increased hazards of operation.

All guide bars have some elements for operation:

====Gauge====
The lower part of the chain runs in the gauge. Here, the lubrication oil is pulled by the chain to the nose. This is basically the thickness of the drive links. 
* 
* 

====Oil holes====

The end of the saw power head has two oil holes, one on each side. These holes must match with the outlet of the oil pump. The pump sends the oil through the hole in the lower part of the gauge.

Saw bar producers provide a large variety of bars matching different saws.

====Grease holes at bar nose====

Through this hole, grease is pumped, typically each tank filling to keep the nose sprocket well lubricated.

====Guide slot====

Here, one or two bolts from the saw run through. The clutch cover is put on top of the bar and it is secured through these bolts. The number of bolts is determined by the size of the saw.

====Bar types====

Different bar types are available:
* Laminated bars consist of different layers to reduce the weight of the bar.
* Solid bars are solid steel, intended for professional use. They commonly have an exchangeable nose, since the sprocket at the bar nose wears out faster than the bar.
* Safety bars are laminated bars with a small sprocket at the nose. The small nose reduces the kickback effect. Such bars are used on consumer saws.

===Cutting chain===

Usually, each segment in a chain (which is constructed from riveted metal sections similar to a bicycle chain, but without rollers) features small, sharp, cutting teeth. Each tooth takes the form of a folded tab of chromium-plated steel with a sharp angular or curved corner and two beveled cutting edges, one on the top plate and one on the side plate. Left-handed and right-handed teeth are alternated in the chain. Chains are made in varying pitch and gauge; the pitch of a chain is defined as half of the length spanned by any three consecutive rivets (e.g., 8 mm, 0.325 inch), while the gauge is the thickness of the drive link where it fits into the guide bar (e.g., 1.5 mm, 0.05 inch). The conventional &quot;full complement&quot; chain has one tooth for every two drive links. &quot;Full skip&quot; chain has one tooth for every three drive links. Built into each tooth is a depth gauge or &quot;raker&quot;, which rides ahead of the tooth and limits the depth of cut, typically to around 0.5 mm (0.025&quot;). Depth gauges are critical to safe chain operation. If left too high, they cause very slow cutting; if filed too low, the chain becomes more prone to kick back. Low depth gauges also cause the saw to vibrate excessively. Vibration is uncomfortable for the operator and is detrimental to the saw.

===Tensioning mechanism===

The tension of the chain that does the cutting is adjusted so that it neither binds on nor comes loose from the guide bar. The tensioner for doing so is either operated by turning a screw or a manual wheel. The tensioner is either in a lateral position underneath the exhaust or integrated into the clutch cover.

Lateral tensioners have the advantage that the clutch cover is easier to mount, but the disadvantage that it is more difficult to reach nearby the bar. Tensioners through the clutch cover are easier to operate, but the clutch cover is more difficult to attach.

When turning the screw, a hook in a bar hole moves the bar either out (tensioning) or in, making the chain loose. Tension is right when it can be moved easily by hand and not hanging loose from the bar. When tensioning, hold the bar nose up and pull the bar nuts tight. Otherwise, the chain might derail.

The underside of each link features a small, metal finger called a &quot;drive link&quot;, which locates the chain on the bar, helps to carry lubricating oil around the bar, and engages with the engine&#x27;s drive sprocket inside the body of the saw. The engine drives the chain around the track by a centrifugal clutch, engaging the chain as engine speed increases under power, but allowing it to stop as the engine speed slows to idle speed.

Consistent improvement to overall chainsaw design, including adding safety features, has taken place over the years. These include chain-brake systems, better chain design, and lighter, more ergonomic saws, including fatigue-reducing antivibration systems.

As chainsaw carving has become more popular, manufacturers are making special short, narrow-tipped bars (called &quot;quarter-tipped&quot; &quot;nickel-tipped&quot;, or &quot;dime-tipped&quot; bars, based on the size of their tips). Some chainsaws are built specifically for carving applications. Echo sponsors a carving series.

===Safety features===

Today&#x27;s chainsaws have multiple safety features to protect the operator. These include:
* Chain brake
** A chain brake activator is located forward of the upper handle and is activated by a kickback event. When triggered, it tensions a band around the clutch drum, stopping the chain within milliseconds.
** A chain catcher is located between the saw body and the clutch cover. In most cases, it resembles a hook made of aluminum. It is used to stop the chain when it derails from the bar and shortens the length of the chain. When derailing, the chain swings from underneath the saw towards the operator. This prevents the chain from hitting the operator, which hits the rear handle guard instead.
** A rear handle guard protects the hand of the operator when the chain derails.
* Some chains have safety features as safety links as on micro chisel saws. These links keep the saw close to the gap between two cutting links and lift the chain when the space at the safety link is full with saw chips, which lifts the chain and lets it cut slower. Nonprofessional chains have less aggressive teeth, by having shallower depth gauges.

== Maintenance ==
Two-stroke chainsaws require about 2–5% of oil in the fuel to lubricate the engine, while the motor in electrical chain-saws is normally lubricated for life. Most modern gasoline-operated saws today require a fuel mix of 2% (1:50). Gasoline that contains ethanol can result in problems for the equipment because ethanol dissolves plastic, rubber, and other material. This leads to problems, especially on older equipment. A workaround for this problem is to run fresh fuel only and run the saw dry at the end of the work.

Separate chain oil or bar oil is used for the lubrication of the bar and chain on all types of chainsaws. The chain oil is depleted quickly because it tends to be thrown off by chain centrifugal force, and it is soaked up by sawdust. On two-stroke chainsaws, the chain oil reservoir is usually filled up at the same time as refueling. The reservoir is normally large enough to provide sufficient chain oil between refueling. Lack of chain oil, or using an oil of incorrect viscosity, is a common source of damage to chainsaws, and tends to lead to rapid wear of the bar, or the chain seizing or coming off the bar. In addition to being quite thick, chain oil is particularly sticky (due to &quot;tackifier&quot; additives) to reduce the amount thrown off the chain. Although motor oil is a common emergency substitute, it is lost even faster, so leaves the chain under-lubricated.

The oil is pumped from a small pump to a hole in the bar. From there, the lower ends of each chain drive link take a portion of the oil into the gauge towards the bar nose. The pump outlet and bar hole must be aligned. Since the bar is moving out and inwards depending on the chain length, the oil outlet on the saw side has a banana-style long shape.

Chains must be kept sharp to perform well. They become blunt rapidly if they touch soil, metal, or stones. When blunt, they tend to produce powdery sawdust, rather than the longer, clean shavings characteristic of a sharp chain; a sharp saw also needs very little force from the operator to push it into the cut. Specially-hardened chains (made with tungsten carbide) are used for applications where the soil is likely to contaminate the cut, such as for cutting through roots.

A clear sign of a blunt chain is the vibrations of the saw. A sharp chain pulls itself into the wood without pressing on the saw.

Since the air intake filter tends to clog up with sawdust, it must be cleaned from time to time but is not a problem during normal operation.

== Safety ==

Protective clothing is designed to protect operators in the event of a moving chain touching their clothing by snarling the chain and sprocket, by using special synthetic fibers woven into the garment. Despite safety features and protective clothing, injuries can still arise from chainsaw use, from the large forces involved in the work, from the fast-moving, sharp chain, or the vibration and noise of the machinery.

A common accident arises from &quot;kickback&quot; when a chain tooth at the tip of the guide bar catches on wood without cutting through it. This throws the bar (with its moving chain) in an upward arc toward the operator, which can cause serious injury or even death.

Another dangerous situation occurs when heavy timber begins to fall or shift before a cut is complete. The chainsaw operator may be trapped or crushed. Similarly, timber falling in an unplanned direction may harm the operator or other workers, or an operator working at a height may fall or be injured by falling timber.

Like other hand-held machinery, the operation of chainsaws can cause vibration white finger, tinnitus, or industrial deafness. These symptoms were very common before vibration dampening using rubber or steel spring was introduced. Heated handles are additional help. Newer, lighter, and easier to wield cordless electric chainsaws use brushless motors, which further decrease noise and vibration compared to traditional petroleum-powered models.

The risks associated with chainsaw use mean that protective clothing such as chainsaw boots, chaps, and hearing protectors are normally worn while operating them, and many jurisdictions require that operators be certified or licensed to work with chainsaws. Injury can also result if the chain breaks during operation due to poor maintenance or attempting to cut inappropriate materials.

Gasoline-powered chainsaws expose operators to harmful carbon monoxide gas, especially indoors or in partially enclosed outdoor areas.

Drop starting, or turning on a chainsaw by dropping it with one hand while pulling the starting cord with the other, is a safety violation in most states in the U.S. Keeping both hands on the saw for stability is essential for safe chainsaw use.

Safe and effective chainsaw and crosscut use on federally administered public lands within the United States has been codified since 2016 in the &quot;Final Directive for National Saw Program&quot; issued by the United States Forest Service, which specifies the training, testing, and certification process for employees and unpaid volunteers who operate chainsaws within public lands.

==Working techniques==

Chainsaw training is designed to provide working technical knowledge and skills to safely operate the equipment.
* Sizeup – This is scouting and planning safe cuts for the felling direction, danger zones, and retreat paths, before starting the saw. The tree&#x27;s location relative to other objects, support, and tension determines a safe fall, splits off, or if the saw will jam. Several factors to consider are tree lean and bend, wind direction, branch arrangement, snow load, obstacles and damaged, rotting tree parts, which might behave unexpectedly when cut. A tree may have to fall in its natural direction if it is too dangerous or impossible to fell in a desired direction. The aim is for the tree to fall safely for limbing and cross-cutting the log. The goal is to avoid having the tree fall on another tree or obstacle.
* Felling – After clearing the tree&#x27;s base undergrowth for the retreat path and the felling direction; felling is properly done with three main cuts. To control the fall, the directional cut line should run 1/4 of the tree diameter to make a 45-degree wedge, which should be 90 degrees to the felling direction and perfectly horizontal. The top cut should be made first and then the bottom cut is made to form the directional cut line at the wedge point. A narrow or nonexistent hinge lessens felling direction control. From the opposite side of the wedge, the final felling cut is finished one-tenth of the tree diameter from the direction cut line. The felling cut is made horizontally and slightly (1.5–2 inches; ) above the bottom cut. When the hinge is properly set, the felling cut will begin the fall in the desired direction. A sitback is when a tree moves back opposite the intended direction. Placing a wedge in the felling cut can prevent a sitback from pinching the saw.
* Freeing – Working a badly fallen tree that may have become trapped in other trees. Working out maximum tension locations to decide the safest way to release tension, and a winch may be needed in complicated situations. To avoid cutting straight through a tree in tension, one or two cuts at the tension point of sufficient depth to reduce tension may be necessary. After tension releases, cuts are made outside the bend.
* Limbing – Cutting the branches off the log. The operator must be able to properly reach the cut to avoid kickback.
* Bucking – Cross-cutting the felled log into sections. Setup is made to avoid binding the chainsaw within the changing log tensions and compressions. Safe bucking is started at the log high-side and then sections worked offside, toward the butt end. The offside log falls and allows for gravity to help prevent binds. The log&#x27;s kerf movement while cutting can help to indicate binds. Additional equipment (lifts, bars, wedges, and winches) and special cutting techniques can help prevent binds.
* Binds – This is when the chainsaw is at risk or is stuck in the log compression. A log bound chainsaw is unsafe and must be carefully removed to prevent equipment damage.
** Top bind – The tension area on log bottom, compression on top.
** Bottom bind – The tension area on log top, compression on bottom.
** Side bind – Sideways pressure exerted on the log.
** End bind – Weight compresses the log&#x27;s entire cross-section.
* Brushing and slashing – This is quickly clearing small trees and branches under five inches () in diameter. Hand piler may follow along to move out debris.

==Cutting==
Chainsaws with specially designed bar-and-chain combinations have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills. Specialized chainsaws are used for cutting concrete during construction developments. Chainsaws are sometimes used for cutting ice; for example, ice sculpture and winter swimming in Finland.

=== As a sawmill ===
When fastened into a special guide frame, a chainsaw can be used as a portable sawmill to cut bulk wood into planks or boards. Such usage is called a chainsaw mill or Alaskan sawmill.

=== Cutting stone, concrete, and brick ===
Special chainsaws can cut concrete, brick, and natural stone. These use similar chains to ordinary chainsaws, but with cutting edges embedded with diamond grit. They may use gasoline or hydraulic power, and the chain is lubricated with water, because of high friction and to remove stone dust. The machine is used in construction, for example, in cutting deep, square holes in walls or floors, in stone sculpture for removing large chunks of stone during pre-carving, by fire departments for gaining access to buildings, and in restoration of buildings and monuments for removing parts with minimal damage to the surrounding structure. More recently, concrete chainsaws with electric motors of 230 volts have also been developed.

Because the material to be cut is not fibrous, much less kickback occurs. So, the most-used method of cutting is plunge-cutting, by pushing the tip of the blade into the material. With this method, square cuts as small as the blade width can be achieved. Pushback can occur if a block shifts when nearly cut through and pinches the blade, but overall, the machine is less dangerous than a wood-cutting chainsaw.

===Underwater work===

Chainsaws are used for underwater cutting by professional divers. They are usually driven by hydraulic power supplied from the surface and operated by commercial divers using surface-supplied diving equipment. Underwater chainsaw cutting may also be used by public safety divers.

Hydraulic chainsaws can be used to cut wood, concrete, brick and steel if the appropriate chain is used. Underwater cutting may be done in conditions of moving water and low visibility, which can increase risk, and appropriate safety precautions and suitable procedures are required for safety.

Underwater wood structures may include bridge pilings, pier, and dock timbers. Chain saws generally include an interlocking safety trigger with hand guard.

<doc id="235085" wikidata="Q972806" url="?curid=235085" title="Ricky Martin (1999 album)">
<text>Ricky Martin is the first English album and fifth studio album by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin. It was released on May 11, 1999, by Columbia Records. Following the release of four Spanish-language albums, and the huge success of his fourth studio album, &quot;Vuelve&quot; (1998), Martin announced the recording of his first English-language album. He worked with producers KC Porter, Robi Rosa, and Desmond Child to create the album. Musically, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; consists of dance-pop tracks, power ballads, mid-tempo pop songs, and rock numbers. After the album&#x27;s release, Martin embarked on the worldwide Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2000 by a Latin artist.

The album was supported by four singles. The lead single &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin&#x27;s biggest hit and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks, becoming Martin&#x27;s first number one single on the chart. Follow-up singles &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot;, and &quot;Private Emotion&quot; became number one and top 10 hits around the world. &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its various genres and styles. &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the album as one of the &quot;10 Best Solo Albums by Former Boy Band Members&quot; in 2020. It was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.

The album was a commercial success. It debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 661,000 copies, becoming the largest sales week by any album in 1999 and breaking the record as the largest first-week sales for any pop or Latin artist in history. Additionally, it made Martin the first male Latin act in history to debut at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and Spain, among others. The album has received several certifications, including 7× platinum in the United States, and diamond in Canada. Only within three months, it became the best-selling album ever by a Latin artist. It is generally seen as the album that began the &quot;Latin explosion&quot; and paved the way for a large number of other Latin artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Marc Anthony, Santana, and Enrique Iglesias.

==Background and recording==

In 1998, Ricky Martin released his fourth studio album, &quot;Vuelve&quot;. The album experienced both critical and commercial success, spending 26 weeks atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart. &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; was released as the second single from the album, and became the official song of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. It topped the charts in more than 30 countries, and Martin performed it at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, which was greeted with a massive standing ovation and met with acclaim from music critics. On October 22, 1998, CNN confirmed that Martin had started working on his first English language album, following the huge success of &quot;Vuelve&quot;. On March 6, 1999, almost two weeks after his Grammy performance, it was announced that the album had been set for release in May. While the album was still untitled at the time, American musician Diane Warren revealed that she contributed two songs to the album, which was produced by KC Porter, Robi Rosa, and Desmond Child. During an interview with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Martin told the newspaper that this album has Asian influences:

On April 24, 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; revealed the album&#x27;s title as eponymous in an article, mentioning that it was initially set for retail on May 25, 1999. However, the huge interest in the disc encouraged Columbia Records to decide to rush the album to release two weeks ahead of schedule, on May 11. Tom Corson, the senior vice president of marketing at Columbia explained: &quot;Quite simply, the market has demanded it. People have been wanting this record for a while, and it&#x27;s now reached the point where we have to get it out there immediately.&quot; Tim Devin, the general manager of Tower Records in New York added about Martin: &quot;He&#x27;s always been one of our strongest Latin artists, but interest in him has picked up considerably since that performance.&quot; In an interview with MTV, Martin told the channel about the album&#x27;s title: &quot;I cannot wear a mask to go on stage. Those are my influences. This is Ricky Martin. That&#x27;s why the album is called &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;. As simple is that. We want to keep it simple. Like Einstein said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s make it simple, but not simpler than what it is.&#x27; And this is me.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Ricky Martin&quot; is a primarily English language album composed of 14 songs, consisting dance-pop tracks, power ballads, mid-tempo pop songs, and &quot;straight-ahead&quot; rock numbers. Ed Morales from &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; stated that the album &quot;runs the gamut from ska and rock&#x27; n&#x27; roll to Latin pop&quot;. &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; () is a rock-etched up-tempo pop song that features Latin percussion rhythms and horn riffs mixed with surf rock-inspired guitar riffs. It has salsa-rock fusion influences, and is about an irresistible, particularly sinister wild woman who lives on the edge, seducing others into her crazy world. The album also contains a Spanish-language version of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, which was recorded under the same title.

In &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, Martin refers to sultriness, tango, and dance over salsa descarga and up-tempo beats. The ballad &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; uses an Indian guitar and lyrically, is the tale of a man missing his woman, as he continues to live and breathe for her. It also has a Spanish version titled &quot;Bella&quot; (). Martin dedicated the track to his grandmother who died a year earlier. &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot; is a salsa party track and features a mix of pop, R&amp;B, Middle Eastern riffs, and Latin horns, as well as a fusion of Latin percussion with retro organ. A Spanglish guitar-based down-tempo duet along with Madonna, &quot;Be Careful (Cuidado con mi corazón)&quot; mixes acoustic and electronic elements.

&quot;I Am Made of You&quot; is a &quot;metal-type&quot; ballad and uses electric guitar and drums that create a theme of &quot;nostalgia and rock&quot;, while &quot;Love You for a Day&quot; is a &quot;high-energy&quot; Latin funk track featuring Latin elements, such as lengthy descargas, piano tumbaos, Latin percussion, and horns. The ballad &quot;Private Emotion&quot;, which features a guest appearance by Swedish singer Meja is a cover version of a song under the same title by the Hooters for their fifth studio album &quot;Out of Body&quot; (1993). &quot;You Stay With Me&quot; is a slow ballad with &quot;heart-wrenching&quot; lyrics, and &quot;I Count the Minutes&quot; is a homage to the 1980s. &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; also features the Spanglish radio edit versions of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; and &quot;María&quot;, which were released as singles for Martin&#x27;s previous albums. This version of &quot;María&quot; is remixed by Puerto Rican DJ Pablo Flores, who upped the tempo and the sex appeal of the song, turning the slow-burn flamenco laced track into an up-tempo samba tune in a house bassline. &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; is a samba-rooted Latin pop song, and features elements of batucada, salsa, dance, mambo, and Europop. Throughout the song, Martin carries a &quot;soccer-heavy&quot; message with fully positive lyrics.

==Singles==
Columbia Records released &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; to radio stations on March 23, 1999, as the lead single from the album. The song topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin&#x27;s biggest hit, and one of the best-selling singles of all time. In the United States, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks, becoming Martin&#x27;s first number one single on the chart. Additionally, it broke several records on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It also spent eight consecutive weeks atop the Canada Top Singles chart and topped the country&#x27;s year-end chart. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number one and stayed there for three weeks, making Martin the first Puerto Rican artist in history to hit number one. The track was ranked as the best &#x27;90s pop song by &quot;Elle&quot;, and was listed among the Best Latin Songs of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot;. It was nominated for four categories at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Its Spanish version reached the summit of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart in the United States, and was nominated for Record of the Year at the 2000 Latin Grammy Awards.

&quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; was released as the second single from the album on June 15, 1999. It peaked at numbers two and three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Canada Top Singles charts, respectively. The Spanish version, &quot;Bella&quot; topped the charts in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Panama, as well as &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Tracks chart. It also peaked at number two in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico. The third single from &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot; was released on October 12, 1999; it reached the top 10 in Canada, Finland, and New Zealand, as well as the top 15 in Spain, Scotland, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 22 on the Hot 100. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Private Emotion&quot;, was launched on February 8, 2000. It reached number one in the Czech Republic, and was a top 10 hit in Finland, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Music videos were filmed for both English and Spanish versions of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot;, &quot;Bella&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot;, and &quot;Private Emotion&quot;.

===Release===
&quot;Ricky Martin&quot; was released worldwide by Columbia Records on May 11, 1999. The European edition of &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; includes the Spanish version of &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, titled &quot;La Diosa Del Carnaval&quot; (), as well as a new track &quot;I&#x27;m On My Way&quot;, while the Spanglish radio edit versions of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; and &quot;María&quot; are not featured. This track list has been also used for the African, Asian, and Latin American editions. The Chinese edition contains both &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; and &quot;María&quot; in addition to the standard Asian track list. The Spanish release uses the same track list as the European, but &quot;Por Arriba, Por Abajo&quot; () from Martin&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Vuelve&quot;, has been added as a hidden track as well. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Martin succeeded Leonardo DiCaprio as &quot;the reigning king of heartthrobs&quot; to become the most popular male celebrity on the American shopping website eBay in 1999, following the album&#x27;s release. Many Martin products and items were on sale at the time, such as his posters, autographs, Pepsi cans, wall clocks, plastic dolls, autographed &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; CDs, and &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; sheet musics.

===Live performances===
To further promote &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, he embarked on the worldwide Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour. The tour began on October 21, 1999, at the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida, and concluded on October 25, 2000, at the Colonial Stadium in Melbourne, with concerts throughout North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. In the United States, the Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2000 by a Latin artist, earning over $36.3 million with 44 dates and drawing 617,488 fans. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; Boxscore, the tour grossed $51.3 million in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with 60 shows and drawing an audience of 875,151. International dates were not reported to Boxscore and would push the tour&#x27;s grosses higher. In addition to his tour, Martin performed singles from &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; on many television programs and award shows. He performed &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; at the 1999 World Music Awards, the 1999 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and Bingolotto TV Show. At the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, he performed &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, accompanied by a group of impressive women dressed in glitter. To promote the album&#x27;s material in the United Kingdom, Martin delivered performances of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; and &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on August 6, 1999, and November 19, 1999, respectively.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Ricky Martin&quot; has been met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars and said that despite moments of filler and outdated production, its songs are balanced well between various genres and styles on &quot;a big, bold album with something to please everyone, from his longtime Latin fans to housewives with a weakness for dramatic ballads&quot;. He noted that all tracks have been constructed carefully on their own, and complimented Martin&#x27;s &quot;fine voice and undeniable charisma&quot; that bring all tracks &quot;alive&quot;, calling him &quot;a true star&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s James Hunter felt it lacks the excitement of Martin&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Vuelve&quot; because of its remixes and Warren-penned songs. However, he said that Martin&#x27;s take on Latin pop is made interesting enough by highlights such as &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot;, and the &quot;perfectly constructed ballad&quot; sung with Madonna.

&quot;The News Journal&quot; critic Jena Montgomery complimented &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; for alternating between &quot;infectious tunes&quot; and &quot;somber, seductive ballads&quot;, stating that his &quot;upbeat pop tunes will undoubtedly catch your ear and stay in your head&quot; and the ballads &quot;are strikingly well-written and performed&quot;. She added that Martin &quot;sings with such passion and tenderness&quot; that &quot;keeps you hanging on, begging for more&quot;. Steve Dollar from &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; described the album as &quot;shockingly irresistible&quot;, and Jim Farber from &quot;Daily News&quot; thought it is &quot;certainly an improvement over Martin&#x27;s four Spanish records&quot;. &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; reviewer Diana Penner gave it three out of four stars, describing Martin&#x27;s pop tunes as &quot;melodic and eminently listenable&quot;. She also highlighted &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, confessing that she does not know any &quot;more happy-snappy catchy melody&quot; than that. Another author of &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; praised Martin for mixing styles well from pop to funk, and noted the album tracks&#x27; Latin rhythms that make &quot;Martin automatically separate himself from the rest of &quot;popular male artists&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; staff assured Martin would be a &quot;household name&quot; before the end of the summer, and described the project as &quot;cheesy, breezy, mass-appeal pop&quot;. The staff also called the duet with Madonna &quot;superb&quot; and celebrated Martin&#x27;s &quot;sincerely&quot; singing with Meja. In a retrospective review for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Leila Cobo described &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; as &quot;an album that went from percussion-filled dance tracks&quot; to &quot;smooth, unabashedly romantic ballads&quot;. She ranked &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; as the best track on the album and praised most of the other tracks of the record, naming &quot;Private Emotion&quot; the &quot;under-appreciated jewel&quot; of the album and calling it a &quot;gorgeous ballad&quot;. She noted &quot;immediately hummable melodies, traces of nostalgia and rock&quot; in &quot;I Am Made of You&quot;, labeling the track &quot;a beauty&quot;. In another article, she described &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; as dazzling. Coinciding with the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Celia San Miguel of &quot;Tidal Magazine&quot; gave it a positive review, highlighting &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; for its &quot;clever fusion of ska, rock, mambo, swing and pop sounds&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; for Martin&#x27;s &quot;charismatic heartthrob and his passionate and emotive vocals&quot;. She stated that &quot;in 1999, Martin&#x27;s star power became undeniable&quot;. In 2020, Daniella Boik from &quot;Paste&quot; acknowledged the album as Martin&#x27;s most influential album since starting his solo career.

==Accolades==
In 2019, Stacker ranked &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; as the 18th best album by an &quot;LGBTQ&quot; musician. In 2020, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it at number eight on the list of &quot;Best Solo Albums by Former Boy Band Members&quot;. The album has received a number of awards and nominations. It was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to &quot;Brand New Day&quot; by Sting.

Only within three months, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; became the best-selling album ever by a Latin artist. According to different sources, the album has sold over 15 million copies or even 17 million copies worldwide.

==Legacy and influence==

Martin is regarded by the media as the &quot;Original Latin Crossover King&quot;. Angie Romero from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote: &quot;If you look up &#x27;crossover&#x27; in the dictionary, there should be a photo of Ricky shaking his bon bon and/or &#x27;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&#x27;.&quot; Following his performance of &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; at the Grammys, and the success of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; and &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1999), he opened the gates for many Latin artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Marc Anthony, Santana, and Enrique Iglesias who released their crossover albums and followed him onto the top of the charts. Jim Farber from &quot;Daily News&quot; noted that &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; &quot;provides a textbook example of how to mix Latin beats with pop tunes and rock intonations&quot;. Lucas Villa from &quot;Spin&quot; wrote about Martin&#x27;s global success in 1999: &quot;When the world went &quot;loca&quot; for Ricky, he led the way for other Latin music superstars like Spain&#x27;s Enrique Iglesias, Colombia&#x27;s Shakira and Nuyoricans like Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony to make their marks beyond the Spanish-speaking crowds.&quot; &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; critic Kevin C. Johnson described Martin as Latin music&#x27;s &quot;pretty-faced poster boy&quot; who is &quot;taking the music to places Jon Secada, Selena and Santana never could&quot;. He also mentioned that even &quot;Gloria Estefan at her peak, failed to muster up the kind of hype and hoopla surrounding Martin&quot;.
Celia San Miguel of &quot;Tidal Magazine&quot; stated that Martin &quot;highlighted the public&#x27;s thirst for a different kind of pop&quot; in 1999, noting the album&#x27;s &quot;fusion-heavy&quot; and &quot;hip-shaking rhythms associated with Latin music&quot;. She mentioned that the album &quot;spawned 1999&#x27;s Latin music boom&quot;, emphasizing the fact that Martin created the &quot;spark&quot; of the &quot;Latin Pop Explosion&quot;, which was followed by 1999 albums, &quot;On the 6&quot; by Lopez, &quot;Enrique&quot; by Iglesias, and Anthony&#x27;s eponymous album. She continued crediting &quot;Martin and the paths he created&quot; responsible for the Latin music and Spanish and Spanglish lyrics being &quot;a commonplace phenomenon on English-language radio&quot; in 2019. In her review for Grammy.com, Ana Monroy Yglesias said Martin led a &quot;major music moment in 1999&quot; with &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, and along with him, &quot;the first major boom of Spanish-language artists&quot;, such as Shakira and Lopez, came into the &quot;U.S. pop landscape&quot;. Geoff Mayfield from &quot;Billboard&quot; stated: &quot;Martin&#x27;s triumph isn&#x27;t just a big win for Latin music or the Sony camp but a big day for the entire music industry.&quot;

According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, the music industry took in revenues of $23.7 billion in 1999, making it the peak year of the business in history. It was also a significant growth in compare with 1998. The website highlighted &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, and &quot;Millennium&quot; as examples of &quot;blockbuster albums&quot; which produced the result. Also, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield described 1999 as &quot;the year music exploded&quot;, mentioning Spears, Aguilera, Martin, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys as &quot;a new breed of stars&quot; who got born. Additionally, Jason Lipshutz from &quot;Billboard&quot; labeled 1999 &quot;[the] Best Musical Year of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

<text>Fallen Leaf Lake, once called Dead Lake, is a lake in Camas, Washington. Once home to Dead Lake Cemetery, its graves were moved to Camas Cemetery in 1984.

This property had been owned by the local Camas paper mill for decades. Most recently, the mill was owned by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc. In 2011, the property surrounding Fallen Leaf Lake was purchased from Koch RP Holdings I, LLC by the City of Camas, Washington for use as a city park.

<doc id="235089" wikidata="Q52166" url="?curid=235089" title="Phaedrus (fabulist)">
<text>Gaius Julius Phaedrus (; ; Phaîdros), or Phaeder (c. 15 BC – c. 50 AD) was a 1st-century AD Roman fabulist and the first versifier of a collection of Aesop&#x27;s fables into Latin. Nothing is recorded of his life except for what can be inferred from his poems, and there was little mention of his work during late antiquity. It was not until the discovery of a few imperfect manuscripts during and following the Renaissance that his importance emerged, both as an author and in the transmission of the fables.

==Biography==
The poet describes himself as born in the Pierian Mountains, perhaps in Pydna, and names the Thracian musicians Linus and Orpheus as his countrymen. The inscriptions and subscriptions in the manuscript tradition identify him as a freedman of Augustus. Some have inferred from these data that Phaedrus was brought to Rome in his childhood as a slave following the Thracian campaign of L. Calpurnius Piso.

Whether in Rome or elsewhere, Phaedrus studied Latin literature in his youth, as he quotes a line from Ennius saying that he read it when he was a boy. When he had published his first two books of fables, he was subjected to a trial in which he says Sejanus was accuser, witness, and judge. Although it is not clear what punishment the poet suffered, the poet pleads with a certain Eutychus to intercede on his behalf in the prologue to his third book. In the epilogue of the third book, the poet describes himself as in advanced middle age, and the final poem of Phaedrus&#x27;s fifth book implies that he had reached old age.

There is no external evidence by which to judge whether the poet spoke truthfully of himself, and scholars have assigned different degrees of significance to the biographical hints contained in the poems. Attilio de Lorenzi&#x27;s biography &quot;Fedro&quot; is reviewed by Perry as a &quot;consistent and convincing all-round picture of the man&quot; with &quot;nothing unreasonable or improbable in any of the author&#x27;s conclusions,&quot; but derided by another reviewer as &quot;a romance&quot; born of &quot;de Lorenzi&#x27;s ingenious imagination&quot; which is &quot;entertaining to read, but not always easy to believe.&quot; likewise disparages elements of de Lorenzi&#x27;s reconstruction as tenuously supported and &quot;novelistic,&quot; and declares &quot;Fedro&quot; an original and useful work on the whole, but one which must be used with caution for biographical facts. Edward Champlin, while acknowledging that the traditional account of Phaedrus&#x27;s life is &quot;handed down through the scholarly literature,&quot; derides even the broad outlines of it that are most commonly accepted as &quot;complete fantasy&quot; and argues that what Phaedrus had to say about himself might as plausibly be reinterpreted to prove that he was born in Rome and spent the whole of his life there as a free citizen. On the basis of &quot;an astonishingly sophisticated interest in Roman law&quot; seen in the poems, however, Champlin asserts that &quot;Phaedrus was a lawyer.&quot;

 purported to find new biographical information in the fables in the form of acrostics, many of which could not be found in the text without novel editorial interventions. Herrmann also attributed the &quot;Apocolocyntosis,&quot; the &quot;Distichs of Cato,&quot; and most of the &quot;Culex&quot; to Phaedrus and sifted these texts for further biographical clues. The second part of Herrmann&#x27;s book was an edition of the fables (in a novel order and divided into four books) and the other works he ascribed to Phaedrus. C. J. Fordyce described Herrmann&#x27;s book simply as &quot;full of surprises&quot;, of which the greatest was that Herrmann was &quot;an editor of Phaedrus, and a professor of Latin, to whom quantity appears to mean nothing at all and who by his own conjectures turns metrical lines into unmetrical on every other page.&quot; Frank Goodyear mocked a later editor for citing Herrmann, referring to him sarcastically as &quot;that noted metrician&quot;. Alfred Ernout remarked that while he would leave Herrmann&#x27;s biographical theories to be discussed by historians of literature, he could only regret the abundance of errors of every kind to be found in Herrmann&#x27;s edition.

===Name===
Phaedrus&#x27;s name appears in his own text and in Martial in the genitive case as &quot;Phaedri.&quot; It is found in the nominative case, as &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; in Avianus&#x27;s letter to Theodosius, and in the titles of three of the fables, possibly added by scribes on the authority of Avianus. Some critics have argued the poet&#x27;s name would more correctly be written &quot;Phaeder&quot; in the nominative, by analogy to Latin names like &quot;Alexander,&quot; &quot;Menander,&quot; and &quot;Anaximander&quot; which reflect Greek originals that end in -δρος, supported by evidence from ancient inscriptions of the use of the form &quot;Phaeder.&quot;

Roman slaves were known by a single name, in contrast with the &quot;tria nomina&quot; borne by citizens. Manumitted slaves in the early empire usually took the praenomen and nomen of their former master, keeping their slave name as a cognomen. Some sources therefore give the poet&#x27;s full name as Gaius Julius Phaedrus (or Phaeder), with the praenomen and nomen of Augustus.

===Dates===
Because Sejanus died in AD 31, Phaedrus&#x27;s statement that his poems had offended Sejanus is usually taken to establish that the first two books were written before that date. That the first two books were published (whether together or separately) in the reign of Tiberius is supported by II.5.7, where Tiberius appears to be referred to as alive. Most scholars infer from the hostile manner in which Phaedrus writes of Sejanus, as if he had nothing further to fear from him, that the third book was written after Sejanus&#x27; death, but not long after, since Phaedrus was still suffering the effects of persecution by Sejanus. Phaedrus&#x27;s statement in the third book that he was in advanced middle age would therefore support an approximate birth date of 15 BC or 18 BC. Based on the poet&#x27;s insinuation in the fifth book that he was worn out by old age like the dog in the fable, scholars conclude that he died an old man in the reign of Claudius (41–54) or Nero (54–68); Giuseppe Zago believes Phaedrus to have revised his first book after having read Seneca the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Moral Epistles&quot; and books &quot;De beneficiis,&quot; in which case Phaedrus died in the reign of Nero or Vespasian (69–79).

==Textual sources==
The following sources are of significance for establishing the text of Phaedrus:

* Codex Pithoeanus (New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 906, ff. 33–87), so called because of its previous ownership by Pierre Pithou who used it to edit the &quot;editio princeps,&quot; was copied by several hands in the late 9th Century and contains 94 fables of Phaedrus divided into four books, bound together with the &quot;Liber Monstrorum.&quot; It was rebound in the 16th Century, now with a copy of Phaedrus on paper in Pithou&#x27;s hand in the front. It was inherited by Pithou&#x27;s great-grandson, , whose family was granted the title of Marquis of Rosanbo by Louis XIV, and so has also been known as the Rosanbo manuscript. A paleographic edition was published in 1893 with the permission of the Marquis of Rosanbo, but the family afterwards denied scholars access to the manuscript, prompting Perry to remark that the codex was in &quot;very private possession&quot; and Postgate to compare the present owner to the dragon from one of Phaedrus&#x27;s fables. It became more accessible after the Pierpont Morgan Library purchased it in 1961.
* Codex Remensis, formerly held at the Abbey of Saint-Remi, was copied ca. 830–850 and destroyed in a fire on January 16, 1774. The readings of this lost witness must be determined by the reports of printed editions and manuscript collations or tracings made by those who were able to have direct knowledge of the manuscript. It contained the same poems as the Codex Pithoeanus in the same order, bound together with the &quot;Querolus.&quot;
* Codex Reginensis Latinus 1616, preserved in the Vatican Library, contains the inscription of the first book immediately followed by eight fables from it (11–13 and 17–21) copied in the mid-9th Century at ff. 17r–18r. Despite the fragment&#x27;s brevity, E. K. Rand declares it the best source for the fables which it contains. This fragment is also called the &quot;vetus Danielis chartula&quot; or &quot;scheda Danielis&quot; because of its previous ownership by , who acquired many of the books of Fleury Abbey after the monastery was plundered by Huguenots in 1562. Daniel&#x27;s books were sold after his death to Jacques Bongars and Paul Pétau, and Pétau&#x27;s share was largely acquired in 1650 by Isaac Vossius as the agent of Christina, Queen of Sweden, who took her library to Rome after abdicating the throne. Her books passed into the Vatican Library, and in her honor are catalogued as the &quot;reginenses,&quot; or &quot;queenly&quot; books.
* Codex Neapolitanus or Perottinus (Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale, IV F 58) is the sole independent witness of an &quot;Epitome fabellarum Aesopi Auieni et Phaedri&quot; composed by Niccolò Perotti, consisting of poems composed by Phaedrus, Avianus, and Perotti himself, in Perotti&#x27;s hand and seemingly written after 1474. The waterlogged manuscript was discovered in the library of the Duke of Parma in early 1727 by . About a decade after d&#x27;Orville&#x27;s discovery, the codex was transferred from Parma to Naples following Charles III of Spain&#x27;s inheritance of the Farneses&#x27; books and conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. The manuscript contains 66 poems by Phaedrus, or rather 63, as Perotti copied one fable twice, and two fables are each divided into two. 30 of these 63 poems were not in the Pithoeanus or Remensis. This manuscript&#x27;s condition has so deteriorated over time due to water damage that in many places it can no longer be read, and recourse must be had to older copies and collations to determine its readings. Nearly all the lacunae can be filled by reference to two codices in the Vatican Library.
** Codex Urbinas Latinus 368, ff. 100–146, containing the entire &quot;Epitome,&quot; was made from the Neapolitanus around 1482 by Federico Veterano. The manuscript was brought to light by Angelo Mai around 1830.
** Codex Urbinas Latinus 301, the sole witness of a work by Perotti titled &quot;Cornucopiae,&quot; includes two fables of Phaedrus (III.17 at f. 644r and app. 4 at f. 126r–v).
** The so-called &quot;schedae d&#x27;Orvillianae&quot; (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. d&#x27;Orville 524) are a copy of the Neapolitanus made by d&#x27;Orville in 1727. D&#x27;Orville&#x27;s manuscripts were sold by his grandson to J. Cleaver Banks, who sold them to the Bodleian Library in 1804.
* Codex Vaticanus Latinus 5190, ff. 111r–125r, contains 22 fables of Phaedrus copied by two hands in the late 15th Century mixed with fables of Avianus, including 8 poems otherwise known only through the Neapolitanus, although it is evidently independent of Perotti.

===Prose paraphrases===
Several medieval fable collections made extensive use of Phaedrus &quot;in solution,&quot; i.e., with the metrical verses adapted into prose. The following collections contain 54 fables that are preserved in the direct tradition, 28 that have been lost from it, and 16 from non-Phaedrian sources. Each of them is printed in , and the fables they contain which have no equivalent in the extant metrical text of Phaedrus are translated or summarized in .

* Codex Leidensis Vossianus Latinus O. 15 (Leiden University Library), copied in the early 11th Century by Adémar de Chabannes, contains 67 fables at ff. 195r–203v, all but a few of which are paraphrases of Phaedrus.
* Codex Wissemburgensis (Wolfenbüttel, Herzog August Library, Codex Gudianus Latinus 148), copied in the 10th Century and formerly at Weissenburg Abbey as the 15th Century &quot;ex libris&quot; shows, contains 62 fables arranged in five books at ff. 60v–82r.

==Number and division of the fables==
===The five books===
Avianus writes about AD 400 that Phaedrus wrote five books of fables. The 94 fables contained in the Pithoeanus are divided into four books, but the text in the Remensis ended with the subscription &quot;PHAEDRI AVG(VSTI) LIBERTI LIBER QVINTVS EXPLICIT FELICITER&quot; (&quot;this is the end of the fifth book of Phaedrus, freedman of Augustus&quot;), indicating that in the manuscript from which the Pithoeanus and Remensis were copied, the poems were divided into five books.

The remains of Phaedrus&#x27;s five books transmitted in the Pithoeanus and Remensis are of unequal length and seem to indicate that material has been lost. This is supported by the apology in the prologue to the first book for including talking trees, of which there are no examples in the text that survives although there was one in the Perotti appendix. In fact, only 59 out of 94 in the Pithou manuscript were even animal fables.

===Appendix Perottina===
The 30 poems which were discovered in Codex Neapolitanus are known as the Appendix Perottina. Perotti, evidently unaware of the unique value of the manuscript from which he copied, excerpted fables in an arbitrary order. Some scholars have attempted to restore these fables to their places within the five books with divergent conclusions, but usually they are printed separately in the order in which they are found in Perotti&#x27;s &quot;Epitome.&quot; Perotti omitted the epimythia and promythia, sometimes transferring their wording into titles of his own stating the moral, which he added to all the fables.

===&quot;Fabulae novae&quot;===
 edited the Phaedrian fables transmitted in solution in 1709. A number of editors have undertaken to restore their original metrical form, and these reconstructions are conventionally referred to as the &quot;fabulae novae,&quot; or &quot;new fables.&quot; The first attempt was made by Pieter Burman the Elder in an appendix to his edition of 1718, which he omitted from his edition of 1727; J. Wight Duff says the omission was wise, as Burman made excessive and arbitrary changes in the words, and unavoidably violated some of Phaedrus&#x27;s metrical principles, which were poorly understood in the 18th Century.

 declares that there neither is nor can be a Latin sentence that cannot be made into a Phaedrian senarius by a slight adjustment, parodically &quot;restoring&quot; sentences from &quot;The Gallic War&quot; and Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Digest&quot; to a metrical form. Postgate defends the procedure of &quot;exhuming&quot; Phaedrus&#x27;s poems from the prose collections by versification, though conceding that &quot;in these reconstitutions ... we tread on treacherous ground&quot; and &quot;in some cases the metrical form cannot now be restored with completeness or with certainty.&quot; Postgate edited only ten &quot;fabulae novae&quot; in his edition, saying that previous editors, believing it to be their duty to Phaedrus to restore everything that was his, had not taken due account of the limits of what can be accomplished.

In 1921, published 30 &quot;fabulae novae.&quot; Duff praised Zander&#x27;s reconstruction as more valuable than his predecessors&#x27; efforts due to his &quot;strict parsimony in alterations&quot; and the clear information provided about the prose basis of the reconstruction and what words were supplied by the editor.

==Work==
A collection of Aesopic fables compiled by Demetrius of Phalerum is likely to have been Phaedrus&#x27;s main source. Phaedrus himself says in the prologue to Book 1 that &quot;Aesop&quot; is his source, and it is likely Demetrius&#x27;s book that he regarded as the canonical Aesop, as distinguished from fables drawn from other sources or invented by himself which he calls &quot;Aesopic in kind but not Aesop&#x27;s.&quot; Demetrius&#x27;s collection was a handbook of material that writers and speakers could adapt to make a point in the context of a work of another genre. Phaedrus created a new form of polite literature by elevating the fable to an independent genre, to be read as literature in its own right and not as an adjunct to another kind of work. Aesopic fable had traditionally been written in prose; before Phaedrus, some versified fables had been incorporated into works of other genres, but he is the first author in Latin or Greek to publish entire books of versified fables. Phaedrus&#x27;s verse is in iambic &quot;senarii&quot; and is very regular.

The author&#x27;s aim at the start was to follow Aesop in creating a work that &quot;moves one to mirth and warns with wise advice&quot;. As the work progressed, however, he widened his focus and now claimed to be &quot;refining&quot; Aesopic material and even adding to it. In later books we find tales of Roman events well after the time of Aesop such as &quot;Tiberius and the slave&quot; (II.5) and &quot;Augustus and the accused wife&quot; (III.9), as well as the poet&#x27;s personal reply to envious detractors (IV.21); there are also anecdotes in which Aesop figures from the later biographical tradition (II.3; III.3; IV.5; app. 9; app. 20). Finally he makes a distinction between matter and manner in the epilogue to the fifth book, commenting that
::I write in Esop’s style, not in his name,
::And for the most part I the subject claim.
::Tho&#x27; some brief portion Esop might indite,
::The more I from my own invention write,
::The style is ancient but the matter’s new.
He also claims a place in the Latin literary tradition by echoing well-known and respected writers. It is to be noticed, however, that where Phaedrus and the slightly earlier poet Horace adapted the same fable to satirical themes, they often used different versions of it. In Horace a crow (&quot;cornicula&quot;) is the subject of The Bird in Borrowed Feathers; in Phaedrus it is a jackdaw (&quot;graculus&quot;). In the case of The Horse that Lost its Liberty, Phaedrus has it disputing with a boar and Horace with a stag. Neither do they agree in their account of The Frog and the Ox. Horace follows the story found in Greek sources; the frog&#x27;s motivation is different in Phaedrus, and it is his version that Martial follows later. Moreover, in following the model of Aesop, the enfranchised slave, Phaedrus&#x27;s satire is sharper and restores &quot;the ancient function of the fable as a popular expression against the dominant classes&quot;. Another commentator points out that &quot;the Aesopian fable has been a political creature from its earliest origins, and Phaedrus, (who was La Fontaine&#x27;s model), though more openly subversive, has claims to be the first proletarian satiric poet&quot;.

==Testimonia and ancient reception==
===Seneca and Cassius Longinus===
Seneca the Younger, writing about AD 43, recommended in a letter to Claudius&#x27;s freedman Polybius that he turn his hand to Latinizing Aesop, &#x27;a task hitherto not attempted by Roman genius&#x27; (&quot;Ad Polybium&quot; 8.3). This may indicate that Seneca had not heard of Phaedrus&#x27;s works, that Seneca deliberately ignored Phaedrus&#x27;s works or did not consider them works of &quot;Roman genius,&quot; or that Phaedrus&#x27;s works did not yet exist and the traditional dating of his first three books in the reign of Tiberius is mistaken. However, it is highly likely that Seneca knew the works of Phaedrus.

Ulpian records that Cassius Longinus, who died not long after AD 70, was accustomed to use the term &quot;a leonine partnership&quot; for a partnership where one partner takes all of the profits and the other partners run all of the risk, indicating that Cassius was familiar with a fable invented by Phaedrus about the lion taking all the profits of his partnership with the other animals (I.5).

===Martial===

By the mid-80s, Martial was imitating Phaedrus and mentions his mischievous humour (&quot;improbi jocos Phaedri,&quot; &quot;the jests of naughty Phaedrus&quot;). Whether Martial referred to the author of fables or to another man of the same name has been disputed. Interpreting the adjective &quot;improbi&quot; as modifying &quot;jocos,&quot; argued that Phaedrus&#x27;s fables cannot rightly be called &quot;joci&quot; because they are not apt to provoke laughter, nor are they &quot;improbi&quot; (interpreted in the sense that they required hard work to accomplish) because Phaedrus wrote light verse about common, everyday things. Fischer believed the verse referred to Phaedrus the Epicurean. Others have proposed that Martial&#x27;s Phaedrus is an otherwise unknown author of mimes. Ludwig Friedländer argues that Martial often uses &quot;improbus&quot; as a synonym of &quot;lascivus,&quot; or &quot;bawdy,&quot; and Phaedrus&#x27;s fables do not answer to this description, but Martial does associate the word &quot;improbus&quot; with mimes. Frédéric Plessis accepts Friedländer&#x27;s reasoning.

Johann Friedrich Gronovius interpreted the word &quot;improbus&quot; to mean &quot;bold&quot; or &quot;impudent,&quot; and considered it sufficiently explained by the fact that Phaedrus had represented animals and trees as speaking in his fables, and by the fact that through his fables, he had lampooned the behavior of the mighty of his age. Léopold Hervieux considered Gronovius to have demonstrated beyond any doubt that Martial referred to the fabulist. Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel rejects Friedländer&#x27;s hypothesis as lacking probability. Robinson Ellis identifies several fables as containing indecent content that can explain the designation &quot;improbus,&quot; and notes that more may have been contained in lost writings of Phaedrus.

Whether this line by Martial originally referred to &quot;jocos&quot; is also disputed. The best manuscripts read &quot;locos&quot; or &quot;locus.&quot; Later manuscripts read &quot;jocos,&quot; which has been adopted by editors, but may be no more than an emendation by an Italian humanist. Following a suggestion originally made by , several editors since 1925 have emended this word to the Greek word λόγους, used in Latin as a loanword signifying &quot;fables.&quot; A. E. Housman grants that both &quot;improbi&quot; and &quot;jocos&quot; have such associations that this combination of words could be taken to suggest lascivious poems, and that there are no poems extant in Phaedrus&#x27;s corpus which would merit this description, but argues that besides the fact that Phaedrus himself calls his fables &quot;joci,&quot; &quot;improbus&quot; need mean nothing more than that Phaedrus was &quot;disrespectful,&quot; which &quot;may allude to those hits at the high and mighty which are supposed to have provoked the displeasure of Sejanus&quot;, and emending to λόγους &quot;leaves &quot;improbi&quot; freer to mean what it ought.&quot;

===Subsequent authors===

Quintilian does not mention Phaedrus by name, but recommends as a school exercise that students compose prose versions of versified fables of Aesop, a genre originated by Phaedrus. This passage is interpreted by J. P. Postgate to praise a particular poet (taken by Postgate to be Phaedrus) who had told Aesop&#x27;s fables in a &quot;pure style.&quot; This is disputed, however, by F. H. Colson, who takes the &quot;sermo purus&quot; in this passage to refer to a style to be demanded of students in their own compositions.

The next literary reference is a homage by Phaedrus&#x27;s fellow fabulist Avianus near the start of the 5th century, who claims the five books of fables as one of his sources in the dedication of his own work. The author of &quot;Octavia&quot;, Tertullian, Nemesianus, Ausonius, St. Paulinus of Nola, Prudentius, the author of the &quot;Alcestis Barcinonensis&quot;, and the author of the &quot;Querolus&quot; also appear to have read and imitated Phaedrus, but no author from antiquity mentions him by name other than Martial and Avianus. Whether Juvenal read Phaedrus is uncertain.

István Szamosközy discovered the verse &quot;nisi utile est quod facimus, stulta est gloria&quot; inscribed on a tomb in Alba Iulia, and published it in 1593. This was later identified as a line from Phaedrus. According to , this inscription still existed in 1666. Theodor Mommsen does not consider the inscription genuine.

==Modern reception==
François Pithou discovered Codex Pithoeanus in 1596, at which time Phaedrus&#x27;s work had fallen into complete oblivion, and sent the manuscript to his brother Pierre Pithou, who used it to publish the &quot;editio princeps.&quot; Pithou left no record of where this manuscript was found except for a note at the end of his edition that said, &quot;vet. ex. Cat.&quot; Johann Caspar von Orelli plausibly took this to be an abbreviation of &quot;vetus exemplar Catalaunense&quot; (&quot;an ancient copy from Châlons-en-Champagne&quot;) or &quot;Catuacense&quot; (&quot;from Douai&quot;). Nicolas Rigault brought out an edition in 1599 based on both the Pithoeanus and the scheda Danielis, and a new edition in 1617 (with minor corrections in 1630) taking into account the evidence of the Remensis.

Codex Neapolitanus was discovered at Parma by in 1727. D&#x27;Orville informed his professor Pieter Burman the Elder of the find, but Burman did not attempt to edit the previously unknown poems because the manuscript was illegible in many places.

The Neapolitanus was rediscovered in Naples in 1808 by Juan Andrés, S.J. hastily brought out an edition of it from a copy made in the library by his brother, while Andrés, unaware of Cassitto&#x27;s work, commissioned to produce an edition; Jannelli&#x27;s edition was in the hands of the printers when Cassitto&#x27;s edition unexpectedly appeared. A bitter scholarly controversy ensued as Jannelli strove to vindicate the superiority of his edition. Cassitto&#x27;s first edition was printed in only fifty copies, and is of no value except as a bibliographical curiosity. Both editions lost much of their interest when Angelo Mai published a much better preserved copy of Perotti&#x27;s &quot;Epitome&quot; in 1831.

The fables of Phaedrus soon began to be published as school editions, both in the original Latin and in prose translation. Since the 18th century there have also been four complete translations into English verse. The first was by Christopher Smart into octosyllabic couplets (London 1753). Brooke Boothby&#x27;s &quot;The Esopean Fables of Phedrus&quot; were included in his &quot;Fables and Satires&quot; (Edinburgh, 1809) and also used octosyllables but in a more condensed manner:
::What Esop taught his beasts in Greek,
::Phedrus in Latin made them speak:
::In English, I from him translate,
::And his brief manner imitate.
It was followed by the Reverend Frederick Toller&#x27;s &quot;A poetical version of the fables of Phædrus&quot; in 1854. These were translated more diffusely into irregular verses of five metrical feet and each fable was followed by a prose commentary. P. F. Widdows&#x27; translation also includes the fables in the Perotti appendix and all are rendered into a free version of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse.

Phaedrus versions were translated individually by a variety of other poets into different languages. A small selection in various poetic forms appeared in the &quot;Poems &amp; Translations&quot; (London 1769) of Ashley Cowper (1701–88). There were many more poems distinctively styled in La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables; others followed by Ivan Krylov in Russian; Gregory Skovoroda and Leonid Hlibov in Ukrainian; and a more complete collection by Volodymyr Lytvynov in 1986.

<doc id="235093" wikidata="Q249740" url="?curid=235093" title="Double whole note">
<text>In music, a double whole note (American), breve (British) or double note lasts two times as long as a whole note (or &quot;semibreve&quot;). It is the second-longest note value still in use in modern music notation. The next longest notated note is the &quot;longa&quot;, which is double the length of the breve. The longest notated note (though now obsolete) is the &quot;maxima&quot;. 

==History==
In medieval mensural notation, the &quot;brevis&quot; was one of the shortest note lengths in use, hence its name, which is the Latin etymon of &quot;&quot;. In &quot;perfect&quot; rhythmic mode, the brevis was a third of a longa, or in &quot;imperfect&quot; mode, half a longa.

==Form==
In modern notation, a breve is commonly represented in either of two ways: by a hollow oval note head, like a whole note, with one or two vertical lines on either side, as on the left and right of the image, or as the rectangular shape also found in older notation, shown in the middle of the image.

Because it lasts longer than a bar in most modern time signatures in common use, the breve is rarely encountered except in English music, where the half-note is often used as the beat unit.

==Breve (double-whole) rest==

A related symbol is the double whole rest (double rest or breve rest), which usually denotes a silence for the same duration.) Double whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles occupying the whole vertical space between the second and third lines from the top of the musical staff. They are often used in long silent passages which are not divided into separate bars to indicate a rest of two bars, regardless of the duration of each bar. This and longer rests are collectively known as multiple rests. They are also used to represent whole bar rest for time signature only.

==Alla breve==

Alla breve, the time signature , takes its name from the note value breve. In the mensural notation of the Renaissance, it was an alternative term for &quot;proportio dupla&quot;, which meant that the &quot;brevis&quot; was to be considered the unit of time (&quot;tactus&quot;), instead of the usual &quot;semibrevis&quot;. The old symbol , used as an alternative to the numerical proportion 2:1 in mensural notation, is carried over into modern notational practice to indicate a smaller relative value per note shape. It is normally used for music in a relatively quick tempo, where it indicates two minim (half note) beats in a bar of four crotchets (quarter notes), while is the equivalent of , with four crotchet beats.

<text>Without Remorse is a thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and published on August 11, 1993. Set during the Vietnam War, it serves as an origin story of John Clark, one of the recurring characters in the &quot;Ryanverse&quot;. &quot;Without Remorse&quot; introduces Clark as former Navy SEAL John Kelly and explains how he changed his name. G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons paid $14 million for the North American rights, a record for a single book. The book debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Plot==
In 1970, former Navy SEAL John Kelly, who recently lost his pregnant wife, Patricia, in a car accident, picks up a hitchhiker named Pam on his way to his home on Battery Island in the Chesapeake Bay. They quickly become lovers, and over time Kelly discovers her full name, Pamela Madden, and that she is a runaway who became a drug mule and prostitute; she has recently escaped from her drug-dealer/pimp Henry Tucker. Kelly, along with the help of doctors Sam and Sarah Rosen, helps rehabilitate her from barbiturates. Weeks after recovering, Kelly and Pam go to Baltimore for follow-up treatment. Kelly takes them scouting through the neighborhood where her pimps work. One of them recognizes Pam and pursues them in a car chase. Kelly is gravely wounded by a shotgun blast, while Pam is recaptured and later tortured, gang-raped, and killed.

In Vietnam, a U.S. target drone (specified in the book as a buffalo hunter) discovers Air Force Colonel Robin Zacharias as a prisoner of war in a secret camp administered by the NVA. Since Zacharias possesses highly classified knowledge and has been declared killed in action, Admiral Dutch Maxwell arranges a secret rescue mission for him as well as other American POWs held in the camp. Unbeknownst to them, Soviet colonel Nikolay Grishanov has been interrogating the prisoners; he later lobbies his government to transport Zacharias and his fellow prisoners into the Soviet Union, citing their intelligence value. However, friction between the Soviets and the North Vietnamese leads the latter to decide to kill the POWs.

Meanwhile, Kelly recovers from his wounds with the help of Dr. Rosen and his head nurse, Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; O&#x27;Toole. Vowing to exact revenge on the people responsible for Pam&#x27;s death, he wages a private war on Tucker&#x27;s drug ring, eliminating some of its players and saving some female drug mules in the process. He recruits Rosen and O&#x27;Toole to help rehabilitate one of the rescued prostitutes, Doris Brown. He later obtains more information on the drug ring from brutally torturing one of Pam&#x27;s pimps, William Grayson, using a pressure chamber designed to simulate deep-water diving conditions; he is then left to die from severe decompression sickness. However, his specialized tactics, including advanced close-quarters combat, camouflaging himself as a homeless man, meticulous intelligence gathering, and manufacturing of suppressors for his firearms draw the attention of local investigators, particularly Emmet Ryan, who investigated Kelly&#x27;s initial altercation and Pam&#x27;s subsequent death. 

Later, Kelly is approached by Admiral Maxwell to act as the pathfinder for the rescue mission on Zacharias and other American POWs, since he is familiar with the area from his days in the UDT and had previously gone behind enemy lines to rescue Maxwell&#x27;s son. Kelly pauses his personal vendetta, and proceeds to Vietnam. A KGB mole informs the Soviets of the rescue mission, compromising it. However, Kelly manages to capture Grishanov while escaping from the camp, who is then used as leverage to negotiate the transfer of Colonel Zacharias and his fellow prisoners to the Hanoi Hilton, where they will be confirmed as alive and eventually returned.

Upon returning from Vietnam, Kelly finds out that Doris and her father Raymond had been killed and continues his mission. He finds out that the heroin processed by Tucker&#x27;s drug ring was smuggled into the U.S. through the corpses of dead American soldiers, and also deduces that a corrupt police officer is on Tucker&#x27;s payroll. Meanwhile, the CIA try to recruit him following his actions in Vietnam, and due to Kelly&#x27;s difficult position, they agree to help him escape his legal troubles in return for the assassination of the mole who had jeopardized the Vietnam operation. Kelly forces the supposed mole, an aide to the Special Assistant to the National Security Advisor, to kill himself, inadvertently leaving the real mole, a Senate aide and anti-war activist, active. He then rushes to complete his vendetta, finally killing Tucker and his remaining cohorts. Corrupt police Lieutenant Mark Charon is incidentally murdered by the criminals.

Ryan deduces that Kelly is the vigilante targeting drug dealers and their corrupt police partners. He confronts him on his boat, where Kelly confesses. He bargains with the detective for one more hour of liberty before being arrested; Ryan agrees, but Kelly fakes his death by capsizing his boat. He is then rescued by his CIA superiors, who recruit him under his new identity as John Clark. He quietly resumes contact with O&#x27;Toole and marries her. Three years later, Zacharias and his fellow POWs are released after the end of the American involvement in the Vietnam War.

He was later offered his freedom in &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988) due to the importance of secret information on the Soviet Union that he brought.

==Themes==
&quot;Without Remorse&quot; is said to be inspired by David Morrell&#x27;s novel &quot;First Blood&quot; (1972) as well a string of action films that feature violent and &quot;psycho&quot; Vietnam veterans of the 1980s. Clancy subverted the cliché by framing Kelly&#x27;s rage and frustration as &quot;pro-social&quot;. Moreover, it gave him a platform to express his disgust with the U.S. government for neglecting Vietnam veterans, who &quot;understand the arts of war&quot;.

Regarding the message of the novel, Clancy said: &quot;The central question in this book is: What is justice? And how is justice applied? What if you&#x27;re in the situation where a great wrong has been done and the law does not respond to it? Now, is your duty as a citizen just to forget about it and permit society as a whole to make that mistake? Or is your duty as a citizen to become the instrument of justice, if you can do so in a controlled and structured and just way? Do you have the moral right to become the instrument of justice yourself?&quot;

==Development==
Clancy started working on &quot;Without Remorse&quot; in 1971. He later went back to the previously abandoned story in 1992, spending about four months on the novel. He explained the process: &quot;You gotta tell a good story if people are going to read it. I think you have an ethical obligation to deal with those issues as truthfully as possible. So, there&#x27;s an educational aspect to what I do.&quot;

In 1992, Putnam paid $14 million for the North American rights, a record for a single book.

==Reception==
Commercially, the book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 29, 1993.

Critically, &quot;Without Remorse&quot; received generally positive reviews. &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; hailed it as &quot;Mr. Clancy&#x27;s best&quot;, while the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; praised it as &quot;a non-stop emotional roller coaster&quot;. However, Kirkus Reviews gave it a mixed verdict, stating that it is &quot;twice as long as the two rather creaky storylines can bear, but the millions of midlevel, desk-bound, action-loving bureaucrats whose adventurous wishes Clancy so faithfully fulfills are unlikely to complain.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also gave it a mixed review, bemoaning Clancy&#x27;s &quot;attempts to rationalize this amoral crusade with passages of introspection by characters who are either noble warriors or human scum&quot; as well as &quot;failings of style and moral judgment&quot;; however, they agree that &quot;this overlong, often melodramatic novel seems destined to follow its predecessors to the top of the bestseller lists.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

Savoy Pictures first bought the film rights to &quot;Without Remorse&quot; soon after the novel was released for $2.5 million. At one point, Keanu Reeves was offered the role as Clark for $7 million but declined. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that Laurence Fishburne and Gary Sinise were later attached to star in the adaptation, but production was shut down due to script problems and financial woes with the production company. The film went under development hell for years until Christopher McQuarrie signed on with Paramount Pictures to direct the adaptation in 2012. Tom Hardy was approached by Paramount to play Clark, and Kevin Costner was slated to reprise his role as mentor William Harper from another Clancy-based film, &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; (2014), but this version was scrapped.

In 2017, Akiva Goldsman signed on with the same studio to produce another film adaptation starring Clark, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. Michael B. Jordan was brought to play the character in a two-part film series, composed of &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and with Goldsman, Jordan, Josh Appelbaum, and Andre Nemec producing. Stefano Sollima was hired to direct the film. Taylor Sheridan was later brought to rewrite the screenplay. &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Without Remorse&quot; was released on Prime Video on April 30, 2021.

<text>Nong Bua Lamphu (, , ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It lies in upper northeastern Thailand, a region also known as Isan. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise from North) Udon Thani, Khon Kaen, and Loei. Nong Bua Lamphu is one of the eight quadruply-landlocked Thai provinces, as its neighboring provinces are triply-landlocked.

==Geography==
Nong Bua Lamphu is in the heart of the Khorat Plateau. The total forest area is , or 11.7 percent of the area of the province.
===National parks===
There is one national park and one national park (preparation), along with five other national parks, make up region 10 (Udon Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Phu Kao–Phu Phan Kham National Park, 
* Phu Hin Chom That–Phu Phra Bat National Park, 

== Paleontological remains ==
&quot;Chalawan&quot;, an extinct genus of crocodylin, is known solely from its holotype collected in the early-1980s from a road-cut near the town of Nong Bua Lam Phu, in the upper part of the Phu Kradung Formation. This single specimen is the most well preserved vertebrate fossil that has been found from the formation. It contains a single species, &quot;Chalawan thailandicus&quot;.

==History==

Nong Bua Lam Phu is noted for it being the area where in the 16th century, Naresuan, the king-liberator of Siam, came to learn of the outcome of a war between the Lao and Burmese in the area of Vientiane. This place was formerly a Lao stronghold and named &quot;Nakhon Khuean Khan Kab Kaew Bua Ban&quot; (). During the existence of the Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang (1354–1707), Nong Bua Lam Phu was traditionally given to the crown prince (Uparat) to rule. It was the birthplace of the principal wife of Ong Boun (), the last independent king of Vientiane. In 1827, Chao Anou of Vientiane designated Phagna Narin to be governor at the onset of the Laotian Rebellion of 1826–1828.

Under Thai rule, the province originally consisted of five amphoe (districts) in Udon Thani province. In 1993 Udon was decentralized and a separate province of Nong Bua Lam Phu was created. It is one of the newest provinces of Thailand, together with Amnat Charoen province, Sa Kaeo province, and Bueng Kan province.

On 6 October 2022, a mass murder occurred at and near a daycare center in Uthai Sawan, a town located in the province. A total of 36 people were killed, and 10 others were injured, before the attacker committed suicide. It was the deadliest mass murder by a single perpetrator in the modern history of Thailand.

==Economy==
Nong Bua Lamphu is the poorest province in Thailand according to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;. Incomes, as of 2018, average 41,000 baht annually.

The province is largely agricultural. Sticky rice has long been the area&#x27;s traditional crop, although there has been a shift to sugarcane due to low rice prices and sugarcane&#x27;s resistance to flooding. In 2016, more than one third of the available agricultural land in Nong Bua Lamphu was used for sugarcane plantations. According to the provincial Office of Agricultural Economics, sugarcane cultivation is expected to rise. In contrast, the area devoted to rice farming shrunk by 73 percent from 2000 to 2016.

==Symbols==
==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into six districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 59 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 636 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Nong Bua Lamphu Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 24 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Nong Bua Lamphu has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 23 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 43 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations – SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at the sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>USS &quot;Reeves&quot; (DLG/CG-24), a United States Navy ship named after Admiral Joseph Mason Reeves (Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, 1934–1936), was a built by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, in Bremerton, Washington.

&quot;Reeves&quot; began her history as a &quot;Leahy&quot;-class destroyer leader (DLG-24) when her keel was laid down on 1 July 1960. She was launched on 12 May 1962 and commissioned on 15 May 1964. Mrs. Joseph M. Reeves, Jr., daughter-in-law of Vice Adm. Reeves, was the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

&quot;Reeves&quot; was later reclassified as a guided missile cruiser (CG-24) on 30 June 1975. On 12 November 1993, &quot;Reeves&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy Register at Pearl Harbor Naval Base. &quot;Reeves&quot; remained in mothballs until she was sunk as a target ship on 31 May 2001.

== Operational history ==

=== The 1960s ===
The second &quot;Reeves&quot;, DLG-24, was laid down 1 July 1960 by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington; launched 12 May 1962; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph M. Reeves, Jr.; and commissioned 15 May 1964.

Following an extended trial and shakedown period, &quot;Reeves&quot; was homeported at Long Beach where she underwent availability and further training. On 10 April 1965, she departed for her first tour with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific (WESTPAC). Deployed for just over six months, she operated primarily in support of Allied operations off the coast of the Republic of Vietnam, serving as an anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) picket, first with TG 77.3 built around aircraft carrier , then with TG 77.6 centered on aircraft carrier . Returning to Long Beach on 3 November 1965, she conducted local operations for the remainder of the year and into 1966. On 26 May 1966, she got underway for Japan and a two-year nonrotated tour with the 7th Fleet. Arriving at her new homeport of Yokosuka on 16 June, she departed shortly thereafter and on 7 July and anchored at Da Nang. to begin another tour off the embattled coast. For the next two years, she regularly sailed south from Japan for combat air-sea rescue (CSAR) tours off Vietnam, compiling a total of 493 days underway, 312 of which were spent in the Gulf of Tonkin.

&quot;Reeves&quot; rotated back to the United States in August 1968 and operated out of Long Beach for the remainder of the year, participating in local operations, as well testing and evaluating radar systems. In early 1969, &quot;Reeves&quot; was ordered to Maine for overhaul and modernization at Bath Iron Works. Arriving on 31 March, she was placed out of commission (special) on 10 April and the extensive modification work began.

=== The 1970s ===
&quot;Reeves&quot; was recommissioned 29 August 1970 at Bath. She spent the period from 10 September – 19 November making the passage from Bath to her new home port at Pearl Harbor. The uncommonly long duration of the passage was due to frequent stops along the way at various ports for additional work to be done and by a three-week refresher training (REFTRA) period in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After arriving at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Reeves&quot; engaged in numerous exercises and operations in the waters around Hawaii.

June 1971 found &quot;Reeves&quot; steaming westward for another deployment in the Gulf of Tonkin. &quot;Reeves&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 December 1971 and remained in the Hawaii and west coast areas until September 1972 where she participated in various operations and exercises, notably a Midshipman cruise in July. She departed Hawaii on 18 September, headed for her second WESTPAC deployment since recommissioning, arriving at Subic Bay Naval Base, Philippine Islands 14 days later. After six months in the western Pacific, stationed off the coast of Vietnam, &quot;Reeves&quot; sailed into port at Pearl Harbor on 17 March 1973.

She remained in the Hawaiian Islands into 1980. She was reclassified a guided missile cruiser (CG-24), on 30 June 1975. &quot;Reeves&quot;, after a period of dry-dock and training exercises in the mid-Pacific from after October 1977, deployed to the Strait of Hormuz in late January 1980 as a response to the embassy hostage situation with Iran of November the year prior.

=== The 1980s ===
USS &quot;Reeves&quot; arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 14 August 1980 to change homeports with USS &quot;Worden&quot; (CG-18), and the crew transfer taking place on 19 August 1980, with 119 Reeves crew moving on board USS &quot;Worden&quot; for the trip to USS &quot;Worden&quot;″s new homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, while 104 &quot;Worden&quot; crewmen transferred to USS &quot;Reeves&quot; to remain in Japan.

During most of the 1980s, &quot;Reeves&quot; was forward deployed to the WESTPAC and homeported in Yokosuka. During that time, she served as the AAW picket for Battle Group Alpha centered around &quot;Midway&quot;. Her nickname during that time was, &quot;the Only Cruiser in Town&quot;.

From 24 February to 5 June 1981 USS &quot;Reeves&quot;, under the command of Captain James White Egerton USN, deployed with Battle Group Alpha on a Westpac/Indian Ocean Cruise. From 6 to 11 May 1981, USS &quot;Reeves&quot; and Battle Group Alpha docked at Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia for R&amp;R after exercising with the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier group centered on .

In March 1986, she participated in a Team Spirit exercise off the coast of the Republic of Korea. Later that year, &quot;Reeves&quot; conducted REFTRA in the Philippines which was quickly followed her involvement in special operations (SPECOPS). SPECOPS consisted of conducting surveillance operations on the Soviet aircraft carrier off the coast of Vladivostok, which was home to the Soviet Pacific Fleet. During this operation, &quot;Reeves&quot; blasted either the Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; or Jefferson Starship&#x27;s &quot;Layin&#x27; It on the Line&quot; over the ship&#x27;s 1MC when in the proximity of Soviet naval vessels.

On 5 November 1986, &quot;Reeves&quot; led and into the harbor of Qingdao (Tsing Tao), the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) for a historic six-day port visit. This would be the first time that U.S. Navy vessels had moored in China since the repair ship departed in 1949 in the face of the communist advance which forced the evacuation of Americans from China. The visit was hosted by soldiers and sailors of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).

 During the port call hundreds of Navy men took advantage of several tours, arranged by their Chinese hosts, that included stops at Qingdao&#x27;s carpet, embroidery, jade and shell factories. Others made it a point to sample the beer at the city&#x27;s world-renowned Tsingtao brewery. A fortunate few were able to leave the port city on tours to Qufu, birthplace of Confucius, the capital city of Beijing, the Forbidden City, and the Great Wall of China.

The port visit was important because it provided visible evidence of growing Sino-American cooperation. Adm. James Lyons, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, was embarked in &quot;Reeves&quot; during the visit. Shortly after arriving in Qingdao, he said there are &quot;three pillars&quot; in the US-China military relationship; high level visits, military exchanges and a limited amount of military technology cooperation. &quot;I see this port visit as strengthening all three pillars,&quot; he said.

Throughout their stay, the crews of the visiting ships held lectures and discussion sessions on Navy shipboard organization, management, training, propulsion, logistics and weapons systems for their Chinese hosts. At the time such navy-to-navy orientations were conducted with many countries. However, this was the Navy&#x27;s first opportunity for such an exchange with China.

During May 1987, &quot;Reeves&quot; found herself involved with yet another Team Spirit exercise. &quot;Reeves&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf from July to December 1987 where she participated in the first of nine Operation Earnest Will tanker reflagging operations beginning on 23 July. Her primary duty was to escort commercial vessels through the Strait of Hormuz. In March 1988 she was involved again with the Team Spirit exercises.

On 26 June 1989, &quot;Reeves&quot; and the destroyer rescued 92 Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea, about southwest of the Philippines. The refugees were pulled from their sinking vessel and provided with medical assistance and other care before being delivered to a United Nations refugee organization in Thailand a week later.

On 30 October 1989 an F/A-18 Hornet aircraft from USS &quot;Midway&quot; mistakenly dropped a 500-pound general-purpose bomb on the deck of &quot;Reeves&quot; during training exercises in the Indian Ocean, creating a hole in the bow through the line locker one compartment forward of the fore missile house, sparking small fires, sending shrapnel back to the fantail and injuring five sailors. &quot;Reeves&quot; was south of Diego Garcia at the time of the incident.

=== Fate ===

&quot;Reeves&quot; was decommissioned on 12 November 1993, stored at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF), Pearl Harbor. She was ultimately used as a target ship on 31 May 2001 during a sink exercise (SINKEX) off the coast of Queensland, Australia during a joint U.S. and Australian naval exercise. Her final resting place is where she lies at a depth of .

== Reclassification from DLG to CG ==
In 1975, the &quot;double-ender&quot; &quot;Leahy&quot;-class guided missile destroyer leaders (DLG) were reclassified as guided missile cruisers (CG), as were other similar ships. The class was given an AAW upgrade during the late-1960s and early 1970s, with Terrier launchers modified to fire Terrier or Standard SM-1ER missiles. The 3&quot;/50 guns were replaced by Harpoon missile launcher, the Terrier launchers were upgraded to fire the Standard SM-2ER missile, and 2 Phalanx CIWS canisters were added. All were upgraded under the late-1980s New Threat Upgrade (NTU) program, which included combat system capability improvements to the ship&#x27;s Air Search Radars (AN/SPS-48E and AN/SPS-49), Fire Control Radars (AN/SPG-55B), and Combat Direction System (CDS). These improvements provided an accurate means of coordinating the engagement of multiple air targets with SM-2 Extended Range missiles. During the NTU overhaul, all spaces were renovated, berthing and food service areas were refurbished, and the engineering plant was fully overhauled.

== Role ==
Modern guided missile cruisers, such as &quot;Reeves&quot;, performed primarily in a Battle Force role. These ships were multi-mission (AAW – anti-air warfare, ASW – anti-surface warfare, ASUW – anti-submarine warfare) surface combatants capable of supporting carrier or battleship battle groups, amphibious forces, or of operating independently and as flagships of surface action groups. Due to their extensive combat capability, these ships were designated as Battle Force Capable (BFC) units.

<doc id="235104" wikidata="Q1936905" url="?curid=235104" title="Dark Side of the Spoon">
<text>Dark Side of the Spoon is the seventh studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on June 8, 1999, by Warner Bros. Records. &quot;Bad Blood&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2000.

==Background==
&quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot; features less aggressive songs than Ministry&#x27;s previous albums, and frontman Al Jourgensen had intended it to be the case. He wanted to branch out from the &quot;drug-infused&quot; records of &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; and &quot;Psalm 69&quot; to more &quot;unfamiliar territory&quot;.

In his autobiography, Jourgensen confirmed that the title has two meanings: one of which is a play on words referencing Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and the other is the blackened (or dark side) of a spoon heated to dissolve heroin, as several members of the band suffered from long-term addiction to said substance at the time.

The saxophone part of the song &quot;10/10&quot; is taken from the last 22 seconds of &quot;Group Dancers&quot; on the Charles Mingus album &quot;The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady&quot;. &quot;Whip and Chain&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; feature vocals from Ty Coon, Al Jourgensen&#x27;s girlfriend at the time.

In 2021, Jourgensen listed &quot;Nursing Home&quot; and &quot;Supermanic Soul&quot; in his top ten favorite Ministry songs.

==Packaging controversy==
The album&#x27;s cover, which features a nude, obese woman sitting in front of a black board with &quot;I will be god&quot; written repeatedly on it; gained controversy and resulted in the album being pulled from Kmart. Jourgensen originally had the idea of having a child drawing on the blackboard, but Barker suggested to have a fat woman instead to evoke the image of &#x27;fattened Americans doing what they&#x27;re told.&#x27;

==Reception==

AllMusic critic Steve Huey wrote: &quot;While it is a better record than &quot;Filth Pig&quot;, that&#x27;s largely because of a few strong moments propping up a number of surprisingly bland attempts at aggression.&quot; Huey further stated that the record &quot;can&#x27;t be considered the successful expansion of their sound that would bode well for the future.&quot; Elisabeth Vincentelli of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that &quot;time may have finally caught up with these thrash-industrial veterans&quot;, remarking that the record &quot;doesn&#x27;t get that fast or heavy again&quot; after the first track, &quot;Supermanic Soul&quot;. Describing the record as &quot;a contrary beast&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the record &quot;amounts to an uneven, frequently unfunny knot of confusion&quot; and further stated: &quot;It&#x27;s as though Jourgensen&#x27;s swapped his black humour for a black dog that won&#x27;t stop howling, however much he beats it.&quot; In a five-star review for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Steffan Chirazi called the album &quot;a deliciously realised composite of Ministry&#x27;s finest characteristics. It&#x27;s fast enough to satisfy the &quot;Psalm 69...&quot; fans and perverse enough for the more bitter and twisted freaks amongst their audience.&quot;

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Neva Chonin thought that the record &quot;sinks into the same complacent rut&quot; as &quot;Filth Pig&quot;, further explaining: &quot;From the stentorian rhythms and predictably ghoulish vocal samples to the bellowed doomsday incantations and chugging wall of guitars, everything here feels like a reflex.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; critic Mark Lepage wrote that &quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot; does not achieve the standards that the band set on &quot;Psalm 69&quot;, &quot;not delivering enough of the medicine.&quot;

==Track listing==
===Hidden tracks===
After the end of track 9, are 59 tracks of silence totaling 10:36. &quot;Everybody&quot; is track 69. &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot;, another Ministry album, features a hidden track called &quot;Walrus&quot; which is also track 69. According to BMI, track 68 is called &quot;Summertime&quot;. AllMusic and the official website of the band refer to this track as &quot;Everybody&quot;. ITunes lists this track as &quot;Dialogue&quot;.

<doc id="235106" wikidata="Q154764" url="?curid=235106" title="Investiture Controversy">
<text>The Investiture Controversy or Investiture Contest (, ) was a conflict between the Church and the state in medieval Europe over the ability to choose and install bishops (investiture) and abbots of monasteries and the Pope himself. A series of popes in the 11th and 12th centuries undercut the power of the Holy Roman Emperor and other European monarchies, and the controversy led to nearly 50 years of conflict.

It began as a power struggle between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV (then King, later Holy Roman Emperor) in 1076. The conflict ended in 1122, when Pope Callixtus II and Emperor Henry V agreed on the Concordat of Worms. The agreement required bishops to swear an oath of fealty to the secular monarch, who held authority &quot;by the lance&quot; but left selection to the church. It affirmed the right of the church to invest bishops with sacred authority, symbolized by a ring and staff. In Germany (but not Italy and Burgundy), the Emperor also retained the right to preside over elections of abbots and bishops by church authorities, and to arbitrate disputes. Holy Roman Emperors renounced the right to choose the Pope.

In the meantime, there was also a brief but significant investiture struggle between Pope Paschal II and King Henry I of England from 1103 to 1107. The earlier resolution to that conflict, the Concordat of London, was very similar to the Concordat of Worms.

==Background==

After the decline of the Western Roman Empire, investiture was performed by members of the ruling nobility (and was known as lay investiture) despite theoretically being a task of the church. Many bishops and abbots were themselves part of the ruling nobility. Given that most members of the European nobility practiced primogeniture, and willed their titles of nobility to the eldest surviving male heir, surplus male siblings often sought careers in the upper levels of the church hierarchy. This was particularly true where the family may have established a proprietary church or abbey on their estate. Since a substantial amount of wealth and land was usually associated with the office of a bishop or abbot, the sale of church offices—a practice known as &quot;simony&quot;—was an important source of income for leaders among the nobility, who themselves owned the land and by charity allowed the building of churches. Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular administration, as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary nobility with family interests. They justified their power by the theory of the divine right of kings.

Many of the papal selections before 1059 were influenced politically and militarily by European powers, often with a king or emperor announcing a choice which would be rubber-stamped by church electors. The Holy Roman Emperors of the Ottonian dynasty believed they should have the power to appoint the pope. Since the ascendance of the first of that line, Otto the Great (936–72), the bishops had been princes of the empire, had secured many privileges, and had become to a great extent feudal lords over great districts of the imperial territory. The control of these great units of economic and military power was for the king a question of primary importance due to its effect on imperial authority. It was essential for a ruler or nobleman to appoint (or sell the office to) someone who would remain loyal.

Problems with simony became particularly unpopular as Pope Benedict IX was accused of selling the papacy in 1045. Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor from 1046 to 1056, settled the papal schism and named several popes, the last emperor to successfully dominate the selection process. Six-year-old Henry IV became King of the Germans in 1056.

==Pope Nicholas II==
Benedict X was elected under the influence of the Count of Tusculum, allegedly by bribing the electors. Dissenting cardinals elected Pope Nicholas II in 1058 at Siena. Nicholas II successfully waged war against Benedict X and regained control of the Vatican. Nicholas II convened a synod in the Lateran on Easter in 1059. The results were codified in the papal bull . It declared that leaders of the nobility would have no part in the selection of popes (though the Holy Roman Emperor might confirm the choice) and that electors would be cardinals (which would later evolve into the College of Cardinals) assembled in Rome. The bull also banned lay investiture. In response, all the bishops in Germany (who supported the Emperor) assembled in 1061 and declared all the decrees of Nicholas II null and void. Nevertheless, the elections of Pope Alexander II and Pope Gregory VII proceeded according to church rules, without the involvement of the Emperor.

== Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII ==

In 1075, Pope Gregory VII composed the &quot;Dictatus papae&quot;, though this was not published at the time, cataloging principles of his Gregorian Reforms. One clause asserted that the pope held the exclusive power to depose an emperor. It declared that the Roman church was founded by God alone—that the papal power (the &quot;auctoritas&quot; of Pope Gelasius) was the sole universal power; in particular, a council held in the Lateran Palace from 24 to 28 February the same year decreed that the pope alone could appoint or depose churchmen or move them from see to see. By this time, Henry IV was no longer a child, and he continued to appoint his own bishops. He reacted to this declaration by sending Gregory VII a letter in which he withdrew his imperial support of Gregory as pope in no uncertain terms: the letter was headed &quot;Henry, king not through usurpation but through the holy ordination of God, to Hildebrand, at present not pope but false monk&quot;. It called for the election of a new pope. His letter ends, &quot;I, Henry, king by the grace of God, with all of my Bishops, say to you, come down, come down!&quot;, and is often quoted with &quot;and to be damned throughout the ages&quot;, which is a later addition.

The situation was made even more dire when Henry IV installed his chaplain, Tedald, a Milanese priest, as Bishop of Milan, when another priest of Milan, Atto, had already been chosen in Rome by the pope. In 1076 Gregory responded by excommunicating Henry, and deposed him as German king, releasing all Christians from their oath of allegiance.

Enforcing these declarations was a different matter, but the advantage gradually came to be on the side of Gregory VII. German princes and the aristocracy were happy to hear of the king&#x27;s deposition. They used religious reasons to continue the rebellion started at the First Battle of Langensalza in 1075, and to seize royal holdings. Aristocrats claimed local lordships over peasants and property, built forts, which had previously been outlawed, and built up localized fiefdoms to secure their autonomy from the empire.
This combination of factors forced Henry IV to back down, as he needed time to marshal his forces to fight the rebellion. In 1077, he traveled to Canossa in northern Italy, where the Pope was staying in the castle of Countess Matilda, to apologize in person. The pope was suspicious of Henry&#x27;s motives, and did not believe he was truly repentant. As penance for his sins, and echoing his own punishment of the Saxons after the First Battle of Langensalza, he wore a hair shirt and stood barefoot in the snow in what has become known as the Road to Canossa. Gregory lifted the excommunication, but the German aristocrats, whose rebellion became known as the Great Saxon Revolt, were not as willing to give up their opportunity and elected a rival king, Rudolf von Rheinfeld. Three years later, Pope Gregory declared his support for von Rheinfeld and then on the Lenten synod of 7 March 1080 excommunicated Henry IV again. In turn, Henry called a council of bishops at Brixen that proclaimed Gregory illegitimate. The internal revolt against Henry effectively ended that same year, however, when Rudolf von Rheinfeld died.

Henry IV named Guibert of Ravenna (who he had invested as bishop of Ravenna) to be pope, referring to Clement III (known by the Catholic Church as Antipope Clement III) as &quot;our pope&quot;. In October 1080, troops raised by the pro-Imperial bishops of Northern Italy clashed with the pro-papal forces of Countess Matilda in the battle of Volta Mantovana. The pro-Imperial forces were victorious, and in March 1081 Henry IV marched from the Brenner Pass into the March of Verona unopposed, entering Milan in April that year. He then attacked Rome and besieged the city with the intent of forcibly removing Gregory VII and installing Clement III. The city of Rome withstood the siege, but the Vatican and St. Peter&#x27;s fell in 1083. On the outskirts of the city, Henry gained thirteen cardinals who became loyal to his cause. The next year the city of Rome surrendered and Henry triumphantly entered the city. On Palm Sunday, 1084, Henry IV solemnly enthroned Clement at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; on Easter Day, Clement returned the favour and crowned Henry IV as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

Gregory VII was meanwhile still resisting a few hundred yards away from the basilica in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, then known as the house of Cencius. Gregory called on his allies for help, and Robert Guiscard (the Norman ruler of Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria) responded, entering Rome on 27 May 1084. The Normans came in force and attacked with such strength that Henry and his army fled. Gregory VII was rescued, but Rome was plundered in the process, for which the citizens of Rome blamed him. As a result, Gregory VII was forced to leave Rome under the protection of the Normans, fleeing to Salerno, where he grew ill and died on 25 May 1085. The last words he uttered were, &quot;I have loved justice and hated iniquity, and therefore I die in exile.&quot;

Upon the death of Gregory, the cardinals elected a new pope, Pope Victor III. He owed his elevation to the influence of the Normans. Antipope Clement III still occupied St. Peter&#x27;s. When Victor III died, the cardinals elected Pope Urban II (1088–99). He was one of three men Gregory VII suggested as his successor. Urban II preached the First Crusade, which united Western Europe, and more importantly, reconciled the majority of bishops who had abandoned Gregory VII.

The reign of Henry IV showed the weakness of the German monarchy. The ruler was dependent upon the good will of the nobility of his land. These were technically royal officials and hereditary princes. He was also dependent on the resources of the churches. Henry IV alienated the Church of Rome and many of the magnates in his own kingdom. Many of these spent years in open or subversive rebellion. Henry failed to create a proper bureaucracy to replace his disobedient vassals. The magnates became increasingly independent, and the Church withdrew support. Henry IV spent the last years of his life desperately grasping to keep his throne. It was a greatly diminished kingdom.

==Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor==
The Investiture Controversy continued for several decades as each successive pope tried to diminish imperial power by stirring up revolt in Germany. These revolts were gradually successful. The reign of Henry IV ended with a diminished kingdom and waning power. Many of his underlords had been in constant or desultory revolt for years. Henry IV&#x27;s insistence that Antipope Clement III was the real pope had initially been popular with some of the nobles, and even many of the bishops of Germany. But as years passed, this support was slowly withdrawn. The idea that the German king could and should name the pope was increasingly discredited and viewed as an anachronism from a by-gone era. The Empire of the Ottos was virtually lost because of Henry IV.

On 31 December 1105, Henry IV was forced to abdicate and was succeeded by his son Henry V, who had rebelled against his father in favor of the papacy, and made his father renounce the legality of his antipopes before he died.

Henry V realised swift action and a change in his father&#x27;s policy was necessary. Pope Paschal II rebuked Henry V for appointing bishops in Germany. The king crossed the Alps with an army in 1111. The pope, who was weak and had few supporters was forced to suggest a compromise, the abortive Concordat of 1111. Its simple and radical solution of the Investiture Controversy between the prerogatives of &quot;regnum&quot; and &quot;sacerdotium&quot; proposed that German churchmen would surrender their lands and secular offices to the emperor and constitute a purely spiritual church. Henry gained greater control over the lands of his kingdom, especially those that had been in the hands of the church, but of contested title. He would not interfere with ecclesiastical affairs and churchmen would avoid secular services. The church would be given autonomy and to Henry V would be restored large parts of his empire that his father had lost. And finally, Henry V would be crowned as the Holy Roman Emperor by Paschal. When the concessions of land were read in St. Peter&#x27;s, however, the crowd erupted in anger. Henry took the pope and cardinals hostage until the pope granted Henry V the right of investiture. Then he returned to Germany—crowned emperor and apparent victor over the papacy.

Henry&#x27;s victory was, however, as short-lived as that of his father, Henry IV over Gregory VII. The clergy urged Paschal to rescind his agreement, which he did in 1112. The quarrel followed the predictable course: Henry V rebelled and was excommunicated. Riots broke out in Germany, a new Antipope Gregory VIII was appointed by the German king, and nobles loyal to Rome seceded from Henry. The unrest and conflict in Germany continued, just as under Henry IV. And the controversy with respect to investiture dragged on for another ten years. Like his father before him, Henry V was faced with waning power. Ultimately, he had no choice but to give up investiture and the old right of naming the pope. The Concordat of Worms in 1122 was the result. After the Concordat, the German kings never had the same control over the Church as had existed in the time of the Ottonian dynasty. Henry V was received back into communion and recognized as legitimate emperor as a result.

Henry V died without heirs in 1125, three years after the Concordat. He had designated his nephew, Frederick von Staufen duke of Swabia, also known as Frederick II, Duke of Swabia as his successor. Instead, churchmen elected Lothair III. A long civil war erupted between the Staufen, also known as Hohenstaufen, and the heirs of Lothar III, paving the way for the rise to power of the Hohenstaufen Frederick I (1152–1190).

==English investiture controversy (1102–07)==
At the time of Henry IV&#x27;s death, Henry I of England and the Gregorian papacy were also embroiled in a controversy over investiture, and its solution provided a model for the eventual solution of the issue in the empire.

William the Conqueror had accepted a papal banner and the distant blessing of Pope Alexander II upon his invasion, but had successfully rebuffed the pope&#x27;s assertion after the successful outcome, that he should come to Rome and pay homage for his fief, under the general provisions of the Donation of Constantine.

The ban on lay investiture in &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; did not shake the loyalty of William&#x27;s bishops and abbots. In the reign of Henry I, the heat of exchanges between Westminster and Rome induced Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, to give up mediating and retire to an abbey. Robert of Meulan, one of Henry&#x27;s chief advisors, was excommunicated, but the threat of excommunicating the king remained unplayed. The papacy needed the support of English Henry while German Henry was still unbroken. A projected crusade also required English support.

Henry I commissioned the Archbishop of York to collect and present all the relevant traditions of anointed kingship. On this topic, the historian Norman Cantor would note: &quot;The resulting &#x27;Anonymous of York&#x27; treatises are a delight to students of early-medieval political theory, but they in no way typify the outlook of the Anglo-Norman monarchy, which had substituted the secure foundation of administrative and legal bureaucracy for outmoded religious ideology.&quot;

==Concordat of London (1107)==

The Concordat of London, agreed in 1107, was a forerunner of a compromise that was later taken up in the Concordat of Worms. In England, as in Germany, the king&#x27;s chancery started to distinguish between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates. Bowing to political reality and employing this distinction, Henry I of England gave up his right to invest his bishops and abbots while reserving the custom of requiring them to swear homage for the &quot;temporalities&quot; (the landed properties tied to the episcopate) directly from his hand, after the bishop had sworn homage and feudal vassalage in the commendation ceremony (&quot;commendatio&quot;), like any secular vassal. The system of vassalage was not divided among great local lords in England as it was in France, since the king was in control by right of the conquest.

===Later developments in England===

Henry I of England perceived a danger in placing monastic scholars in his chancery and turned increasingly to secular clerks, some of whom held minor positions in the Church. He often rewarded these men with the titles of bishop and abbot. Henry I expanded the system of scutage to reduce the monarchy&#x27;s dependence on knights supplied from church lands. Unlike the situation in Germany, Henry I of England used the Investiture Controversy to strengthen the secular power of the king. It would continue to boil under the surface. The controversy would surface in the Thomas Becket affair under Henry II of England, the Great Charter of 1217, the Statutes of Mortmain and the battles over &quot;Cestui que use&quot; under Henry VII of England, and finally come to a head under Henry VIII of England.

== Concordat of Worms (1122) ==

The European mainland experienced about 50 years of fighting, with efforts by Lamberto Scannabecchi, the future Pope Honorius II, and the 1121 Diet of Würzburg to end the conflict. On 23 September 1122, near the German city of Worms, Pope Callixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V entered into an agreement, now known as the Concordat of Worms, that effectively ended the Investiture Controversy. It eliminated lay investiture, while allowing secular leaders some room for unofficial but significant influence in the appointment process.

By the terms of the agreement, the election of bishops and abbots in Germany was to take place in the emperor&#x27;s presence (or his legate&#x27;s) as judge (&quot;without violence&quot;) between potentially disputing parties, free of bribes, thus retaining to the emperor a crucial role in choosing these great territorial magnates of the Empire. But absent a dispute, the canons of the cathedral were to elect the bishop, monks were to choose the abbot. Beyond the borders of Germany, in Burgundy and Italy, the election would be handled by the church without imperial interference.

Callixtus&#x27; reference to the feudal homage due the emperor on appointment is guarded: &quot;shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should&quot; was the wording of the &quot;privilegium&quot; granted by Callixtus. The emperor&#x27;s right to a substantial imbursement (payment) on the election of a bishop or abbot was specifically denied.

The emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration. To make up for this and symbolise the &quot;worldly&quot; authority of the bishop which the pope had always recognised to derive from the Emperor, another symbol, the scepter, was invented, which would be handed over by the king (or his legate).

The two ended by promising mutual aid when requested and by granting one another peace. The Concordat was confirmed by the First Council of the Lateran in 1123.

===Terminology===
In modern terminology, a concordat is an international convention, specifically one concluded between the Holy See and the civil power of a country to define the relationship between the Catholic Church and the state in matters in which both are concerned. Concordats began during the First Crusade&#x27;s end in 1098.

The Concordat of Worms () is sometimes called the &quot;Pactum Callixtinum&quot; by papal historians, since the term &quot;concordat&quot; was not in use until Nicolas of Cusa&#x27;s &quot;De concordantia catholica&quot; of 1434.

==Legacy==

===Local authority===
In the long term, the decline of imperial power would divide Germany until the 19th century. Similarly, in Italy, the investiture controversy weakened the emperor&#x27;s authority and strengthened local separatists.

While the monarchy was embroiled in the dispute with the Church, its power declined, and the localized rights of lordship over peasants increased, which eventually led to:
* Increased serfdom that reduced rights for the majority
* Local taxes and levies increased, while royal coffers declined
* Localized rights of justice where courts did not have to answer to royal authority

===Selection of leaders===
The papacy grew stronger, and the laity became engaged in religious affairs, increasing its piety and setting the stage for the Crusades and the great religious vitality of the 12th century.
German kings still had &quot;de facto&quot; influence over the selection of German bishops, though over time, German princes gained influence among church electors. The bishop-elect would then be invested by the Emperor (or representative) with the scepter and, sometime afterwards, by his ecclesial superior with ring and staff. The resolution of the Controversy produced a significant improvement in the character of men raised to the episcopacy. Kings no longer interfered so frequently in their election, and when they did, they generally nominated more worthy candidates for the office.

The Concordat of Worms did not end the interference of European monarchs in the selection of the pope. Practically speaking, the German kings retained a decisive voice in the selection of the hierarchy. All kings supported King John of England&#x27;s defiance of Pope Innocent III ninety years after the Concordat of Worms in the matter concerning Stephen Langton. In theory, the pope named his bishops and cardinals. In reality, more often than not, Rome consecrated the clergy once it was notified by the kings who the incumbent would be. Recalcitrance by Rome would lead to problems in the kingdom. For the most part it was a no-win situation for Rome. In this, the Concordat of Worms changed little. The growth of canon law in the Ecclesiastical Courts was based on the underlying Roman law and increased the strength of the Roman Pontiff.

Disputes between popes and Holy Roman Emperors continued until northern Italy was lost to the empire entirely, after the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Emperor Otto IV marched on Rome and commanded Pope Innocent III to annul the Concordat of Worms and to recognise the imperial crown&#x27;s right to make nominations to all vacant benefices. The church would crusade against the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II. As historian Norman Cantor put it, the controversy &quot;shattered the early-medieval equilibrium and ended the interpenetration of &quot;ecclesia&quot; and &quot;mundus&quot;&quot;. Indeed, medieval emperors, which were &quot;largely the creation of ecclesiastical ideals and personnel&quot;, were forced to develop a secular bureaucratic state, whose essential components persisted in the Anglo-Norman monarchy.

Kings continued to attempt to control either the direct leadership of the church, or indirectly through political means for centuries. This is seen most clearly in the Avignon Papacy when the popes moved from Rome to Avignon. The conflict in Germany and northern Italy arguably left the culture ripe for various Protestant sects, such as the Cathars, the Waldensians and ultimately Jan Hus and Martin Luther.

===Authority and reform===
Though the Holy Roman Emperor retained some power over imperial churches, his power was damaged irreparably because he lost the religious authority that previously belonged to the office of the king. In France, England, and the Christian state in Spain, the king could overcome rebellions of his magnates and establish the power of his royal demesne because he could rely on the Church, which, for several centuries, had given him a mystical authority. From time to time, rebellious and recalcitrant monarchs might run afoul of the Church. These could be excommunicated, and after an appropriate time and public penance, be received back into the communion and good graces of the Church.

Of the three reforms Gregory VII and his predecessors and successor popes had attempted, the most successful had been that in regard to celibacy of the clergy. Simony had been partially checked. Against lay investiture they won only a limited success, and one that seemed less impressive as the years passed. During the time following the Concordat of Worms, the Church gained in both stature and power.

The wording of the Concordat of Worms was ambiguous, skirted some issues and avoided others altogether. This has caused some scholars to conclude that the settlement turned its back on Gregory VII&#x27;s and Urban II&#x27;s genuine hopes for reform. The emperor&#x27;s influence in episcopal matters was preserved, and he could decide disputed elections. If the compromise was a rebuke to the most radical vision of the liberty of the Church, on at least one point its implication was firm and unmistakable: the king, even an emperor, was a layman, and his power at least morally limited (hence, totalitarianism was unacceptable). According to the opinion of W. Jordan, the divine right of kings was dealt a blow from which it never completely recovered, yet unfettered authority and Caesaropapism was not something the later Mediaevals and Early Moderns understood by the phrase &quot;by the grace of God&quot; (which many of them ardently defended). If anything, a blow was dealt to subconsciously remaining pre-Christian Germanic feelings of &quot;royal hail&quot;.

===Unifications of Germany and Italy===
It was the consequence of this lengthy episode that a whole generation grew up in Germany and Northern Italy in an atmosphere of war, doubt and scepticism. The papal backers had been busy propounding arguments to show that royal power was not of divine origin. They had been so successful that the moral authority of the Emperor had been undermined in the minds of many of his subjects. Serious divisions existed from this battle over the Investiture Controversy, which fractured large portions of the Holy Roman Empire in Germany and Italy. Davis argues these rifts were so deep and lasting that neither Germany nor Italy were able to form a cohesive nation-state until the 19th century. A similar situation arose from the French Revolution, which caused fractures in France that still exist. The effect of Henry IV&#x27;s excommunication, and his subsequent refusal to repent left a turbulence in central Europe that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. It may have been emblematic of certain German attitudes toward religion in general, and the perceived relevance of the German Emperor in the universal scheme of things.

===German culture===
The catastrophic political consequences of the struggle between pope and emperor also led to a cultural disaster. Germany lost intellectual leadership in western Europe. In 1050, German monasteries were great centres of learning and art and German schools of theology and canon law were unsurpassed and probably unmatched anywhere in Europe. The long war over investiture sapped the energy of both German churchmen and intellectuals. They fell behind advances in philosophy, law, literature and art taking place in France and Italy. In many ways, Germany never caught up during the rest of the Middle Ages. Universities were established in France, Italy, Spain and England by the early 13th century. Notable are the University of Bologna, 1088, Oxford University, 1096, the University of Salamanca, 1134, the University of Paris, 1150, and the University of Cambridge, 1207. The first German university, the Heidelberg University, was not established until 1386. It was immediately steeped in mediaeval nominalism and early Protestantism.

===Development of liberty and prosperity in northern Europe===
The political scientist Bruce Bueno de Mesquita argues that the Concordat of Worms contained within itself the germ of nation-based sovereignty that would one day be confirmed in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). The Concordat of Worms created an incentive structure for the rulers of the Catholic parts of Europe such that in the northern regions, local rulers were motivated to raise the prosperity and liberty of their subjects because such reforms helped those rulers assert their independence from the pope.

With the Concordat of Worms, the pope became the &quot;de facto&quot; selector of bishops, as his recommendations all but guaranteed a candidate&#x27;s nomination. Instead of myriad local customs, it all came down to negotiations between the pope and the local secular ruler. Therefore, the influence of the pope in the region became the common deciding factor across the Catholic parts of Europe.

As a consequence of the Concordat, if the local ruler rejected the pope&#x27;s nominee for bishop, the ruler could keep the revenue of the diocese for himself, but the pope could retaliate in various ways, such as: ordering the local priests to not perform certain sacraments such as marriages, which would annoy the ruler&#x27;s subjects; forgiving oaths made by the vassals to the ruler; and even excommunicating the ruler, thereby undermining his moral legitimacy. Eventually, the ruler would have to give in to the pope and accept a bishop. The longer a local ruler could hold out against the pope, the more leverage the ruler had to demand a bishop who suited his interests.

In a region where the pope&#x27;s influence was weak, the local priests might have performed sacraments anyway, having calculated that defying the pope was not as dangerous as angering their parishioners; the ruler&#x27;s vassals might have honored their oaths anyway because the pope could not protect them from their lord&#x27;s wrath; and the subjects might still have respected their ruler despite excommunication.

If the pope&#x27;s influence in a diocese was weak, the local ruler could force the pope to choose between getting the tax revenue and appointing a loyal bishop. If said diocese was relatively poor, the pope would stubbornly hold out until the local ruler accepted the pope&#x27;s choice of bishop. During this standoff, the pope would not get any money from the diocese, but this was fine with him because the diocese didn&#x27;t yield much money anyway. But if said diocese was prosperous, the pope wanted to resolve the dispute more quickly so that he could sooner get that ample revenue flowing into his coffers, and so he was more inclined to let the local ruler pick the bishop.

A local secular ruler could stimulate the economy of his domain, and thereby collect more tax revenue, by giving his subjects more liberty and more participation in politics. The local ruler was required to raise enough tax revenue so that he could provide sufficient rewards to his essential supporters in order to secure their loyalty. But liberalization and democratization would also make his subjects more assertive, which in itself made the ruler&#x27;s hold on power less secure. Generally, a shrewd ruler would permit his people just enough liberty that he could raise sufficient tax revenue to provide his essential supporters with just enough rewards to keep them loyal (see &quot;selectorate theory&quot; for a thorough explanation of these trade-offs). In this specific context, the ruler of a diocese also had to consider whether to raise additional money, by risking liberalization, to convince the pope to compromise on the choice of bishop.

Under this incentive structure, if the pope&#x27;s influence in a region was strong, the local ruler would see little point in liberalizing his state. He would raise more tax revenue, but it would not be enough to get out from under the pope&#x27;s thumb which was just too strong. Liberalization would make his people more assertive and the pope would incite them to revolt. The pope would get both the money and his choice of bishop. Thus, the local ruler decided that oppressing his people was the sounder strategy for political survival.

On the other hand, if the pope&#x27;s influence in the region was weak, the local ruler calculated that liberalizing his state, thereby making it more prosperous, could give him enough leverage to get his choice of bishop. The pope would try to incite the people to revolt, but to weak effect. Thus, the local ruler could hold out for longer against the pope, and the pope would concede. The local ruler would get his preferred bishop, and the pope would get the money.

In the Catholic regions of Europe, the pope&#x27;s influence was weaker the further away a region was from Rome because in general it is difficult to project power over long distances and across difficult terrain such as mountains. This, Bueno de Mesquita argues, is why the northern regions of Europe, such as England and the Netherlands, became more prosperous and free than the southern regions. He further argues that this dynamic is what enabled the Protestant Reformation, which mostly happened in northern Europe. The northern parts of Europe were so prosperous and the influence of the pope there was so weak, their local rulers could reject the pope&#x27;s bishops indefinitely.

<text>TLC is an American multinational cable and satellite television network owned by the Networks division of Warner Bros. Discovery. First established in 1980 as The Learning Channel, it initially focused on educational and instructional programming. By the late 1990s, after an acquisition by Discovery, Inc. earlier in the decade, the network began to pivot towards reality television programming—predominantly focusing on programming involving lifestyles and personal stories—to the point that the previous name with &quot;The Learning Channel&quot; spelled out was phased out in favor of its initialism.

, with its programming primarily dedicated to the nine-series &quot;90 Day Fiancé&quot; universe, comprising 31% of the shows carried by the channel, TLC is available to approximately 71,000,000 pay television households in the United States—down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households.

==History==
===1972–1980: Early history as the Appalachian Educational Satellite Project===
TLC&#x27;s history traces to the 1972 formation of the Appalachian Educational Satellite Project (AESP), a distance education project formed by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), in participation with the Education Satellite Communication Demonstration (ESCD), a partnership with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and NASA intended to transmit instructional, career and health programming via satellite to provide televised educational material to public schools and universities in the Appalachian region. ARC submitted a proposal to participate in the ESCD and use the ATS-6 communications satellite (launched into orbit in 1974) to disseminate &quot;career education&quot; programming to teachers at no cost; the consortium set up 15 earth station receiver sites across eight states in conjunction with local education service agencies.

The ATS-6 temporarily ceased service to the Appalachian region after being re-orbited to India in September 1975; by the time the satellite reoriented to the United States the following year, the number of earth receivers used to transmit AESP content increased to 45 sites in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina (some of which also acted as relays to local television stations in the region). All programming offered through the project was accepted for academic credit at 12 universities in the region. In October 1978, NASA disclosed the ATS-6 would suspend transmissions for 12 months due to transmission problems with the satellite. As a result, ARC decided to purchase transponder time on the commercial Satcom I communications satellite, in order to continue its distance education offerings.

===1980–1998: From ACSN to The Learning Channel, &quot;A place for learning minds&quot;===
The non-profit Appalachian Community Service Network (ACSN) was incorporated in April 1980, maintaining a board of directors appointed by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The ACSN television service launched in October 1980 as ACSN – The Learning Channel; unlike the closed-circuit AESP, the network distributed its programming available directly to cable systems for home viewing. Its programming also expanded to include &quot;informational&quot; content. (NASA immediately launched NASA TV as the ACSN&#x27;s internal replacement.) By 1982, ACSN claimed that it &quot;achieved the fastest rate of growth of all basic cable programming services&quot;, with availability on around 70 cable affiliates reaching 1.5 million subscribers; by this point, 70 universities granted academic credit for telecourses carried on the network. On January 1, 1984, the network shortened its name to The Learning Channel.

The channel mostly featured documentary content pertaining to nature, science, history, current events, medicine, technology, cooking, home improvement, and other information-based topics. A notable example of such programming was &quot;Sew, What&#x27;s New?&quot;, a fashion design show presented by George W. Trippon. These were more focused, more technical, and of a more academic nature than the content that was being broadcast at the time on its eventual rival, The Discovery Channel, which launched in 1985. TLC was geared toward an inquisitive and narrow audience during this time, and had modest ratings. An exception to this viewership commonality was &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot; (produced and hosted by Mark Graves, also known as Captain Mark Gray), a weekly primetime boating safety series that aired from 1987 to 1990; the program often achieved between a 4.5 to 6 rating share and was the highest compensated series in the history of TLC with over 30 times the compensation of any other series on the network.

In 1986, Infotech, Inc.—then-owner of the Financial News Network (FNN)—acquired a 51% interest in The Learning Channel for $3 million; the American Community Service Network retained a 31.5% share of the network, with the remaining 17.5% owned by network management.

On February 15, 1991, The Discovery Channel, Inc.—owners of the namesake cable channel—announced it had reached an agreement to acquire The Learning Channel from ACSN and Infotech (the latter of which was in the process of a bankruptcy-led asset liquidation to repay creditors, subsequently resulting in the sale of the Financial News Network to a joint venture of NBC and Cablevision that integrated the network with rival financial news channel CNBC) for $12.75 million (equivalent to $ million today). Under Discovery, The Learning Channel continued to focus primarily on instructional and educational programming for much of the 1990s; however, in what preceded its later expansion of such content, it also began to include shows less focused on education and geared more toward attracting popular consumption and mass marketing. In 1992, the network&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;TLC&quot;, although the full name remained in use on alternating basis.

TLC continued to offer educational programs such as &quot;Paleoworld&quot; (a show about prehistoric creatures), though more and more of its programming began to be devoted to niche audiences for shows regarding subjects like home improvement (&quot;Hometime&quot; and &quot;Home Savvy&quot; were two of the first), arts and crafts, crime programs such as &quot;The New Detectives&quot;, medical programming (particularly reality-based shows following real patients through the process of operations), and other shows that appealed to daytime audiences, particularly housewives. This was to be indicative of a major change in programming content and target audience over the next few years.

===1998–2008: &quot;Life Unscripted&quot;, new direction===
TLC began to explore new avenues starting in the late 1990s, deemphasizing educational material in favor of entertainment. &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot;, the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block, was slowly reduced through the years as the network deliberately redirected viewers towards the full-day lineup of children&#x27;s programming on Discovery Kids. The block was dropped completely in late 2008, and Cable in the Classroom programming, meant for recording by teachers, was discontinued in 2014.

In 1998, the channel began to distance itself from its original name &quot;The Learning Channel&quot;, and instead began to advertise itself only as &quot;TLC&quot;. During this period, there was a huge shift in content, with most new programming being geared towards reality-drama and interior design shows. The huge success of shows like &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot;, &quot;A Wedding Story&quot;, and &quot;A Baby Story&quot; exemplified this new shift in programming towards more mass-appeal shows.

This came at a time when Discovery itself was overhauling much, and in some cases competition series of its own programming, introducing shows like &quot;American Chopper&quot; (which Discovery moved to TLC for a time). Much of the older, more educationally focused programming could still be found dispersed amongst other channels owned by Discovery Communications.

On March 27, 2006, the network launched a new look and promotional campaign, dropping the &quot;Life Unscripted&quot; tag and introducing a new theme, &quot;Live and Learn&quot;, trying to turn around the network&#x27;s reliance on decorating shows and reality programming. As part of the new campaign, the channel&#x27;s original name, &quot;The Learning Channel&quot;, returned to occasional usage in promotions. The new theme also played on &quot;life lessons&quot;, which featured heavily in the network&#x27;s advertising and promotional clips. This campaign used humor to appeal to a target audience in their 30s. In 2007, TLC premiered &quot;Say Yes to the Dress&quot;, a reality series following clients of Kleinfeld Bridal in Manhattan.

=== 2008–present: Further focus on personal stories ===
In early March 2008, TLC launched a new imaging campaign, &quot;Life Surprises&quot;. This new slogan came as TLC began to shift even more to personal stories, and away from the once-dominating home improvement shows. Programs focused on family life became the core of the channel. &quot;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&quot;, which by 2008 was the highest-rated program on TLC, and &quot;Little People, Big World&quot; were joined by &quot;17 Kids and Counting&quot;—a show which followed the lives of the Duggar family (and was in turn retitled &quot;18 Kids and Counting&quot;, and then &quot;19 Kids and Counting&quot;, as the family expanded), and &quot;Table for 12&quot; in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The series &quot;Toddlers &amp; Tiaras&quot; also debuted in 2008, and proved popular enough to spawn a spin-off in 2012, &quot;Here Comes Honey Boo Boo&quot;, focusing on the family life of recurring contestant Alana &quot;Honey Boo Boo&quot; Thompson. Also premiering on TLC in 2009 was &quot;Cake Boss&quot;, which focuses on the head baker at Carlo&#x27;s Bakery and his staff, who mostly consist of his family.

In July 2014, TLC introduced a new slogan and promotional campaign, &quot;Everyone Needs a Little TLC&quot;, which continued to build upon the network&#x27;s current focus on personal stories and family life. In 2014, &quot;Here Comes Honey Boo Boo&quot; was canceled after it was reported that Alana&#x27;s mother had been dating a registered sex offender. In 2015, &quot;19 Kids and Counting&quot; was canceled by TLC after the Duggars&#x27; eldest son, Josh Duggar, admitted to acts of molestation he had committed against minors while he was a teenager. It was subsequently succeeded by a spin-off series, &quot;Counting On&quot;, which followed the adult lives of Duggar family members; the series was canceled in June 2021 after Josh Duggar was arrested on child pornography charges (for which he was later convicted).

In 2017, home design programming began to return to the network with the premiere of &quot;Nate &amp; Jeremiah By Design&quot;; the series was renewed for a second season. In April 2018, TLC premiered a revival of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; (which accompanied the season 2 premiere of &quot;Nate &amp; Jeremiah By Design&quot;); the season premiere and an accompanying reunion special were seen by 2.8 million viewers, marking the network&#x27;s highest-rated Saturday primetime program since 2010.

In March 2018, Discovery Communications acquired Scripps Networks Interactive, and was renamed Discovery, Inc. TLC president Nancy Daniels left the network to become the chief brand officer of Discovery&#x27;s factual networks, to replace the outgoing Rich Ross. She was replaced by Scripps Networks&#x27; chief programmer Kathleen Finch as chief brand officer of Discovery&#x27;s lifestyle networks, overseeing TLC and the six networks formerly owned by SNI (such as HGTV and Food Network), among others. In 2019, HGTV and TLC premiered a co-commissioned revival of another former TLC series, &quot;While You Were Out&quot;; new episodes premiered on both networks simultaneously, with HGTV airing an alternate cut of the episode focusing more on the renovation process.

<text>Babrius (, &quot;Bábrios&quot;; ), also known as Babrias () or Gabrias (), was the author of a collection of Greek fables, many of which are known today as Aesop&#x27;s Fables.

==Life==
Practically nothing is known of him. He is supposed to have been a Hellenized Roman, whose original name may have been Valerius. He lived in the East, probably in Syria, where the fables seem first to have gained popularity. The address to &quot;a son of King Alexander&quot; has caused much speculation, with the result that dates varying between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD have been assigned to Babrius. The Alexander referred to may have been Alexander Severus (AD 222–235), who was fond of having literary men of all kinds about his court. &quot;The son of Alexander&quot; has further been identified with a certain Branchus mentioned in the fables, and it is suggested that Babrius may have been his tutor; probably, however, Branchus is a purely fictitious name. There is no mention of Babrius in ancient writers before the beginning of the 3rd century AD. As appears from surviving papyrus fragments, his work is to be dated before c. 200 AD (and probably not much earlier, for his language and style seem to show that he belonged to that period).

==Work of Richard Bentley==
The first critic who made Babrius more than a mere name was Richard Bentley. In a careful examination of these prose Aesopian fables, which had been handed down in various collections from the time of Maximus Planudes, Bentley discovered traces of versification, and was able to extract a number of verses which he assigned to Babrius. Tyrwhitt followed up the researches of Bentley, and for some time the efforts of scholars were directed towards reconstructing the metrical original of the prose fables.

==1842 find==
In 1842 the Greek manuscript collector Minoides Mynas came upon a manuscript of Babrius in the convent of Great Lavra on Mount Athos, now in the British Museum. This manuscript contained 123 fables out of the supposed original number, 160. They are arranged alphabetically, but break off at the letter O. The fables are written in choliambic, that is, limping or imperfect iambic verse, having a spondee as the last foot, a meter originally appropriated to scurrilous verse. The style is extremely good, the expression being terse and pointed, the versification correct and elegant, and the construction of the stories is fully equal to that in the prose versions. The genuineness of this collection of the fables was generally admitted by scholars. In 1857, Mynas professed to have discovered at Mount Athos another manuscript containing 94 fables and a preface. As the monks refused to sell this manuscript, he made a copy of it, which was sold to the British Museum, and was published in 1859 by Sir G Cornewall Lewis. This, however, was soon considered to be a forgery. Six more fables were brought to light by P Knoll from a Vatican manuscript edited by A. Eberhard.

Early translations in English were made by Davies (1860) and in French by Levêque (1890), and in many other languages. More contemporary translations are by Denison B. Hull (University of Chicago Press) and Ben E. Perry (Harvard University Press).

In 1941, Heritage Press produced a &quot;fine book&quot; edition of Aesop, translated and adapted by Munro Leaf as juvenalia and lavishly illustrated by Robert Lawson.

In 1998, Penguin Classics released a new translation by Olivia and Robert Temple, entitled &quot;Aesop: The Complete Fables&quot; in reference to the fact that some previous translations were partial. Working from the Chambry text published in 1927, the Temple translation includes 358 fables; Robert Temple acknowledges on page xxiv that scholars will in all likelihood challenge the &quot;Aesopian&quot; origin of some of them.

<text>A multilayer switch (MLS) is a computer networking device that switches on OSI layer 2 like an ordinary network switch and provides extra functions on higher OSI layers. The MLS was invented by engineers at Digital Equipment Corporation.

Switching technologies are crucial to network design, as they allow traffic to be sent only where it is needed in most cases, using fast, hardware-based methods. Switching uses different kinds of network switches. A standard switch is known as a &quot;layer-2 switch&quot; and is commonly found in nearly any LAN. &quot;Layer-3&quot; or &quot;layer-4&quot; switches require advanced technology (see managed switch) and are more expensive and thus are usually only found in larger LANs or in special network environments.

==Multilayer switch==
Multi-layer switching combines layer-2, -3 and -4 switching technologies and provides high-speed scalability with low latency. Multi-layer switching can move traffic at wire speed and also provide layer-3 routing. There is no performance difference between forwarding at different layers because the routing and switching are all hardware-basedrouting decisions are made by specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with the help of content-addressable memory.

Multi-layer switching can make routing and switching decisions based on the following
* MAC address in a data link frame
* Protocol field in the data link frame
* IP address in the network layer header
* Protocol field in the network layer header
* Port numbers in the transport layer header

MLSs implement QoS in hardware. A multilayer switch can prioritize packets by the 6 bit differentiated services code point (DSCP). These 6 bits were originally used for type of service. The following 4 mappings are normally available in an MLS:
* From OSI layer 2, 3 or 4 to IP DSCP (for IP packets) or IEEE 802.1p
* From IEEE 802.1p to IP DSCP
* From IP DSCP to IEEE 802.1p
* From VLAN IEEE 802.1p to port egress queue.

MLSs are also able to route IP traffic between VLANs like a common router. The routing is normally as quick as switching (at wire speed).

== Layer-2 switching ==
Layer-2 switching uses the MAC addresses of the hosts’ network interface controllers (NICs) to decide where to forward frames. Layer-2 switching is hardware-based, which means switches use ASICs to build and maintain the forwarding information base and to perform packet forwarding at wire speed. One way to think of a layer-2 switch is as a multiport bridge.

Layer-2 switching is highly efficient because there is no modification to the frame required. Encapsulation of the packet changes only when the data packet passes through dissimilar media (such as from Ethernet to FDDI). Layer-2 switching is used for workgroup connectivity and network segmentation (breaking up collision domains). This allows a flatter network design with more network segments than conventional networks joined by repeater hubs and routers.

Layer-2 switches have the same limitations as bridges. Bridges break up collision domains, but the network remains one large broadcast domain which can cause performance issues and limits the size of a network. Broadcast and multicasts, along with the slow convergence of spanning tree, can cause major problems as the network grows. Because of these problems, layer-2 switches cannot completely replace routers. Bridges are good if a network is designed by the 80/20 rule: users spend 80 percent of their time on their local segment.

== Layer-3 switching ==
A layer-3 switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a router. Most network switches, however, are limited to supporting a single type of physical network, typically Ethernet, whereas a router may support different kinds of physical networks on different ports.

Layer-3 switching is solely based on the (destination) IP address stored in the header of an IP datagram (layer-4 switching may use other information in the header). The difference between a layer-3 switch and a router is the way the device is making the routing decision. Conventionally, routers use microprocessors to make forwarding decisions in software, while the switch performs only hardware-based packet switching (by specialized ASICs with the help of content-addressable memory). However, many routers now also have advanced hardware functions to assist with forwarding.

The main advantage of layer-3 switches is the potential for lower network latency as a packet can be routed without making extra network hops to a router. For example, connecting two distinct segments (e.g. VLANs) with a router to a standard layer-2 switch requires passing the frame to the switch (first L2 hop), then to the router (second L2 hop) where the packet inside the frame is routed (L3 hop) and then passed back to the switch (third L2 hop). A layer-3 switch accomplishes the same task without the need for a router (and therefore additional hops) by making the routing decision itself, i.e. the packet is routed to another subnet and switched to the destination network port simultaneously.

Because many layer-3 switches offer the same functionality as conventional routers they can be used as cheaper, lower latency replacements in some networks. Layer-3 switches can perform the following actions that can also be performed by routers:
* determine paths based on logical addressing
* check and recompute layer-3 header checksums
* examine and update time to live (TTL) field
* process and respond to any option information
* update Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) managers with Management Information Base (MIB) information

The benefits of layer-3 switching include the following:
* fast hardware-based packet forwarding with low latency
* lower per-port cost compared to pure routers
* flow accounting
* Quality of service (QoS)

IEEE has developed hierarchical terminology that is useful in describing forwarding and switching processes. Network devices without the capability to forward packets between subnetworks are called end systems (ESs, singular ES), whereas network devices with these capabilities are called intermediate systems (ISs). ISs are further divided into those that communicate only within their routing domain (intradomain IS) and those that communicate both within and between routing domains (interdomains IS). A routing domain is generally considered as a portion of an internetwork under common administrative authority and is regulated by a particular set of administrative guidelines. Routing domains are also called autonomous systems.

A common layer-3 capability is an awareness of IP multicast through IGMP snooping. With this awareness, a layer-3 switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group.

Layer-3 switches typically support IP routing between VLANs configured on the switch. Some layer-3 switches support the routing protocols that routers use to exchange information about routes between networks.

== Layer-4 switching ==
Layer-4 switching means hardware-based layer-3 switching technology that can also consider the type of network traffic (for example, distinguishing between UDP and TCP). Layer-4 switching provides additional datagram inspection by reading the port numbers found in the transport layer header to make routing decisions (i.e. ports used by HTTP, FTP and VoIP). These port numbers are found in RFC 1700 and reference the upper-layer protocol, program, or application.

Using layer-4 switching, the network administrator can configure a layer-4 switch to prioritize data traffic by application. Layer-4 information can also be used to help make routing decisions. For example, extended access lists can filter packets based on layer-4 port numbers. Another example is accounting information gathered by open standards using sFlow.

A layer-4 switch can use information in the transport-layer protocols to make forwarding decisions. Principally this refers to an ability to use source and destination port numbers in TCP and UDP communications to allow, block and prioritize communications.

===Layer 4–7 switch, web switch, or content switch===
Some switches can use packet information up to OSI layer 7; these may be called layer 4–7 switches, &#x27;, &#x27;, web switches or application switches.

Content switches are typically used for load balancing among groups of servers. Load balancing can be performed on HTTP, HTTPS, VPN, or any TCP/IP traffic using a specific port. Load balancing often involves destination network address translation so that the client of the load-balanced service is not fully aware of which server is handling its requests. Some layer 4–7 switches can perform Network address translation (NAT) at wire speed. Content switches can often be used to perform standard operations such as SSL encryption and decryption to reduce the load on the servers receiving the traffic, or to centralize the management of digital certificates. Layer-7 switching is a technology used in a content delivery network (CDN).

Some applications require that repeated requests from a client are directed at the same application server. Since the client isn&#x27;t generally aware of which server it spoke to earlier, content switches define a notion of stickiness. For example, requests from the same source IP address are directed to the same application server each time. Stickiness can also be based on SSL IDs, and some content switches can use cookies to provide this functionality.

===Layer-4 load balancer===
The router operates on the transport layer and makes decisions on where to send the packets. Modern load balancing routers can use different rules to make decisions on where to route traffic. This can be based on least load, or fastest response times, or simply balancing requests out to multiple destinations providing the same services. This is also a redundancy method, so if one machine is not up, the router will not send traffic to it.

The router may also have NAT capability with port and transaction awareness and performs a form of port translation for sending incoming packets to one or more machines that are hidden behind a single IP address.

===Layer 7===
Layer-7 switches may distribute the load based on uniform resource locators (URLs), or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions. A layer-7 switch may include a web cache and participate in a &quot;content-distribution network&quot; (&quot;CDN&quot;).

<text>William Gunion Rutherford (17 July 1853 – 19 July 1907) was a Scottish scholar.

== Life ==
He was born in Peeblesshire on 17 July 1853 and educated at St Andrews and Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in natural science. His intention to enter medical profession was abandoned in favour of a scholastic career. From 1883 to 1901 he was Head Master of Westminster School; and his death deprived classical scholarship in the UK of one of its most brilliant modern representatives. He was also a Fellow of University College, Oxford for a time.

=== Work ===
Rutherford devoted special attention to Attic Greek idioms and the language of Aristophanes. His most important work, &quot;New Phrynichus&quot; (1881), dealing with the Atticisms of Phrynichus Arabius, was supplemented by his &quot;Babrius&quot; (1883), a specimen of the later Greek language, which was the chief subject of Christian August Lobeck&#x27;s earlier commentary (1820) on Phrynichus. His edition (1896–1905) of the &quot;Aristophanic scholia&quot; from the Ravenna manuscript was less successful. Mention may also be made of his &quot;Elementary Greek Accidence&quot; and &quot;Lex Rex&quot;, a list of cognate words in Greek, Latin and English.

In the year 1900, Rutherford produced an English translation of some parts of the Bible, called &quot;Five Pauline Epistles – A New Translation.&quot; This work was a translation of the books of Romans, first and second Thessalonians, and first and second Corinthians, with a brief analysis.

William G. Rutherford died on 19 July 1907, two days after his 54th birthday.

== Family ==
On 3 January 1884, he married Constance Gordon Renton.

<text>Maximus Planudes (, &quot;Máximos Planoúdēs&quot;; ) was a Byzantine Greek monk, scholar, anthologist, translator, mathematician, grammarian and theologian at Constantinople. Through his translations from Latin into Greek and from Greek into Latin, he brought the Greek East and the Latin West into closer contact with one another. He is now best known as a compiler of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;.

==Biography==
Maximus Planudes lived during the reigns of the Byzantine emperors Michael VIII and Andronikos II. He was born at Nicomedia in Bithynia in 1260, but the greater part of his life was spent in Constantinople, where as a monk he devoted himself to study and teaching. On entering the monastery he changed his original name Manuel to Maximus.

Planudes possessed a knowledge of Latin remarkable at a time when Rome and Italy were regarded with some hostility by the Greeks of the Byzantine Empire. To this accomplishment he probably owed his selection as one of the ambassadors sent by emperor Andronikos II in 1295–96 to remonstrate with the Venetians for their attack upon the Genoese settlement in Galata near Constantinople. A more important result was that Planudes, especially by his translations, paved the way for the revival of the study of Greek language and literature in western Europe.
He was the author of numerous works, including: a Greek grammar in the form of question and answer, like the &quot;Erotemata&quot; of Manuel Moschopulus, with an appendix on the so-called &quot;Political verse&quot;; a treatise on syntax; a biography of Aesop and a prose version of the fables; &quot;scholia&quot; on certain Greek authors; two hexameter poems, one a eulogy of Claudius Ptolemaeus— whose &quot;Geography&quot; was rediscovered by Planudes, who translated it into Latin— the other an account of the sudden change of an ox into a mouse; a treatise on the method of calculating in use amongst the Indians; and &quot;scholia&quot; to the first two books of the &quot;Arithmetic&quot; of Diophantus.

His numerous translations from the Latin included Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; with the commentary of Macrobius; Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot; and &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; Boethius&#x27; &quot;De consolatione philosophiae&quot;; and Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De trinitate&quot;. Traditionally, a translation of Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; has been attributed to Planudes, but this is a much repeated mistake. These translations were not only useful to Greek speakers but were also widely used in western Europe as textbooks for the study of Greek.

It is, however, for his edition of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; that he is best known. This edition, the Anthology of Planudes or Planudean Anthology, is shorter than the Heidelberg text (the Palatine Anthology), and largely overlaps it, but contains 380 epigrams not present in it, normally published with the others, either as a sixteenth book or as an appendix.

J. W. Mackail in his book &quot;Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology&quot;, has this to add of him:

:Among his works were translations into Greek of Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot; and Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic War&quot;. The restored Greek Empire of the Palaeologi was then fast dropping to pieces. The Genoese colony of Pera usurped the trade of Constantinople and acted as an independent state; and it brings us very near the modern world to remember that Planudes was the contemporary of Petrarch.

He is recorded as one of the first people to use the word &quot;million&quot;.

== Geography (Ptolemy) ==
According to Berggren &amp; Jones (2000) and Mittenhuber (2010) many of the extant manuscripts of Ptolemy&#x27;s Geography can be connected with the activities of Planudes. Within the stemma, manuscript groups UKFN and RVWC both descend from a recension by Planudes; only manuscript X (Vat.gr.191) is independent. 

Regarding Planudes&#x27; work in rediscovering the Geography, an hexameter poem survives titled: &quot;ου σοφωτάτου κυρου Μαξίμου μονάχου του Πλανούδου στίχοι ηρωικοί εις τήν Γεωγραφίαν Πτολεμαίου χρόνοις πολ λοίς άφανισιΜσαν, είτα δέ παρ&#x27; αύτοΰ πόνοις πολλοίς εύρεύεΐσαν.&quot; which can be translated as &quot;Heroic verses by the most wise monk Maximos Planudes on the Geography of Ptolemy, which had vanished for many years and then had been discovered by him through many toils.&quot; The summary of the poem by Berggen &amp; Jones (2010) is as follows:&quot;What a great wonder, the way that Ptolemy has brought the whole world into view, just like someone making a map showing just a little city. I never saw anything so skillful, colorful, and elegant as this lovely geographia. This work lay hidden for countless years and found no one to bring it to light. But the emperor Andronikos exhorted the bishop of Alexandria, who took great troubles that a certain free-spirited friend of the Byzantines should restore a likeness of the picture worthy of a king.&quot;

<text>Jean François Boissonade de Fontarabie (12 August 17748 September 1857) was a French classical scholar.

==Life==
He was born in Paris. In 1792 he entered the public service during the administration of General Dumouriez. Driven out in 1795, he was restored by Lucien Bonaparte, during whose time of office he served as secretary to the prefecture of the Upper Marne. He then resigned public employment permanently, in order to devote his time to the study of Greek. In 1809 he was appointed deputy professor of Greek at the faculty of letters at Paris, and titular professor in 1813 on the death of Pierre Henri Larcher. In 1828 he succeeded Jean-Baptiste Gail in the chair of Greek at the Collège de France. He also held the offices of librarian of the Bibliothèque du Roi, and perpetual secretary of the Académie des Inscriptions. 
Boissonade was the father of Gustave Emile Boissonade.

==Works==
Boissonade chiefly devoted his attention to later Greek literature:

*Philostratus, &quot;Heroica&quot; (1806) and &quot;Epistolae&quot; (1842)
*Marinus, &quot;Vita procli&quot; (1814)
*Tiberius Rhetor, &quot;De Figuris&quot; (1815)
*Nicetas Eugenianus, &quot;Drosilla et Charicles&quot; (1819)
*Herodian, &quot;Partitiones&quot; (1819)
*Aristaenetus, &quot;Epistolae&quot; (1822)
*Eunapius, &quot;Vitae Sophistarum&quot; (1822)
*Babrius, &quot;Fables&quot; (1844)
*Tzetzes, &quot;Allegoriae Iliadis&quot; (1851)
*a &quot;Collection of Greek Poets&quot; in 24 vols.

The &quot;Anecdota Graeca&quot; (1829–1833) and &quot;Anecdota Nova&quot; (1844) are important for Byzantine history and the Greek grammarians.

A selection of his papers was published by Ferdinand Colincamp, &quot;Critique littéraire sous le premier Empire&quot; (1863), vol. i of which contains a complete list of his works, and a &quot;Notice Historique sur Monsieur B.&quot; by Joseph Naudet.

<doc id="235157" wikidata="Q15249491" url="?curid=235157" title="Marwell Zoo">
<text>Marwell Zoo is a zoo situated in Colden Common near Winchester, in the English county of Hampshire. It is owned and run by the registered charity Marwell Wildlife. The zoo is home to over 500 animals of 145 species. The charity undertakes a range of educational and conservation activities, with a particular focus on Africa in addition to work from its base.

==History==
The zoo was founded by Dr John Knowles, opening in 1972. He sold a Rolls-Royce of his to buy some zebras. It was one of the earliest zoos in Europe to place an emphasis on animal conservation. Within a few years of its establishment, it became an important breeding centre for several species, some (e.g. the Mongolian wild horse) already extinct in the wild, others (e.g. the snow leopard and Siberian tiger) close to extinction.

The park is situated in the estate of Marwell Hall, a Grade I listed building originally built around the year 1320 by Walter Woodlock and largely rebuilt in 1816 by William Long. In the 16th century, the Hall belonged to the Seymour family, and there is a local legend that Henry VIII married Jane Seymour there. Between September 1941 and March 1944, Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft used the area (part of the managing director&#x27;s personal estate) as an airfield to support the manufacture of military aircraft at its nearby factory in Eastleigh. After the end of World War II, the area was returned to agricultural use until the establishment of the zoo.

In 1977, a giraffe called Victor tore a muscle in his leg, collapsed on his stomach, and was unable to get up. The press suggested that he had slipped while trying to mate and compared his situation to the splits. All attempts to get him on his feet failed, and his plight became a major international news story. Portsmouth Dockyard made a hoist to attempt to raise him onto his feet. He died of a heart attack very shortly afterward in the arms of his keeper Ruth. The publicity turned Marwell into a major tourist attraction, and interest was revived the following summer, when Victor&#x27;s mate, Dribbles, gave birth to a female calf named Victoria.

In the late 1980s, a number of scimitar-horned oryx and nyala antelope were transported from Marwell Zoo to the Pearl Coast Zoological Gardens in Broome, Western Australia. The Pearl Coast Zoo was a project of Lord Alistair McAlpine, opened in 1984. 

In 1991 Dr John Knowles was appointed an OBE for services to conservation.

In 1999, the zoo lost all of its penguins (22 African and 5 macaroni) to avian malaria. There were other cases in the UK but Marwell was the only zoo to lose its entire colony, which had arrived only two and a half years before to stock the new &quot;Penguin World&quot; exhibit. After consulting with experts, the exhibit was restocked with Humboldt penguins, which whilst endangered in the wild, are present in greater numbers in captivity.

In 2003, after constructing a new enclosure for critically endangered Amur leopards, a female leopard (Jade) escaped and fell from a tree to her death after being shot with a tranquiliser dart only days before the official opening of the exhibit. Following a replacement after the death of Jade, in 2005 the first cub born to the new Amur leopard pair, Amirah, escaped into the male&#x27;s enclosure and was killed by her father. On 18 November 2007, a female Amur leopard cub (named Kiska following a public vote) was born as a result of a European Conservation Breeding Programme.

Both the park and charity changed their name to &quot;Marwell Wildlife&quot; in April 2009, to promote awareness of conservation work beyond the park. The charity had previously been called the Marwell Preservation Trust, and the park had been Marwell Zoological Park.

In August 2022 another female giraffe died unexpectedly.

==Conservation==

The main, current Marwell Wildlife conservation programmes include Managing Biodiversity in Hampshire, assisting Grevy&#x27;s zebra and its ecosystem in Kenya; supporting threatened species in Zimbabwe and managing the population of small, vulnerable populations; and reintroducing the scimitar-horned oryx to the Sahara.

The zoo has been involved in reintroducing wild horse, golden lion tamarin, roan antelope and scimitar oryx to the wild. The oryx was extinct in the wild, but more than 200 calves have been born and reared at the zoo since 1972 and many of these have been released back to the Sahara with animals from Whipsnade Zoo and Edinburgh Zoo.

The charity carries out a range of research and education activities and provides the office for the IUCN antelope specialist group.

Marwell Zoo has had notable success breeding various endangered animals including: black and white ruffed lemur (critically endangered), scimitar-horned oryx, Amur leopard (critically endangered) and snow leopard. In July 2015 a critically endangered Sulawesi-crested macaque baby was born.

October 2018 saw the birth of a Hartmann&#x27;s Mountain Zebra at the zoo. First time mother, Dorotka, is genetically very important to the European population and the last successful breeding of the vulnerable species at the zoo was back in 1997. On 24th February 2021, a Javan Chevrotain was born at the zoo.

==Facilities==
The family attraction additionally includes five children&#x27;s playgrounds, various food kiosks, two indoor picnic lodges, and Bushtucker Bites, as well as picnic areas on Marwell Hall lawn and various other areas across the zoo. There is a hotel adjacent to the park.
The Marwell Wildlife Railway (MWR), was a gauge railway operating around the front half of the zoo site. It was commonly known as Marwell Zoo Railway, although its locomotive is lettered MWR to reflect the former name. The line ran for a little less than a kilometre, and was served by two stations, &quot;Treetops Junction&quot; and &quot;Park End Halt&quot;. The line opened in 1987 and operated using the original rolling stock. It operated daily during school holidays, and at weekends for the rest of the spring, summer, and autumn, but ceased operating in 2022 

Rolling stock on the railway was supplied by Severn Lamb. The only locomotive was a steam-outline locomotive named &quot;Princess Anne&quot;. There were four passenger coaches, each capable of seating 16 adult passengers. The coaches were roofed, but open-sided. There was a 4-wheel open wagon for maintenance trains.

<text>Esther Hart (born Esther Katinka Hartkamp on 3 June 1970 in Epe, Gelderland) is a Dutch singer.

==Career==
Hart entered BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest in 2003 with the song &quot;Wait for the Moment&quot;. She withdrew from that contest as participating for two countries would not have been acceptable for both BBC and NOS. She opted for participating in &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot;, the Dutch heat of the Eurovision Song Contest, and won. Her song, &quot;One More Night&quot;, was placed 13th in the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest. She read the Dutch results at Eurovision 2004 and Eurovision 2008.

==Activism==
On 17 January 2008, Hart willingly went to jail and stayed overnight in an attempt to gain publicity and money for charity. During that time she gave a concert with the Dutch broadcaster NCRV (Dutch Christian Radio Association) and the Exodus Foundation, which provides assistance for former prisoners to adapt to normal life. In addition, a poetry contest was held by the prisoners with the theme of &quot;dare to believe in change&quot;, with the winning poem to be read by Hart.

<doc id="235169" wikidata="Q19914428" url="?curid=235169" title="DNA paternity testing">
<text>DNA paternity testing is the use of DNA profiles to determine whether an individual is the biological parent of another individual. Paternity testing can be especially important when the rights and duties of the father are in issue and a child&#x27;s paternity is in doubt. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent. Though genetic testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including ABO blood group typing, analysis of various other proteins and enzymes, or using human leukocyte antigen antigens. The current techniques for paternity testing are using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the woman is still pregnant from a blood draw.

DNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage. In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the &#x27;probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as &quot;chimeras&quot;, have at least two different sets of genes. This can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.

==Paternity or maternity testing for child or adult==
The DNA test is performed by collecting buccal (cheek) cells found on the inside of a person&#x27;s cheek using a buccal or cheek swab. These swabs have wooden or plastic stick handles with a cotton synthetic tip. The collector rubs the inside of a person&#x27;s cheek to collect as many buccal cells as possible, which are then sent to a laboratory for testing. Samples from the alleged father or mother and the child would be needed.

==Prenatal paternity testing for unborn child==

===Invasive prenatal paternity testing===
It is possible to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Chorionic villus sampling retrieves placental tissue in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother&#x27;s abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, there is a small risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and amniocentesis require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.

===Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing===
Advances in genetic testing have led to the ability to identify the biological father while the woman is still pregnant. There is a small amount of fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in the mother&#x27;s blood during pregnancy. This allows for accurate fetal DNA paternity testing during pregnancy from a blood draw with no risk of miscarriage. Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as seven weeks gestation, and the amount of cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses.

==DNA profiling==
The DNA of an individual is the same in every somatic (nonreproductive) cell. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of each parent in equal amounts; this genetic material is known as the nuclear genome of the individual because it is found in the nucleus.

Comparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. Specific sequences are examined to see if they were copied verbatim from one individual&#x27;s genome; if so, then the genetic material of one individual could have been derived from that of the other (i.e. one is the parent of the other). This is called Autosomal DNA testing. It is currently the gold standard in paternity testing as it allows a comparison of the child’s DNA to that of the mother and alleged father. The genetic contribution to the child from the mother can be evaluated, resulting in possible genotypes for the true father. If the alleged father cannot be excluded as the true father, then statistical calculations can be conducted to determine how likely the alleged father is the true father compared to if another random man was the true father.

Besides nuclear DNA, mitochondria also have their own genetic material called mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling. Proving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can prove only if two individuals are related by common descent through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is, thus, of limited value (i.e., it could not be used to test for paternity).

In testing the paternity of a male child, comparison of the Y chromosome can be used, since it is passed directly from father to son. However, similar to mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome is passed through the paternal line. This means that two brothers share the Y chromosome of their father. Therefore if one brother is the suspected father, his biological brother could also be the father based on Y chromosomal data alone. This is true with any male related to the suspected father on the paternal line. For this reason autosomal DNA testing would be a more precise paternity testing method. 

In the US, the AABB has regulations for DNA paternity and family relationship testing, but AABB accreditation is not required. DNA test results are legally admissible if the collection and the processing follows a chain of custody. Similarly in Canada, the SCC has regulations on DNA paternity and relationship testing, but this accreditation, while recommended, is not required.

The Paternity Testing Commission of the International Society for Forensic Genetics has taken up the task of establishing the biostatistical recommendations in accordance with the ISO/IEC 17025 standards. Bio-statistical evaluations of paternity should be based on a likelihood ratio principle - yielding the Paternity Index, PI. The recommendations provide guidance on concepts of genetic hypotheses and calculation concerns needed to produce valid PIs, as well as on specific issues related to population genetics.

==History==
The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in 1901, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent under this form of testing. In the 1930s, serological testing, which tests certain proteins in the blood, became available, with a 40% exclusion rate.

In the 1960s, accurate genetic paternity testing became a possibility when HLA typing was developed, which compares the genetic fingerprints on white blood cells between the child and alleged parent. HLA tests could be done with 80% accuracy but could not distinguish between close relatives. Genetic parental testing technology advanced further with the isolation of the first restriction enzyme in 1970. Highly accurate DNA parental testing became available in the 1980s with the development of RFLP. In the 1990s, PCR became the standard method for DNA parental testing: a simpler, faster, and more accurate method of testing than RFLP, it has an exclusion rate of 99.99% or higher.

==Legal evidence==
The DNA parentage test that follows strict chain of custody can generate legally admissible results that are used for child support, inheritance, social welfare benefits, immigration, or adoption purposes. To satisfy the chain-of-custody legal requirements, all tested parties have to be properly identified and their specimens collected by a third-party professional who is not related to any of the tested parties and has no interest in the outcome of the test.

The quantum of evidence needed is clear and convincing evidence: that is, more evidence than an ordinary case in civil litigation, but less than beyond a reasonable doubt required to convict a defendant in a criminal case.

In recent years, immigration authorities in various countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and others, may accept DNA parentage test results from immigration petitioners and beneficiaries in a family-based immigration case when primary documents that prove biological relationship are missing or inadequate.

In the U.S., immigration applicants bear the responsibility of arranging and paying for DNA testing. The U.S. immigration authorities require that the DNA test, if pursued, be performed by one of the laboratories accredited by the AABB (formerly American Association of Blood Banks). Similarly, in Canada, the laboratory needs to be accredited by the Standards Council of Canada.

Although paternity tests are more common than maternity tests, there may be circumstances in which the biological mother of the child is unclear: examples include cases of an adopted child attempting to reunify with his or her biological mother, potential hospital mix-ups, and in vitro fertilization where the laboratory may have implanted an unrelated embryo inside the mother.

Other factors, such as new laws regarding reproductive technologies using donated eggs and sperm and surrogate mothers, can also mean that the female giving birth is not necessarily the legal mother of the child. For example, in Canada, the federal &quot;Human Assisted Reproduction Act&quot; provides for the use of hired surrogate mothers. The legal mother of the child may be the egg donor. Similar laws are in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.

In Brazil in 2019, two male identical twins were ordered to both pay maintenance for a child fathered by one of them, because the father could not be identified with DNA.

==Legal issues==

===Australia===
Peace-of-mind parentage tests are widely available on the internet. For a parentage test (paternity or maternity) to be admissible for legal purposes, such as for changing a birth certificate, Family Law Court proceedings, visa/citizenship applications or child support claims, the process must comply with the &quot;Family Law Regulations 1984&quot; (Cth). Further, the laboratory processing the samples must be accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA).

===Canada===
Personal paternity-testing kits are available. The Standards Council of Canada regulates paternity testing in Canada whereby laboratories are ISO 17025-approved. In Canada, only a handful of labs have this approval, and it is recommended that testing is performed in these labs. Courts also have the power to order paternity tests during divorce cases.

===China===
In China, paternity testing is legally available to fathers who suspect their child is not theirs. Chinese law also requires a paternity test for any child born outside the one-child policy for the child to be eligible for a &quot;hukou&quot;, or family registration record. Family tie formed by adoption can also only be confirmed by a paternity test. A large number of Chinese citizens seek paternity testing each year, and this has given rise to many unlicensed illegal testing centers being set up.

===France===
DNA paternity testing is solely performed on decision of a judge in case of a judiciary procedure in order either to establish or contest paternity or to obtain or deny child support. Non consensual private DNA paternity testing is illegal, including through laboratories in other countries, and is punishable by up to a year in prison and a €15,000 fine. The French Council of State has described the law&#x27;s purpose as upholding the &quot;French regime of filiation&quot; and preserving &quot;the peace of families.&quot;

===Germany===
Under the Gene Diagnostics Act of 2009, secret paternity testing is illegal. Any paternity testing must be conducted by a licensed physician or by an expert with a university degree in science and special education in parentage testing, and the laboratory carrying out genetic testing must be accredited according to ISO/IEC 17025. Full informed consent of both parents is required, and prenatal paternity testing is prohibited, with the exception of sexual abuse and rape cases. Any genetic testing done without the other parent&#x27;s consent is punishable with a €5,000 fine. Due to an amendment of the civil law section 1598a in 2005, any man who contests paternity no longer automatically severs legal rights and obligations to the child.

===Israel===
A paternity test with any legal standing must be ordered by a family court. Though parents have access to &quot;peace of mind&quot; parental tests through overseas laboratories, family courts are under no obligation to accept them as evidence. It is also illegal to take genetic material for a parental test from a minor over 16 years of age without the minor&#x27;s consent. Family courts have the power to order paternity tests against the will of the father in divorce and child support cases, as well as in other cases such as determining heirs and settling the question involving the population registry. A man seeking to prove that he is not the father of the child registered as his is entitled to a paternity test, even if the mother and natural guardian object. Paternity tests are not ordered when it is believed it could lead to the murder of the mother, and until 2007, were not ordered when there was a chance that the child of a married woman could have been fathered by a man other than her husband, thereby making the child a &quot;mamzer&quot; under Jewish law.

===Philippines===
DNA paternity testing for personal knowledge is legal, and home test kits are available by mail from representatives of AABB- and ISO 17025-certified laboratories. DNA Paternity Testing for official purposes, such as sustento (child support) and inheritance disputes, must follow the Rule on DNA Evidence A.M. No. 06-11-5-SC, which was promulgated by the Philippine Supreme Court on October 15, 2007. Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required.

===Spain===
In Spain, peace-of-mind paternity tests are a &quot;big business,&quot; partly due to the French ban on paternity testing, with many genetic testing companies being based in Spain.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there were no restrictions on paternity tests until the &quot;Human Tissue Act 2004&quot; came into force in September 2006. Section 45 states that it is an offence to possess without appropriate consent any human bodily material with the intent of analysing its DNA. Legally declared fathers have access to paternity-testing services under the new regulations, provided the putative parental DNA being tested is their own. Tests are sometimes ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required. In the UK, the Ministry of Justice accredits bodies that can conduct this testing. The Department of Health produced a voluntary code of practice on genetic paternity testing in 2001. This document is currently under review, and responsibility for it has been transferred to the Human Tissue Authority.
In the 2018 case of Anderson V Spencer the Court of Appeal permitted for the very first time DNA samples taken from a Deceased person to be used for paternity testing.

===United States===
In the United States, paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court and are for personal knowledge only.

Only a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. If parental testing is being submitted for legal purposes, including immigration, testing must be ordered through a lab that has AABB accreditation for relationship DNA testing.

The legal implications of a parentage result test vary by state and according to whether the putative parents are unmarried or married. If a parentage test does not meet forensic standards for the state in question, a court-ordered test may be required for the results of the test to be admissible for legal purposes. For unmarried parents, if a parent is currently receiving child support or custody, but DNA testing later proves that the man is not the father, support automatically stops. However, in many states, this testing must be performed during a narrow window of time, if a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form has already been signed by the putative father; otherwise, the results of the test may be disregarded by law, and in many cases, a man may be required to pay child support, though the child is biologically unrelated. In a few states, if the mother is receiving the support, then that alleged father has the right to file a lawsuit to get back any money that he lost from paying support. As of 2011, in most states, unwed parents confronted with a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form are informed of the possibility and right to request a DNA paternity test. If testing is refused by the mother, the father may not be required to sign the birth certificate or the voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form for the child. For wedded putative parents, the husband of the mother is presumed to be the father of the child. But, in most states, this presumption can be overturned by the application of a forensic paternity test; in many states, the time for overturning this presumption may be limited to the first few years of the child&#x27;s life.

==Reverse paternity testing==
Reverse paternity determination is the ability to establish the biological father when the father of that person is not available. The test uses the STR alleles in mother and her child, other children and brothers of the alleged father, and deduction of genetic constitution of the father by the basis of genetic laws, all to create a rough amalgamation. This can compare the father&#x27;s DNA when a direct sample of the father&#x27;s DNA is unavailable. An episode of &quot;Solved&quot; shows this test being used to know if a blood sample matches with the victim of a kidnapping.

<text>A trace element is a chemical element of a minute quantity, a trace amount, especially used in referring to a micronutrient, but is also used to refer to minor elements in the composition of a rock, or other chemical substance.

In nutrition, trace elements are classified into two groups: essential trace elements, and non-essential trace elements. Essential trace elements are needed for many physiological and biochemical processes in both plants and animals. Not only do trace elements play a role in biological processes but they also serve as catalysts to engage in redox – oxidation and reduction mechanisms. Trace elements of some heavy metals have a biological role as essential micronutrients.

==Types==

The two types of trace element in biochemistry are classed as essential or non-essential.

===Essential trace elements===
An essential trace element is a dietary element, a mineral that is only needed in minute quantities for the proper growth, development, and physiology of the organism. The essential trace elements are those that are required to perform vital metabolic activities in organisms. Essential trace elements in human nutrition, and other animals include iron (Fe) (hemoglobin), copper (Cu) (respiratory pigments), cobalt (Co) (Vitamin B12), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), chlorine (Cl), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) (enzymes). Although they are essential, they become toxic at high concentrations.

===Non-essential trace elements===
Non-essential trace elements include silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). They have no known biological function in mammals, with toxic effects even at low concentration.

The structural components of cells and tissues that are required in the diet in gram quantities daily are known as &quot;bulk elements&quot;.

<text>Pierre Henri Larcher (12 October 1726 – 22 December 1812) was a French classical scholar and archaeologist.

==Life==
Born at Dijon, and originally intended for the law, he abandoned it for the classics. His (anonymous) translation of Chariton&#x27;s &quot;Callirhoe&quot; (1763) marked him as an excellent Greek scholar. His attack upon Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Philosophie de l&#x27;historie&quot; (published under the name of l&#x27;Abbé Bazin) created considerable interest at the time. His archaeological and mythological &quot;Memoire sur Venus&quot; (1775), which has been ranked with similar works of Heyne and Winckelmann, gained him admission to the Academie des Inscriptions (1778).

After the imperial university was founded, he was appointed professor of Greek literature (1809) with Boissonade as his assistant.

Larcher&#x27;s best work was his translation of Herodotus (1786, new ed. by L Humbert, 1880) on the preparation of which he had spent fifteen years. The translation itself, though correct, is dull, but the commentary (translated into English, London, 1829, new ed. 1844, by W. D. Cooley) dealing with historical, geographical and chronological questions, and enriched by a wealth of illustration from ancient and modern authors, is not without value.

<text>In the context of nutrition, a mineral is a chemical element. Some &quot;minerals&quot; are essential for life, but most are not. &quot;Minerals&quot; are one of the four groups of essential nutrients; the others are vitamins, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. The five major minerals in the human body are calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and magnesium. The remaining minerals are called &quot;trace elements&quot;. The generally accepted trace elements are iron, chlorine, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, iodine, selenium, and bromine; there is some evidence that there may be more.

The four organogenic elements, namely carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (CHON), that comprise roughly 96% of the human body by weight, are usually not considered as minerals (nutrient). In fact, in nutrition, the term &quot;mineral&quot; refers more generally to all the other functional and structural elements found in living organisms. 

Plants obtain minerals from soil. Animals ingest plants, thus moving minerals up the food chain. Larger organisms may also consume soil (geophagia) or use mineral resources such as salt licks to obtain minerals.

Finally, although mineral and elements are in many ways synonymous, minerals are only bioavailable to the extent that they can be absorbed. To be absorbed, minerals either must be soluble or readily extractable by the consuming organism. For example, molybdenum is an essential mineral, but metallic molybdenum has no nutritional benefit. Many molybdates are sources of molybdenum.

==Essential chemical elements for humans==

Twenty chemical elements are known to be &quot;required&quot; to support human biochemical processes by serving structural and functional roles, and there is evidence for a few more.

Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen are the most abundant elements in the body by weight and make up about 96% of the weight of a human body. Calcium makes up 920 to 1200 grams of adult body weight, with 99% of it contained in bones and teeth. This is about 1.5% of body weight. Phosphorus occurs in amounts of about 2/3 of calcium, and makes up about 1% of a person&#x27;s body weight. The other major minerals (potassium, sodium, chlorine, sulfur and magnesium) make up only about 0.85% of the weight of the body. Together these eleven chemical elements (H, C, N, O, Ca, P, K, Na, Cl, S, Mg) make up 99.85% of the body. The remaining ≈18 ultratrace minerals comprise just 0.15% of the body, or about one hundred grams in total for the average person. Total fractions in this paragraph are amounts based on summing percentages from the article on chemical composition of the human body.

Some diversity of opinion exist about the essential nature of various ultratrace elements in humans (and other mammals), even based on the same data. For example, whether chromium is essential in humans is debated. No Cr-containing biochemical has been purified. The United States and Japan designate chromium as an essential nutrient, but the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), representing the European Union, reviewed the question in 2014 and does not agree.

Most of the known and suggested mineral nutrients are of relatively low atomic weight, and are reasonably common on land, or for sodium and iodine, in the ocean. They also tend to have soluble compounds at physiological pH ranges: elements without such soluble compounds tend to be either non-essential (Al) or, at best, may only be needed in traces (Si).
===Roles in biological processes===
RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance; AI = Adequate intake; UL = Tolerable upper intake level; Figures shown are for adults age 31–50, male or female neither pregnant nor lactating

* One serving of seaweed exceeds the US UL of 1100 μg but not the 3000 μg UL set by Japan.

==Dietary nutrition==
Dietitians may recommend that minerals are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the chemical element(s) of interest. The elements may be naturally present in the food (e.g., calcium in dairy milk) or added to the food (e.g., orange juice fortified with calcium; iodized salt fortified with iodine). Dietary supplements can be formulated to contain several different chemical elements (as compounds), a combination of vitamins and/or other chemical compounds, or a single element (as a compound or mixture of compounds), such as calcium (calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) or magnesium (magnesium oxide), or iron (ferrous sulfate, iron bis-glycinate).

The dietary focus on chemical elements derives from an interest in supporting the biochemical reactions of metabolism with the required elemental components. Appropriate intake levels of certain chemical elements have been demonstrated to be required to maintain optimal health. Diet can meet all the body&#x27;s chemical element requirements, although supplements can be used when some recommendations are not adequately met by the diet. An example would be a diet low in dairy products, and hence not meeting the recommendation for calcium.

==Plants==
The list of minerals required for plants is similar to that for animals. Both use very similar enzymes, although differences exist. For example, legumes host molybdenum-containing nitrogenase, but animals do not. Many animals rely on hemoglobin (Fe) for oxygen transport, but plants do not. Fertilizers are often tailored to address mineral deficiencies in particular soils. Examples include molybdenum deficiency, manganese deficiency, zinc deficiency, and so on.

===Safety===
The gap between recommended daily intake and what are considered safe upper limits (ULs) can be small. For example, for calcium the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the recommended intake for adults over 70 years at 1,200 mg/day and the UL at 2,000 mg/day. The European Union also sets recommended amounts and upper limits, which are not always in accord with the U.S. Likewise, Japan, which sets the UL for iodine at 3000 μg versus 1100 for the U.S. and 600 for the EU. In the table above, magnesium appears to be an anomaly as the recommended intake for adult men is 420 mg/day (women 350 mg/day) while the UL is lower than the recommended, at 350 mg. The reason is that the UL is specific to consuming more than 350 mg of magnesium all at once, in the form of a dietary supplement, as this may cause diarrhea. Magnesium-rich foods do not cause this problem.

==Elements considered possibly essential for humans but not confirmed==
Many ultratrace elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function. One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive (examples: silicon and nickel in solid and dust), so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce. Some elements were once thought to have a role with unknown biochemical nature, but the evidence has not always been strong. For example, it was once thought that arsenic was probably essential in mammals, but it seems to be only used by microbes; and while chromium was long thought to be an essential trace element based on rodent models, and was proposed to be involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, more recent studies have conclusively ruled this possibility out. It may still have a role in insulin signalling, but the evidence is not clear, and it only seems to occur at doses not found in normal diets. Boron is essential to plants, but not animals.

Non-essential elements can sometimes appear in the body when they are chemically similar to essential elements (e.g. Rb+ and Cs+ replacing Na+), so that essentiality is not the same thing as uptake by a biological system.

==Mineral ecology==
Diverse ions are used by animals and microorganisms for the process of mineralizing structures, called biomineralization, used to construct bones, seashells, eggshells, exoskeletons and mollusc shells.

Minerals can be bioengineered by bacteria which act on metals to catalyze mineral dissolution and precipitation. Mineral nutrients are recycled by bacteria distributed throughout soils, oceans, freshwater, groundwater, and glacier meltwater systems worldwide. Bacteria absorb dissolved organic matter containing minerals as they scavenge phytoplankton blooms. Mineral nutrients cycle through this marine food chain, from bacteria and phytoplankton to flagellates and zooplankton, which are then eaten by other marine life. In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi have similar roles as bacteria, mobilizing minerals from matter inaccessible by other organisms, then transporting the acquired nutrients to local ecosystems.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Gail (1755–1829) was a French Hellenist scholar, member of the Institut de France (French Institute).

==Early years==
Gail was born in Paris on July 4, 1755. In 1791 he was appointed deputy, and in 1792 titular professor at the Collège de France. During the French Revolution, he maintained his professional duties, taking no part in politics, although he managed to ingratiate himself with those in authority.

==Career==
In 1815 he was appointed by King Louis XVIII of France to the post of keeper of Greek manuscripts in the royal library over the heads of the candidates proposed by the other conservators, an appointment which made him many enemies. Gail believed there was an organized conspiracy to belittle his learning and professional success, and there was a feud between him and his literary opponents, the most distinguished of whom was PL Courier.

==Achievements==
Without being a great Greek scholar, Gail was a hard worker, devoted to his favourite studies, and effectively rescued Greek from the neglect into which it had fallen during the revolutionary period. The list of Gail&#x27;s published works filled 500 quarto pages of the introduction to his edition of Xenophon. The most notable of these is his edition of Theocritus (1828). He also wrote a number of elementary educational works, based on the principles of the school of Port-Royal. His communications to the Académie des Inscriptions being coldly received and seldom accorded the honour of print, he inserted them in a vast compilation in 24 volumes, which he called &quot;Le Philologue&quot;, containing a mass of ill-digested notes on Greek grammar, geography, archaeology, and various authors.

A list of his works will be found in JM Quérard, &quot;La France littéraire&quot; (1829), including the contents of the volumes of &quot;Le Philologue&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Gail married singer and composer Sophie Gail and was the father of classicist Jean François Gail. Jean-Baptiste died in Paris on February 5, 1829.
