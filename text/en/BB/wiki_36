<text>Satmar (; ) is a group in Hasidic Judaism founded in 1905 by Grand Rebbe Joel Teitelbaum (1887–1979), in the city of Szatmárnémeti (also called Szatmár in the 1890s), Hungary (now Satu Mare in Romania). The group is a branch of the Sighet Hasidic dynasty. Following World War II, it was re-established in New York and has since grown to become one of the largest Hasidic dynasties in the world, comprising around 26,000 households.

Satmar is characterized by extreme conservatism, complete rejection of modern culture, and strong religious anti-Zionism. The community sponsors a comprehensive education and media network in Yiddish, which is also the primary language used by its members. Satmar also sponsors and leads the Central Rabbinical Congress, which serves as an umbrella organization for other highly conservative, anti-Zionist, and mostly Hungarian-descended ultra-Orthodox communities.

Following the death of Joel Teitelbaum in 1979, he was succeeded by his nephew, Moshe Teitelbaum. Since Moshe&#x27;s death in 2006, the dynasty has been divided between his two sons, Aaron and Zalman Leib, each leading separate communities and institutions.

==History==
===Transylvania===
Chananya Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum was the Grand Rebbe of the Sighet Hasidic dynasty. He died in 1904, and was succeeded by his oldest son, Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum.

A few Sighet Hasidim preferred his second son, Joel, as their leader. Joel Teitelbaum left the town of Máramarossziget, and, on 8 September 1905, he settled in Szatmárnémeti (in Yiddish: Satmar). His Sighet supporters followed him, and he began to attract a following. Hungarian journalist Dezső Schön, who researched the Teitelbaum rabbis in the 1930s, wrote that Teitelbaum started referring to himself as the &quot;Rebbe of Satmar&quot; at that time.

Teitelbaum&#x27;s power base grew with the years. In 1911, he received his first rabbinical post as chief rabbi of Ilosva. In 1921, the northeastern regions of Hungary were ceded to Czechoslovakia and Romania, under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. This area was densely populated with a segment of Orthodox Jewry known as Unterlander Jews. Many Sziget Hasidim, unable to regularly visit Chaim Tzvi&#x27;s court, turned to Joel Teitelbaum instead.

In 1925, Teitelbaum was appointed chief rabbi of Carei (Nagykároly). On 21 January 1926, Chaim Tzvi died unexpectedly, leaving his twelve-year-old son Yekusiel Yehuda to succeed him. Their mother emphasized Joel as successor, her grandson being too young for the position, and Joel returned to Sziget. However, Chaim Tzvi&#x27;s followers would only accept Joel as a trustee-leader until Yekusiel became old enough. Although Teitelbaum was highly regarded, he was not well-liked there. Under these conditions, Teitelbaum would have become the dynasty&#x27;s head in all but name, which was nevertheless unacceptable for him and his mother, and they left Sziget again. In 1928, Teitelbaum was elected as chief rabbi of Szatmárnémeti itself. The appointment resulted in bitter strife within the Jewish community, and he only accepted the post in 1934.

Teitelbaum rose to become a prominent figure in strictly Orthodox circles, leading an uncompromisingly conservative line against modernization. Among other issues, he was a fierce opponent of Zionism and Agudath Israel.

The Jewish population of Hungary was spared wholesale destruction by the Holocaust until 1944. On 19 March 1944, the German Army occupied the country, and deportations to the concentration camps ensued. Teitelbaum sought to re-assure the frightened people who, for the most part, weren&#x27;t able to leave Hungary, saying that by the merit of their religiosity, they would be saved. However, when the Germans invaded, he was saved by his devoted followers, who paid a huge ransom to have him included in the passenger list of the Kastner train. Teitelbaum reached Switzerland on the night of 7–8 December 1944, and soon immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. Many of Satmar&#x27;s Jews were murdered by the Nazis.

===In America===
A year after his daughter&#x27;s death in Jerusalem, Teitelbaum chose to move to the United States, arriving in New York aboard the MS &quot;Vulcania&quot; on 26 September 1946.

Teitelbaum settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, along with a small group of followers, and set out to re-establish his sect, which had been destroyed in the Holocaust. His arrival in America allowed him to fully implement his views: The separation of religion and state enabled the Satmar dynasty, as well as numerous other Jewish groups, to establish independent communities, unlike the state-regulated structures in Central Europe. In April 1948, his adherents founded &quot;Congregation Yetev Lev&quot;, which was registered as a religious corporation. Teitelbaum appointed Leopold Friedman (1904–1972), a former bank director, as the congregation&#x27;s president, while he was declared supreme spiritual authority. After Friedman&#x27;s death, he was replaced by Leopold (Leibish) Lefkowitz (1920–1998). Teitelbaum&#x27;s policy was to maintain complete independence by refusing to affiliate with, or receive financial aid from, any other Jewish group; his Hasidim established a network of businesses that provided an economic base for the community&#x27;s own social institutions.

The Satmar group grew rapidly, attracting many new followers. A 1961 survey established that its Williamsburg community included 4,500 people. From the 860 household heads, about 40 percent had been neither Satmar nor Sighet Hasidim in the pre-war years. In 1968, Satmar was already New York&#x27;s largest Hasidic group, with 1,300 households in the city. In addition, there are many Satmar Hasidim in other parts of the United States, and worldwide.

As part of his vision of complete isolation from the outside world, Teitelbaum encouraged his followers to make Yiddish their primary language, though many had previously used German or Hungarian, being immigrants from former Greater Hungary. The sect has its own Yiddish-oriented education system and several publishing houses which provide extensive reading material. Teitelbaum&#x27;s work in this matter made him, according to Bruce Mitchell, the &quot;most influential figure&quot; in the maintenance of the language in the post-war period. The uniformity of Satmar in America made it easier to teach young people the language, unlike in Europe: George Kranzler noted already in 1961 that the children speak Yiddish much better than their parents.

On 23 February 1968, Teitelbaum suffered a stroke, which left him barely able to function. His second wife, Alte Feiga, administered the sect for the remainder of Teitelbaum&#x27;s life, with the assistance of several Satmar functionaries.

In 1974, the sect began constructing the housing project Kiryas Joel in Monroe, New York, for its members. It was accorded an independent municipal status in 1977. On August 19, 1979, Teitelbaum died of a heart attack.

===Succession===

Teitelbaum was not survived by any children – all three of his daughters died in his lifetime. After prolonged vacillations by the community board, his nephew Moshe, Chaim Tzvi&#x27;s second son, was appointed as successor, despite Alte Feiga&#x27;s severe objections. Moshe Teitelbaum was proclaimed Rebbe on 8 August 1980, the first anniversary of his uncle&#x27;s death according to the Hebrew calendar. The great majority of Hasidim accepted the new leader, though a small fraction called Bnei Yoel, which was unofficially led by Feiga, opposed him. The tense relations between both led to several violent incidents in the 1980s.

In 1984, Moshe Teitelbaum appointed his oldest son, Aaron, as chief rabbi of Kiryas Joel. Both incurred opposition from elements within the sect. They were blamed for exercising a centralized leadership style, and for lack of sufficient zealotry.

Until the late 1990s, Moshe Teitelbaum&#x27;s heir apparent was his oldest son, Aaron. In 1999, his third son, Zalman, was recalled from his post as Satmar chief rabbi in Jerusalem and received the parallel post in the sect&#x27;s largest enclave, Williamsburg. He was later proclaimed successor, and a struggle between the two brothers ensued. Aaron resided in Kiryas Joel, where he was considered the local authority, while Zalman held sway in Williamsburg.

=== Schism ===
Following Moshe Teitelbaum&#x27;s death in 2006, both groups of followers announced that their candidate was named successor in his will, and they were both declared Rebbes. Zalman and Aaron were engaged in prolonged judicial disputes as to who should control the Congregation&#x27;s assets in Brooklyn. The sect has effectively split into two independent ones.

At the time of Moshe Teitelbaum&#x27;s death, sources within the sect estimated it had 119,000 members worldwide, making it the world&#x27;s largest Hasidic group. A similar figure of 120,000 was cited by sociologist Samuel Heilman. However, anthropologist Jacques Gutwirth estimated in 2004 that Satmar numbered about 50,000. As of 2006, the dynasty controlled assets worth $1 billion in the United States.

The two largest Satmar communities are in Williamsburg and Kiryas Joel. There are also significant Satmar communities in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and in Monsey and Bloomingburg, New York. Smaller concentrations can be found elsewhere. In North America, there are institutions in Los Angeles; Lakewood, New Jersey; and Montreal. Elsewhere, cities such as Antwerp, London, and Manchester; and in Argentina and Australia have Satmar groups, and there are many spread throughout Israel. Aaron Teitelbaum has stated that he wants to establish a community in Romania too. There is a small community of Satmar &quot;gerim&quot; (converts) living in Guatemala, having rejected the Lev Tahor cult which initially converted the group before being expelled from the country. The community of about 40 families has the full backing of the Satmar community in Williamsburg.

In addition to the Grand Rabbis&#x27; two main congregations, Chaim Yehoshua Halberstam, chief rabbi of the Satmar community in Monsey, became its local leader. Unlike the two brothers, Halberstam does not lay claim to the entire sect, though he conducts himself in the manner of a Hasidic Rebbe, accepting &quot;kvitel&quot; and holding &quot;tish&quot;. Another son, Lipa Teitelbaum, established his own congregation and calls himself Zenter Rav, in homage to the town of Senta, Serbia, where his father served as rabbi before World War II.

==Ideology==
The principles of Satmar reflect Joel Teitelbaum&#x27;s adherence to the Hungarian ultra-Orthodox school of thought, a particularly extreme variety, founded by Hillel Lichtenstein and his son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger in the 1860s, on the eve of the Schism in Hungarian Jewry. Faced with rapid acculturation and a decline in religious observance, Lichtenstein preached utter rejection of modernity, widely applying the words of his teacher, Moses Sofer: &quot;All that is new is forbidden by the Torah.&quot; Schlesinger accorded Yiddish and traditional Jewish garb a religious status, idealizing them as a means of separation from the outside world.

To reinforce his opposition to secular studies and the use of a vernacular, Schlesinger ventured outside the realm of strict &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) and based his rulings on the non-legalistic Aggadah. The ultra-Orthodox believed that the main threat did not come from liberal Jewish Neologs, who advocated religious reform, but from the moderate traditionalists; they directed their attacks chiefly against the modern Orthodox Azriel Hildesheimer. Their power base lay among the Unterlander Jews of northeastern Hungary – roughly present-day eastern Slovakia, Zakarpattia Oblast, and Northern Transylvania – where modernity made little headway, and the local Galician-descended Jews were poor, unacculturated, and strongly influenced by Hasidism. Sighet, as well as most other Hungarian Hasidic dynasties, originated from these regions.
Lichtenstein&#x27;s successors were no less rigid; the leading authority of Hungarian extremists in the Interwar period, Chaim Elazar Spira of Mukačevo, regarded the Polish/German ultra-Orthodox Agudath Israel as a demonic force, as much as both the religious and secular streams of Zionism. He demanded complete political passivity, stating that any action to the contrary was akin to disbelief in divine providence. While Agudah opposed Zionism for seeing it as anti-religious, Spira viewed their plan for establishing an independent state before the arrival of the Messiah as &quot;forcing the end&quot;, trying to bring Redemption before God prescribed it. In addition, he was an avowed anti-modernist: He sharply denounced Avraham Mordechai Alter, Rebbe of Ger, for introducing secular studies and allowing girls to attend school, and criticized modern medicine, believing the treatments recorded in the Talmud to be superior. Though personal relations between Spira and Joel Teitelbaum were tense, his ideological stance had a strong influence over the younger rabbi. Aviezer Ravitzky believed it remained unacknowledged in the latter&#x27;s writings due to the personal animosity between both.

Already firmly anti-Agudist and anti-Zionist in the interwar period, Teitelbaum had to contend with the issues which baffled world Jewry in the aftermath of World War II: the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel. In 1959, he enunciated his theological response in the book &quot;Vayoel Moshe&quot; (; the title is from Exodus ). The book contained three segments; the first was devoted to Teitelbaum&#x27;s interpretation of an Aggadatic text from the Ketubot in the Talmud, the Midrash of the Three Oaths. It discusses the meaning of a phrase quoted three times in the Song of Songs (, , ): &quot;I adjure you... that ye awaken not, nor stir up love until it please.&quot; The passage explains it as a reference to three oaths forced by God; two on the Children of Israel – that they &quot;shall not go up&quot; (migrate en masse) to their land before redemption, and neither rebel against the Gentile nations among which they are exiled – and the third upon all nations, &quot;that they shall not oppress Israel too much&quot;.

Teitelbaum argued that the first two are binding and eternal, and that their intent was to keep the people in divinely decreed exile until they would all fully repent their sins and earn a solely miraculous salvation, without human interference. He sought to demonstrate that Rabbinic sages of the past all treated the Oaths as legally binding, and even those who did not mention them, like Maimonides, did so because this was common knowledge. His thesis was also meant to refute contrary pro-Zionist religious arguments, whether that the aggadic source of the Oaths made them non-binding, or that they were no longer valid, especially after the Gentiles &quot;oppressed Israel too much&quot; in the Holocaust. The Oaths were never utilized as a central argument beforehand, and his interpretation of the matter is Teitelbaum&#x27;s most notable contribution to rabbinic literature. Based on his arguments, Teitelbaum stated that Zionism was a severe heresy and a rebellion against God, and that its pursuit brought about the Holocaust as a divine punishment; the continued existence of Israel was a major sin in itself, and would unavoidably lead to further retribution, as well as to the delaying of redemption. &quot;Vayoel Moshe&quot; crystallized the Rabbi&#x27;s uncompromisingly hostile stance toward the state. The link between Zionism and the Holocaust became a hallmark of his religious worldview.

Teitelbaum&#x27;s rabbinic authority and wealthy supporters in the United States made him the leader of the radical, anti-Zionist flank of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish world. He adopted a policy of utter non-recognition towards the State of Israel, banning his adherents residing there from voting in the elections or from affiliating in any way with the state&#x27;s institutions. When he visited the country in 1959, a separate train was organized for him, with no Israeli markings. The Israeli educational networks of Satmar and Edah HaChareidis, the latter also led by the Grand Rebbe, are fully independent and receive funding from abroad. Satmar and allied elements refuse to receive social benefits or any other monetary aid from the Israeli state and criticize those non-Zionist Haredim who do. Teitelbaum and his successors routinely condemned the Agudah and its supporters for taking part in Israeli politics. As to Religious Zionism, the Satmar Rebbe described its chief theologian, Abraham Isaac Kook, as &quot;a wicked adversary and enemy of our Holy Faith&quot;. 

In 1967, when the Western Wall and other holy places fell under Israel&#x27;s control after the Six-Day War, Teitelbaum reinforced his views in the 1968 pamphlet &quot;Concerning Redeeming and Concerning Changing&quot; (; Ruth ), arguing the war was no miracle, as opposed to statements by Menachem Mendel Schneerson of Chabad and others, whom he condemned severely, and forbade prayer at the Wall or at the other occupied holy sites, as he believed it would grant legitimacy to Israel&#x27;s rule. While providing some support for the otherwise unrelated Neturei Karta, Satmar has not always condoned its actions. Teitelbaum denounced them in 1967, when they co-operated with Arabs, and in 2006, the rabbinic court of Zalman Leib Teitelbaum&#x27;s group placed an anathema upon those who visited the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust. Satmar issued a further condemnation of Neturei Karta activities following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

==Women&#x27;s role==
Satmar women are required to cover their necklines fully, and to wear long sleeves, long, conservative skirts, and full stockings. Whereas married Orthodox Jewish women do not show their hair in public, in Satmar, this is taken a step further: Satmar women shave their heads after their weddings, and wear a wig or other covering over their heads, while some cover the wig with a small hat or scarf. The Grand Rebbe also insisted that the stockings of women and girls be fully opaque, a norm accepted by other Hungarian Hasidic groups which revered him.

Joel Teitelbaum opened Satmar&#x27;s &quot;Bais Ruchel&quot; school network only because he feared that if he did not, many parents would send their daughters to Bais Yaakov.

In 2016, the sect issued a decree warning that university education for women is &quot;dangerous&quot;. Written in Yiddish, the decree warns:

==Institutions==
The sect operates numerous community foundations. &quot;Bikur Cholim&quot; (&quot;Visiting the sick&quot;), established in 1957 by Teitelbaum&#x27;s wife Alte Feiga, concerns itself with helping hospitalized Jews, regardless of affiliation. &quot;Rav Tuv&quot;, founded in the 1950s to help Jews in the Soviet Union, aids Jewish refugees. Today, the organization mostly helps Jews from Iran and Yemen. &quot;Keren Hatzolah&quot; is a charitable fund to support yeshivas and the poor in Israel, providing for those who shun government benefits.

Teitelbaum founded a network of large educational institutions, both yeshivas and girls&#x27; schools. If its schools in New York were a public school system, it would be the fourth-largest system in the state, after those of New York City, Buffalo, and Rochester. In most places, the girls&#x27; schools are called &quot;Beis Rochel&quot;, and the yeshivas &quot;Torah VeYirah&quot;. In 1953, Teitelbaum founded the Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada, which provides various services, including &quot;kashrut&quot; supervision.

Senior yeshivas include the United Talmudical Seminary and &quot;Yeshivas Maharit D&#x27;Satmar&quot;. Satmar also operates its own rabbinical courts, which settle various issues within the community by the principles of Jewish Law.

The sect has a Yiddish newspaper called &quot;Der Yid&quot;, now privatized, and various other Yiddish publications. It is currently identified with Zalman&#x27;s Hasidim; whereas &quot;Der Blatt&quot;, established in 2000, is owned and run by a follower of Aaron&#x27;s.

In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, that a school district whose boundaries had been drawn to include only Satmar children violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In February 2025, the New York State Education Department cut funding to two Satmar yeshivas for failing to meet secular education standards in core subjects such as English and math.

== In media ==
The Satmar community of Williamsburg was portrayed in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Unorthodox&quot; in 2020, with consultation from Eli Rosen, a former Hasidic community member. A majority of the show&#x27;s dialogue is in Yiddish.

<doc id="231362" wikidata="Q1074438" url="?curid=231362" title="Citrus myrtifolia">
<text>Citrus myrtifolia (chinotto), the myrtle-leaved orange tree, is a species of &quot;Citrus&quot; with foliage similar to that of the common myrtle. It is a compact tree with small leaves and no thorns which grows to a height of and can be found in Malta, Libya, the south of France, and Italy (primarily in Liguria, typically Savona, and also in Tuscany, Sicily, and Calabria).

The fruit of the tree resembles small oranges. It has a bitter flavor and is commonly called by its Italian name, &quot;chinotto&quot; (). It is an essential flavoring agent of most Italian amari, of the popular Campari apéritif, and of several brands of carbonated soft drinks that are generically called &quot;chinotto&quot;.

&quot;Citrus myrtifolia&quot; is sometimes planted in gardens. Due to its compactness, it can also be planted in a pot or other container.

== Usage ==

The plant produces small bitter fruits which can be used to make jams, candied fruits, and syrups. Such processing reduces the bitter taste. Chinotto juice can be used to produce a drink, and is a component of some digestifs.

<text>Robert Bosch GmbH (; ), commonly known as Bosch (styled BOSCH), is a German multinational engineering and technology company headquartered in Gerlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company was founded by Robert Bosch in Stuttgart in 1886. Bosch is 94% owned by the Robert Bosch Stiftung, a charitable institution. Although the charity is funded by owning the vast majority of shares, it has no voting rights and is involved in health and social causes unrelated to Bosch&#x27;s business.

Bosch&#x27;s core operating areas are spread across four business sectors: mobility (hardware and software), consumer goods (including household appliances and power tools), industrial technology (including drive and control) and energy and building technology. In terms of revenue, Bosch is the largest automotive supplier. 

==History==

===1886–1920===
The company started in a backyard in Stuttgart-West as the (Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering) on 15 November 1886. The next year Bosch presented a low voltage magneto for gas engines.

From 1897, Bosch started installing magneto ignition devices into automobiles and became a supplier of an ignition system. In 1902, the chief engineer at Bosch, Gottlob Honold, unveiled the high-voltage magneto ignition system with spark plug.

In 1901, Bosch opened its first factory in Stuttgart. In 1906, the company produced its 100,000th magneto. In the same year, Bosch introduced the eight-hour day for workers. In 1910, the Feuerbach plant was founded and built close to Stuttgart. In this factory, Bosch started to produce generators and headlights &quot;Bosch-Light&quot; in 1914. The system had been presented in 1913.

The onset of motorization in road traffic meant that the company grew very rapidly after 1900. While Bosch had a workforce of 45 in 1901, it had grown to more than 1,000 by 1908.

In 1913, Bosch founded an apprentice workshop in order to recruit qualified young people for the production of automotive electrics. Bosch&#x27;s international development began in 1898 with the opening of a branch in London, followed the next year by Paris, Vienna, and Budapest. By 1909, Bosch was represented by trading partners on every continent: in 1906 in New York (U.S.) and Johannesburg (South Africa), in 1907 in Sydney (Australia), in 1908 in Buenos Aires (Argentina), in 1909 in Shanghai (China), in 1910 in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and in 1911 in Tokyo (Japan). Bosch opened the first factory outside Germany in Paris, in 1905, and the first on another continent in 1912 in Springfield, Massachusetts (USA).

In 1917, Bosch was transformed into a corporation and remained so until 1937, when Robert Bosch became the sole owner again after buying back his shares. In the process, the company became a limited liability company (GmbH).

=== 1920s–1945 ===
After the First World War, Bosch lost most of its international holdings, including its U.S. factories. The company had to largely rebuild its international activities. This included opening up further South American and Asian regions. In 1922, for example, Illies &amp; Company established a sales office for Bosch goods in Calcutta, India. In the years that followed, Bosch concluded contracts in Asia with sales partners in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and what is now Indonesia, for example, and on the American continents with partners in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.

In the 1920s, Bosch expanded its product range to include numerous automotive technology products that were required for cars in everyday use: electric horn (1921), windshield wipers (1926), and direction indicators (&quot;trafficator&quot;, 1927).

In 1927, Bosch launched injection pumps for diesel. Bosch bought the gas appliances production from Junkers &amp; Co. in 1932, as a part of a diversification strategy. In 1932, the company developed its first electric drill and presented its first car radio. In 1933, Bosch presented its first electric refrigerator for private households.

=== Nazi collaboration ===
In late 1933 negotiations between Robert Bosch AG and the Nazi Party began on relocating parts of armaments production to Germany&#x27;s interior. Bosch founded two such alternative plants in 1935 and 1937: Dreilinden Maschinenbau GmbH in Kleinmachnow near Berlin and Elektro- und Feinmechanische Industrie GmbH (later Trillke-Werke GmbH) in Hildesheim. Both plants were used exclusively for armament production. These &quot;shadow factories&quot; were built under great secrecy and in close cooperation with the Nazi authorities. In 1937, Bosch AG became a limited liability company (GmbH).

The Bosch subsidiary Dreilinden Maschinenbau GmbH (DLMG) in Kleinmachnow employed around 5,000 people, more than half of whom were forced laborers, prisoners of war, and female concentration camp prisoners, including many women from the Warsaw Uprising. They had to produce accessories for German Luftwaffe aircraft. In Hildesheim, a secret plant for the entire electrical equipment of tanks, tractors, and trucks of the Wehrmacht was built. In 1944, 4,290 men and women worked in the Trillke factory, 2,019 of whom were forced laborers, prisoners of war, and military internees. During the Second World War, there were at least 3,000 workers at the mechanics division at the Bosch Hildesheim plant, almost all of them from nearby occupied countries; there were only 200 recorded German workers.

In the last years of the war, no new German tank ever drove without the starter elements from the Bosch factory in Hildesheim. Bosch also had a monopoly position in the outfitting of German Luftwaffe aircraft.

During the war, production was further decentralized, Bosch produced in an ever larger number of factories, and relocated parts of its production to 213 plants in more than 100 locations.

===21st century===
In 2001, Bosch acquired &quot;Mannesmann Rexroth AG&quot;, which they later renamed to &quot;Bosch Rexroth AG&quot;. In the same year, the company opened a new testing center in Vaitoudden, close to Arjeplog in north Sweden. A new developing center in Abstatt, Germany followed in 2004.

In 2002, Bosch acquired Philips CSI, which at the time was manufacturing a broad range of professional communication and security products and systems including CCTV, congress, and public address systems.

In the 2000s the company developed the electric hydraulic brake, common rail fuel injection with piezo-injectors, digital car radio with a disc drive, and the cordless screwdriver with a lithium-ion battery in 2003.

==== Role in emission cheating software ====
In 2006, Volkswagen executives asked Bosch for help in developing software for their emission defeat devices. Volkswagen is one of Bosch&#x27;s biggest customers. Volkswagen engineers provided detailed specifications to Bosch, which wrote the necessary code. Bosch was apparently concerned about the legality of the software and asked Volkswagen to assume responsibility if the fraud was discovered, but Volkswagen refused.

Starting in 2008, Bosch supplied approximately 17 million motor control and mixture control devices containing illegal software to various manufacturers both domestically and globally. With such software, the automobiles fitted with Bosch&#x27;s devices emitted more nitrogen oxides than allowed under regulations.

On 1 February 2017, Bosch agreed to pay consumers in the United States $327.5 million as compensation for its role in devising the software. Bosch also provided emissions software for Fiat Chrysler&#x27;s 3.0 L V6 diesel engine used in 100,000 model year 2014–2016 Grand Cherokee SUVs and Ram Trucks and agreed to pay affected consumers $27.5 million as part of a broader settlement in January 2019. In May 2019, Bosch paid another fine for its connection to the Dieselgate scandal.

==Operations==

The majority of Bosch Group businesses are grouped into the following four business sectors.

===Industrial technology===
In the 2019 business year, the Industrial Technology business sector generated roughly 10 percent of total Bosch Group sales. The sector includes the Drive and Control Technology division, whose products include customized drive, control, and linear motion for factory automation, plant construction and engineering, and mobile machinery.

The second division, Packaging Technology, provides process and packaging for the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries. Its range includes stand-alone machines, systems, and services. In the early 2000s, it was portrayed as the world’s No. 1 company for packaging technology. In 2018, Bosch decided to look for a new owner for this business. Bosch&#x27;s in-house provider of assembly systems, Robert Bosch Manufacturing Solutions GmbH, Stuttgart, remains part of the Bosch Group; up to now, it has been part of the Packaging Technology division.

In addition, the Bosch Connected Industry business unit, which develops software and carries out Industry 4.0 projects for internal and external customers, has been part of the Industrial Technology business sector since the start of 2018.

In January 2020, Bosch Packaging Technology became Syntegon 
===Consumer goods===

In 2017, Bosch launched its first co-creation IoT innovation space in the world, the Connectory. A partnership with 1871, it is located within the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago, Illinois.

=== Indian operations ===

Bosch entered India in 1922, when Illies &amp; Company set up a sales office in Calcutta. For three decades, the company operated in the Indian market only through imports. In 1951, the Motor Industries Company Ltd. (MICO) was founded, with Bosch instantly buying 49% of its stock. MICO became the sole distributor and, after the Indian state implemented restrictive import regulations, a factory was set up at Adugodi, Bangalore in 1953, to manufacture various products with Bosch licensing. From this point onward, vocational training took place as well, culminating in the creation of a Vocational Centre in 1960. By 1961, 2,000 people worked at the Bangalore plant, which had already started an export business, and 57.5% of MICO shares had been bought by Bosch. This was followed by increased investments into MICO plants in India in the late 1960s and early 1970s; a second plant was installed in Nasik in 1969–1971, and a third in Naganathapura in 1988. In the late 1980s, the second-largest contingent of Bosch employees outside of Germany was based in India until eventually, in 2008, MICO was renamed Bosch Limited.

Bosch India has a turnover of over US$3 billion and over 31,000 employees spread across 10 locations and 7 application development centers. Approximately 84% of Bosch India revenues come from its automotive business, with the remaining 16% split between its non-automotive businesses that include packaging, energy and building, power tools, and consumer retail. Bosch also has R&amp;D facilities in Pune, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, and Bangalore, India. This is Bosch&#x27;s largest R&amp;D operation outside its home market of Germany. In September 2014, Bosch announced the launch of a locally developed eye-irrigation fluid in India. The company&#x27;s new eye screening and detection system offers a combination of hardware and software and provides affordable eye care.

Bosch India is listed on the Indian stock exchanges and has a market capitalization of over US$12 billion.

In 2022, Bosch&#x27;s engineering and software arm Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions (abbreviated as RBEI), changed its name to Bosch Global Software Technologies.

==Joint ventures==

===BSH Hausgeräte===

BSH Hausgeräte GmbH, in which Bosch acquired all shares in 2014, is one of the world&#x27;s top three companies in the household appliances industry. In Germany and Western Europe, BSH is the market leader. It includes the principal brand names &quot;Bosch&quot; and &quot;Siemens&quot;, &quot;Gaggenau&quot;, &quot;Balay&quot;, &quot;Neff&quot;, &quot;Thermador&quot;, &quot;Constructa&quot;, &quot;Viva&quot; and &quot;Ufesa&quot; brands, and further six regional brands. Bosch household appliances for the North American market are mainly manufactured at its factory near New Bern, North Carolina.

===EM-motive===
Daimler AG and Bosch established a 50:50 joint venture (JV) to develop and manufacture electric motors in 2011. The JV, called EM-motive GmbH, manufactures traction motors for electric, fuel cell and extended-range vehicles at a facility in Hildesheim, Germany.

In 2019 Bosch acquired the remaining shares and assumed full control of the company.

===Purolator filters===
Bosch co-owned Purolator Filters in a joint venture with Mann+Hummel until 2013. In 2013 the Mann+Hummel Group acquired Bosch&#x27;s stake.

===SB LiMotive===

In June 2008 Bosch formed SB LiMotive, a 50:50 joint company with Samsung SDI. The company held a ceremony for a 28.000 m2 lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plant in September 2009 and it is scheduled to start production for hybrid vehicles in 2011 and for electric vehicles in 2012. The plant will generate 1,000 jobs in Ulsan, Korea in addition to the 500 employees in Korea, Germany, and the United States. SB LiMotive was officially ended in September 2012 with both companies focusing on automotive batteries alone.

===Static ADAS Calibration===
In October 2020, Bosch and Mitchell International paired up to develop the MD-500, a wireless tablet that repair planners can use to link directly to OEM repair procedures from Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), automatically upload pre-scan and post-scans, and write estimates and calibration reports. Bosch and Mitchell launched the MD-TS21, a target system that permits repair facilities to quickly and accurately calibrate blind-spot monitors, front-facing camera, and radar sensors in automobile models with ADAS, in February 2021.

==Corporate affairs==

Robert Bosch GmbH, including its wholly owned subsidiaries, is unusual in that it is an extremely large, privately owned corporation that is almost entirely (92%) owned by a charitable foundation. Thus, while most of the profits are invested back into the corporation to build for the future and sustain growth, nearly all of the profits distributed to shareholders are devoted to humanitarian causes.


As shown in the diagram above, the &quot;Robert Bosch Stiftung&quot; (&quot;Robert Bosch Foundation&quot;) holds 92% of the shares of &quot;Robert Bosch GmbH&quot;, but no voting rights. The &quot;Robert Bosch Industrietreuhand KG&quot; (&quot;Robert Bosch Industrial Trust KG&quot;), with old members of the company management, agents of the Bosch family, and other eminent people from the industry (such as Jürgen Hambrecht, CEO of BASF), have 93% of the votes, but no shares (0.01%). The remaining 8% of shares and 7% of voting rights are held by the descendants of the company founder Robert Bosch.

Bosch invests 9% of its revenue on research and development, nearly double the industry average of 4.7%.

== Controversies ==
In March 2022, German engineering firm Bosch faced allegations of violating European Union sanctions against Russia after Ukrainian authorities reported finding Bosch components in Russian military vehicles.

In April 2024, the Russian government placed Bosch&#x27;s Russian subsidiary under the temporary management of a Gazprom entity, citing responses to Western hostilities.

Additionally, reports have surfaced indicating that Bosch, along with other companies, has been selling appliances intended for the Ukrainian market in Russia.

==Environmental practices and initiatives==
In May 2019, Bosch said it planned to be &quot;fully carbon-neutral” by 2020 by investing in clean electricity and a carbon offset program.

== Partnership with universities ==
Bosch has formed a strategic alliance with the Technische Universität Darmstadt.

<text>Brasidas (, died 422 BC) was the most distinguished Spartan officer during the first decade of the Peloponnesian War. He died during the Second Battle of Amphipolis while winning one of his most spectacular victories.
==Biography==
Brasidas was the son of Tellis (Τέλλις) and Argileonis, and won his first laurels by leading the relief of Methone, which was besieged by the Athenians (431 BC). During the following year he seems to have been eponymous ephor, and in 429 BC he was sent out as one of the three commissioners to advise the admiral Cnemus. As trierarch he distinguished himself in the assault on the Athenian position at the Battle of Pylos, during which he was severely wounded. 

In 424 BC, while Brasidas mustered a force at Corinth for a campaign in Thrace, he frustrated an Athenian attack on Megara. Immediately afterwards he marched through Thessaly at the head of 1,700 hoplites (700 helots and 1000 Peloponnesian mercenaries) and joined Perdiccas II of Macedon. The Macedonian king tried to use the Peloponnesian task force against the Lyncestians, a Macedonian tribe that had fallen out with their king, but Brasidas refused to be made a tool for the furtherance of Perdiccas&#x27;s ambitions; he ignored the king&#x27;s objections and received and negotiated with Arrhabaeus, the leader of the Lyncestians. 

After he settled with Arrhabaeus, Brasidas set about accomplishing his main objective. Partly by the rapidity and boldness of his movements, partly by his personal charm and the moderation of his demands, he succeeded during the course of the winter in winning over the important cities of Acanthus, Amphipolis (the main objective), Stagirus and Toroni as well as a number of minor towns, and most of the Chalcidic peninsulas. An attack on Eion was foiled by the arrival of Thucydides (the famous historian of the war, who at this time was serving as one of the Athenian generals) at the head of an Athenian squadron. In the spring of 423 BC a truce was concluded between Athens and Sparta, but it was at once imperilled by the city of Scione, which it transpired had come over to Brasidas two days after the truce began, which led to the Athenian requiring it to be returned to them. Brasidas refused to return Scione while encouraging the revolt of Mende shortly afterwards. The Scionians granted Brasidas a golden crown and named him the &quot;liberator of Hellas&quot;.

An Athenian fleet under Nicias and Nicostratus recovered Mende and blockaded Scione, which fell two years later (421 BC). Meanwhile, Perdiccas forced Brasidas to join him in a campaign against Arrhabaeus and the Lyncestians. They soon met the Lyncestians in a pitched battle and were victorious, driving Arrhabaeus into the mountains. On the approach of a body of Illyrians, who, though summoned by Perdiccas, unexpectedly declared for Arrhabaeus, the Macedonians fled, and Brasidas&#x27;s force was rescued from a critical position only by his coolness and ability (Battle of Lyncestis). This brought to a head the quarrel between Brasidas and Perdiccas (I.G. i. 42).

In April 422 BC, the truce with Sparta expired, and in the same summer Cleon was dispatched to Thrace, where he stormed Toroni and Galepsus and prepared for an attack on Amphipolis, the most important Athenian subject city in Chalcidice. When Cleon brought part of his army forward to probe the defences, Brasidas recognized an opportunity to defeat his superior force in detail. Brasidas&#x27;s plan for his final victory was typical of his campaigns in Thrace. It was a boldly aggressive surprise attack aimed at throwing the enemy into confusion and it made the best possible use of both his small force of Spartan hoplites and his allies who made up the bulk of his army, in this case mostly Edonians from the city of Myrkinos.

Brasidas personally led the Spartans in a sudden charge from Amphipolis, routing the left wing of the Athenian army. His allies sallied from the north-eastern gate and attacked from the north, breaking the enemy&#x27;s right wing. Edonian and Chalcidian cavalry and light infantry pursued the fleeing Athenians, killing 600 men, including Cleon. On the Spartan side only seven fatalities are reported, but one of them was Brasidas, who was mortally wounded while at the head of his Spartan troops. He was buried at Amphipolis within the city limits (an extraordinary honour among the ancient Greeks) with impressive pomp, and was subsequently regarded as the founder (oikistes) of the city and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices. At Sparta a cenotaph was erected in his memory near the tombs of Pausanias and Leonidas, and yearly speeches were made and games celebrated in their honour, in which only Spartiates could compete.

== Legacy ==
Chaido Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, in her three-decade research at Amphipolis, offers evidence of the recovery and identification of Brasidas&#x27;s burial at the ancient Amphipolis&#x27; agora. According to the Greek historian Thucydides, Brasidas&#x27;s grave was placed in front of the new, relocated agora of Amphipolis. An archaeological dig at Amphipolis unearthed the foundations of a small building, and a cist grave containing the remains of a silver ossuary accompanied by a gold wreath, believed to hold the remains of Brasidas. This ossuary is currently located in the Archaeological Museum of Amphipolis. The grave itself was a hole dug into the existing rock, with limestone blocks and mortar used to create the cist grave.

Thucydides&#x27;s characterisation of Brasidas suggests that Brasidas combined typical Spartan courage with those virtues in which regular Spartans were most signally lacking. Brasidas was apparently quick in forming his plans and carried them out without delay or hesitation. Furthermore, the rhetoric in the speech of Brasidas to the Acanthians is of noticeably higher quality than the other Spartan speeches recorded by Thucydides (Thuc. iv. 84–89). It appears that Brasidas&#x27;s un-Spartan virtues raised jealousy and suspicion in Sparta. (See in particular Thucydides; what Diodorus xii. adds is mainly oratorical elaboration or pure invention.) 

A fuller account is contained in the histories of Greece (e.g. those of George Grote, Karl Julius Beloch, Georg Busolt, Eduard Meyer) and in Gustav Schimmelpfeng, &quot;De Brasidae Spartani rebus gestis atque ingenio&quot; (Marburg, 1857).

== In popular culture == 
Brasidas appears in the 2018 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;. Brasidas is portrayed in the game as a powerful warrior and close friend of the protagonist.
Brasidas also appears in the Age of Empires II Grand Campaign as a protagonist for the Spartan side during the Pelepponesian War.

<text>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (; also romanized &quot;Shulkhan Arukh HaRav&quot;) is especially a record of prevailing halakha by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745–1812), known during his lifetime as &quot;HaRav&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;The Rabbi&quot;) and as the first Rebbe (Yiddish for &quot;rabbi&quot;) of Chabad. Within the Chabad community the work is known as the Alter Rebbe&#x27;s Shulchan Aruch.

==New edition of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;==
Shneur Zalman was asked by his teacher, Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch, to write an adjusted version of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (1562 CE) of Rabbi Joseph Karo with reference to later commentaries, as well as subsequent responsa, for nascent Hassidism. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (and its forerunner, the Beit Yosef) was written from the standpoint of Sephardi minhag. Shneur Zalman composed his updated and adapted &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (c. 1800), so that Hassidic laymen would be able to study the corresponding Jewish law, and in an attempt to reference halakha (Jewish law) as it stood at his time and place. Aiming to avoid ambiguity or obscurity, the work references the common Hassidic halakha with its underlying reasoning. Chabad-hagiography has it that Shneur Zalman, whose works form the foundation of Chabad philosophy, finished the composition aged 20. Originally the work was intended to cover all of the topics addressed in the Shulchan Aruch of Rav Yosef Karo, however, most of the work was lost prior to publication with only Orach Chaim surviving intact, along with small fragments of Choshen Mishpat and Yoreh Deah.

==Influence==
The &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot; is today used by most Hasidim as their basis for daily practice. The work is broadly considered an authoritative halachic text, and is frequently cited by later authorities such as Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan in his &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; and the &quot;Ben Ish Chai&quot; of Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Baghdad, as well as in many contemporary responsa by leading halachic authorities of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot; is also one of the three works on which Shlomo Ganzfried based his &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot;, the well-known precis of customary Ashkenazi Halakha.

Although widely accepted, the work was originally limited in printings. Much of the original text was destroyed in a fire in Lubavitch, and only parts of copies of the draft survived. Kehot Publication Society (2002) has recently begun publication of a Bilingual Edition; in this work notations appear whenever Shneur Zalman&#x27;s rulings are at variance with those in Yosef Karo&#x27;s &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

<doc id="231372" wikidata="Q273306" url="?curid=231372" title="Phang Nga province">
<text>Phang Nga (, ) is one of the southern provinces (&quot;Changwat&quot;) of Thailand, on the shore of the Andaman Sea to the west and Phang Nga Bay to the south. Neighbouring provinces, from north and moving clockwise, are Ranong, Surat Thani, and Krabi. Towards the south of Phang Nga is the Phuket province, connected by the Sarasin Bridge.

==Geography==
The province, located on the western side of the Malay Peninsula, encompasses the islands within Phang Nga Bay. Among these, Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu, often referred to as &quot;James Bond Island,&quot; gained prominence following their appearance in the 1974 film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. In this film, Khao Phing Kan serves as the base for the antagonist, with the distinct, needle-shaped limestone formation of Ko Ta Pu, situated approximately off the main beach, featuring significantly. To safeguard these and other islands, the Ao Phang Nga (Phang Nga Bay) National Park was established in 1981. The province also includes the Similan Islands and Surin Islands, notable diving destinations in Thailand. The total forested area of the province is approximately , accounting for 32.4 percent of its total area.

==Toponymy==
Phang Nga derives its name from the ancient Malay term &quot;Pangan,&quot; which translates to &#x27;jungle&#x27; in contemporary Thai. This term historically referred to a broad category of indigenous peoples, colloquially known as &#x27;orang Pangan&#x27; in Malay. This phrase was used to describe communities perceived as &#x27;heathen, pagan, or primitive&#x27;, typically residing in the dense jungle regions of the Malay Peninsula and its adjacent islands.

==History==
During the reign of King Rama II, the region surrounding Thalang (currently known as Phuket) fell under Burmese occupation, leading to a significant influx of refugees into Kraphu Nga. Following the successful expulsion of Burmese forces by Siamese troops in 1824, King Rama III renamed the area adjacent to the bay as &quot;Phang Nga&quot;. This adaptation from the Malay word &quot;pangan&quot; suggests the historical presence of Orang Asli or other indigenous groups in the region. In 1933, the town was elevated to the status of a province.

On the morning of 26 December 2004, the Andaman Sea coastline of Phang Nga Province experienced severe devastation due to a tsunami, resulting in extensive loss of life.

Khura Buri District, and particularly Ko Phra Thong, referred to as &quot;smuggler&#x27;s paradise&quot;, has been identified as a critical point of entry for illegal activities in Thailand, including human trafficking. This area is reportedly a transit route for various groups, including Rohingya, Uighur, and Syrian refugees seeking entry into Thailand.

==Symbols==

The official seal of the province features an illustration of the Phu Khao Chang mountains, set as a backdrop to the depiction of the city hall. Additionally, the seal includes an image of a dredge, symbolizing the province&#x27;s history of tin mining.

The provincial slogan encapsulates various aspects of the region&#x27;s identity and heritage: &quot;Massive mining industry, Ban Klang Nam &#x27;floating house&#x27;, delightful caves, strangely shaped hills, Jampun flower, rich in resources&quot;. This slogan reflects the diverse elements that define the province, from its industrial past to its unique natural and cultural features.

In terms of regional flora, the province has designated Cinnamomum porrectum, commonly known as hardy cinnamon, as its official tree. The provincial flower is Anaxagorea javanica, further emphasizing the area&#x27;s rich botanical diversity. Many beaches in Phang Nga are marine turtle nesting grounds, and on the ground, the provincial aquatic life is the green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;). 

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===

Phang Nga is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;), which are further divided into 48 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 314 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

Phang Nga and Takua Pa have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 36 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Transportation==

<text>Pluralism is a term used in philosophy, referring to a worldview of multiplicity, often used in opposition to monism (the view that all is one) or dualism (the view that all is two). The term has different meanings in metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and logic. In metaphysics, it is the view that there are in fact many different substances in nature that constitute reality. In ontology, pluralism refers to different ways, kinds, or modes of being. For example, a topic in ontological pluralism is the comparison of the modes of existence of things like &#x27;humans&#x27; and &#x27;cars&#x27; with things like &#x27;numbers&#x27; and some other concepts as they are used in science. 

In epistemology, pluralism is the position that there is not one consistent means of approaching truths about the world, but rather many. Often this is associated with pragmatism, or conceptual, contextual, or cultural relativism. In the philosophy of science it may refer to the acceptance of co-existing scientific paradigms which though accurately describing their relevant domains are nonetheless incommensurable. In logic, pluralism is the relatively novel view that there is no one correct logic, or alternatively, that there is more than one correct logic. Such as using classical logic in most cases, but using paraconsistent logic to deal with certain paradoxes.

== Metaphysical pluralism ==

Metaphysical pluralism in philosophy is the multiplicity of metaphysical models of the structure and content of reality, both as it appears and as logic dictates that it might be, as is exhibited by the four related models in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and as developed in the contrast between phenomenalism and physicalism. Pluralism is in contrast to the concept of monism in metaphysics, while dualism is a limited form, a pluralism of exactly two models, structures, elements, or concepts. A distinction is made between the metaphysical identification of realms of reality and the more restricted sub-fields of ontological pluralism (that examines what exists in each of these realms) and epistemological pluralism (that deals with the methodology for establishing knowledge about these realms).

===Ancient pluralism ===

In ancient Greece, Empedocles wrote that they were fire, air, water and earth, although he used the word &quot;root&quot; rather than &quot;element&quot; (στοιχεῖον; &quot;stoicheion&quot;), which appeared later in Plato. From the association (φιλία; &quot;philia&quot;) and separation (νεῖκος; &quot;neikos&quot;) of these indestructible and unchangeable root elements, all things came to be in a fullness (πλήρωμα; &quot;pleroma&quot;) of ratio (λόγος; &quot;logos&quot;) and proportion (ἀνάλογος; &quot;analogos&quot;).

Similar to Empedocles, Anaxagoras was another Classical Greek philosopher with links to pluralism. His metaphysical system is centered around mechanically necessitated &quot;nous&quot; which governs, combines and diffuses the various &quot;roots&quot; of reality (known as &quot;homoioneroi&quot;). Unlike Empedocles&#x27; four &quot;root elements&quot; and similar to Democritus&#x27; multitude of atoms (yet not physical in nature), these &quot;homoioneroi&quot; are used by Anaxagoras to explain the multiplicity in reality and becoming. This pluralist theory of being influenced later thinkers such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#x27;s theory of &quot;monads&quot; and Julius Bahnsen&#x27;s idea of will &quot;henades&quot;. The notion of a governing &quot;nous&quot; would also be used by Socrates and Plato, but they will assign it a more active and rational role in their philosophical systems.

Aristotle incorporated these elements, but his substance pluralism was not material in essence. His hylomorphic theory allowed him to maintain a reduced set of basic material elements as per the Milesians, while answering for the ever-changing flux of Heraclitus and the unchanging unity of Parmenides. In his &quot;Physics,&quot; due to the continuum of Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, as well as both logical and empirical considerations for natural science, he presented numerous arguments against the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus, who posited a basic duality of &quot;void&quot; and &quot;atoms&quot;. The atoms were an infinite variety of &quot;irreducibles&quot;, of all shapes and sizes, which randomly collide and mechanically hook together in the void, thus providing a reductive account of changeable figure, order and position as aggregates of the unchangeable atoms.

== Ontological pluralism ==
The topic of ontological pluralism discusses different ways, kinds, or modes of being. Recent attention in ontological pluralism is due to the work of Kris McDaniel, who defends ontological pluralism in a number of papers. The name for the doctrine is due to Jason Turner, who, following McDaniel, suggests that &quot;In contemporary guise, it is the doctrine that a logically perspicuous description of reality will use multiple quantifiers which cannot be thought of as ranging over a single domain.&quot; &quot;There are numbers, fictional characters, impossible things, and holes. But, we don&#x27;t think these things all exist in the same sense as cars and human beings.&quot;

It is common to refer to a film, novel or otherwise fictitious or virtual narrative as not being &#x27;real&#x27;. Thus, the characters in the film or novel are not real, where the &#x27;real world&#x27; is the everyday world in which we live. However, some authors may argue that fiction informs our concept of reality, and so has &quot;some&quot; kind of reality.

One reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s notion of language-games argues that there is no overarching, single, fundamental ontology, but only a patchwork of overlapping interconnected ontologies ineluctably leading from one to another. For example, Wittgenstein discusses &#x27;number&#x27; as technical vocabulary and in more general usage:
 Wittgenstein suggests that it is not possible to identify a single concept underlying all versions of &#x27;number&#x27;, but that there are many interconnected meanings that transition one to another; vocabulary need not be restricted to technical meanings to be useful, and indeed technical meanings are &#x27;exact&#x27; only within some proscribed context.

Eklund has argued that Wittgenstein&#x27;s conception includes as a special case the technically constructed, largely autonomous, &quot;forms of language&quot; or &quot;linguistic frameworks&quot; of Carnap and Carnapian ontological pluralism. He places Carnap&#x27;s ontological pluralism in the context of other philosophers, such as Eli Hirsch and Hilary Putnam.

== Epistemological pluralism==
Epistemological pluralism is a term used in philosophy and in other fields of study to refer to different ways of knowing things, different epistemological methodologies for attaining a full description of a particular field. In the philosophy of science epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to reductionism to express the contrary view that at least some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.

== Logical pluralism==
&quot;Logical pluralism&quot; can be defined a number of ways: the position that there is more than one correct account of logical consequence (or no single, &#x27;correct&#x27; account at all), that there is more than one correct set of logical constants or even that the &#x27;correct&#x27; logic depends on the relevant logical questions under consideration (a sort of logical instrumentalism). Pluralism about logical consequence says that because different logical systems have different logical consequence relations, there is therefore more than one correct logic. For example, classical logic holds that the argument from explosion is a valid argument, but in Graham Priest&#x27;s paraconsistent logic—LP, the &#x27;Logic of Paradox&#x27;—it is an invalid argument. However, logical monists may respond that a plurality of logical theories does not mean that no single one of the theories is the correct one. After all, there are and have been a multitude of theories in physics, but that hasn&#x27;t been taken to mean that all of them are correct.

Pluralists of the instrumentalist sort hold if a logic can be correct at all, it based on its ability to answer the logical questions under consideration. If one wants to understand vague propositions, one may need a many-valued logic. Or if one wants to know what the truth-value of the Liar Paradox is, a dialetheic paraconsistent logic may be required. Rudolf Carnap held to a version of logical pluralism:

<doc id="231378" wikidata="Q585727" url="?curid=231378" title="John Birch Society">
<text>The John Birch Society (JBS) is an American right-wing political advocacy group. Founded in 1958, it is anti-communist, supports social conservatism, and is associated with ultraconservative, radical right, far-right, right-wing populist, and right-wing libertarian ideas. Originally based in Belmont, Massachusetts, the JBS is now headquartered in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, with local chapters throughout the United States. It owns American Opinion Publishing, Inc., which publishes the magazine &quot;The New American&quot;, and it is affiliated with an online school called FreedomProject Academy.
The society&#x27;s founder, businessman Robert W. Welch Jr. (1899–1985), developed an organizational infrastructure of nationwide chapters in December 1958. The society rose quickly in membership and influence, and also became known for Welch&#x27;s conspiracy theories. His allegation that Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower was a communist agent was especially controversial. In the 1960s, the conservative William F. Buckley Jr. and &quot;National Review&quot; attempted to shun the JBS to the fringes of the American right. JBS membership is kept private but is said to have neared 100,000 in the 1960s and 1970s, declining afterward.

In the 2010s and 2020s, several observers and commentators argued that, while the organization&#x27;s influence peaked in the 1970s, &quot;Bircherism&quot; and its legacy of conspiracy theories began making a resurgence in the mid-2010s, and had become the dominant strain in the conservative movement. In particular, they argued that the JBS and its beliefs shaped the Republican Party, the Christian right, the Trump administration, and the broader conservative movement.

==Political positions==

The John Birch Society from its start opposed collectivism as a &quot;cancer&quot; and by extension communism and big government. JBS publications referred to the fight against Communism as a spiritual war against the devil. Allegations that so-called &quot;Insiders&quot; have conspired to control the United States through communism and world government are a recurring theme of JBS publications. The organization and its founder, Robert W. Welch Jr., promoted Americanism as &quot;the philosophical antithesis of Communism.&quot; It contended that the United States is a republic, not a democracy, and argued that states&#x27; rights should supersede those of the federal government. Welch infused constitutionalist and classical liberal principles, in addition to his conspiracy theories, into the JBS&#x27;s ideology and rhetoric. In 1983, Congressman Larry McDonald, then the society&#x27;s newly appointed chairman, characterized the JBS as belonging to the Old Right rather than the New Right.

The society opposes &quot;one world government&quot;, the United Nations (UN), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and other free trade agreements. It argues the U.S. Constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization. It has cited the existence of the former Security and Prosperity Partnership as evidence of a push towards a North American Union. The JBS has sought immigration reduction.

The JBS opposed the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. It has campaigned for state nullification. It opposes efforts to call an Article V convention to amend the U.S. Constitution, and it has been influential at promoting opposition to it among Republican legislators. The JBS also supports auditing and eventually dismantling the Federal Reserve System. The JBS holds that the United States Constitution gives only Congress the ability to coin money, and does not permit it to delegate this power, or to transform the dollar into a fiat currency not backed by gold or silver.

Its publication &quot;The New American&quot; has described what it sees as American moral decline and threats to the family, including abortion, birth control, divorce, drugs, homosexuality, crime, violence, secular humanism, teenage pregnancy, teen suicide, environmentalism, feminism and pornography. The JBS has alleged that moral degeneracy is perpetrated by a conspiracy to make the United States vulnerable to internationalism. A JBS pamphlet distributed in 2024 illustrating a school on fire urged parents to withdraw children from public education, saying, &quot;Reforming the schools is no longer an option. We must get them out now!&quot;

The JBS has been described as ultraconservative, far-right, extremist, and fringe. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the society as a &quot;Patriot&quot; group, a group that &quot;advocate[s] or adhere[s] to extreme antigovernment doctrines&quot;. By the 1990s, the JBS was perceived as &quot;more mainstream conservative&quot; than in the 1960s. It has also been associated with the American libertarian movement, as well as business nationalism. The society&#x27;s worldview was noted in the early 2000s for influencing the American militia movement, although the JBS had not publicly called for paramilitary training. Extremism expert George Michael wrote that &quot;a virtual who&#x27;s who of the American radical right had at one time or another sojourned&quot; in the JBS.

===Influence on conservatism===
The JBS contributed to the development of modern American conservatism through its organizational tactics and its promotion of right-wing political views. Despite never considering itself a religious organization, the JBS played a role in the rise of the Moral Majority and the Christian right as major political forces, ideologically and tactically influencing multiple leaders in that movement including Tim LaHaye and Phyllis Schlafly. Scholar Celestini Carmen argues that LaHaye used the JBS&#x27;s culture war methods and rhetoric of &quot;fear, apocalyptic thought and conspiracy&quot; to forge the Moral Majority, with &quot;fear, anger, and disgust as essential ingredients.&quot; The historian D. J. Mulloy wrote in 2014 that the JBS has served as &quot;a kind of bridge&quot; between the Old Right (including the McCarthyites) of the 1940s50s, the New Right of the 1970s80s, and the Tea Party right of the 21st century.

Professor Edward H. Miller wrote that Welch and the JBS were &quot;never excommunicated&quot; from conservatism and that &quot;the ideas of the John Birch Society paved the way for the conservatism of the twentieth century&quot; and &quot;shaped events in the twenty-first century&quot;. Miller also writes that JBS helped stop the Equal Rights Amendment and helped set the stage for the Reagan Era, while Mulloy writes that the JBS &quot;played an essential role in the revitalization of conservatism&quot; and &quot;trained a generation of conservative activists.&quot; According to Professor Matthew Dallek, modern American conservatism &quot;bear[s] the imprint of the John Birch Society,&quot; and &quot;the GOP has largely replaced the ideological tenets of Reaganism with a worldview inherited from the John Birch Society (JBS).&quot; According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2024, Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 election &quot;saw many of its core instincts finally reflected in the White House,&quot; and the JBS &quot;now fits neatly into the mainstream of the American right.&quot;

JBS took an early stance in opposing abortion and social liberalism, and its TRIM committees, which supported lower taxes, helped lead to the Reagan tax cuts. By the early 2020s, multiple commentators and academics argued that the John Birch Society and its beliefs had successfully taken over the Republican Party and the broader conservative movement. Efforts of Moms for Liberty in the 2020s to influence public education in the United States via school board elections and book bans have been compared to JBS&#x27;s efforts in the 1960s. 
When introducing legislation to withdraw the U.S. from the UN, Senator Mike Lee used &quot;some of the same arguments to support the bill&quot; that the JBS &quot;first employed.&quot; By the 2020s, some national Republican and conservative figures openly associated with the JBS.

==History==
===Origins===
The John Birch Society was established on December 9, 1958, in Indianapolis, Indiana, at the conclusion of a two-day session of a group of 12 people led by Robert W. Welch Jr. Welch was a retired candy manufacturer from Belmont, Massachusetts, who had been a state Republican Party official and had unsuccessfully run in its 1950 lieutenant governor primary. In 1954, Welch wrote the first book about John Birch (an Air Force intelligence officer and Baptist missionary), titled &quot;The Life of John Birch&quot;. He organized an anti-Communist society to &quot;promote less government, more responsibility, and a better world&quot;. He named his new organization in memory of Birch, saying that Birch was an unknown but dedicated anti-Communist, and the first American casualty of the Cold War. Welch alleged that a Communist conspiracy within the American government had suppressed the truth about Birch&#x27;s killing.

====John Birch====

John Birch was an American Baptist who went to China as a missionary in 1940, when the Japanese invasion had created suffering and chaos during the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was a U.S. military intelligence officer under Brigadier General Claire Lee Chennault in China. Chennault commanded the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; and afterwards U.S. Army Air Forces units in China. In April 1942, Birch helped Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle and his flight crew, among other crews, a few days after they bailed out of their B-25 bomber over Japanese-held territory in China. Sixteen B-25s led by Doolittle bombed Tokyo (&quot;Doolittle raid&quot;) off the Navy aircraft carrier &quot;USS Hornet&quot; during the United States&#x27; first attack on Japan. Beginning in July 1942, Birch, who spoke Chinese, became an Army intelligence officer. He operated alone or with Nationalist Chinese soldiers, and regularly risked his life in Japanese-held territory in China. His many activities included setting up Chinese agent and radio intelligence networks, and rescuing downed American pilots; he had two emergency aircraft runways built. Although he suffered from malaria, he refused furloughs.

In 1945, Birch was promoted to captain and began working in China both for and with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the U.S. wartime intelligence service in World War II. In August, after the Japanese surrendered, Birch was ordered by the OSS to northern China to obtain the surrender of the Japanese commanders at their installations. On August 24, nine days after the war, Birch left by train with his party which included two American soldiers, five Chinese officers, and two Koreans who spoke Japanese. After spending a night in a village, the party proceeded by handcar the next morning, and ran into a group of 300 armed Chinese Communists. Birch and his Chinese officer aide approached them and were told to surrender their weapons and the group&#x27;s equipment. Birch refused, and after arguing about it with their commander, they were allowed to proceed. Along the way, Birch&#x27;s party encountered more groups of Communists. The party arrived at a train station at Hwang Kao which was occupied by more Chinese Communists. Birch requested to speak with their leader. Birch and his aide approached the group&#x27;s leader and after Birch refused to give up his sidearm, both were beaten and shot. Birch&#x27;s corpse was bayonetted. The rest of Birch&#x27;s party were taken prisoner. Birch&#x27;s aide survived and the prisoners were later released. Birch&#x27;s remains were recovered, and a Catholic burial service was held with military honors on a hillside outside of Suzhou, in eastern China. The Chinese Communists, who were active in northern China and Manchuria, were supposedly World War II allies with the United States. Birch believed that Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists intended to take over China after the war and move into Korea. There were different explanations and theories as to why Birch was killed, ranging from his party showing up at Hwang Kao instead of Ninchuan, Birch&#x27;s scheduled meeting with Chinese puppet troops of the Sixth Army under General Hu Peng-chu, misunderstanding by local guerillas, and provocation from Birch himself.

====Founding and beliefs====
The founding members of the JBS included Harry Lynde Bradley, co-founder of the Allen Bradley Company and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Fred C. Koch, founder of Koch Industries, and Robert Waring Stoddard, president of Wyman-Gordon, a major industrial enterprise. Another was Revilo P. Oliver, a University of Illinois professor who was later expelled from the Society and helped found the National Alliance. Koch became one of the organization&#x27;s primary financial supporters. According to investigative journalist Jane Mayer, David Koch and Charles Koch, Koch&#x27;s sons, were also members of the JBS; however, both left it before the 1970s. A transcript of Welch&#x27;s two-day presentation at the founding meeting was published as &quot;The Blue Book of the John Birch Society&quot;, and became a cornerstone of its beliefs, with each new prospective member receiving a copy. Welch stated:

 Welch saw collectivism as the main threat to Western culture, and modern American liberals as &quot;secret Communist traitors&quot; who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism, with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a one-world socialist government. He wrote: &quot;There are many stages of welfarism, socialism, and collectivism in general, but Communism is the ultimate state of them all, and they all lead inevitably in that direction.&quot; Welch predicted that &quot;you have only a few more years before the country in which you live will become four separate provinces in a world-wide Communist dominion ruled by police-state methods from the Kremlin.&quot;

The JBS was organized to be, in Welch&#x27;s words, &quot;under completely authoritative control at all levels&quot;. It incorporated aspects of business hierarchies and also the Communist cells Welch opposed but whose discipline he admired. Chapters of 10 to 20 members each had a leader appointed from above, and were expected to meet twice a month. Members of chapters that grew larger than 20 members were expected to break off and form a new small chapter.

The activities of the JBS include distributing literature, pamphlets, magazines, videos and other material; the society also sponsors a Speaker&#x27;s Bureau, which invites &quot;speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy&quot;. One of the first public activities of the society was a &quot;Get US Out!&quot; (of membership in the UN) campaign, which claimed in 1959 that the &quot;Real nature of [the] UN is to build a One World Government&quot;. The society also alleged that Communists and UN supporters were conducting an &quot;assault on Christmas&quot; to &quot;destroy all religious beliefs and customs&quot;. In 1960, Welch advised JBS members to: &quot;Join your local P.T.A. at the beginning of the school year, get your conservative friends to do likewise, and go to work to take it over.&quot; &quot;One Man&#x27;s Opinion&quot;, a magazine launched by Welch in 1956, was renamed &quot;American Opinion&quot;. In 1965, Welch established a JBS-affiliated publication known as &quot;The Review of the News&quot;, which was intended for a larger readership and covered news. In 1985, these magazines merged into &quot;The New American&quot;, a biweekly magazine published by the Society.

===Eisenhower issue===
For the first eighteen months of its existence, JBS &quot;operated in relative obscurity&quot;. Then in July 1960, the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; published a relatively in-depth story on the Society, including the contention of founder Robert Welch, that President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a &quot;dedicated, conscious agent&quot; of the communist conspiracy in the United States. &quot;For the next few years Birchers found themselves at the center of a storm of controversy&quot;.

Welch had first made the statement in 1954 when he wrote in a widely circulated statement, &quot;The Politician&quot;: &quot;Could Eisenhower really be simply a smart politician, entirely without principles and hungry for glory, who is only the tool of the Communists? The answer is yes.&quot; He went on: &quot;With regard to ... Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.&quot; The controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of &quot;The Politician&quot;.

The sensationalism of Welch&#x27;s charges against Eisenhower prompted several conservatives and Republicans, most prominently Goldwater and the intellectuals of William F. Buckley&#x27;s circle, to renounce outright or quietly shun the group. Buckley, an early friend and admirer of Welch, regarded his accusations against Eisenhower as &quot;paranoid and idiotic libels&quot; and attempted unsuccessfully to purge Welch from the Birch Society. From then on, Buckley became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives. Buckley&#x27;s biographer, John B. Judis, wrote that &quot;Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism &quot;National Review&quot; had promoted.&quot; Despite Buckley&#x27;s opposition, the author Edward H. Miller wrote, the JBS &quot;remained a force in the conservative movement&quot;, and arguments to the contrary are &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot;.

The booklet found support from Ezra Taft Benson, then Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of Agriculture and later the 13th president of the LDS Church. In a letter to his friend FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, Benson asked &quot;how can a man [Eisenhower] who seems to be so strong for Christian principles and base American concepts be so effectively used as a tool to serve the Communist conspiracy?&quot; Benson privately fought to prevent the Bureau from condemning the JBS, which prompted Hoover to distance himself from Benson. At one point in 1971, Hoover directed his staff to lie to Benson to avoid having to meet with him about the issue.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, the JBS became known as a right-wing organization with an anti-Communist ideology. It was moderately active in that decade with numerous chapters, but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives. It was rejected by most conservatives because of Welch&#x27;s conspiracy theories. The philosopher Ayn Rand said in a 1964 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview: &quot;I consider the Birch Society futile, because they are not for capitalism but merely against Communism ... I gather they believe that the disastrous state of today&#x27;s world is caused by a Communist conspiracy. This is childishly naïve and superficial. No country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy, it can be destroyed only by ideas.&quot; Some historians said the JBS had a large role in 1960s politics, and functioned much like a third party, forcing &quot;the GOP, the Democrats, and conservatives of all types to respond to its agenda&quot;, in Jonathan M. Schoenwald&#x27;s words.

By March 1961, the JBS had 60,000 to 100,000 members and, according to Welch, &quot;a staff of 28 people in the Home Office; about 30 Coordinators (or Major Coordinators) in the field, who are fully paid as to salary and expenses; and about 100 Coordinators (or Section Leaders as they are called in some areas), who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary, or expenses, or both&quot;. According to Political Research Associates (a non-profit research group that investigates the far-right), the society &quot;pioneered grassroots lobbying, combining educational meetings, petition drives and letter-writing campaigns. Rick Perlstein described its main activity in the 1960s as &quot;monthly meetings to watch a film by Welch, followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the Communist menace&quot;.

One early campaign against the second summit between the United States and the Soviet Union (which urged President Dwight D. Eisenhower, &quot;If you go, don&#x27;t come back!&quot;) generated over 600,000 postcards and letters, according to the society. In 1961 Welch offered $2,300 in prizes to college students for the best essays on &quot;grounds of impeachment&quot; of Chief Justice Warren, a prime target of ultra-conservatives. A June 1964 society campaign to oppose Xerox corporate sponsorship of TV programs favorable to the UN produced 51,279 letters from 12,785 individuals.&quot; By the middle of the decade, it had 400 American Opinion bookstores selling its literature.

In 1962, William F. Buckley Jr., editor of the &quot;National Review&quot;, an influential conservative magazine, denounced Welch and the John Birch Society as &quot;far removed from common sense&quot; and urged the GOP to purge itself of Welch&#x27;s influence. In the late 1960s, Welch insisted that the Lyndon B. Johnson administration&#x27;s war against Communist guerillas and North Vietnamese troops during the Vietnam War, which was unpopular among liberals and leftists but not among conservatives, was part of a Communist plot aimed at taking over the United States. Welch demanded that the United States get out of Vietnam, thus aligning the JBS with the left. The society opposed water fluoridation, which it called &quot;mass medicine&quot; and a Communist effort to destroy American children.

Former Eisenhower cabinet member Ezra Taft Benson—a leading Mormon—spoke in favor of the JBS. In January 1963, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement distancing itself from the Society. Antisemitic, racist, anti-Mormon, anti-Masonic groups criticized the organization&#x27;s acceptance of Jews, non-whites, Masons, and Mormons as members. These opponents accused Welch of harboring feminist, ecumenical, and evolutionary ideas. Welch rejected these accusations by his detractors: &quot;All we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the Communists, and eventually destroying the whole Communist conspiracy, so that Jews and Christians alike, and Mohammedans and Buddhists, can again have a decent world in which to live.&quot;

In a 1963 report, the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities, following an investigation into the JBS, found no evidence it was &quot;a secret, fascist, subversive, un-American, [or] anti-Semitic organization.&quot; In 1964, Welch favored Barry Goldwater for the Republican presidential nomination, but the membership split, with two-thirds supporting Goldwater and one-third supporting Richard Nixon, who did not run. A number of Birch members and their allies were Goldwater supporters in 1964 and a hundred of them were delegates at the 1964 Republican National Convention.

In April 1966, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article on New Jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for &quot;the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government, libraries, school boards, parent-teacher associations, mental health programs, the Republican Party and, most recently, the ecumenical movement.&quot; It then characterized the society as &quot;by far the most successful and &#x27;respectable&#x27; radical right organization in the country. It operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation, like that of the Birchers, is the internal Communist conspiracy in the United States.&quot; The JBS also opposed the creation of the first sex education curriculum in the United States through a division called the Movement to Restore Decency (MOTOREDE). Surviving MOTOREDE pamphlets date from 1967 to 1971. Additionally, the JBS advocated against other manifestations of social liberalism, including abortion. JBS members and activities were featured in &quot;The Radical Americans&quot;, a series produced by National Educational Television (NET) and WGBH-TV that aired in 1966 on NET outlets. JBS membership peaked in 1965 or 1966 at an estimated 100,000.

The JBS opposed the 1960s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had Communists in important positions. In the latter half of 1965, the JBS produced a flyer titled &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Civil Rights?&quot; and used the flyer as a newspaper advertisement. In the piece, one of the answers was: &quot;For the civil rights movement in the United States, with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness, and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war, has not been &quot;infiltrated&quot; by the Communists, as you now frequently hear. It has been deliberately and almost wholly &quot;created&quot; by the Communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years.&quot; The society believed that the ultimate aim of the civil rights movement was the creation of a &quot;Soviet Negro Republic&quot; in the southeastern United States and opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming it violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and overstepped individual states&#x27; rights to enact laws regarding civil rights. Some prominent black conservatives such as George Schuyler and Manning Johnson joined forces with the JBS during this period and echoed the Society&#x27;s rhetoric about the civil-rights movement and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Although Welch and the JBS publicly opposed racism and anti-Semitism, and had a policy of expelling individuals who held such views, in 1968, a notable faction of JBS members expressed opposition towards desegregation efforts and demonstrated solidarity with white nationalists by supporting George Wallace. Both the SPLC and the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith have ascertained the existence in the past of antisemitic and racist elements, such as Revilo P. Oliver and Eric D. Butler. Many of these individuals later left or were expelled from the JBS because of these views. The JBS launched a &quot;Support Your Local Police&quot; campaign in the mid-1960s. The campaign openly advocated against the use of federal officers to enforce civil rights laws.

===1970s===
By 1976, the JBS had 90,000 members, 240 paid staffers, and a $7 million annual budget according to a paper written by the American libertarian conservative tycoon Charles Koch.

The JBS was at the center of a free-speech law case in the 1970s, after &quot;American Opinion&quot; accused a Chicago lawyer, Elmer Gertz, who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer, of being part of a Communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force. The resulting libel suit, &quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.&quot;, reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that a state may allow a private figure such as Gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice, according to the standard laid out in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages. The court ordered a retrial in which Gertz prevailed.

Key causes of the JBS in the 1970s included opposition to both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The JBS claimed that Nixon&#x27;s visit to mainland China had &quot;humiliated the American people and betrayed our anti-communist allies&quot; and that it was the primary supplier of illicit heroin into the United States. The society also was opposed to transferring control of the Panama Canal from American to Panamanian sovereignty.

During the 1970s, the Kuomintang in the Republic of China under Executive Yuan Premier Chiang Ching-kuo organized a people&#x27;s diplomacy campaign in the United States in an effort to mobilize American political sentiment in opposition to the PRC through mass demonstrations and petitions. Among these efforts, the John Birch Society worked with the KMT on a petition writing campaign through which Americans were urged to write their local government officials and ask them to &quot;Cut the Red China connection.&quot;

The John Birch Society, along with other conservative groups such as the Eagle Forum and the Christian right, successfully opposed the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. JBS played a key role in stopping the ERA&#x27;s ratification – on par with Phyllis Schlafly, herself a JBS member – and it organized opposition to it across the nation. JBS accused the ERA&#x27;s supporters of subversion, asserting that the ERA was part of a Communist plot &quot;to reduce human beings to living at the same level as animals.&quot;

The JBS advocated for lower taxes, including reducing the federal income tax rate. By 1977, it had established over 200 TRIM (Tax Relief Immediately) committees across the U.S. In the 1970s, the JBS also played a prominent role in promoting the false claim that laetrile was a cancer cure, and in advocating for the legalization of the compound as a drug. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review in 1977 found JBS and other far-right groups were involved in pro-laetrile campaigns in at least nine states. &quot;Virtually all&quot; of the officers of the &quot;Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy,&quot; the leading pro-laetrile group, were JBS members. Congressman and Birch Society leader Lawrence P. McDonald was involved in the campaign as a member of the committee. The JBS opposed Earth Day, suggesting that it was a Communist plot and noting that the first celebration fell on the 100th anniversary of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s birth.

The JBS was organized into local chapters during this period. Ernest Brosang, a New Jersey regional coordinator, claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policy-making levels, thereby protecting it from &quot;anti-American&quot; takeover attempts. Its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation, warnings over the influence of the United Nations, and the release of petitions to impeach United States Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren. To spread their message, members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;, a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages.

===1980s and 1990s===

After the Vietnam War, the JBS&#x27;s membership and influence declined. This decline continued through the 1980s and 1990s due to Welch&#x27;s death in 1985 (at age 85) and the end of the Cold War in 1991. By the mid-1990s, membership in the JBS was estimated between 15,000 and 20,000. While other anti-Communist organizations faded away following the Cold War&#x27;s end, the JBS survived and experienced some growth in the 1990s. News reports said President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s invocation of a &quot;new world order&quot; during the 1991 Gulf War gave the society a new audience. The society consolidated its national office in Appleton, Wisconsin, the birthplace of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

In 1984, three members of the San Diego Padres, namely Eric Show, Mark Thurmond, and Dave Dravecky, revealed they were members of the JBS. The society campaigned against the ratification of the Genocide Convention, arguing it would erode U.S. national sovereignty. The JBS continued to press for an end to United States membership in the United Nations. As evidence of its effectiveness, the society pointed to the Utah State Legislature&#x27;s failed resolution calling for United States withdrawal, as well as the actions of several other states where the society&#x27;s membership was active.

The second head of the JBS was Congressman Larry McDonald (D) from Georgia. McDonald&#x27;s first wife &quot;estimated that, over the years, he had hosted 10,000 people in his living room for Bircher-inspired lectures and documentaries.&quot; In 1982, McDonald was appointed as national chairman of the Society. McDonald was killed in 1983 when airliner KAL 007 was shot down by a Soviet interceptor.

William P. Hoar, a writer for the JBS who has attacked mainstream politicians from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush, published regularly in &quot;The New American&quot; and its predecessor &quot;American Opinion.&quot; He coauthored &quot;The Clinton Clique&quot; with Larry Abraham alleging that Bill Clinton was part of the Anglo-American conspiracy supposedly ruled through the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. The Birch Society publications arm, Western Islands, published his &quot;Architects of Conspiracy: An Intriguing History&quot; (1984), and Huntington House Publishers published his &quot;Handouts and Pickpockets: Our Government Gone Berserk&quot; (1996).

In 1995, the JBS campaigned against plans for a Conference of States; proponents said such a conference would reduce federal powers. The JBS feared it would lead to a second Constitutional Convention.

=== 2000–present ===
In the mid-2000s, the JBS, along with the Eagle Forum, mobilized conservative opposition to a so-called North American Union and the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America. As a result of two organizations&#x27; activities, 23 state legislatures saw bills introduced condemning an NAU while the Bush and Obama administrations were deterred &quot;from any grand initiatives.&quot; In 2007, &quot;The New American&quot; published a special issue devoted to the topic; approximately 500,000 copies were distributed. The JBS also advocated for U.S. withdrawal from the UN. The JBS was a co-sponsor of the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), ending its decades-long distance from the mainstream conservative movement. It attended CPAC again in 2023 and 2024.

Although JBS membership numbers are kept private, it reported a resurgence of members in the 2010s and 2020s, specifically in Texas. A 2017 article in &quot;Politico&quot; describing the group&#x27;s activities in Texas listed some of its stances as opposing the UN&#x27;s Agenda 21 based on a conspiracy theory that it will &quot;establish control over all human activity&quot;, opposing a bill that would allow people who entered the United States illegally to pay in-state college tuition, pulling the United States out of NAFTA, returning America to what the group calls its Christian foundations, and abolishing the federal departments of education and energy. In 2012, the Tennessee House of Representatives passed an anti-Agenda 21 resolution with nearly identical wording as a JBS model resolution.

With Donald Trump&#x27;s election in 2016, the JBS &quot;saw many of its core instincts finally reflected in the White House.&quot; Political commentator Jeet Heer argued in 2016 that &quot;Trumpism&quot; is essentially Bircherism, and journalist Andrew Reinbach called the JBS &quot;the intellectual seed bank of the right.&quot; Trump confidant and longtime advisor Roger Stone said that Trump&#x27;s father Fred Trump was a financier of the JBS and a personal friend of founder Robert Welch. Trump&#x27;s former Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was the speaker at the John Birch Society&#x27;s National Council dinner shortly before joining the Trump administration. Former Congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas) has had a long and close relationship with the JBS, celebrating its work in his 2008 keynote speech at its 50th anniversary event and saying that the JBS was leading the fight to restore freedom. The keynote speaker at the organization&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebration was Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who maintained a near-perfect score on the JBS&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Index&quot; ranking of members of Congress. Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who hosted Trump on his &quot;InfoWars&quot; radio show and claimed to have a personal relationship with the president, called Trump a &quot;John Birch Society president&quot;, and previously said Trump was &quot;more John Birch Society than the John Birch Society.&quot; Former JBS CEO Arthur R. Thompson stated, &quot;The bulk of Trump’s campaign was Birch&quot;. Trump&#x27;s talk of a deep state has been described as &quot;repeating a longtime Birch talking point.&quot; In July 2021, the Republican central committees of Kootenai County, Idaho, and Benewah County, Idaho, unanimously approved resolutions calling JBS &quot;a valuable organization that is dedicated to restoring the Republic according to the vision of the Founding Fathers.&quot; The Idaho Republican Party declined to endorse the resolutions, though the party elected a JBS member, Dorothy Moon, as chair in July 2022. The JBS had been active in Idaho.

In the early 2020s, the JBS campaigned against carbon-capture pipelines in Iowa, arguing they threatened property rights. The JBS is affiliated with FreedomProject Academy, an online school &quot;based on Judeo-Christian values.&quot; Between 2011 and 2020, its enrollment grew from 22 to 1,000 students. The JBS publishes the Freedom Index, which rates members of Congress and state legislators &quot;based on their adherence to constitutional principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, national sovereignty and a traditional foreign policy of avoiding foreign entanglements.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Pete Seeger lampooned the John Birch Society with a song called &quot;The Jack Ash Society&quot;, recorded on his 1961 Folkways Records LP album &quot;Gazette Vol. 2&quot;. The name is a pun. On the surface, it changes the name from one type of tree, birch to another, ash. However, the name &quot;Jack Ash&quot; also sounds like the word meaning &#x27;a foolish person&#x27;.
* In 1962, Bob Dylan recorded &quot;Talkin&#x27; John Birch Paranoid Blues&quot;, which poked fun at the society and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations. When he attempted to perform it on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1963, however, CBS&#x27;s Standards and Practices department forbade it, fearing that lyrics equating the Society&#x27;s views with those of Adolf Hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit. Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice he would rather not appear at all. The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; Sullivan denounced the network&#x27;s decision in published interviews.
* &quot;Pogo&quot; cartoonist Walt Kelly lampooned the American anti-Communist movement, and the John Birch Society in particular, in a series of strips collected in 1962 in &quot;The Jack Acid Society Black Book&quot;.
* In 1962 The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded a satirical song, &quot;The John Birch Society&quot;, which made its way to no. 99 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
* When jazz trumpeter John Birks &quot;Dizzy&quot; Gillespie launched a joke presidential campaign in 1963, fans created a &quot;John Birks Society&quot; to campaign for him.
* In the 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, a deranged U.S. Air Force general claims that water fluoridation would &quot;sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids&quot; and is part of a communist conspiracy, a parody of JBS claims.
* The 1973 song &quot;Uneasy Rider&quot; by Charlie Daniels contains a reference to &quot;Brother John Birch&quot; in the lyrics.
* In 2020, American journalist Robert Evans released a multi-part series on his podcast &quot;Behind the Bastards&quot; entitled &quot;How The John Birch Society Invented the Modern Far Right&quot;.

<doc id="231384" wikidata="Q7907894" url="?curid=231384" title="Vacated judgment">
<text>A vacated judgment (also known as vacatur relief) is a legal judgment that legally voids a previous legal judgment. A vacated judgment is usually the result of the judgment of an appellate court, which overturns, reverses, or sets aside the judgment of a lower court. An appellate court may also vacate its own decisions. Rules of procedure may allow vacatur either at the request of a party (a motion to vacate) or &quot;sua sponte&quot; (at the court&#x27;s initiative).

A vacated judgment may free the parties to civil litigation to re-litigate the issues subject to the vacated judgment.

Another means of having a vacated judgment would be if the defendant dies prior to all appeals being exhausted. Notable defendants having their convictions vacated under this include Kenneth Lay, the former Chairman and CEO of Enron who died before sentencing, and Aaron Hernandez, a former football player who killed himself in jail before his appeals were exhausted. In the latter case, the vacatur was itself later overturned.

==United States==
&quot;Relief from judgment&quot; of a United States District Court is governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has noted that a vacated judgment &quot;place[s] the parties in the position of no trial having taken place at all; thus a vacated judgment is of no further force or effect.&quot;
One form of a vacatur in the United States legal system was established by &quot;United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.&quot; , otherwise known as the &quot;Munsingwear&quot; vacatur. This approach is used when while a case is being held on appeal, whether at the Circuit Court or Supreme Court level, underlying factors make the case moot. The higher court will vacate the lower court&#x27;s ruling, send the case back to the lower court, and have them render the case moot. Certain conditions must be met before the higher court can give a &quot;Munsingwear&quot; vacatur, generally allowing this vacatur to be used in three situations: in the matter of &quot;happenstance&quot; (such as the death of a litigant), through a settlement of the parties, or a unilateral action by the prevailing party in the lower court.

<text>The navel (clinically known as the umbilicus; : umbilici or umbilicuses; commonly known as the belly button or tummy button) is a protruding, flat, or hollowed area on the abdomen at the attachment site of the umbilical cord.

==Structure==

The umbilicus is used to visually separate the abdomen into quadrants.

The umbilicus is a prominent scar on the abdomen, with its position being relatively consistent among humans. The skin around the waist at the level of the umbilicus is supplied by the tenth thoracic spinal nerve (T10 dermatome). The umbilicus itself typically lies at a vertical level corresponding to the junction between the L3 and L4 vertebrae, with a normal variation among people between the L3 and L5 vertebrae.

Parts of the adult navel include the &quot;umbilical cord remnant&quot; or &quot;umbilical tip&quot;, which is the often protruding scar left by the detachment of the umbilical cord. This is located in the center of the navel, sometimes described as the &quot;belly button&quot;. Around the cord remnant is the &quot;umbilical collar&quot;, formed by the dense fibrous umbilical ring. Surrounding the umbilical collar is the periumbilical skin. Directly behind the navel is a thick fibrous cord formed from the umbilical cord, called the urachus, which originates from the bladder.

The belly button is unique to each individual due to it being a scar, and various general forms have been classified by medical practitioners.

*Outie: A navel consisting of the umbilical tip protruding past the periumbilical skin is an outie. Essentially any navel which is not concave.
**Swirly/spiral: A rare form in which the umbilical cord scar forms a swirl shape.
**Split: The protruding umbilical cord scar extends outwards, but is cleft in two by a fissure which extends part or all the way through the umbilical cord scar. This form is similar in appearance to a coffee bean.
**Protrusion: The umbilical cord remnant is completely divulged, exposing the full umbilical scar.
**Circlet: Although the entirety of the umbilical cord remnant sits out with the umbilical collar, the centre of the knot is inset by a deep fissure. Unlike a split outie, in this form the fissure is contained centrally and does not extend past the umbilical cord remnant in any direction, much akin to a &#x27;donut&#x27; shape.
*Innie: A navel in which the umbilical tip does not protrude past the periumbilical skin. Any navel which is concave.
**Round: Round navels are completely circular with no hooding.
**Vertical: Some navels present in the form of a more elongate hollow parallel with the linea alba.
**Oval: This form consists of three variants; superior hooding, inferior hooding, no hooding.
**T-shaped: As the name states, the scar is in the shape of a T, and may have superior hooding to various extent.
**Horizontal: The scar is the least visible, as the natural lines of the tendinous intersection fold over the scar.
*Distorted: Any navel which does not fit well into any of the other categories.

==Clinical significance==
===Disorders===
Outies are sometimes mistaken for umbilical hernias; however, they are a completely different shape with no health concern, unlike an umbilical hernia. The navel (specifically abdominal wall) would be considered an umbilical hernia if the protrusion were 5 centimeters or more. The diameter of an umbilical hernia is usually 1/2-inch or more. While the shape of the human navel may be affected by long term changes to diet and exercise, unexpected change in shape may be the result of ascites. 

In addition to change in shape being a possible side effect from ascites and umbilical hernias, the navel can be involved in umbilical sinus or fistula, which in rare cases can lead to menstrual or fecal discharge from the navel. Menstrual discharge from the umbilicus is a rare disorder associated with umbilical endometriosis.

===Other disorders===
*Omphalitis, an inflammatory condition of the umbilicus in the newborn, usually caused by a bacterial infection.
* Omphalophobia is the fear of belly buttons. People suffering from omphalophobia are terrified of belly buttons—their own or, in some cases, those of others. They do not like touching their belly buttons (or even other people touching it). Sometimes just seeing a belly button is enough to make them feel disgusted or terrified.

===Surgery===
To minimize scarring, the navel is a recommended site of incision for various surgeries, including transgastric appendicectomy, gall bladder surgery, and the umbilicoplasty procedure itself.

==Other animals==
All placental mammals have a navel, although it is generally more conspicuous in humans.

==Fashion, society and culture==
The public exposure of the male and female midriff and bare navel was considered taboo at times in the past in Western cultures, being considered immodest or indecent. Female navel exposure was banned in some jurisdictions, but community perceptions have changed to this now being acceptable. The crop top is a shirt that often exposes the belly button and has become more common among young people. Exposure of the male navel has rarely been stigmatised and has become particularly popular in recent years, due to the strong resurgence of the male crop top and male navel piercing. The navel and midriff are often also displayed in bikinis, or when low-rise pants are worn.

While the West was relatively resistant to navel-baring clothing until the 1980s, it has long been a fashion with Indian women, often displayed with saris or lehengas.

The Japanese have long had a special regard for the navel. During the early Jōmon period in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolized the center where life began.

In Arabic-Levantine culture, belly dancing is a popular art form that consists of dance movements focused on the torso and navel.

Buddhism and Hinduism refer to the chakra of the navel as the manipura. In qigong, the navel is seen as the main energy centre, or dantian. In Hinduism, the Kundalini energy is sometimes described as being located at the navel.

<text>The modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) is a transform based on the type-IV discrete cosine transform (DCT-IV), with the additional property of being lapped: it is designed to be performed on consecutive blocks of a larger dataset, where subsequent blocks are overlapped so that the last half of one block coincides with the first half of the next block. This overlapping, in addition to the energy-compaction qualities of the DCT, makes the MDCT especially attractive for signal compression applications, since it helps to avoid artifacts stemming from the block boundaries. As a result of these advantages, the MDCT is the most widely used lossy compression technique in audio data compression. It is employed in most modern audio coding standards, including MP3, Dolby Digital (AC-3), Vorbis (Ogg), Windows Media Audio (WMA), ATRAC, Cook, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), High-Definition Coding (HDC), LDAC, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H 3D Audio, as well as speech coding standards such as AAC-LD (LD-MDCT), G.722.1, G.729.1, CELT, and Opus.

The discrete cosine transform (DCT) was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, and demonstrated by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. The MDCT was later proposed by John P. Princen, A.W. Johnson and Alan B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987, following earlier work by Princen and Bradley (1986) to develop the MDCT&#x27;s underlying principle of time-domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC), described below. (There also exists an analogous transform, the MDST, based on the discrete sine transform, as well as other, rarely used, forms of the MDCT based on different types of DCT or DCT/DST combinations.)

In MP3, the MDCT is not applied to the audio signal directly, but rather to the output of a 32-band polyphase quadrature filter (PQF) bank. The output of this MDCT is postprocessed by an alias reduction formula to reduce the typical aliasing of the PQF filter bank. Such a combination of a filter bank with an MDCT is called a &quot;hybrid&quot; filter bank or a &quot;subband&quot; MDCT. AAC, on the other hand, normally uses a pure MDCT; only the (rarely used) MPEG-4 AAC-SSR variant (by Sony) uses a four-band PQF bank followed by an MDCT. Similar to MP3, ATRAC uses stacked quadrature mirror filters (QMF) followed by an MDCT.

== Definition ==

As a lapped transform, the MDCT is somewhat unusual compared to other Fourier-related transforms in that it has half as many outputs as inputs (instead of the same number). In particular, it is a linear function formula_1 (where R denotes the set of real numbers). The 2&quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;x&quot;0, ..., &quot;x&quot;2&quot;N&quot;-1 are transformed into the &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;X&quot;0, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot;-1 according to the formula:

:formula_2

(The normalization coefficient in front of this transform, here unity, is an arbitrary convention and differs between treatments. Only the product of the normalizations of the MDCT and the IMDCT, below, is constrained.)

=== Inverse transform ===

The inverse MDCT is known as the IMDCT. Because there are different numbers of inputs and outputs, at first glance it might seem that the MDCT should not be invertible. However, perfect invertibility is achieved by &quot;adding&quot; the overlapped IMDCTs of subsequent overlapping blocks, causing the errors to &quot;cancel&quot; and the original data to be retrieved; this technique is known as &quot;time-domain aliasing cancellation&quot; (TDAC).

The IMDCT transforms &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;X&quot;0, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot;-1 into 2&quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;y&quot;0, ..., &quot;y&quot;2&quot;N&quot;-1 according to the formula:

:formula_3

(Like for the DCT-IV, an orthogonal transform, the inverse has the same form as the forward transform.)

In the case of a windowed MDCT with the usual window normalization (see below), the normalization coefficient in front of the IMDCT should be multiplied by 2 (i.e., becoming 2/&quot;N&quot;).

=== Computation ===

Although the direct application of the MDCT formula would require O(&quot;N&quot;2) operations, it is possible to compute the same thing with only O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) complexity by recursively factorizing the computation, as in the fast Fourier transform (FFT). One can also compute MDCTs via other transforms, typically a DFT (FFT) or a DCT, combined with O(&quot;N&quot;) pre- and post-processing steps. Also, as described below, any algorithm for the DCT-IV immediately provides a method to compute the MDCT and IMDCT of even size.

== Window functions ==

In typical signal-compression applications, the transform properties are further improved by using a window function &quot;w&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; = 0, ..., 2&quot;N&quot;−1) that is multiplied with &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the MDCT and with &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the IMDCT formulas, above, in order to avoid discontinuities at the &quot;n&quot; = 0 and 2&quot;N&quot; boundaries by making the function go smoothly to zero at those points. (That is, the window function is applied to the data &quot;before&quot; the MDCT or &quot;after&quot; the IMDCT.) In principle, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; could have different window functions, and the window function could also change from one block to the next (especially for the case where data blocks of different sizes are combined), but for simplicity we consider the common case of identical window functions for equal-sized blocks.

The transform remains invertible (that is, TDAC works), for a symmetric window &quot;w&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;w&quot;2&quot;N&quot;−1−&quot;n&quot;, as long as &quot;w&quot; satisfies the Princen-Bradley condition: 

:formula_4.

Various window functions are used. A window that produces a form known as a modulated lapped transform (MLT) is given by

:formula_5

and is used for MP3 and MPEG-2 AAC, and 

:formula_6

for Vorbis. AC-3 uses a Kaiser–Bessel derived (KBD) window, and MPEG-4 AAC can also use a KBD window.

Note that windows applied to the MDCT are different from windows used for some other types of signal analysis, since they must fulfill the Princen–Bradley condition. One of the reasons for this difference is that MDCT windows are applied twice, for both the MDCT (analysis) and the IMDCT (synthesis).

== Relationship to DCT-IV and Origin of TDAC ==

As can be seen by inspection of the definitions, for even &quot;N&quot; the MDCT is essentially equivalent to a DCT-IV, where the input is shifted by &quot;N&quot;/2 and two &quot;N&quot;-blocks of data are transformed at once. By examining this equivalence more carefully, important properties like TDAC can be easily derived.

In order to define the precise relationship to the DCT-IV, one must realize that the DCT-IV corresponds to alternating even/odd boundary conditions: even at its left boundary (around &quot;n&quot; = −1/2), odd at its right boundary (around &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1/2), and so on (instead of periodic boundaries as for a DFT). This follows from the identities formula_7 and formula_8. Thus, if its inputs are an array &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;N&quot;, we can imagine extending this array to (&quot;x&quot;, −&quot;x&quot;&quot;R&quot;, −&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;R&quot;, ...) and so on, where &quot;x&quot;&quot;R&quot; denotes &quot;x&quot; in reverse order.

Consider an MDCT with 2&quot;N&quot; inputs and &quot;N&quot; outputs, where we divide the inputs into four blocks (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) each of size &quot;N&quot;/2. If we shift these to the right by &quot;N&quot;/2 (from the +&quot;N&quot;/2 term in the MDCT definition), then (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) extend past the end of the &quot;N&quot; DCT-IV inputs, so we must &quot;fold&quot; them back according to the boundary conditions described above.

:Thus, the MDCT of 2&quot;N&quot; inputs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) is &quot;exactly&quot; equivalent to a DCT-IV of the &quot;N&quot; inputs: (−&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;−&quot;d&quot;, &quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;), where &quot;R&quot; denotes reversal as above.

(In this way, any algorithm to compute the DCT-IV can be trivially applied to the MDCT.)

Similarly, the IMDCT formula above is precisely 1/2 of the DCT-IV (which is its own inverse), where the output is extended (via the boundary conditions) to a length 2&quot;N&quot; and shifted back to the left by &quot;N&quot;/2. The inverse DCT-IV would simply give back the inputs (−&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;−&quot;d&quot;, &quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;) from above. When this is extended via the boundary conditions and shifted, one obtains:

:IMDCT (MDCT (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)) = (&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;b&quot;−&quot;a&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c&quot;+&quot;d&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;d&quot;+&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;) / 2.

Half of the IMDCT outputs are thus redundant, as &quot;b&quot;−&quot;a&quot;&quot;R&quot; = −(&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;)&quot;R&quot;, and likewise for the last two terms. If we group the input into bigger blocks &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot; of size &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;B&quot; = (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), we can write this result in a simpler way:

:IMDCT (MDCT (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)) = (&quot;A&quot;−&quot;A&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;B&quot;+&quot;B&quot;&quot;R&quot;) / 2

One can now understand how TDAC works. Suppose that one computes the MDCT of the subsequent, 50% overlapped, 2&quot;N&quot; block (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;). The IMDCT will then yield, analogous to the above: (&quot;B&quot;−&quot;B&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;C&quot;+&quot;C&quot;&quot;R&quot;) / 2. When this is added with the previous IMDCT result in the overlapping half, the reversed terms cancel and one obtains simply &quot;B&quot;, recovering the original data.

=== Origin of TDAC ===

The origin of the term &quot;time-domain aliasing cancellation&quot; is now clear. The use of input data that extend beyond the boundaries of the logical DCT-IV causes the data to be &quot;aliased&quot; in the same way that frequencies beyond the Nyquist frequency are aliased to lower frequencies, except that this aliasing occurs in the time domain instead of the frequency domain: we cannot distinguish the contributions of
&quot;a&quot; and of &quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot; to the MDCT of (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), or equivalently, to
the result of
:IMDCT (MDCT (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)) = (&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;b&quot;−&quot;a&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c&quot;+&quot;d&quot;&quot;R&quot;, &quot;d&quot;+&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;) / 2.
The combinations &quot;c&quot;−&quot;d&quot;&quot;R&quot; and so on, have precisely the right signs for the combinations to cancel when they are added.

For odd &quot;N&quot; (which are rarely used in practice), &quot;N&quot;/2 is not an integer so the MDCT is not simply a shift permutation of a DCT-IV. In this case, the additional shift by half a sample means that the MDCT/IMDCT becomes equivalent to the DCT-III/II, and the analysis is analogous to the above.

=== Smoothness and discontinuities ===

We have seen above that the MDCT of 2&quot;N&quot; inputs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) is equivalent to a DCT-IV of the &quot;N&quot; inputs
(−&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;−&quot;d&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;).
The DCT-IV is designed for the
case where the function at the right boundary is odd, and therefore
the values near the right boundary are close to 0. If the input signal is smooth,
this is the case: the rightmost components of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot; are
consecutive in the input sequence (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), and
therefore their difference is small.
Let us look at the middle of the interval:
if we rewrite the above expression as
(−&quot;c&quot;&quot;R&quot;−&quot;d&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;&quot;R&quot;) = (−&quot;d&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)−(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)&quot;R&quot;,
the second term, (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)&quot;R&quot;, gives a smooth
transition in the middle.
However, in the first term, (−&quot;d&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), there is a
potential discontinuity where the right end of
−&quot;d&quot; meets the left end of &quot;a&quot;.
This is the reason for using a window function that reduces the components
near the boundaries of the input sequence (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) towards 0.

=== TDAC for the windowed MDCT ===

Above, the TDAC property was proved for the ordinary MDCT, showing that adding IMDCTs of subsequent blocks in their overlapping half recovers the original data. The derivation of this inverse property for the windowed MDCT is only slightly more complicated.

Consider two overlapping consecutive sets of 2&quot;N&quot; inputs (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) and (&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;), for blocks &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot; of size &quot;N&quot;.
Recall from above that when formula_9 and formula_10 are MDCTed, IMDCTed, and added in their overlapping half, we obtain formula_11, the original data.

Now we suppose that we multiply &quot;both&quot; the MDCT inputs &quot;and&quot; the IMDCT outputs by a window function of length 2&quot;N&quot;. As above, we assume a symmetric window function, which is therefore of the form formula_12 where &quot;W&quot; is a length-&quot;N&quot; vector and &quot;R&quot; denotes reversal as before. Then the Princen-Bradley condition can be written as formula_13, with the squares and additions performed elementwise.

Therefore, instead of MDCTing formula_9, we now MDCT formula_15 (with all multiplications performed elementwise). When this is IMDCTed and multiplied again (elementwise) by the window function, the last-&quot;N&quot; half becomes:
:formula_16.
(Note that we no longer have the multiplication by 1/2, because the IMDCT normalization differs by a factor of 2 in the windowed case.)

Similarly, the windowed MDCT and IMDCT of formula_10 yields, in its first-&quot;N&quot; half:
:formula_18.

When we add these two halves together, we obtain:

:formula_19

recovering the original data.

<text>Thomas Edward Brown (5 May 183029 October 1897), commonly referred to as T. E. Brown, was a late-19th century scholar, schoolmaster, poet, and theologian from the Isle of Man.

Having achieved a double first at Christ Church, Oxford, and election as a fellow of Oriel in April 1854, Brown served first as headmaster of The Crypt School, Gloucester, then as a young master at the recently-founded Clifton College, near Bristol (influencing, among others, poet William Ernest Henley at The Crypt School. Writing throughout his teaching career, Brown developed a poetry corpus—with &quot;Fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le Yarns&quot; (1881), &quot;The Doctor&quot; (1887), &quot;The Manx Witch&quot; (1889), and &quot;Old John&quot; (1893)—of narrative poetry in Anglo-Manx, the historic dialect of English spoken on the Isle of Man that incorporates elements of Manx Gaelic. Retiring in 1892 to concentrate on writing, Brown died in 1897 (age 67), during a visit to Clifton.

==Life==

Brown was born on 5 May 1830 in Douglas, Isle of Man, the sixth of ten children born to Reverend Robert Brown and his wife, Dorothy. His elder brother became the Baptist preacher, pastor and reformer Hugh Stowell Brown (10 August 182324 February 1886). The family relocated to Kirk Braddan when Thomas was two years old.

Brown&#x27;s father is described as a rather &quot;stern, undemonstrative, evangelical preacher&quot;. As Rev. Brown became blind partially, he employed his sons in reading to him from a wide variety of works, excepting novels. Brown educated the boy, assisted by the parish schoolmaster. Young Brown was a shy and timid boy; the family gardener instilled in him a love of nature, and introduced him to Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley Novels. At the age of fifteen, Thomas began attending King William&#x27;s College in Castletown, Isle of Man. It was at this time that he began to write poetry.

Arthur Quiller-Couch writes:
Brown left the Isle soon afterward, c. 1857, to accept the job of headmaster of The Crypt School, in Gloucester, where a commission had, through the hiring and other efforts, been attempting to revive the school. Brown was considered distinguished academically; while his tenure at the school was relatively brief (c. 1857–1863)—he reportedly found the burden of administration at the school intolerable—he had great influence during this period, including on William Ernest Henley with whom he overlapped from 1861 to 1863. Years later, after becoming a successful published poet (e.g., of &quot;Invictus&quot; and other works), Henley would recall Headmaster Brown as a &quot;revelation&quot; and &quot;a man of genius ... the first I&#x27;d ever seen&quot;, and would eulogise him as one &quot;singularly kind … at a moment … I needed kindness even more than I needed encouragement.&quot;

Quiller-Couch continues:

Hence, Brown created a distinct regional poetic form that earned him the appellation of &quot;Manx national poet&quot;.

<text>John Caspar Leyden, M.D., (8 September 1775 – 28 August 1811) was a Scottish indologist.

==Biography==
Leyden was born at Denholm on the River Teviot, not far from Hawick. His father, a shepherd, had contrived to send him to Edinburgh University to study for the ministry. Leyden was a diligent but somewhat haphazard student, apparently reading everything except theology, for which he seems to have had no taste. Though he completed his divinity course, and in 1798 was licensed to preach from the presbytery of St Andrews, it soon became clear that the pulpit was not his vocation.

In 1794, Leyden formed an acquaintance with Dr Robert Anderson, editor of &quot;The British Poets&quot;, and of &quot;The Literary Magazine&quot;. It was Anderson who later introduced him to Dr Alexander Murray, and Murray, probably, who led him to the study of Eastern languages. They became warm friends and generous rivals, though Leyden excelled, perhaps, in the rapid acquisition of new tongues and acquaintance with their literature, while Murray was the more scientific philologist.

Through Anderson also he came to know Richard Heber, by whom he came to the notice of Walter Scott, who was then collecting materials for his &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; (1802). Leyden was admirably fitted for helping in this kind of work, for he was a borderer himself, and an enthusiastic lover of old ballads and folklore. Scott tells how, on one occasion, Leyden walked 40 miles to get the last two verses of a ballad, and returned at midnight, singing it all the way with his loud, harsh voice, to the wonder and consternation of the poet and his household.

Other work on Scottish customs includes the editing of the 16th-century tract &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot;, adding an essay exploring Scottish folk music and customs, printing a volume of Scottish descriptive poems, and nearly finishing his &quot;Scenes of Infancy&quot;, a diffuse poem based on border scenes and traditions. Leyden meanwhile compiled a work on the &quot;Discoveries and Settlements of Europeans in Northern and Western Africa&quot;, suggested by Mungo Park&#x27;s travels, He also made some translations from Persian and Arabic poetry.

At last his friends got him an appointment in India on the medical staff, for which he qualified by a year&#x27;s hard work. In 1803, he sailed for Madras, and took his place in the general hospital there. He was promoted to be naturalist to the commissioners going to survey Mysore, and in 1807, his knowledge of the languages of India procured him an appointment as professor of Hindustani at Calcutta; this he soon after resigned for a judgeship, and that again to be a commissioner in the court of requests in 1805, a post which required a familiarity with several Eastern languages.

In 1811, Leyden joined Lord Minto in the expedition to Java. Having entered a library which was said to contain many Eastern manuscripts, without having the place aired, he was seized with Batavian fever (possibly malaria or dengue) and died, after three days&#x27; illness, on 28 August 1811. He was buried on the island, underneath a small firefly colony, which remains as his tombstone to this day.

Leyden has importance for the Punjab and the Sikh community. Recently surfaced manuscripts in the British Library show he translated Punjabi works into English. These have been commented on and discussed by Sikh historian Gurinder Singh Mann from Leicester, UK. The Panjab Cultural Association created the website www.drleyden.co.uk and a booklet regarding the project in November 2011.

The manuscript of Leyden&#x27;s &quot;Journal of a Tour in the Highlands and Western Islands of Scotland in 1800&quot; was published posthumously in 1903. It was edited, with a comprehensive bibliography of Leyden&#x27;s works and manuscripts, by the antiquary James Sinton.

<doc id="231394" wikidata="Q265424" url="?curid=231394" title="Mitzvah">
<text>In its primary meaning, the Hebrew word  (; , &quot;mīṣvā&quot; , plural &quot;mīṣvōt&quot; ; &quot;commandment&quot;) refers to a commandment from God to be performed as a religious duty. Jewish law () in large part consists of discussion of these commandments. According to religious tradition, there are 613 such commandments.

In its secondary meaning, the word &quot;mitzvah&quot; refers to a deed performed in order to fulfill such a commandment. As such, the term &quot;mitzvah&quot; has also come to express an individual act of human kindness in keeping with the law. The expression includes a sense of heartfelt sentiment beyond mere legal duty, as &quot;you shall love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (Leviticus 19:18).

For some &quot;mitzvot&quot;, the purpose is specified in the Torah; though, the opinions of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek the purpose of the &quot;mitzvot&quot; and those who do not question them. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason for each &quot;mitzvah&quot;, it would help them to observe and perform the &quot;mitzvah&quot;. The latter argue that if the purpose for each &quot;mitzvah&quot; could be determined, people might try to achieve what they see as the ultimate purpose of the &quot;mitzvah&quot;, while rejecting the &quot;mitzvah&quot; itself.

==Hebrew Bible==
The feminine noun &#x27; () occurs over 180 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. The first use is in Genesis where God says that Abraham has &quot;obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments ( &#x27;), my statutes, and my laws&quot;. In the Septuagint the word is usually translated with &quot;entolē&quot; (). In Second Temple period funeral inscriptions the epithet &quot;phil-entolos&quot;, &quot;lover of the commandments&quot;, was sometimes inscribed on Jewish tombs. Other words are also used in Hebrew for commands and statutes; the Ten Commandments (עשרת הדיברות), for example, are the &quot;Ten Words&quot;.

==Enumeration==

Jewish tradition states that there exist 613 commandments. This number does not appear in the Hebrew Bible. The tradition that the number is 613 is first recorded in the 3rd century CE, when Rabbi Simlai claimed it in a sermon, perhaps to make the point that a person should observe the Torah every day with his whole body.

However, this opinion was not universally accepted. Abraham ibn Ezra observed that there were over a thousand divine commandments in the Bible, but fewer than 300 applied to his time. Nachmanides found that the number was in dispute and uncertain. The number 613 is a rabbinical tradition rather than an exact count.

In rabbinic literature there are a number of works, mainly by the Rishonim, that attempt to enumerate 613 commandments. Probably the most famous of these is &quot;Sefer Hamitzvot&quot; by Maimonides.

==Rabbinic mitzvot==

The Biblical mitzvot are referred to in the Talmud as &quot;mitzvot d&#x27;oraita&quot;, translated as &quot;commandments of the Law (Torah)&quot;. In addition, rabbis of later generations decreed a number of additional laws, which are known as rabbinic laws (&quot;mitzvot derabbanan&quot;). Types of rabbinic laws include the &quot;takkanah&quot; and the &quot;gezeirah&quot;.

Medieval rabbis discussed the question of why a Jew should be required to follow rabbinic mitzvot, as they were not commanded by God, but rather by the rabbis. According to Maimonides, one who keeps rabbinic mitzvot is in fact following a Biblical commandment to obey the decisions of the Jewish religious authorities (, ) According to Nahmanides, there is no biblical source for the obligation to keep rabbinic mitzvot.

In addition, many of the specific details of the Biblical mitzvot are only derived via rabbinical application of the Oral Torah (Mishna/Gemarah); for example, the three daily prayers in any language and the recitation of the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-7) twice a day in any language, the binding of the tefillin and the fixing of the mezuzah (Deuteronomy 6:8-9), and the saying of Grace After Meals (Deuteronomy 8:10).

===The seven rabbinic mitzvot===
Seven notable &quot;mitzvot d&#x27;rabbanan&quot; are as follows:
* To recite a blessing for each enjoyment
* To ritually wash the hands before eating bread
* To light Shabbat candles
* To construct an eruv to permit carrying to and within public areas on Shabbat
* To recite the Hallel psalms on holy days
* To light the Hanukkah lights
* To read the Scroll of Esther on Purim

These seven rabbinical commandments are treated like Biblical commandments insofar as, prior to the performance of each, a benediction is recited (&quot;Blessed are You, O our God, King of the universe, Who has commanded us ...&quot;). In gematria, these seven, added to the 613 Biblical commandments, form a total of 620, corresponding to the numerical value of the phrase &quot;Keter Torah&quot; (&quot;The Crown of the Torah&quot;).

==Categories of mitzvot==

The commandments have been divided also into three general categories: mishpatim; edot; and chukim. Mishpatim (&quot;laws&quot;) include commandments that are deemed to be self-evident, such as not to murder and not to steal. Edot (&quot;testimonies&quot;) commemorate important events in Jewish history. For example, the Shabbat is said to testify to the story that Hashem created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day and declared it holy. Chukim (&quot;decrees&quot;) are commandments with no known rationale, and are perceived as pure manifestations of the Divine will.

The commandments are divided into positive (&quot;thou shalt&quot;) and negative (&quot;thou shalt not&quot;) commandments. According to Jewish tradition, the 613 commandments contain 365 negative commandments and 248 positive commandments.

Many commandments concern only special classes of peoplesuch as kings, &quot;Kohanim&quot; (the priesthood), Levites, or Nazaritesor are conditioned by local or temporary circumstances of the Jewish nation, as, for instance, the agricultural, sacrificial, and Levitical laws. Some are sex-dependent: for example, women are exempt from certain time-related commandments (such as &quot;shofar&quot;, &quot;sukkah&quot;, &quot;lulav&quot;, &quot;tzitzit&quot; and &quot;tefillin&quot;).

Three types of negative commandments fall under the self-sacrificial principle &quot;yehareg ve&#x27;al ya&#x27;avor&quot;, meaning &quot;One should let oneself be killed rather than violate it&quot;. These are murder, idolatry, and forbidden sexual relations. For all other commandments, one must violate the commandment if the only alternative is to be killed.

According to Rabbi Ishmael, only the principal commandments were given on Mount Sinai, the remainder having been given in the Tent of Meeting. Rabbi Akiva, on the other hand, was of the opinion that they were all given on Mount Sinai, repeated in the Tent of Meeting, and declared a third time by Moses before his death. According to the Midrash, all divine commandments were given on Mount Sinai, and no prophet could add any new ones.

==Six constant mitzvot==
Out of the 613 Mitzvot mentioned in the Torah, there are six mitzvot which the Sefer Hachinuch calls &quot;constant mitzvot&quot;: &quot;We have six mitzvot which are perpetual and constant, applicable at all times, all the days of our lives&quot;.

# To know God, and that God created all things.
# Not to have any &quot;god(s)&quot; beside God
# To know God&#x27;s Oneness.
# To fear God.
# To love God.
# Not to pursue the passions of your heart and stray after your eyes.

==Mitzvot and Jewish law==

In rabbinic thought, the commandments are usually divided into two major groups, positive commandments (obligations) – [] and negative commandments (prohibitions) – [].

The system describing the practical application of the commandments is known as &quot;Halakha&quot;. &quot;Halakha&quot; is the development of the &quot;mitzvot&quot; as contained in the Written Law (Torah), via discussion and debate in the Oral Law, as recorded in the rabbinic literature of the classical era, especially the Mishnah and the Talmud. The &quot;halakha&quot; dictates and influences a wide variety of behavior of traditionalist Jews.
===Applicability in the messianic age===
The majority view of classical rabbis was that the commandments will still be applicable and in force during the Messianic Age. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified by, or in, the messianic era. Examples of such rabbinic views include:
* that the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years (Malachi 3:4)
* that today we should observe the commandments (Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Avodah Zarah 3a, 4b); because we will not observe them in the world to come (Rashi)
* that in the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)
* that all sacrifices will be annulled in the future (Tanchuma Emor 19, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)
* that God will permit what is now forbidden (Midrash Tehillim, Mizmor 146:5)
* that most mitzvot will no longer be in force (Babylonian Talmud, Niddah 61b and Shabbat 151b).

There is no accepted authoritative answer within Judaism as to which &quot;mitzvot&quot;, if any, would be annulled in the Messianic era. This is a subject of theoretical debate and, not being viewed as an immediately practical question, is usually passed over in favor of answering questions of the practical &quot;halakha&quot;.

<text>Great Baddow is a village and civil parish in the Chelmsford borough of Essex, England. It is close to the city of Chelmsford and, with a population of over 13,000, is one of the largest villages in the country.

==History==
Great Baddow&#x27;s name is believed to have been derived from the River Beadwan, now known as the River Chelmer, which marks the northern boundary of the village. &quot;Beadwan&quot; is thought to be a Celtic word of uncertain meaning, possibly &quot;birch stream&quot; or a reference to the goddess Badb.

In the Saxon period, the manor of Great Baddow was held by the Earls of Mercia and in the 13th century by Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale whose widow launched a legal challenge over its ownership on his death in March 1295. After passing to the Crown, Henry VIII later granted it to Catherine of Aragon. During the reign of Edward VI, it was held by the Paschals, before being sold to J.A. Houblon in 1736.

According to information in the local Church of St Mary, the rebel leader Jack Straw led an ill-fated crowd (the &quot;men of Essex&quot;) from the churchyard to London, in one of the risings in the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt.

In 1731, Jasper Jeffrey founded Great Baddow Free School and, in 1830, two National Schools were built. By 1933, there were 7 daily schools, 2 daily and Sunday schools, and a further 2 boarding schools.

Great Baddow is recorded as having had a population of 1,445 in 1801, a figure that had risen to 2,022 in 1841. White&#x27;s Directory of Essex 1848 reports Great Baddow as being &#x27;one of the handsomest villages in Essex&#x27; having &#x27;many scattered farms and neat houses&#x27;, also noting that it had an annual pleasure fair on 14 May.

William Calcraft, the hangman and a cobbler by trade, was born at Baddow in 1800.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, responsibility for the poor of Great Baddow was removed from the parish and transferred to the Chelmsford Union on 10 August 1835.

The Post Office Directory of Essex 1851, which lists the principal residents and trade persons of the parish of Great Baddow, includes 24 farmers, 8 beer retailers, 4 shoemakers, 3 blacksmith, 2 dressmakers and notes that the vicar is residing in the Vineyards.

The Great Baddow Mast – a former Chain Home radar transmitter tower, originally sited at RAF Canewdon – was moved to the outskirts of Great Baddow at around 1954 and is used by BAE Systems for equipment testing. The last remaining example of a Chain Home tower maintaining its platforms, it was made a listed building by Historic England in October 2019 and given a Grade II status.

In October 2024 Virginia McCullough was sentenced, at Chelmsford Crown Court, to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 36 years. She had previously admitted murdering her parents, between 17 and 20 June 2019, at their home in Pump Hill in the village, and then concealing their bodies in the bedroom wardrobes, while continuing to live at the address for four years.

==Amenities==
In 1967, a fire station was opened in Great Baddow to replace the former station which occupied a converted hut in Brewery Fields, Galleywood; it was once part of the Galleywood race course complex.

Great Baddow has three pubs: the &quot;White Horse&quot;, &quot;Blue Lion&quot; and &quot;The Star&quot;; &quot;The Beehive&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Head&quot; pubs have closed in recent times. There is also a family-run brewery, the Chelmsford Brewing Company. The former Baddow Brewery, previously owned by the Baddow Brewery Co Ltd, built in 1868 and extended in 1878 by George Scamell, is now a Grade II building and houses local businesses. Great Baddow is also home to the Pontlands Park Country Hotel and the Baddow Antique Centre.

The centre of Great Baddow is now a conservation area and contains over 30 listed buildings.

===Development===
During the early part of the 20th century, Great Baddow grew through ribbon development towards Chelmsford and Galleywood. In 1936, Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company opened the Marconi Research Laboratory in Great Baddow (now BAE Systems Applied Intelligence Laboratories), bringing together their various radio, television and telephony research teams in a single location. As the electronics industry developed, the campus expanded during the 1940s and 1950s to include research into radar, general physics, high voltage, vacuum physics and semiconductors. Great Baddow expanded considerably in the 1950s with the construction of Rothmans Estate, which provided housing for workers at Marconi&#x27;s and English Electric Valve Company in Chelmsford. The village has continued to expand over subsequent years.

The Vineyards, in the centre of the old village, was once a Georgian house set in wooded grounds which later became a hotel. It was demolished in the mid-1960s before the advent of conservation legislation, to make way for the construction of the Vineyards shopping centre and later the Marrable House office block, both constructed with a &#x27;scale, form, layout and architecture&#x27; that Chelmsford Council now considers to &#x27;jar with its historic surroundings&#x27;. Despite this, the shopping centre continues to thrive and, since refurbishment in the 2000s, the flats above are highly regarded and sought-after properties. Marrable House, a six-storey office block was described at the time of its construction in 1968 as &quot;one of the worst examples of town and country planning in the country&quot; and subsequently once voted as one of England&#x27;s ugliest buildings, was demolished in the Spring of 2016, and was replaced with a 53-flat development, made up of one to two bedrooms in two buildings, named &quot;Heron Gate&quot;; the development was completed in spring 
2018. A corner of the grounds of the former Vineyards mansion were retained and form a green area to the west of the Vineyards development. A library was also opened on the western edge of the development in September 1981, replacing the former building in Bell Street.

==Geology==
Great Baddow lies to the south east to central Chelmsford, on higher ground that is thought to mark the edge of the main ice mass during the Anglian glaciation. An outcrop of glacial sand and gravel 3 km long and 0.8 km wide is beneath the village, which used to be extracted from several pits in the area, including Beehive Pit (now beneath Harbeard Tye), Baddow Hall Pit (now beneath Baden-Powell Close), to the south of the A1114 Princes Road (now in the grounds of Moulsham High School) and on what is now an area of open land off Waterson Vale. Smaller pits were also located off the Galleywood Road (near what is now Hollywood Close) and off Pitt Chase. The area is overlain with head, while the lower levels of the sand and gravel are mixed with London Clay. A Sarsen stone from the Beehive Pit used to stand outside The Beehive pub.

==Education==
The village secondary school is Great Baddow High School, a sports and science college on Duffield Road. Primary schools include Baddow Hall Infant and Junior Schools at the border of Great Baddow, Beehive Lane County Primary School, Larkrise Primary School, (formerly Rothmans Primary School), and Meadgate County Primary Schools.

<doc id="231400" wikidata="Q2087293" url="?curid=231400" title="Hand of Glory">
<text>A Hand of Glory is the dried and pickled hand of a hanged man, often specified as being the left () hand, or, if the person was hanged for murder, the hand that &quot;did the deed.&quot;

Old European beliefs attribute great powers to a Hand of Glory. The process for preparing the hand and the candle are described in 18th-century documents, with certain steps disputed due to difficulty in properly translating phrases from that era. The concept has inspired short stories and poems since the 19th century.

==History of the term==
Etymologist Walter Skeat reports that, while folklore has long attributed mystical powers to a dead man&#x27;s hand, the specific phrase &quot;Hand of Glory&quot; is in fact a folk etymology: it derives from the French &#x27;, a corruption of &quot;mandragore&quot;, which is to say mandrake. Skeat writes, &quot;The identification of the &quot;hand of glory&quot; with the &quot;mandrake&quot; is clinched by the statement in Cockayne&#x27;s Leechdoms, i. 245, that the mandrake &#x27;shineth by night altogether like a lamp. Cockayne in turn is quoting &quot;Pseudo-Apuleius&quot;, in a translation of a Saxon manuscript of his &#x27;.

==Powers attributed==
According to old European beliefs, a candle made of the fat from a malefactor who died on the gallows, lighted, and placed (as if in a candlestick) in the Hand of Glory, which comes from the same man as the fat in the candle, would render motionless all persons to whom it was presented. The method for holding the candle is sketched in &quot;&quot;. The candle could be put out only with milk. In another version, the hair of the dead man is used as a wick, and the candle would give light only to the holder.

The Hand of Glory also purportedly had the power to unlock any door it came across. The method of making a Hand of Glory is described in &#x27;, and in the &#x27;.

==Process==

The 1722 &quot;&quot; describes in detail how to make a Hand of Glory, as cited from him by Émile-Jules Grillot de Givry:

De Givry points out the difficulties with the meaning of the words &quot;zimat&quot; and &quot;ponie&quot;, saying it is likely &quot;ponie&quot; means horse-dung. De Givry is expressly using the 1722 edition, where the phrase is, according to John Livingston Lowes &quot;&quot; and de Givry notes that the meaning of &quot;ponie&quot; as &quot;horse dung&quot; is entirely unknown &quot;to us&quot;, but that in local Lower Normandy dialect, it has that meaning. His reason for regarding this interpretation as &quot;more than probable&quot; is that horse-dung is &quot;very combustible, when dry&quot;.

In the French 1752 edition (called &quot;&quot;, i.e., &quot;New Edition, corrected and augmented&quot;), however, this reads as &quot;&quot;, that is, in Francis Grose&#x27;s translation from 1787, &quot;sisame of Lapland&quot;, or Lapland sesame. This interpretation can be found many places on the Internet, and even in books published at university presses. Two books, one by Cora Daniels, another by Montague Summers, perpetuate the Lapland sesame myth, while being uncertain whether zimat should mean verdigris or the Arabian sulphate of iron.

The &quot; also provides a way to shield a house from the effects of the Hand of Glory:

An actual Hand of Glory is kept at the Whitby Museum in North Yorkshire, England, together with a text published in a book from 1823. In this manuscript text, the way to make the Hand of Glory is as follows:

==Cultural references==

=== In crime ===
A Hand of Glory was proposed as one of the motives for an unsolved murder that occurred in wartime England some time in mid-late 1941. The case was made more mysterious by numerous graffiti that appeared later stating &quot;Who put Bella down the Wych Elm?&quot;&quot;, referring to the woman&#x27;s corpse which was found inside a tree.

===In literature===
Severed hands in an occult context occur as early as Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Rhampsinitus&quot; (ii, 121), in which a clever thief leaves a dead hand behind in order to avoid capture. They also appear in early stories of lycanthropy, such as Henry Boguet&#x27;s &quot; in 1590.

In 1832 wrote the short story &quot; (&quot;The Hand of Glory, a Macaronic Story&quot;). The same year Aloysius Bertrand published &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Hour of the Sabbat&quot;). Guy de Maupassant made his debut with &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Flayed Hand&quot;) (1875) one of his first stories in the &#x27; under the pseudonym Joseph Prunier. Marcel Schwob wrote an uncollected short story about it: &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Hand of Glory&quot;), which was published in &#x27; on March 11, 1893.

The second of the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;, &quot;The Hand of Glory, or, The Nurse&#x27;s Story&quot;, describes the making and use of a Hand of Glory. The first lines are:

&lt;poem&gt;Now open, lock!
To the Dead Man&#x27;s knock!
Fly, bolt, and bar, and band!
Nor move, nor swerve,
Joint, muscle, or nerve,
At the spell of the Dead Man&#x27;s hand!
Sleep, all who sleep! -- Wake, all who wake!
But be as the dead for the Dead Man&#x27;s sake!&lt;/poem&gt;

 wrote a poem titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Studies of Hands&quot;) on the subject of the hand of the poet-thief Lacenaire, severed after his execution for a double murder, presumably for future use as a Hand of Glory.

===In film===

A Hand of Glory appears briefly and is mentioned by name in the 1973 classic British folk horror film The Wicker Man.

<doc id="231405" wikidata="Q4735348" url="?curid=231405" title="Alphonse Briart">
<text>Alphonse Briart (1825–1898) was supervisor of the coal mines at Bascoup and Mariemont near Morlanwelz in the Hainaut province of Belgium, and a geologist who studied that region. During the period 1863–1896 he and Francois Cornet published a number of books and papers describing fossils and geological structures found near Mons. They devised theories - now generally accepted - as to the geological history of the region. After Cornet&#x27;s death in 1887, Briart continued to write alone.

The mineral Briartite is named for his grandson, Gaston Briart. In 1890 his son Paul took part in Delcommune&#x27;s Katanga expedition.

==Life events==
Briart was born at Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on 25 February 1825, the son of a military surgeon. In 1844 he graduated from the École des Mines in Mons as an engineer. For most of his career, he worked for the Mariemont &amp; Bascoup coal-mining company. In 1868 he was appointed the company&#x27;s Chief Engineer, and in 1888 the company&#x27;s president.

He married Elise Deltenre in 1855.

His first geological publication, in collaboration with Fr. Cornet, was published in 1863. In 1866 the two of them received the gold medal of the Society of Sciences, Arts and Letters of Hainaut () for a paper on the Cretaceous terrain of Hainaut.

In 1867, together with Cornet and A. Houzeau de Lehaie, Briart undertook the excavation of the Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes, and at nearby Mesvin, during the construction of the railway line between Mons and Charleroi. Findings were presented to the International Prehistoric Congress held in Brussels in 1872.

Briart became a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Belgium in 1867, and a full member in 1874. In 1889 he became head of the Sciences section. He was a founding member of the Société géologique de Belgique (1871).

In 1895 he undertook a geological expedition in Chile.

He died at Morlanwelz on 15 March 1898. His paleontological collection was acquired by the École des Mines de Mons.

==Honours==
In 1875 Briart became a knight, in 1890 an officer, and in 1897 commander of the Order of Leopold.

<doc id="231407" wikidata="Q330821" url="?curid=231407" title="Abraham ibn Daud">
<text>Abraham ibn Daud (; ) was a Spanish-Jewish astronomer, historian and philosopher; born in Córdoba, Spain about 1110; who was said to have been killed for his religious beliefs in Toledo, Spain, about 1180. He is sometimes known by the abbreviation Rabad I or Ravad I. His maternal grandfather was Isaac Albalia. Some scholars believe he was the Arabic-into-Latin translator known as &quot;Avendauth&quot;.

==Works==
His chronicle, a work written in Hebrew in 1161 under the title of &quot;Sefer ha-Qabbalah&quot; (; some manuscripts give the title as &quot;Seder ha-Qabbalah&quot;, i.e. the &quot;Order of Tradition&quot;), in which he fiercely attacked the contentions of Karaism and justified Rabbinic Judaism by the establishment of a chain of traditions from Moses to his own time, is replete with valuable general information, especially relating to the time of the Geonim and to the history of the Jews in Spain. 

In his book he attempted to explain how the pre-Inquisition Spanish Jewish community became the centre of the Jewish world by claiming that four rabbis from Babylonia, which had been the centre of Jewish scholarship for centuries, were travelling across the Mediterranean by ship in 990. Their ship was captured by a royal Spanish fleet and all four rabbis were sold into slavery at different points around the Mediterranean. In each place where the rabbis were sold as slaves, the local Jewish communities bought their freedom. One of the slaves was Rabbi Hanoch ben Moshe who was freed in the Spanish city of Córdoba. When he began attending Torah classes and giving brilliant answers to questions, the community recognized him as a prodigious scholar and made him their leader; this transferred what Dara Horn called the &#x27;crown of Torah&#x27; from Babylonia to Spain. 

The account described in &quot;Sefer ha-Qabbalah&quot; contains numerous impossibilities and inaccuracies. Jewish historian Gerson Cohen noted that the alleged leader of the Spanish royal fleet, Abd al-Rahman III, died some thirty years before the story took place, and that the legend of Rabbi Moshe, disguised as a pauper, surprising scholars in a Torah study session was nearly identical to the rise of Hillel the Elder.

An astronomical work written by him in 1180 is favourably noticed by Isaac Israeli the Younger. His philosophical work, &quot;al-ʿaqida l-Rafiya&quot; (The Sublime Faith), written in 1168, in Arabic, has been preserved in two Hebrew translations: one by Solomon ben Labi, with the title &quot;Emunah Ramah&quot;; the other by Samuel Motot. Labi&#x27;s translation was retranslated into German and published by Simshon Weil.

==Philosophy==
===Aristotelian approach===
Ibn Daud was the first to introduce the phase of Jewish philosophy which is generally attributed to Maimonides and which differs from former systems of philosophy mainly in its more thorough systematic form derived from Aristotle. He is considered the first Aristotelian in medieval Jewish philosophy; his work has been given less attention than Maimonides&#x27; subsequent and widely popular work &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. Hasdai Crescas said Ibn Daud was the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides.

The only Jewish philosophical works that Ibn Daud had before him, according to his own statement, were Saadia&#x27;s &quot;Emunoth ve-Deoth&quot;, and &quot;The Fountain of Life&quot; by Solomon ibn Gabirol. On the one hand, he fully recognized the merits of Saadia Gaon, although he does not adopt his views on the freedom of the will, notwithstanding that the solution of this problem was to be the chief aim and purpose of his whole system. On the other hand, his attitude toward Gabirol was entirely antagonistic, and even in the preface to his &quot;Emunah Ramah&quot; he pitilessly condemned Gabirol&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Life.&quot; He considered Aristotle and his Arabic commentators, Alfarabi and Ibn Sina, to be the only true philosophers.

True philosophy, according to Ibn Daud, does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them. Ibn Daud insists that, however highly philosophy may be valued, the religion of Judaism is preferable. Knowledge, which had been acquired by philosophers through the evolution of several thousand years, and after overcoming the most serious errors, had been bestowed upon Judaism from the beginning through revelation. As to moral truths, it may be even assumed as probable that the philosophers did not attain to them through independent study, but rather under the influence of the doctrines of Holy Scripture.

===Theology===

As to the incorporeality of God, it follows logically from the notion of infinity which belongs to the First Cause of motion that no corporeal thing can be infinite itself; nor can infinite force be attributed to it. But the Prime Mover is infinite; for, since it itself is without motion, its force also remains unaffected by the motion of change and transformation. Therefore, the Prime Mover—that is, God—cannot be corporeal.

But as a being of necessary existence, God must also be absolutely simple and single; inasmuch as the conception of a plurality in its essence would, at the same time, nullify the notion of the necessity of Its existence. For the consolidation of this plurality into a unity must have been effected by another being different from itself; hence the existence of this plural being would be no more necessary, that is, determined by its own essence, but would be dependent upon that other being which brought about the unification.

From the notion of absolute unity results the conception of the uniqueness of God; for if two beings of this kind could exist, the unity of God would be nullified, since to one, at least, of the units a special character must be attributed so as to distinguish it from the other. With the doctrine of the unity of God is connected the doctrine of the divine attributes, which is preceded in Abraham ibn Daud&#x27;s system by the doctrine of the negative attributes, already accepted by Bahya ibn Paquda. and by Judah ha-Levi from the older Arabic theology. According to Ibn Daud, only negative attributes, in the strict and proper sense, can be imputed to God; so that, whatever multiplicity of these negative attributes may be ascribed to It, no multiplicity in the essence of God can result. Certainly this is equivalent to a renunciation of a positive conception of the Divine Being; for negative statements may suffice to prevent erroneous ideas, but a positive knowledge can never be obtained through them alone. Indeed, our whole knowledge of God is limited to two certainties, (1) that It exists and (2) that Its essence is incomprehensible. In addition to the negative attributes, only relative attributes can be predicated of God; for even these latter, however many may be assumed, since they do not apply to the essence of God but only to Its relation to the world, produce no modification in the notion of the unity of the Divine Being.

From the speculative doctrines of faith, the truth of which can be proved only by reasoning, are to be distinguished the historical dogmas whose authenticity is based principally upon divine revelation, or (more precisely) upon the historical tradition of such a revelation. The tradition concerning an event that is reported to have taken place publicly before a great body of men, which originated, so to say, under the control of public opinion, without having been disputed by contemporaries, and has descended with an uninterrupted continuity, is persuasive which cannot be controverted even by the professional logician. The trustworthiness of historical tradition forms a presumption in favour of the truth of prophecy. This trust only applies when the divine revelations apply to important public matters, but not when they relate to less important matters, or to the personal affairs of a single individual. Thus, as ibn Daud remarks (perhaps referring to the miracles attributed to Jesus), the authenticity of the Torah would be in a difficult situation if, instead of being based historically certain miracles such as those of Moses, it were supported only by private miracles such the resurrections by Elijah and Elisha.

===Theory of prophecy===
Relying upon the doctrines of Alfarabi and Avicenna, Ibn Daud (whom Maimonides follows in many ways in his conception of prophecy) further argues that the gift of prophecy must not be considered as a phenomenon, interrupting the continuity of the development of the human mind, but in a certain sense as the final stage of a natural evolution whose lower phases, though they must be distinguished from prophecy proper, are nevertheless connected with the same faculty through a certain identity of nature. And even if the true stage of prophecy is reached, this gift is, nevertheless, still capable of progressive development, although it may exceptionally at once reach the highest perfection in particularly gifted individuals.

The connection between the mind of the prophet and the higher intellects, principally with the Active Intelligence, furnishes a sufficient explanation of the higher cognitive faculty of the prophet, as well as of his power of transcending natural law. Appointed to become an intermediary between God and man, the prophet is elevated almost to the plane of the separated intelligences, or angels.

===On predestination===
Based upon the philosophical system developed above, and after the exposition of the doctrine of faith, the problem of human free will and its relation to faith in a divine providence, or predestination, may be regarded as much nearer its solution. The objection that faith in a divine providence is inconsistent with the existence of evil in the world, because God can not be the author of evil and good at the same time, is refuted by the fact that evil has no existence in itself, but is only the natural result of the absence of actual good, and that, consequently, evil needs no creator. The defects and imperfections which appear in this world in no way contradict the wisdom and goodness of God. The defects appear only to a finite conception which considers things separately and in themselves, and not in their connection with the whole. Viewed from a higher standpoint the imperfections adhering to things or individuals would perhaps, in their relation to the whole, even prove to be perfections and advantages.

The human free-will as a subjective principle has for its objective correlate the notion of possibility, by which one of two alternatives may occur. This does not limit divine omniscience in any way; unless, misled by common usage, one should designate as &quot;possible&quot; those things whose undetermined state results not from their own essence, but only from our deficient knowledge of the essence. But this kind of possibility, which, indeed, is no possibility at all, must be eliminated from God as quite irreconcilable with His omniscience. In its strict and precise form, the notion of possibility is not at all antagonistic to the omniscience of God; for it is easily conceivable that God from the beginning regulated creation, so that for certain cases both alternatives should be &quot;possible&quot; events; that the Creator, in order to grant to human liberty the opportunity to display its own energy, left the final issue of certain actions undecided even for His own knowledge.

Ibn Daud admits that human free will is somewhat limited through the variety of moral dispositions, partly due to natural causes, to be found both in single individuals and in entire nations. But man is able to overcome his natural disposition and appetites, and to lift himself to a higher plane of morality, by purifying and ennobling himself. The Torah, and the study of ethics which forms a part of practical philosophy and is designated, by an expression borrowed from Plato, as the &quot;doctrine of the healing of souls,&quot; are the guiding stars to this exalted plane; but no scientific presentation of practical philosophy approaches in this regard the lofty heights of the Scriptures, wherein are clearly expressed the most sublime moral principles known to philosophers.

The ceremonial laws also serve the purpose of moral education. Therefore, they too qualify as moral laws; although when compared with the doctrines of faith and the ethical laws proper, they have only a subordinate importance, just as the Bible also attribute to the sacrifices a relatively minor importance in comparison with the moral laws.

<doc id="231410" wikidata="Q7900164" url="?curid=231410" title="Urban seismic risk">
<text>Urban seismic risk is the risk of earthquakes damaging or destroying people and things in towns and cities. Even if a big earthquake is likely urban seismic risk can be minimized with good earthquake construction, and seismic analysis. One of the best ways to deal with the issue is through an earthquake scenario analysis. Earthquake engineering can reduce the risk.

==International projects==
The IDNDR secretariat launched the RADIUS (risk assessment tools for diagnosis of urban areas against seismic disasters) initiative in 1996 to promote worldwide activities for the reduction of urban seismic risk, which experienced rapid growth particularly in developing countries, by helping to raise public awareness.

===Urban risk and planning===
One of the disaster risk reduction themes set forth by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction project PreventionWeb, is urban risk and planning. This theme refers to the measurement and management of urban hazards and vulnerability in order to improve awareness and local capacity to effectively reduce disaster risk.

==Istanbul==
==Toronto==

Cities are a mixture of old and new construction as in this picture. Note the old brick building mixed in with the new highrises, and the famous Toronto CN Tower. Similar to methodologies used in nuclear reactors, a seismic walkdown of the city is the best way to identify vulnerabilities and possible places for improvement.

Toronto is located on the shores of Lake Ontario, the site of much microseismicity. Toronto was struck by a 5.0 magnitude earthquake on June 23, 2010, and a 5.1 magnitude earthquake on May 17, 2013.

There are many places where the risk of seismic damage to older buildings is quite high. Old brick buildings on poor soils are highly vulnerable to earthquake damage, particularly when the mortar holding the bricks together has decayed. Problems increase if there is the possibility for soil or soil liquefaction.

Even in buildings which are capable of withstanding an earthquake without structural failure there may be risk to people due to interior hazards. Items such as suspended ceilings and light fixtures have almost no seismic ruggedness. Warehouse stores where heavy merchandise is stacked are a particular hazard.

<text>Marmaduke Langdale, 1st Baron Langdale ( – 5 August 1661) was an English landowner and soldier who fought with the Royalists during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

An only child who inherited large estates, he served in the 1620 to 1622 Palatinate campaign before returning home; during the period of Personal Rule by Charles I from 1629 to 1640, he opposed both the Forced Loan and Ship Money. Nevertheless, when the civil war began in 1642 he joined the Royalist Northern Army, although with little enthusiasm.

He proved a talented commander of cavalry; after defeat at Marston Moor in 1644, he formed the survivors into the Northern Horse, which quickly gained a reputation for ill-discipline. After Royalist defeat in the Second English Civil War in 1648, he went into exile and served briefly in the Venetian army before forced to retire by sickness. In 1653, he converted to Catholicism and later resided in Lamspringe Abbey, Westphalia.

Created Baron Langdale in 1658 by Charles II, after The Restoration in 1660 he returned home and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. His health and finances had been destroyed by the war and he died at his home of Holme Hall in August 1661.

==Family==
Marmaduke Langdale was born in 1598, only son of Peter Langdale (d.1617) and his wife Anne Wharton (1576–1646), who in 1606 purchased Pighill Hall, Molescroft, near Beverley in Yorkshire. The name &#x27;Langdale&#x27; allegedly came from the manor of Langdale in Yorkshire.

In 1626 Langdale married Lenox Rodes (d.1639), daughter of Sir John Rodes (1562–1639) of Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire; before she died in childbirth in 1639, they had seven children. Four of these survived to adulthood; sons Marmaduke (1627–1703) and Philip (died 1672), and daughters Lenox (died 1658) and Mary (died 1678).

==Career==
Langdale attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1612 and inherited his father&#x27;s estates in 1617. His sister-in-law Katherine was the first wife of Sir John Hotham (1589–1645); in 1620, the two went to Europe and briefly fought for Elizabeth of Bohemia, sister of Charles I. Sir John was appointed Parliamentarian Governor of Hull, Yorkshire in 1642 and executed for treason in 1645 along with his son John, whom Clarendon describes as a close friend.

During the 1620s and 1630s, Langdale became an increasingly important local political figure and knighted in 1628; however, during the period of Personal Rule by Charles from 1629 to 1640, he opposed the Forced Loan and payment of Ship money. In 1638, the Earl of Strafford, Charles&#x27; chief minister and President of the Council of the North identified Langdale as a person of &quot;ill affections to the Provincial, if not to the Regal Power&quot;. He was punished by being appointed Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1639, making him personally liable for any shortfalls in collecting the taxes. He eventually complied but was removed in July 1640 after organising a petition signed by leading members of the Yorkshire gentry listing their &#x27;grievances&#x27;.

Langdale provides a good example of the complex motives driving individuals to choose a particular side during the War of the Three Kingdoms. Despite his previous opposition and ill-health, when the war began in August 1642 he joined the Royalists and fought under the Marquess of Newcastle, Royalist commander in Northern England. During the Siege of Newcastle in February 1644, he scattered the Covenanter cavalry at Corbridge, before the loss of Selby forced the main Royalist army to retreat into York. At the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644, he commanded part of the Royalist left wing and after their defeat formed the surviving cavalry into the &quot;Northern Horse&quot;. A collection of the remnants of an estimated 30 regiments, it was later described as a &quot;rabble of gentility&quot; and quickly gained a reputation for poor discipline.

In March 1645, Langdale dispersed a Parliamentarian force under John Lambert outside Wentbridge, and relieved Pontefract Castle, one of the last Royalist positions in the north. However, without infantry support, he was forced to retreat; the Northern Horse rejoined the main Royalist field army and formed the left wing at the Battle of Naseby in June. Although they initially held their ground against Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s more numerous and better disciplined troopers, they were later outflanked and driven from the field.

The survivors of Naseby, which included the Northern Horse, withdrew to Raglan Castle in South Wales, but on 10 July the last significant Royalist field army in England was destroyed at the Battle of Langport. Langdale and other Yorkshire Royalists wanted to go north to link up with Montrose, who won a series of victories in Scotland from 1644 to 1645. Charles agreed but first insisted on relieving Chester, a port vital for communication with his Irish supporters; on 24 September the Royalists were defeated at the Battle of Rowton Heath.

Shortly after this, news came of Montrose&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Philiphaugh on 13 September. Langdale and Lord Digby escaped from Chester with about 2,400 cavalry, but on 15 October a Parliamentarian army intercepted and dispersed their forces at Sherburn-in-Elmet. Digby and Langdale escaped to France and the First English Civil War came to an end in June 1646. An alliance between Royalists, Parliamentarian moderates and the Scots led to the Second English Civil War in 1648; Langdale returned from exile to lead the Royalists in Cumberland and seized the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed to enable his Scottish allies to invade England. In August, John Lambert, Parliamentarian commander in the North, was reinforced by Cromwell and Fairfax who had defeated Royalist risings in Wales and Southern England. Although Langdale linked up with the Scottish army under the Duke of Hamilton, they were decisively defeated at the Battle of Preston, over a period of three days between 17 and 19 August.

Along with much of the cavalry, Langdale and Hamilton evaded capture at Preston but were taken shortly afterwards and imprisoned in Nottingham Castle. The Second Civil War convinced Parliamentarians, including Cromwell, that peace could only be assured by the death of prominent Royalists; Hamilton was executed, as was Charles himself in January 1649. As one of seven Royalists excluded by name from pardon, Langdale avoided a similar fate by escaping dressed as a milkmaid and made his way to France once again.

Under the 1650 Treaty of Breda, the Covenanters agreed to restore Charles II to the English and Scots thrones but insisted on the exclusion of many who followed him into exile. As a result, Langdale did not participate in the Third English Civil War; he converted to Catholicism in 1652 and joined the army of the Republic of Venice but was forced to retire due to poor health. In 1655, poverty led him to take refuge at the English Benedictine Congregation at Lamspringe Abbey in Lower Saxony.

In 1658, Charles created him Baron Langdale; after the Restoration in 1660, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire but claimed he was too poor to attend Charles&#x27; coronation. He died in August 1661 at Holme and was buried in All Saints Church, Sancton, where his memorial survives, along with others belonging to the Langdale family.

<doc id="231432" wikidata="Q236071" url="?curid=231432" title="Apollo 4">
<text>Apollo 4 (November 9, 1967), also known as SA-501, was the uncrewed first test flight of the Saturn V launch vehicle, the rocket that eventually took astronauts to the Moon. The space vehicle was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and was the first to be launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, ascending from Launch Complex 39, where facilities built specially for the SaturnV had been constructed.

Apollo 4 was an &quot;all-up&quot; test, meaning all rocket stages and spacecraft were fully functional on the initial flight, a first for NASA. It was the first time the S-IC first stage and S-II second stage flew. It also demonstrated the S-IVB third stage&#x27;s first in-flight restart. The mission used a BlockI command and service module modified to test several key BlockII revisions, including its heat shield at simulated lunar-return velocity and angle.

The launch was planned for early 1967, but delayed to November9 because of problems with various elements of the spacecraft and difficulties during pre-flight testing. Additional inspections were also required after a fire killed the Apollo 1 crew in January 1967. 

The mission splashed down in the Pacific Ocean slightly less than nine hours after launch, having achieved its objectives. NASA considered the mission a complete success, proving that the SaturnV worked, an important step towards achieving the main objective of landing astronauts on the Moon, and bringing them back safely, before the end of the 1960s.

==Background==
In 1961 U.S. President John F. Kennedy proposed that his nation land an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth. One of the early choices that had to be made to accomplish this goal was what launch vehicle to use. NASA decided on the SaturnC-5 rocket, a three-stage launch vehicle based on rockets already in development. In 1962 this was approved by NASA, which contemplated an initial test launch in 1965 and a first crewed flight by 1967, leaving plenty of time to accomplish Kennedy&#x27;s goal. In early 1963, NASA redesignated the C-5 as the Saturn V.

After considerable debate within NASA, it was decided in late 1962 that lunar missions would have a &quot;lunar orbit rendezvous&quot; mode whereby the complete Apollo spacecraft would be propelled towards lunar orbit by the third stage of the launch vehicle, the S-IVB. Once in lunar orbit, the astronauts who would land would enter what was then known as the Lunar Excursion Module, which would separate from the rest of the spacecraft, land, and after taking off again be discarded once the crew had transferred back. The remainder of the vehicle would then return to Earth. The launch facilities under development would not be sufficient for the new launch vehicle, and in 1962, NASA announced plans for a new complex on the Florida coast from which the Apollo lunar missions could be launched. This was dubbed the Launch Operations Center, but after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963 was renamed the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Apollo4 was the first flight from KSC, and the first using Launch Complex 39 (LC-39) there, built to accommodate the SaturnV.

The first three flights carrying Apollo equipment were launched using Saturn IBs. This smaller launch vehicle did not use the facilities at KSC, but issues resolved by SaturnIB flights would be valid for those to be launched by the SaturnV. Both the SaturnIB and the SaturnV would use a S-IVB, though the IB would use it as its second, final stage, rather than the third stage as on the SaturnV. Thus, many of the flight qualifications for the payload the SaturnV would carry could be resolved without having to expend one of the large launch vehicles. In addition to flight-qualifying the hardware, it was necessary to prove that the ground systems at KSC could successfully launch a Saturn V before risking the lives of astronauts on one.

Three Saturn IB launches (in order of launch, AS-201, AS-203 and AS-202) took place in 1966; all were successful. According to Charles D. Benson and William B. Flaherty in their history of KSC, &quot;The Apollo-SaturnIB launches of 1966 represented important gains for NASA&#x27;s launch team. LC-34 and LC-37, testbeds for automated checkout, were found wanting. In the twenty months between AS-201 and SA-501 [Apollo4], KSC corrected the major automation problems. Without these trial and error advances, SA-501, the toughest launch in Apollo&#x27;s history, would have been far more difficult.&quot;

==Delays==
In January 1965 Major General Samuel C. Phillips, the Apollo Program Director, scheduled SA-501, the first test flight of the SaturnV, for January 1967. This left little spare time for delay, especially since two additional SaturnV launches were planned to follow in 1967. Many Apollo officials lacked confidence in the proposed launch date, and these misgivings proved accurate. After an explosion involving a liquid oxygen line flowing to LC-39, from which SA-501 was to be launched, there was a potential for a delay of several weeks.

North American Aviation was the contractor for both the S-II SaturnV second stage, and the Apollo command and service module (CSM) spacecraft. NASA had been experiencing problems with North American&#x27;s schedule, cost, and quality performance on both programs, severe enough that Phillips led a team to North American&#x27;s facility in California in November and December 1965 to investigate matters, and recommend solutions to the program management problems. He published his findings in a report to his supervisor, George Mueller. Technicians found cracks in the S-II, delaying its test firings prior to acceptance by NASA. As North American worked to fix the S-II, parts of the rocket began to arrive at KSC, beginning with the S-IVB on August 14, 1966, (by Pregnant Guppy aircraft) and followed closely by the first stage S-IC on September 12 (by barge). A spool-shaped &quot;spacer&quot; that took the place of the S-II allowed NASA to stack the vehicle as its checkout proceeded in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). With the S-II still not arrived by November 1966 (it had originally been planned for July), NASA planned January 1967 for its arrival, with launch three months later. The CSM arrived on December 24, 1966, with the S-II arriving on January 21, 1967. Last to arrive was the aft interstage (the structure between the first and second stages), on January 31.

The Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, which killed three astronauts during a launch pad test, threw NASA&#x27;s schedules into further questioneven though SA-501 was uncrewed, NASA officials wanted to closely examine its CSM. NASA had planned to restack the vehicle once this was done, but instead the inspections that took place found a total of 1,407 errors in the spacecraft. Inspectors found many haphazardly routed and skinned wires, prime material for short circuits.
Other problems were discovered, such as an extra, out-of-place bolt in one of the J-2 engines; NASA was concerned not only with retrieving the surplus hardware, but also with discovering how it got there. A meeting in March 1967, with Phillips in attendance, disclosed twelve hundred problems with the SaturnV, which the technicians proposed to deal with at the rate of eighty per day. While the CSM was undergoing repairs, the spacer was removed from the vehicle stack, and the S-II positioned. On May 24 it was announced that the S-II would be removed for inspection following the discovery of hairline cracks in another S-II then being constructed, this work being completed by mid-June, after which the CSM was also returned to the stack, the first time the launch vehicle and spacecraft had been fully assembled. It was rolled out to LC-39 on August 26, 1967, where it was joined by the Mobile Servicing Structure that allowed access to the launch vehicle and spacecraft two days later, also transported by crawler. This was the first time a NASA spacecraft had been assembled away from its launch site, something allowing protection from Florida&#x27;s hot and humid climate for equipment and personnel.

The countdown demonstration test had been scheduled for September 20 but was soon rescheduled for the 25th and did not begin until the evening of the 27th. By October2 another two days had been lost to delays, but by October4 it reached launch minus 45 minutes. Then a computer failed, and the count, reset to minus 13 hours before launch, resumed on October 9. More computer and equipment problems appeared. By then, the launch team was exhausted and a two-day break was declared. The test was completed on October 13, meaning that it took three weeks rather than the expectation of a week or slightly over. With world attention on the launch, NASA public relations head Julian Scheer brought the skeptical questions from the media as to whether Apollo4 would ever fly to the attention of NASA Administrator James E. Webb, leading to a heated meeting in which Webb said he would announce the launch date when he wanted to.

These difficulties provided the launch crew with valuable experience, but meant that Apollo4 could not be launched at the earliest until November 7. A flight readiness review on October 19 cleared Apollo4 for launch, assuming the remaining tests and modifications were satisfactorily completed. Concerned about the potential for leaks in the Teflon seal rings and drain valves of the liquid oxygen tanks on board the vehicle due to the long time it had been sitting on the launch pad in the Florida sun, on November2 Phillips postponed the launch until November9.

==Objectives==
The purpose of Apollo 4 (together with the SaturnV&#x27;s other uncrewed test flight, Apollo6) was to qualify the launch vehicle, the Apollo spacecraft, and the ground systems, for the crewed lunar landing missions that would follow. In addition to being the first flight of the SaturnV, Apollo4 marked the first flight for two of its stages: the S-IC first stage and the S-II second stage (the S-IVB had flown as part of the SaturnIB).

Objectives for the Apollo 4 mission were to gain flight data on the SaturnV and spacecraft structural integrity and mutual compatibility, including on flight loads and during the separations as each SaturnV stage was exhausted and was discarded. NASA also wanted data on subsystem operations, including the emergency detection subsystem, and sought to evaluate the Apollo CM&#x27;s heat shield under conditions simulating a return from a lunar mission. NASA was also seeking to test the restart capability of the S-IVB in space. These objectives would all be achieved.

==Equipment==
Apollo 4 carried CSM-017, a BlockI design of the command and service modules meant for testing and for Apollo&#x27;s early Earth orbit flights. Unlike the BlockII spacecraft which would go to the Moon, it lacked the capability to dock with a lunar module (LM). CSM-017 was made up of command module CM-017 and service module SM-020. CM-017 was the second fully-functional CM to be delivered to NASA; the first, CM-012, was designated for Apollo1, and was severely damaged in the fire. SM-020 was originally to be used in CSM-020, slated for the second SaturnV test, but this changed after SM-017, which was intended to be part of CSM-017, was damaged in an explosion and was scrapped.

Several significant Block II modifications were made to CSM-017 for certification purposes, since no BlockII spacecraft would fly without a crew. These included upgrading the heat shield to BlockII standards, using a BlockII CM-to-SM umbilical connector, and installing BlockII-style VHF and S-band antennae. Additionally, there were modifications to the CM&#x27;s hatch. The fact that the spacecraft hatch could not be readily opened in case of emergency had trapped the Apollo1 astronauts in the fire that took their lives, and led to a redesign of the hatch. The new hatch was not scheduled to fly until the second SaturnV test (Apollo 6), but its seals were to be flight-qualified on Apollo4the hatch window was replaced with a test panel simulating the seals and exterior heat shield. The heat shield was upgraded to BlockII standards since Apollo4&#x27;s high-speed re-entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was intended to simulate a return from the Moon. Special equipment had been installed to allow Mission Control to operate the CSM&#x27;s systems remotely, and there was a camera that would automatically take pictures out of one of the CM&#x27;s windows on its final orbit. Since Apollo4 carried no crew the CM lacked couches, controls and displays.

A Lunar Module Test Article, LTA-10R, was carried, and remained inside the Spacecraft–LM Adapter, numbered as SLA-8, on the third stage of the SaturnV throughout its flight. The LTA consisted of a flight-type descent stage lacking landing gear, with its fuel and oxidizer tanks containing a mixture of water, glycol, and freon. There was an ascent stage mockup atop it, made of aluminum with ballast, and having no flight systems. The SLA and LTA were instrumented to measure stress on them as the SaturnV made its way to orbit. LTA-10R would be destroyed when the S-IVB re-entered the atmosphere.
Apollo 4 was the first flight of a SaturnV. At the time, it was the largest launch vehicle to ever attempt a flight. This mission was the first time NASA used &quot;all-up&quot; testing, requiring that each stage of the launch vehicle work and that the vehicle carry a working spacecraft; a decision that goes back to late 1963. Mueller, the head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight at that time, was a systems engineer who previously worked on military missile projects. He had recognized that all-up testing was successfully used to rapidly develop the Air Force&#x27;s Minuteman ICBM program, and thought it could be used to meet Apollo&#x27;s schedule. In a 1963 memo he ordered that both the first SaturnIB flight and the first SaturnV flight be uncrewed, that each stage be fully functional, and that each carry a working spacecraft. The second flight of each type of rocket would also be an uncrewed test flight, and the third flight would be crewed. Previously, the way Wernher von Braun&#x27;s team at the Marshall Space Flight Center tested new rockets was by testing each stage incrementally. The SaturnV would be tested all at once, with all stages live and fully flight-worthy, including an Apollo CSM. This decision dramatically streamlined the program&#x27;s test flight phase, eliminating four missions, but it required everything to work properly the first time. Apollo program managers had misgivings about all-up testing but agreed to it with some reluctance since incremental component tests would inevitably push the lunar landing mission past the 1970 goal.

==Mission numbering==
Apollo 4 was the first mission to fly under the official Apollo mission numbering scheme approved by Mueller on April 24, 1967; the planned first crewed flight, in preparation for which three astronauts had died, was retroactively designated Apollo1 as the widows of the crew members had requested. Although three uncrewed SaturnIB flights had already occurred, only two had contained an Apollo spacecraft (AS-203 carried only the aerodynamic nose cone). Mueller resumed the numbering sequence at Apollo4, without designating an Apollo 2 or3.

==Public interest and media coverage==
VIPs swarmed to KSC in the days before the launch. Von Braun arrived on November 6, scheduled for an exclusive executive dinner and conference that evening. NASA executives, figures from industry, Congressional leaders and diplomats also came for the launch. Each NASA center involved had a list of VIP guests, as did NASA headquarters in Washington, and duplications were sorted out so each center&#x27;s director could invite guests personally. They watched the launch from uncovered bleachers near the VAB. NASA set up press headquarters in Cocoa Beach, where media representatives were accredited, and offered tours of KSC to visiting journalists, as well as a half-hourly shuttle service. NASA provided extensive telephone facilities for the media at the press site near LC-39, at their expense. KSC workers and their dependents watched the launch from near their work assignments. In addition, 43 employees of contractors who had performed in an exemplary manner were selected as &quot;Manned Flight Awareness&quot; honorees, given a VIP tour of KSC, a social evening in which six astronauts participated, and a view of the launch.

Apollo 4, being the first flight of the SaturnV, gained intense media coverage, and writers struggled to convey to the public the size of the launch vehicle, stating that it would tower well over the Statue of Liberty and be thirteen times as heavy. North American, in a handout to the media, noted that the 3000-ton SaturnV comfortably outweighed a &quot;good-sized navy destroyer&quot;. On the day before launch, Mueller, Phillips, von Braun, Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans and Kennedy Space Center Director Kurt Debus held an outdoor press conference for more than a thousand journalists, including some from the Soviet Union, with the SaturnV in the background.

==Launch and flight==
On November 6, 1967, at 10:30pm EST (03:30 November7 UTC), the -hour countdown sequence began with propellant loading. In total there were 89 trailer-truck loads of liquid oxygen, 28 trailer loads of LH2 (liquid hydrogen), and 27 rail cars of RP-1 (highly refined kerosene). This time the problems encountered were few and minor, and did not delay the launch due to the use of built-in holds in the countdown, during which time accumulated delays were made good.

Apollo 4 launched on November9 at 7:00am EST (noon UTC). Eight seconds before liftoff, the five F-1 engines ignited, sending tremendous amounts of noise across Kennedy Space Center. Even though the launch pads at LC-39 were more than five kilometers (three miles) from the Vehicle Assembly Building, the sound pressure was much stronger than expected and buffeted the VAB, Launch Control Center and press buildings. Dust was dislodged from the ceiling of the Launch Control Center and formed a layer on the consoles of mission controllers. William Donn of Columbia University described the blast as one of the loudest noises, natural or artificial, in human history, excepting nuclear explosions. CBS&#x27;s commentator, Walter Cronkite, and producer Jeff Gralnick put their hands on their trailer&#x27;s observation window to stop it from shattering as ceiling tiles fell from above. Cronkite found Apollo4 to be the most frightening space mission he covered.
The launch placed the S-IVB and CSM into a nearly circular orbit, a nominal parking orbit that would be used on the lunar missions. After two orbits, in a simulation of the trans-lunar injection burn that would take later Apollo missions towards the Moon, the S-IVB&#x27;s first in-space re-ignition put the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit with an apogee of and a perigee deliberately aimed below the Earth&#x27;s surface; this would ensure both a high-speed atmospheric re-entry of the command module, and destruction after re-entry of the S-IVB. Shortly after this burn, the CSM separated from the S-IVB and fired its service module engine to adjust the apogee to . After passing apogee, the service module engine fired again for 281 seconds to increase re-entry speed to , at an altitude of and a flight path angle of −6.93 degrees, simulating conditions on a return from the Moon.

The CM landed approximately from the target landing site northwest of Midway Island in the North Pacific Ocean. Its descent was visible from the deck of the aircraft carrier , the prime recovery ship, which within two hours had recovered it and one of its parachutes, the first time an Apollo parachute had been recovered for inspection. The spacecraft was brought to Hawaii for deactivation, after which it was taken to North American&#x27;s facility in Downey, California, for post-flight analysis.

==Onboard cameras==

Two motion-picture cameras were aboard Apollo4. These were mounted on the SaturnV so as to capture the separation of the first stage and interstage from the launch vehicle. They would then be ejected, descend to the Atlantic Ocean in pods with parachutes and radio beacons, and be recovered about downrange of KSC. 
The command module contained an automatic 70mm film camera which captured photographs of almost the entire Earth. For a period of two hours and thirteen minutes as the craft approached and passed its apogee, a total of 755 color images were taken through the Command Pilot&#x27;s (left-hand) forward-looking window, at altitudes ranging from . These were the color images taken from the highest altitude at that time. The photographs were not of sufficient resolution to obtain detailed scientific data, but were still of interest to those involved in the Earth sciences.

==Aftermath, assessment and spacecraft location==
All Apollo 4 launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed satisfactorily. On the climb to orbit, each of the SaturnV&#x27;s three stages burned for slightly longer than expected. This left the craft in an orbit roughly one kilometer higher than expected, something well within tolerance. A burn eleven seconds longer than planned meant that the CM entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere slightly faster and at a shallower angle than planned, but still within tolerance. This discrepancy happened not because of the performance of the guidance system (which was exemplary), but because the burn had been controlled from Earth. The CM&#x27;s environmental control system kept the ship&#x27;s cabin within acceptable temperatures and pressures throughout the mission, increasing by only during atmospheric entry.

President Lyndon Johnson described the launch, &quot;The whole world could see the awesome sight of the first launch of what is now the largest rocket ever flown. This launching symbolizes the power this nation is harnessing for the peaceful exploration of space.&quot; Von Braun spoke of the mission as &quot;an expert launching all the way through, from lift-off exactly on time to performance of every single stage&quot;. In his history of the SaturnV, Roger E. Bilstein wrote that &quot;the flawless mission of Apollo4 elated the entire NASA organization; everyone looked ahead with buoyant spirits.&quot; Mueller stated that Apollo4 dramatically increased the confidence of many and showed it should be possible for astronauts to land on the Moon by mid-1969.

Apollo 6, the second flight of the SaturnV, was launched on April 4, 1968. Although the SaturnV&#x27;s stages gave more trouble than on Apollo4 (the mission experienced pogo oscillation during its first stage and had an early second-stage engine shutdown), it was decided that a third uncrewed flight was unnecessary. The SaturnV flew with a crew for the first time on Apollo 8. A SaturnV launched astronauts into space, and (except for Apollo 9) towards the Moon, on each of the Apollo missions that followed.

In January 1969 CM-017 was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. As of 1978, it was on display at the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science. The CM was subsequently put on public display at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center, where it remained until 2017. It is currently on display at Stennis Space Center&#x27;s visitor center, the Infinity Science Center, in Pearlington, Mississippi.

<text>Apollo 5 (launched January 22, 1968), also known as AS-204, was the uncrewed first flight of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) that would later carry astronauts to the surface of the Moon. The Saturn IB rocket bearing the LM lifted off from Cape Kennedy on January 22, 1968. The mission was successful, though due to programming problems an alternate mission to that originally planned was executed.

Like Apollo 4, this flight was long delayed, due in part to setbacks in development of the LM, manufactured by Grumman Aircraft. The original Saturn IB rocket that was to take the first LM (LM-1) to space was taken down during the delays and replaced with the one that would have launched Apollo 1 if the spacecraft fire that killed three astronauts had not occurred. LM-1 arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in June 1967; the following months were occupied in testing and placing the LM atop the Saturn IB. After final delays due to equipment trouble, the countdown began on January 21, 1968, and the space vehicle was launched the following day.

Once the craft reached orbit and the LM separated from the S-IVB booster, the program of orbital testing began, but a planned burn was aborted automatically when the Apollo Guidance Computer detected the craft was not going as fast as planned. Flight Director Gene Kranz and his team at Mission Control in Houston quickly decided on an alternate mission, during which the mission&#x27;s goals of testing LM-1 were accomplished. The mission was successful enough that a contemplated second uncrewed mission to test the LM was cancelled, advancing NASA&#x27;s plans to land an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

== Background ==

In 1961, United States President John F. Kennedy challenged the United States to land an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth. After considerable debate, NASA (the US government&#x27;s spaceflight agency) decided in late 1962 that lunar missions would use a lunar orbit rendezvous in which the complete Apollo spacecraft would be propelled towards lunar orbit by the Saturn V launch vehicle&#x27;s third stage (called the S-IVB). Once in lunar orbit, those astronauts who would land on the Moon would enter what was then called the lunar excursion module (LEM) (later called the lunar module (LM)). This craft would separate from the Apollo&#x27;s command and service module (CSM) and land on the Moon. When the astronauts were ready to return, they would enter the LM, take off, and re-dock with the CSM. Once the crew reentered the CSM, they would discard the lunar module and return to Earth in the CSM. In 1962, NASA invited eleven companies to bid for the contract to construct the LM. On November 7, 1962, NASA announced that it had awarded the contract to Grumman in Bethpage, New York.

==Delays==
As with Apollo 4, there were significant delays for Apollo 5. The primary cause of the Apollo 5 delays was the LM, which was behind schedule. Apollo Program Manager Major General Samuel C. Phillips had originally hoped that the uncrewed test flight of LM-1, the first lunar module, would launch in April 1967. Anticipating six months for checkout and testing of the vehicle, NASA asked Grumman to have LM-1 delivered to Kennedy Space Center in Florida by September 1966, but due to difficulties in manufacturing LM-1, delivery was repeatedly delayed. The delivery date was still uncertain when AS-206, the Saturn IB launch vehicle planned to boost LM-1 to orbit, was erected at Launch Complex 37 in January 1967. After the fire that month that killed the Apollo 1 crew, the launch vehicle planned for Apollo 1, AS-204, was moved from Launch Complex 34 to Launch Complex 37 and replaced AS-206. This was done because AS-204 was the last Saturn IB with full research and development instrumentation, and, with crewed flight on hold, NASA wanted to use that booster for the first flight of the LM.

With no LM yet available, Grumman built a plywood mockup of one at Launch Complex 37 to aid in facilities verification. On May 12, 1967, Apollo Program Spacecraft Manager George M. Low informed NASA headquarters that Grumman was committed to a June 28 delivery of LM-1, though Low noted that the goal would be hard to meet. On June 23, LM-1 arrived at Cape Kennedy on board Aero Spacelines&#x27; Super Guppy; the stages were mated to each other four days later. A 400-person team under John J. Williams, a veteran of launch operations for both Mercury and Gemini, checked to see that LM-1 met specifications, after which they supervised Grumman technicians, who tested and modified the vehicle. Due to leaks in the LM&#x27;s ascent stage, the two stages were demated in August, and after these were fixed and the stages remated, another leak developed and the stages were demated again in September. During this time, several pieces of equipment were removed for repair by Grumman; the stages were remated again in October.

As of September 6, 1967, Apollo 5 was running about 39 days behind the plan established on July 18, but all known issues were being dealt with, with the exception of some leaks from the propulsion system. Most mission documents were ready by late 1967; Mission Director William C. Schneider issued mission rules on November 18, 1967. The following day, LM-1 was mated to its launch vehicle, and the space vehicle readiness test was completed in December. In early January 1968, the office of NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced that Apollo 5 would be launched no earlier than January 18, 1968. Minor faults such as clogged filters led to some additional delays. The countdown demonstration test concluded on January 19 and an abbreviated 22-hour countdown began on January 21.

==Objectives==

Apollo 5 was intended to verify the operation of the subsystems of the LM. During the flight, the ascent and descent engines would be fired. A &quot;fire in the hole&quot; test would be conducted to verify that the ascent stage could still fire while attached to the descent stage, a procedure that would be used on the lunar surface and in the event of an aborted lunar landing. It involved shutting down the descent stage, switching control and power to the ascent stage, and starting the ascent engine while the two stages were still mated. The term &quot;fire in the hole&quot; derived from a term used in mining when explosives are about to be used. Additional testing was to check that the LM engines could be restarted after initial use. In addition to testing LM systems, Apollo 5 was to test the Instrument Unit in its Saturn V configuration.

It was expected that the ascent stage of LM-1 would remain in orbit for about two years before re-entering the atmosphere and disintegrating, and the descent stage for about three weeks. 
==Equipment==

Apollo 5 was launched into orbit by the Saturn IB, designated SA-204R, which had been assigned to Apollo 1. Originally brought to Cape Kennedy in August 1966, it had survived the fire unscathed, having been inspected after the fire for corrosion or other damage. Ignition weight for the launch vehicle, including the spacecraft and propellant, was .

The space vehicle for this mission was tall but had a stubby appearance since it had neither a CSM nor a launch escape system. Instead, the LM was housed within the spacecraft-lunar module adapter (SLA) at the top of the vehicle stack. The SLA, numbered as SLA-7, was just below the nose cap in the stack, and had four panels that would open once the nose cap was jettisoned in orbit, allowing the LM room to separate and move away.

The LM, designated as LM-1, was the first flight-ready Apollo lunar module. To save weight, and because they would not be necessary during the test mission, LM-1 had no landing legs.

After one of the windows of LM-5 (which would fly on Apollo 11) broke during testing in December 1967, NASA officials decided to replace the windows of LM-1 with aluminum plates out of concern a window might fail in flight. Since there would be no astronauts aboard, LM-1 had a mission programmer installed, which could control the craft remotely. Not all LM-1 systems were fully activated nor was it given a full load of consumables: for example, its primary batteries were partially discharged to avoid over-voltage complications, and the oxygen tanks for the environmental control systems were only partially full.

== Flight ==
On January 22, 1968, Apollo 5 lifted off from Launch Complex 37B at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station at 17:48:08 Eastern Standard Time (22:48:08 UTC). The Saturn IB worked perfectly, inserting the second stage and LM into an orbit. The nose cone was jettisoned, and after a coast of 43 minutes 52 seconds, the LM separated from its adapter, in a orbit.

After two orbits, the first planned 39-second descent-engine burn was started, but this was aborted after only four seconds by the Apollo Guidance Computer, which detected that the spacecraft was not going as fast as expected. This happened because one of the engine&#x27;s valves was suspected of being leaky and was not armed until it was time to ignite the engine, in orbit, which meant that the propellant took longer to reach the engine, leading to the lag. Programmers could have adjusted the software to account for this, but were not told. In addition, the tanks were only half full, and this contributed to the slowness of the ship. Had this occurred on a crewed mission, the astronauts would have been able to analyze the situation and decide whether the engine should be restarted.

Gene Kranz was the flight director for Apollo 5. Mission Control, under Kranz&#x27;s command, decided on a plan to conduct the engine and &quot;fire-in-the-hole&quot; tests under manual control. There were communication problems with the spacecraft, and omitting these tests would have meant the mission was a failure. Despite this, Kranz&#x27;s team accomplished every burn. The ascent stage spun out of control eight hours into the mission, after completion of the engine burns, due to a problem with the guidance system.

The stages were left in a low enough orbit that atmospheric drag would soon cause their orbits to decay and re-enter the atmosphere. The ascent stage re-entered on January 24 and burned up; the descent stage re-entered on February 12, falling into the Pacific several hundred miles southwest of Guam. Simulations showed that the S-IVB stage of the launch vehicle (1968-007B) re-entered about 15.5 hours into the flight.

Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager George M. Low said that Apollo 5&#x27;s success &quot;was due to the fact that we had a good piece of hardware; it was due to the fact that we had outstanding flight control teams under Gene Kranz&#x27; able leadership.&quot; Despite the trouble during the descent-engine burn, NASA deemed the mission a success in demonstrating the LM systems, and a second uncrewed flight test using LM-2 was cancelled. The first crewed LM flight took place on Apollo 9 in March 1969.

<text>Apollo 6 (April 4, 1968), also known as AS-502, was the third and final uncrewed flight in the United States&#x27; Apollo Program and the second test of the Saturn V launch vehicle. It qualified the Saturn V for use on crewed missions, and it was used beginning with Apollo 8 in December 1968.

Apollo 6 was intended to demonstrate the ability of the Saturn V&#x27;s third stage, the S-IVB, to propel itself and the Apollo spacecraft to lunar distances. Its components began arriving at the Kennedy Space Center in early 1967. Testing proceeded slowly, often delayed by testing of the Saturn V intended for Apollo 4—the inaugural launch of the Saturn V. After that uncrewed mission launched in November 1967, there were fewer delays, but enough so that the flight was postponed from March to April 1968.

The flight plan called for, following trans-lunar injection, a direct return abort using the service module&#x27;s main engine with a flight time totaling about 10 hours but vibrations damaged some of the Rocketdyne J-2 engines in the second and third stages by rupturing internal fuel lines causing a second-stage engine to shut down early. An additional second-stage engine also shut down early due to cross-wiring with the engine that had shut down. The vehicle&#x27;s onboard guidance system compensated by burning the second and third stages longer, although the resulting parking orbit was more elliptical than planned. The damaged third-stage engine failed to restart for trans-lunar injection. Flight controllers elected to repeat the flight profile of the previous Apollo 4 test, achieving a high orbit and high-speed return. Despite the engine failures, the flight provided NASA with enough confidence to use the Saturn V for crewed launches; a potential third uncrewed flight was cancelled.

==Objectives==

Apollo 6, the second test flight of the 
Saturn V launch vehicle, was intended to send a command and service module (CSM) plus a Lunar Test Article (LTA), a simulated lunar module (LM) with mounted structural vibration sensors, into a trans-lunar trajectory, with the boost from orbit to trans-lunar velocity powered by the Saturn V&#x27;s third stage, the S-IVB. That trajectory, although passing beyond the orbit of the Moon, would not encounter it. The CSM was to separate from the S-IVB soon after the burn, and the SM engine would then fire to slow the craft, dropping its apogee to and causing the CSM to return to Earth, simulating a &quot;direct-return&quot; abort. On the return leg, the engine was to fire once more to accelerate the craft to simulate conditions that the Apollo spacecraft would encounter on its return from the Moon, with a re-entry angle of −6.5 degrees and velocity of . The entire mission was to last about 10 hours.
The mission was intended to test the Saturn V launch vehicle&#x27;s ability to send the entire Apollo spacecraft to the Moon—in particular, to test the stresses on the LM and the vibration modes of the entire Saturn V with near-full loads. With the spacecraft having been qualified for crewed flight through the Apollo 4 mission (the first flight of the Saturn V), the focus was on fully qualifying the launch vehicle. Nominal completion of planned mission events through attainment of the initial parking orbit, and the restarting of the S-IVB to propel the space vehicle towards the planned distance, beyond the Moon&#x27;s orbit, was deemed sufficient to fulfill Apollo 6&#x27;s main objectives.

== Equipment ==

Apollo 6&#x27;s launch vehicle was designated AS-502, the second flight-capable Saturn V. Its payload included CSM-020, a Block I CSM that had some Block II modifications. The Block I CSM did not have the capability of docking with a Lunar Module, as the Block II did. Among the modifications to CSM-020 was a new crew hatch, intended to be tested under lunar return conditions. This new hatch replaced the one which was condemned by the Apollo 1 investigation board as too difficult to open in case of emergency, circumstances that had contributed to the deaths of three astronauts in the Apollo 1 fire of January 27, 1967. The command module used was CM-020; it carried a mission programmer and other equipment to allow it to be operated remotely.

The service module used was SM-014—the originally-planned SM for Apollo 6, SM-020, was used for Apollo 4 after its SM, SM-017, was damaged in an explosion and had to be scrapped. CM-014 was unavailable for flight as it was being used to aid the Apollo 1 investigation. Not all SM systems were activated for the short Apollo 6 mission: the radiators to remove excess heat from the electrical power system and the environmental control system were not connected.

Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, Command and Service Module manager at the Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston, was pleased with CSM-020 when it arrived at Kennedy Space Center from North American Aviation, the manufacturer, though he was upset it arrived wrapped in flammable mylar. In contrast with Apollo 1&#x27;s ill-fated CSM, which arrived with hundreds of unresolved issues, CSM-020 had only 23, mostly routine problems.

Also flown on Apollo 6 was a lunar test article: a simulated lunar module, designated as LTA-2R. It included a flight-type descent stage without landing gear, its fuel tanks filled with a water–glycol mixture and freon in its oxidizer tanks. Containing no flight systems, its ascent stage was made of ballasted aluminum and instrumented to show vibration, acoustics and structural integrity. LTA-2R remained inside the Spacecraft-Lunar Module Adapter, numbered SLA-9, throughout the flight.

==Preparation==
The S-IC first stage arrived by barge on March 13, 1967, and was erected in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) four days later; the S-IVB third stage and Instrument Unit computer both arrived on March 17. The S-II second stage was not yet ready and so the dumbbell-shaped spacer, used in preparation for Apollo 4 (which also had a delayed S-II), was substituted so testing could proceed. The spacer had the same height and mass as the S-II along with all the electrical connections. The S-II arrived May 24 and was stacked and mated into the rocket on July 7.

Apollo 6 saw the first use of the High Bay 3 of the VAB, and it was quickly discovered that its air conditioning facilities were inadequate. Portable high-capacity units were brought in to keep equipment and workers cool. There were delays in April as personnel and equipment were busy with Apollo 4, and not available for tests on Apollo 6. The S-II second stage arrived on May 25 and was erected in one of the VAB&#x27;s low bays, but work on Apollo 6 continued to be plagued by delays, many occasioned by work on Apollo 4. The vehicle was erected on Mobile Service Launcher 2, but work on the launcher&#x27;s arms, which would swing back at launch, proceeded slowly. Also slow to arrive was the CSM itself; the planned late-September arrival was pushed back two months.

After Apollo 4&#x27;s launch on November 9, 1967, the pace of the Apollo 6 project picked up, but there remained many problems with flight hardware.
The CSM was erected atop the launch vehicle on December 11, 1967, and the spacecraft stack was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A on February 6, 1968. The rollout was an all-day affair and much of it was conducted in heavy rain. Because the crawler-transporter had to halt for two hours when communications failed, the vehicle did not arrive at the launch pad until it was dark. The mobile service structure could not be moved to the launch pad for two days due to high winds.

The flight readiness test concluded on March 8, 1968, and at a review held three days later, Apollo 6 was cleared for launch contingent on the successful completion of testing and some action items identified at the meeting. Launch was set for March 28, 1968, but was postponed to April 1 and then April 3 after problems with some guidance system equipment and with fueling. The countdown demonstration test began on March 24; although it was completed within a week, the launch had to be postponed one more time. On April 3, the final countdown began with liftoff scheduled for the following day. All subsequent problems were fixed during the built-in holds in the countdown and did not delay the mission.

==Flight==

===Launch===

Apollo 6 launched from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center on April 4, 1968, at 7:00 am (1200 UT). For the first two minutes, the Saturn V launch vehicle behaved normally. Then, as the Saturn V&#x27;s S-IC first stage burned, pogo oscillations shook the vehicle. The thrust variations caused the Saturn V to experience a g-force of ±, though it had only been designed for a maximum of . The vehicle suffered no damage, other than the loss of one of the panels of the Spacecraft-Lunar Module Adapter (SLA).

NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight George Mueller explained the cause to a congressional hearing:

After the first stage was jettisoned, the S-II second stage began to experience problems with its J-2 engines. Engine number two had performance problems from 225 seconds after liftoff, abruptly worsening at T+319 seconds. At T+412 seconds the Instrument Unit shut it down altogether, and two seconds later, engine number three also shut down. The fault was in engine two, but due to cross-connection of wires, the command from the Instrument Unit also shut down engine three, which had been running normally. The Instrument Unit was able to compensate, and the remaining three engines burned for 58 seconds longer than planned. The S-IVB third stage also had to burn for 29 seconds longer than usual. The S-IVB also experienced a slight performance loss.

===Orbit===
Due to the less-than-nominal launch, the CSM and S-IVB were inserted into a by parking orbit, instead of the planned circular parking orbit. This deviation from the flight plan did not preclude continuing the mission. During the first orbit, the S-IVB maneuvered, changing its attitude towards the horizon to qualify techniques that future astronauts could use in landmark tracking. Then, after the standard two orbits to assess the vehicle&#x27;s readiness for trans-lunar injection (TLI), the S-IVB was ordered to restart, but failed to do so.

Deciding on a pre-planned alternate mission, the flight director, Clifford E. Charlesworth and his team in Mission Control chose to use the SM&#x27;s Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine to raise the spacecraft into an orbit with a high apogee (point of furthest distance from Earth), with a low perigee that would result in re-entry, as had been done in Apollo 4. This plan would complete some of the mission objectives. The SPS engine burned for 442 seconds to get to the planned apogee. There was now, however, not enough propellant to speed up the atmospheric reentry with a second SPS engine burn, and the spacecraft only entered the atmosphere at a speed of instead of the planned that would simulate a lunar return. While at high altitudes, the CM was able to return data on the extent to which future astronauts would be protected from the Van Allen Belts by the skin of the spacecraft.

Ten hours after launch, the CM landed from the planned touchdown point in the North Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii, and was lifted on board . The SM was jettisoned just before reaching the atmosphere and burned up. The S-IVB&#x27;s orbit gradually decayed and it reentered the atmosphere on April 26, 1968.

==Aftermath==
In a post-launch press conference, Apollo Program Director Samuel C. Phillips said, &quot;there&#x27;s no question that it&#x27;s less than a perfect mission&quot;, but that the launch vehicle&#x27;s reaching orbit despite the loss of two engines was &quot;a major unplanned accomplishment&quot;. Mueller called Apollo 6 &quot;a good job all around, an excellent launch, and, in balance, a successful mission ... and we have learned a great deal&quot;, but later stated that Apollo 6 &quot;will have to be defined as a failure&quot;.

The phenomenon of pogo, experienced during the first stage of the flight, was well known. However, NASA thought that the Saturn V had been &quot;detuned&quot;—that is, prevented from vibrating at its natural frequencies. Soon after the Apollo 6 flight, NASA and its contractors sought to eliminate the problems for future flights, and about 1,000 government and industry engineers worked on the problem. To damp pressure oscillations in the F-1 and J-2 engines, cavities in valves leading to them were filled with helium gas shortly before takeoff as a shock absorber. 

The problems with the S-II and the S-IVB were traced to the J-2 engines, present in both stages. Tests showed that the propellant lines leading to the spark igniters could fail in low atmospheric pressure or in vacuum. The propellant lines had metal bellows to allow for thermal expansion. In ground testing the cold propellants passing through the propellant lines would form a layer of frost on the LOX line and liquid air on the LH2 line, damping out any vibrations. In the vacuum of space, there was no such protection: the bellows vibrated rapidly and failed at peak flow, causing a burn-through of the propellant lines. The bellows were replaced with rigid bends and the lines strengthened. In Apollo 6&#x27;s wake, NASA engineers debated whether to configure the spacecraft&#x27;s emergency detection system to automatically abort in the event of excessive pogo; this plan was opposed by Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton. Instead, work began on having a &quot;pogo abort sensor&quot; to allow the flight crew to judge whether to abort, but by August 1968, it had become clear that pogo could be dealt with without such a sensor, and work on it was abandoned.

The SLA problem was caused by its honeycomb structure. As the rocket accelerated through the atmosphere, the cells expanded due to trapped air and water, causing the adapter surface to break free. In response, engineers drilled small holes in the surface to allow trapped gases to dissipate, and placed a thin layer of cork on the adapter to help absorb moisture.

NASA&#x27;s efforts were enough to satisfy the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. In late April, the committee reported that the agency had quickly analyzed and diagnosed the abnormalities of Apollo 6, and had taken corrective action. After detailed analysis of the Saturn V&#x27;s performance, and of the fixes for future launch vehicles, engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama concluded that a third uncrewed test flight of the Saturn V was unnecessary. Therefore, the next Saturn V to fly, on Apollo 8, would carry a crew (Apollo 7, the first crewed Apollo mission to fly, would be launched by a Saturn IB).

After the mission, CM-020 was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. The Apollo 6 command module is on display at the Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Cameras==

The Saturn V had several cameras affixed to it, intended to be ejected and later recovered. Three of the four cameras on board the S-IC failed to eject and thus were destroyed, and only one of the two cameras on the S-II was recovered. Two of these cameras were intended to film the S-IC/S-II separation and the other two were to film the liquid oxygen tank; the one that was recovered had filmed separation. The failure to eject was attributed to a lack of nitrogen pressure in the bottles that were to cause the ejection. The command module carried a motion picture camera, intended to be activated during launch and during re-entry. Because the mission took about ten minutes longer than planned, re-entry events were not filmed.

A 70 mm still camera operated in the CM during part of the mission, pointed at the Earth through the hatch window. Coverage included parts of the United States, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, and the western Pacific Ocean. The camera had haze-penetrating film and filter combination, with better color balance and higher resolution than photographs taken on previous American crewed missions. These proved excellent for cartographic, topographic, and geographic studies.

==Public impact==
There was little press coverage of the Apollo 6 mission mainly because on the same day as the launch, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, and President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced he would not seek reelection only four days earlier.

<text>In medicine and health-related fields, a reference range or reference interval is the range or the interval of values that is deemed normal for a physiological measurement in healthy persons (for example, the amount of creatinine in the blood, or the partial pressure of oxygen). It is a basis for comparison for a physician or other health professional to interpret a set of test results for a particular patient. Some important reference ranges in medicine are reference ranges for blood tests and reference ranges for urine tests.

The standard definition of a reference range (usually referred to if not otherwise specified) originates in what is most prevalent in a reference group taken from the general (i.e. total) population. This is the general reference range. However, there are also &quot;optimal health ranges&quot; (ranges that appear to have the optimal health impact) and ranges for particular conditions or statuses (such as pregnancy reference ranges for hormone levels).

Values within the reference range (WRR) are those within normal limits (WNL). The limits are called the &quot;upper reference limit&quot; (URL) or &quot;upper limit of normal&quot; (ULN) and the &quot;lower reference limit&quot; (LRL) or &quot;lower limit of normal&quot; (LLN). In health care–related publishing, style sheets sometimes prefer the word &quot;reference&quot; over the word &quot;normal&quot; to prevent the nontechnical senses of &quot;normal&quot; from being conflated with the statistical sense. Values outside a reference range are not pathologic, and they are not necessarily abnormal in any sense other than statistically. Nonetheless, they are indicators of probable pathosis. Sometimes the underlying cause is obvious; in other cases, challenging differential diagnosis is required to determine what is wrong and thus how to treat it.

A cutoff or threshold is a limit used for binary classification, mainly between normal versus pathological (or probably pathological). Establishment methods for cutoffs include using an upper or a lower limit of a reference range.

==Standard definition==
The standard definition of a reference range for a particular measurement is defined as the interval between which 95% of values of a reference population fall into, in such a way that 2.5% of the time a value will be less than the lower limit of this interval, and 2.5% of the time it will be larger than the upper limit of this interval, whatever the distribution of these values.

Reference ranges that are given by this definition are sometimes referred as &quot;standard ranges&quot;.

Since a range is a defined statistical value (Range (statistics)) that describes the interval between the smallest and largest values, many, including the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry prefer to use the expression reference interval rather than reference range.

Regarding the target population, if not otherwise specified, a standard reference range generally denotes the one in healthy individuals, or without any known condition that directly affects the ranges being established. These are likewise established using reference groups from the healthy population, and are sometimes termed &quot;normal ranges&quot; or &quot;normal values&quot; (and sometimes &quot;usual&quot; ranges/values). However, using the term &quot;normal&quot; may not be appropriate as not everyone outside the interval is abnormal, and people who have a particular condition may still fall within this interval.

However, reference ranges may also be established by taking samples from the whole population, with or without diseases and conditions. In some cases, diseased individuals are taken as the population, establishing reference ranges among those having a disease or condition. Preferably, there should be specific reference ranges for each subgroup of the population that has any factor that affects the measurement, such as, for example, specific ranges for each &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;age group&quot;, &quot;race&quot; or any other general determinant.

===Establishment methods===
Methods for establishing reference ranges can be based on assuming a normal distribution or a log-normal distribution, or directly from percentages of interest, as detailed respectively in following sections. When establishing reference ranges from bilateral organs (e.g., vision or hearing), both results from the same individual can be used, although intra-subject correlation must be taken into account.

====Normal distribution====

The 95% interval, is often estimated by assuming a normal distribution of the measured parameter, in which case it can be defined as the interval limited by 1.96 (often rounded up to 2) population standard deviations from either side of the population mean (also called the expected value).
However, in the real world, neither the population mean nor the population standard deviation are known. They both need to be estimated from a sample, whose size can be designated &quot;n&quot;. The population standard deviation is estimated by the sample standard deviation and the population mean is estimated by the sample mean (also called mean or arithmetic mean). To account for these estimations, the 95% prediction interval (95% PI) is calculated as:

where formula_1 is the 97.5% quantile of a Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;n&quot;−1 degrees of freedom.

When the sample size is large (&quot;n&quot;≥30) formula_2

This method is often acceptably accurate if the standard deviation, as compared to the mean, is not very large. A more accurate method is to perform the calculations on logarithmized values, as described in separate section later.

The following example of this (&quot;not&quot; logarithmized) method is based on values of fasting plasma glucose taken from a reference group of 12 subjects:

As can be given from, for example, a table of selected values of Student&#x27;s t-distribution, the 97.5% percentile with (12-1) degrees of freedom corresponds to 
formula_3
Subsequently, the lower and upper limits of the standard reference range are calculated as:
:formula_4

:formula_5

Thus, the standard reference range for this example is estimated to be 4.4 to 6.3 mmol/L.

=====Confidence interval of limit=====
The 90% &quot;confidence interval of a standard reference range limit&quot; as estimated assuming a normal distribution can be calculated by:

: Lower limit of the confidence interval = percentile limit - 2.81 × 

: Upper limit of the confidence interval = percentile limit + 2.81 × ,

where SD is the standard deviation, and n is the number of samples.

Taking the example from the previous section, the number of samples is 12 and the standard deviation is 0.42 mmol/L, resulting in:

:&quot;Lower limit of the confidence interval&quot; of the &quot;lower limit of the standard reference range&quot; = 4.4 - 2.81 × ≈ 4.1

:&quot;Upper limit of the confidence interval&quot; of the &quot;lower limit of the standard reference range&quot; = 4.4 + 2.81 × ≈ 4.7

Thus, the lower limit of the reference range can be written as 4.4 (90% CI 4.1–4.7) mmol/L.

Likewise, with similar calculations, the upper limit of the reference range can be written as 6.3 (90% CI 6.0–6.6) mmol/L.

These confidence intervals reflect random error, but do not compensate for systematic error, which in this case can arise from, for example, the reference group not having fasted long enough before blood sampling.

As a comparison, actual reference ranges used clinically for fasting plasma glucose are estimated to have a lower limit of approximately 3.8 to 4.0, and an upper limit of approximately 6.0 to 6.1.

====Log-normal distribution====

In reality, biological parameters tend to have a log-normal distribution, rather than the normal distribution or Gaussian distribution.

An explanation for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half the value of the mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (at least when measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive skewness.

As shown in diagram at right, this phenomenon has relatively small effect if the standard deviation (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to a normal distribution. Thus, the normal distribution may be more appropriate to use with small standard deviations for convenience, and the log-normal distribution with large standard deviations.

In a log-normal distribution, the geometric standard deviations and geometric mean more accurately estimate the 95% prediction interval than their arithmetic counterparts.

=====Necessity=====
Reference ranges for substances that are usually within relatively narrow limits (coefficient of variation less than 0.213, as detailed below) such as electrolytes can be estimated by assuming normal distribution, whereas reference ranges for those that vary significantly (coefficient of variation generally over 0.213) such as most hormones are more accurately established by log-normal distribution.

The necessity to establish a reference range by log-normal distribution rather than normal distribution can be regarded as depending on how much difference it would make to &quot;not&quot; do so, which can be described as the ratio:

where:
* &quot;Limitlog-normal&quot; is the (lower or upper) limit as estimated by assuming log-normal distribution
* &quot;Limitnormal&quot; is the (lower or upper) limit as estimated by assuming normal distribution.

This difference can be put solely in relation to the coefficient of variation, as in the diagram at right, where:

where:
* &quot;s.d.&quot; is the standard deviation
* &quot;m&quot; is the arithmetic mean

In practice, it can be regarded as necessary to use the establishment methods of a log-normal distribution if the difference ratio becomes more than 0.1, meaning that a (lower or upper) limit estimated from an assumed normal distribution would be more than 10% different from the corresponding limit as estimated from a (more accurate) log-normal distribution. As seen in the diagram, a difference ratio of 0.1 is reached for the lower limit at a coefficient of variation of 0.213 (or 21.3%), and for the upper limit at a coefficient of variation at 0.413 (41.3%). The lower limit is more affected by increasing coefficient of variation, and its &quot;critical&quot; coefficient of variation of 0.213 corresponds to a ratio of (upper limit)/(lower limit) of 2.43, so as a rule of thumb, if the upper limit is more than 2.4 times the lower limit when estimated by assuming normal distribution, then it should be considered to do the calculations again by log-normal distribution.

Taking the example from previous section, the standard deviation (s.d.) is estimated at 0.42 and the arithmetic mean (m) is estimated at 5.33. Thus the coefficient of variation is 0.079. This is less than both 0.213 and 0.413, and thus both the lower and upper limit of fasting blood glucose can most likely be estimated by assuming normal distribution. More specifically, the coefficient of variation of 0.079 corresponds to a difference ratio of 0.01 (1%) for the lower limit and 0.007 (0.7%) for the upper limit.

=====From logarithmized sample values=====
A method to estimate the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary base (for example &quot;e&quot;), derive the mean and standard deviation of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above that mean, and subsequently exponentiate using those two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.

The following example of this method is based on the same values of fasting plasma glucose as used in the previous section, using &quot;e&quot; as a base:

Subsequently, the still logarithmized lower limit of the reference range is calculated as:

: formula_6

and the upper limit of the reference range as:

: formula_7

Conversion back to non-logarithmized values are subsequently performed as:

: formula_8

: formula_9

Thus, the standard reference range for this example is estimated to be 4.4 to 6.4.

=====From arithmetic mean and variance=====
An alternative method of establishing a reference range with the assumption of log-normal distribution is to use the arithmetic mean and standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful in cases where a study presents only the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, while leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of normal distribution is less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic mean and standard deviation may be the only available parameters to determine the reference range.

By assuming that the expected value can represent the arithmetic mean in this case, the parameters &quot;μlog&quot; and &quot;σlog&quot; can be estimated from the arithmetic mean (&quot;m&quot;) and standard deviation (&quot;s.d.&quot;) as:
: formula_10

: formula_11

Following the exampled reference group from the previous section:

: formula_12

: formula_13

Subsequently, the logarithmized, and later non-logarithmized, lower and upper limit are calculated just as by logarithmized sample values.

====Directly from percentages of interest====
Reference ranges can also be established directly from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the measurements in the reference group. For example, if the reference group consists of 200 people, and counting from the measurement with lowest value to highest, the lower limit of the reference range would correspond to the 5th measurement and the upper limit would correspond to the 195th measurement.

This method can be used even when measurement values do not appear to conform conveniently to any form of normal distribution or other function.

However, the reference range limits as estimated in this way have higher variance, and therefore less reliability, than those estimated by an arithmetic or log-normal distribution (when such is applicable), because the latter ones acquire statistical power from the measurements of the whole reference group rather than just the measurements at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Still, this variance decreases with increasing size of the reference group, and therefore, this method may be optimal where a large reference group easily can be gathered, and the distribution mode of the measurements is uncertain.

====Bimodal distribution====

In case of a bimodal distribution (seen at right), it is useful to find out why this is the case. Two reference ranges can be established for the two different groups of people, making it possible to assume a normal distribution for each group. This bimodal pattern is commonly seen in tests that differ between men and women, such as prostate specific antigen.

===Interpretation of standard ranges in medical tests===
In case of medical tests whose results are of continuous values, reference ranges can be used in the interpretation of an individual test result. This is primarily used for diagnostic tests and screening tests, while monitoring tests may optimally be interpreted from previous tests of the same individual instead.

====Probability of random variability====
Reference ranges aid in the evaluation of whether a test result&#x27;s deviation from the mean is a result of random variability or a result of an underlying disease or condition. If the reference group used to establish the reference range can be assumed to be representative of the individual person in a healthy state, then a test result from that individual that turns out to be lower or higher than the reference range can be interpreted as that there is less than 2.5% probability that this would have occurred by random variability in the absence of disease or other condition, which, in turn, is strongly indicative for considering an underlying disease or condition as a cause.

Such further consideration can be performed, for example, by an epidemiology-based differential diagnostic procedure, where potential candidate conditions are listed that may explain the finding, followed by calculations of how probable they are to have occurred in the first place, in turn followed by a comparison with the probability that the result would have occurred by random variability.

If the establishment of the reference range could have been made assuming a normal distribution, then the probability that the result would be an effect of random variability can be further specified as follows:

The standard deviation, if not given already, can be inversely calculated by the fact that the absolute value of the difference between the mean and either the upper or lower limit of the reference range is approximately 2 standard deviations (more accurately 1.96), and thus:

The standard score for the individual&#x27;s test can subsequently be calculated as:

The probability that a value is of a certain distance from the mean can subsequently be calculated from the relation between standard score and prediction intervals. For example, a standard score of 2.58 corresponds to a prediction interval of 99%, corresponding to a probability of 0.5% that a result is at least such far from the mean in the absence of disease.

====Example====

Let&#x27;s say, for example, that an individual takes a test that measures the ionized calcium in the blood, resulting in a value of 1.30 mmol/L, and a reference group that appropriately represents the individual has established a reference range of 1.05 to 1.25 mmol/L. The individual&#x27;s value is higher than the upper limit of the reference range, and therefore has less than 2.5% probability of being a result of random variability, constituting a strong indication to make a differential diagnosis of possible causative conditions.

In this case, an epidemiology-based differential diagnostic procedure is used, and its first step is to find candidate conditions that can explain the finding.

Hypercalcemia (usually defined as a calcium level above the reference range) is mostly caused by either primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, and therefore, it is reasonable to include these in the differential diagnosis.

Using for example epidemiology and the individual&#x27;s risk factors, let&#x27;s say that the probability that the hypercalcemia would have been caused by primary hyperparathyroidism in the first place is estimated to be 0.00125 (or 0.125%), the equivalent probability for cancer is 0.0002, and 0.0005 for other conditions. With a probability given as less than 0.025 of no disease, this corresponds to a probability that the hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place of up to 0.02695. However, the hypercalcemia &quot;has occurred&quot; with a probability of 100%, resulting adjusted probabilities of at least 4.6% that primary hyperparathyroidism has caused the hypercalcemia, at least 0.7% for cancer, at least 1.9% for other conditions and up to 92.8% for that there is no disease and the hypercalcemia is caused by random variability.

In this case, further processing benefits from specification of the probability of random variability:

The value is assumed to conform acceptably to a normal distribution, so the mean can be assumed to be 1.15 in the reference group. The standard deviation, if not given already, can be inversely calculated by knowing that the absolute value of the difference between the mean and, for example, the upper limit of the reference range, is approximately 2 standard deviations (more accurately 1.96), and thus:

The standard score for the individual&#x27;s test is subsequently calculated as:

The probability that a value is of so much larger value than the mean as having a standard score of 3 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.14% (given by , with 99.7% here being given from the 68–95–99.7 rule).

Using the same probabilities that the hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place by the other candidate conditions, the probability that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place is 0.00335, and given the fact that hypercalcemia &quot;has occurred&quot; gives adjusted probabilities of 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, for primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions and no disease.

==Optimal health range==
&quot;Optimal (health) range&quot; or &quot;therapeutic target&quot; (not to be confused with biological target) is a reference range or limit that is based on concentrations or levels that are associated with optimal health or minimal risk of related complications and diseases, rather than the standard range based on normal distribution in the population.

It may be more appropriate to use for e.g. folate, since approximately 90 percent of North Americans may actually suffer more or less from folate deficiency, but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the standard reference range. In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the standard reference ranges. Vitamin D has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. uric acid, having a level not exceeding the standard reference range still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most toxins, the standard reference range is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.

A problem with optimal health range is a lack of a standard method of estimating the ranges. The limits may be defined as those where the health risks exceed a certain threshold, but with various risk profiles between different measurements (such as folate and vitamin D), and even different risk aspects for one and the same measurement (such as both deficiency and toxicity of vitamin A) it is difficult to standardize. Subsequently, optimal health ranges, when given by various sources, have an additional variability caused by various definitions of the parameter. Also, as with standard reference ranges, there should be specific ranges for different determinants that affects the values, such as sex, age etc. Ideally, there should rather be an estimation of what is the optimal value for every individual, when taking all significant factors of that individual into account - a task that may be hard to achieve by studies, but long clinical experience by a physician may make this method preferable to using reference ranges.
==One-sided cut-off values==
In many cases, only one side of the range is usually of interest, such as with markers of pathology including cancer antigen 19-9, where it is generally without any clinical significance to have a value below what is usual in the population. Therefore, such targets are often given with only one limit of the reference range given, and, strictly, such values are rather &quot;cut-off values&quot; or &quot;threshold values&quot;.

They may represent both standard ranges and optimal health ranges. Also, they may represent an appropriate value to distinguish healthy person from a specific disease, although this gives additional variability by different diseases being distinguished. For example, for NT-proBNP, a lower cut-off value is used in distinguishing healthy babies from those with acyanotic heart disease, compared to the cut-off value used in distinguishing healthy babies from those with congenital nonspherocytic anemia.

==General drawbacks==
For standard as well as optimal health ranges, and cut-offs, sources of inaccuracy and imprecision include:

* Instruments and lab techniques used, or how the measurements are interpreted by observers. These may apply both to the instruments etc. used to establish the reference ranges and the instruments, etc. used to acquire the value for the individual to whom these ranges is applied. To compensate, individual laboratories should have their own lab ranges to account for the instruments used in the laboratory.
* Determinants such as age, diet, etc. that are not compensated for. Optimally, there should be reference ranges from a reference group that is as similar as possible to each individual they are applied to, but it is practically impossible to compensate for every single determinant, often not even when the reference ranges are established from multiple measurements of the same individual they are applied to, because of test-retest variability.

Also, reference ranges tend to give the impression of definite thresholds that clearly separate &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; values, while in reality there are generally continuously increasing risks with increased distance from usual or optimal values.

With this and uncompensated factors in mind, the ideal interpretation method of a test result would rather consist of a comparison of what would be expected or optimal in the individual when taking all factors and conditions of that individual into account, rather than strictly classifying the values as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; by using reference ranges from other people.

In a recent paper, Rappoport et al. described a novel way to redefine reference range from an electronic health record system. In such a system, a higher population resolution can be achieved (e.g., age, sex, race and ethnicity-specific).

<text>Aspasia (; ; after 428 BC) was a &quot;metic&quot; woman in Classical Athens. Born in Miletus, she moved to Athens and began a relationship with the statesman Pericles, with whom she had a son named Pericles the Younger. According to the traditional historical narrative, she worked as a courtesan and was tried for &quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety), though modern scholars have questioned the factual basis for either of these claims, which both derive from ancient comedy. Though Aspasia is one of the best-attested women from the Greco-Roman world, and the most important woman in the history of fifth-century Athens, almost nothing is certain about her life.

Aspasia was portrayed in Old Comedy as a prostitute and madam, and in ancient philosophy as a teacher and rhetorician. She has continued to be a subject of both visual and literary artists until the present. From the twentieth century, she has been portrayed as both a sexualised and sexually liberated woman, and as a feminist role model fighting for women&#x27;s rights in ancient Athens.

==Sources==
Aspasia was an important figure – and the most important woman – in the history of fifth-century Athens, and is one of the women from the Greco-Roman world with the most substantial biographical traditions. The earliest literary sources to mention Aspasia, written during her lifetime, are from Athenian comedy, and in the fourth century BC she appears in Socratic dialogues. After the fourth century, she appears only in brief mentions of complete texts, or in fragments whose full context is now lost, until the second century AD, when Plutarch wrote his &quot;Life of Pericles&quot;, the longest and most complete ancient biographical treatment of Aspasia. Modern biographies of Aspasia are dependent on Plutarch, despite his writing nearly seven centuries after her death.

It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the real Aspasia from any of these sources: as Robert Wallace puts it, &quot;for us Aspasia herself possesses and can possess almost no historical reality&quot;. Aside from her name, father&#x27;s name, and place of birth, Aspasia&#x27;s biography is almost entirely unverifiable, and the ancient writings about her are frequently more of a projection of their own (without exception male) preconceptions than they are historical fact. Madeleine Henry&#x27;s full-length biography covers what is known of Aspasia&#x27;s life in only nine pages.

==Life==
===Early life===
Aspasia was born, probably no earlier than 470 BC, in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in modern Aydın Province, Turkey), the daughter of a man called Axiochus. A scholiast on Aelius Aristides wrongly claims that Aspasia was a Carian prisoner of war and a slave; this is perhaps due to confusion with the concubine of Cyrus the Younger, also called Aspasia. The circumstances surrounding Aspasia&#x27;s move to Athens are unknown. One theory, first put forward by Peter Bicknell based on a fourth-century tomb inscription, suggests that Alcibiades of Scambonidae, the grandfather of the famous Alcibiades, married Aspasia&#x27;s sister while he was in exile in Miletus following his ostracism, and Aspasia went with him when he returned to Athens. Bicknell speculates that this was motivated by the death of Aspasia&#x27;s father Axiochus in the upheaval in Miletus following its secession from the Delian League in 455/4 BC.

===Life in Athens===
According to the conventional understanding of Aspasia&#x27;s life, she worked as a courtesan and then ran a brothel. Some scholars have challenged this view. Peter Bicknell notes that the &quot;pejorative epithets applied to her by comic dramatists&quot; are unreliable. Madeleine Henry argues in her biography of Aspasia that &quot;we are not required to believe that Aspasia was a whore because a comic poet says she was&quot;, and that the portrayal of Aspasia as involved in the sex trade should &quot;be looked upon with great suspicion&quot;. Cheryl Glenn contends that Aspasia actually opened an academy for women that became &quot;a popular salon for the most influential men of the day&quot;, including Socrates, Plato, and Pericles, and Rebecca Futo Kennedy suggests that the accusations in comedy that she was a brothel-keeper derived from this. Despite these challenges to the traditional narrative, many scholars continue to believe that Aspasia worked as a courtesan or madam. Konstantinos Kapparis argues that the kinds of comic attacks made on Aspasia would not have been acceptable to make about a respectable woman, and that it is therefore likely that Aspasia did have a history as a sex worker before she began her relationship with Pericles. Whether or not Aspasia worked as a courtesan, her later life, in which she apparently achieved some degree of power, reputation, and independence, has similarities to the lives of other prominent &quot;hetairai&quot; (&quot;courtesans&quot;) such as Phryne.
In Athens, Aspasia met and began a relationship with the statesman Pericles. It is uncertain how they met; if Bicknell&#x27;s thesis is correct then she may have met him through his connection to Alcibiades&#x27; household. Kennedy speculates that when Cleinias, the son of the elder Alcibiades, died at the Battle of Coronea, Pericles may have become the &quot;kurios&quot; (guardian) of Aspasia. Aspasia&#x27;s relationship with Pericles began some time between 452 and 441. The exact nature of Pericles and Aspasia&#x27;s relationship is disputed. Ancient authors variously portrayed her as a prostitute, his concubine, or his wife. Modern scholars are also divided. Rebecca Futo Kennedy argues that they were married; Debra Nails describes Aspasia as &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; wife of Pericles&quot;; Madeleine Henry believes that Pericles&#x27; citizenship law of 451/0 made marriage between an Athenian and a &quot;metic&quot; illegal, and suggests a quasi-marital &quot;pallakia&quot; (&quot;concubinage&quot;) enforced by contract; and Sue Blundell describes Aspasia as a &quot;hetaira&quot; and mistress of Pericles.

Aspasia and Pericles had a son, Pericles the Younger, born no later than 440/39 BC. At the time of Pericles the Younger&#x27;s birth, Pericles had two legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus. In 430/29, after the death of his two elder sons, Pericles proposed an amendment to his citizenship law of 451/0 which would have made Pericles the Younger able to become a citizen and inherit. Though many scholars believe that this was specifically for Pericles, some have suggested that a more general exception was introduced, in response to the effect of the Plague of Athens and Peloponnesian War on citizen families.

According to Plutarch, Aspasia was prosecuted for &quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety) by the comic poet Hermippus. She was supposedly defended by Pericles and acquitted. Many scholars have questioned whether this trial ever took place, suggesting that the tradition derives from a fictional trial of Aspasia in a play by Hermippus. Vincent Azoulay compares the trial of Aspasia to those of Phidias and Anaxagoras, both also connected to Pericles, and concludes that &quot;none of the trials for impiety involving those close to Pericles is attested with certainty&quot;.

In 429 BC, Pericles died. According to ancient sources, Aspasia then married another politician, Lysicles, and gave birth to another son, Poristes. As &quot;Poristes&quot; is not otherwise known as a name – it means &quot;supplier&quot; or &quot;provider&quot;, and was a euphemism for &quot;thief&quot; – some scholars have argued that the name comes from a misunderstanding of a joke in a comedy. Henry doubts whether Aspasia had a child with Lysicles, and Kennedy questions whether she married Lysicles at all. Pomeroy, however, suggests that Poristes&#x27; unusual name may have been chosen by Lysicles for political reasons, to draw attention to his providing for the people of Athens. Lysicles died a year after Pericles, in 428, and nothing is recorded of Aspasia&#x27;s life after this point. It is unknown where or when she died.

==Legacy==
===Ancient reception===

In the classical period, two primary schools of thought developed around Aspasia. One tradition, deriving from Old Comedy, emphasises her influence over Pericles and her involvement in the sex trade; the other, which can be traced back to fourth-century philosophy, concentrates on her intellect and rhetorical skill. Some scholars have also proposed that the portrayal of several female characters in Athenian tragedy commented on Aspasia, including Euripides&#x27; Medea and Phaedra, and Sophocles&#x27; Jocasta.

====Comic tradition====
The only surviving ancient sources to discuss Aspasia which were written during her life are from comedy. The surviving comic tradition about Aspasia – unlike her male contemporaries – focuses on her sexuality. Aristophanes, the only writer of Old Comedy for whom complete works survive, refers to Aspasia only once in his surviving corpus, in &quot;Acharnians&quot;. In a passage parodying the beginning of Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, Aristophanes jokes that the Megarian decree was retaliation for the kidnapping of two &quot;pornai&quot; (&quot;prostitutes&quot;) from Aspasia. A similar charge, attributed by Plutarch to Duris of Samos, that Aspasia was responsible for Athens&#x27; involvement in the Samian War, may have derived from this. The mention of Aspasia&#x27;s &quot;pornai&quot; in &quot;Acharnians&quot; is also the earliest known instance of the tradition that she worked as a brothel-keeper.

Outside of Aristophanes, mentions of Aspasia are known from the surviving fragments of Cratinus and Eupolis. In a fragment of Cratinus&#x27; &quot;Cheirons&quot;, Aspasia is described as &quot;Hera-Aspasia, a dog-eyed concubine&quot;. Eupolis mentions Aspasia by name in three surviving fragments. In &quot;Proslapatians&quot;, she is compared to Helen of Troy – like Aspasia, blamed for starting a war – and in &quot;Philoi&quot; to Omphale, who owned Herakles as a slave. Eupolis also alluded to Aspasia in &quot;Demes&quot;, where Pericles, having been brought back from the dead, asks after his son; he is informed that he is alive, but is ashamed of having a &quot;porne&quot; as a mother. Aspasia is also known to have been mentioned by Kallias, though the scholion to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Menexenus&quot; which reports this is garbled and it is uncertain what Kallias said about her. She may also have appeared in a play by Hermippus – this is possibly the source of the anecdote told by Plutarch that Aspasia was prosecuted by him for &quot;asebeia&quot; and for supplying free-born women for Pericles to have sex with. Later authors to follow the comic tradition in focusing on Aspasia&#x27;s sexuality and improper influence over Pericles, for example in Clearchus&#x27; &quot;Erotika&quot;.

====Philosophical tradition====

In the fourth century, four philosophers are known to have written Socratic dialogues which feature Aspasia. Those by Antisthenes and Plato portray her negatively, in a way resembling her portrayal in comedy; Aeschines and Xenophon show her in a more positive light. In the dialogues by Plato, Xenophon, and Aeschines, Aspasia is portrayed as an educated, skilled rhetorician, and a source of advice for marital concerns. Armand D&#x27;Angour has argued that Diotima, to whom Socrates attributes his understanding of love in &quot;Symposium&quot;, is based on her. In the Hellenistic and Roman periods, some authors followed Aspasia&#x27;s more positive portrayal in Socratic literature, distancing her from prostitution and situating her in a tradition of wise women. Didymus Chalcenterus wrote about exceptional women in history in his &quot;Symposiaka&quot;, downplaying her sexuality but noting her influence on Socrates&#x27; philosophy and Pericles&#x27; rhetoric. Both Athenaeus and Maximus of Tyre report that Socrates advised Callias to have Aspasia teach his son. In Rome, Cicero and Quintillian used the conversation between Aspasia and Xenophon in Aeschines&#x27; dialogue as a good example of &quot;inductio&quot;.

===Modern reception===

Aspasia&#x27;s earliest post-classical portrayal is in the letters of Héloïse to Abelard. Héloïse cites Aspasia&#x27;s conversation with Xenophon and his wife in Aeschines&#x27; dialogue, which she probably knew through Cicero&#x27;s reference to it, and proposes Aspasia as an example for how she should live her own life.

In the late medieval and early modern periods, Aspasia appeared in several catalogues, a fashionable genre at the time. She was included in three &quot;medallion books&quot;, with an imagined portrait and a brief biography. The first of these was Guillaume Rouille&#x27;s &quot;Promptuarium Iconum&quot;, which derives its depiction of Aspasia from Plutarch and focuses on her relationship with Pericles; in Giovanni Angelo Canini&#x27;s &quot;Iconografia&quot;, Aspasia is depicted wearing a helmet and shield. Aspasia also featured in two catalogues of women in this period as a teacher and philosopher: in Arcangela Tarabotti&#x27;s &quot;Tirannia Paterna&quot;, which portrays her as a teacher of rhetoric, and Gilles Ménage&#x27;s &quot;Historia Mulierum Philosopharum&quot;, in which Aspasia is described as teaching rhetoric to Pericles and Socrates, and philosophy to Socrates.
By the eighteenth century, Aspasia was widely enough known to be included in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where depictions of her were largely based on Plutarch. In 1736, Jean Leconte de Bièvre published the &quot;Histoire de deux Aspasies&quot;, also based on Plutarch&#x27;s depiction, which portrayed Aspasia as an educated woman and Pericles&#x27; teacher as well as his wife. The eighteenth century also saw the first known image of Aspasia to be created by a woman, Marie Bouliard&#x27;s &quot;Aspasie&quot;. The painting depicts Aspasia with one breast bared, looking into a handheld mirror and with a scroll in her other hand. Though the bare breast references the eroticised traditions surrounding Aspasia, Madeleine Henry argues that the portrait differs from more pornographic depictions of women, with Aspasia looking into the mirror rather than out at the viewer, and holding a scroll rather than a cosmetic object such as a comb.

In the nineteenth century, Plutarch&#x27;s narrative dominated the interpretation of Aspasia in both novels and paintings. In the visual arts, the sexualised side of Aspasia was represented by Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s painting &quot;Socrates Seeking Alcibiades in the House of Aspasia&quot;, but this pornographised representation was relatively uncommon. Honoré Daumier&#x27;s lithograph of &quot;Socrates at the House of Aspasia&quot; depicts Aspasia as a &quot;lorette&quot;, an ambiguous social position which referred to &quot;loose, vulgar or &#x27;liberated&#x27; women&quot;. Other artists of the period depicted an Aspasia active in public life, and interacting with the most renowned men of the period. In Henry Holiday&#x27;s painting of &quot;Aspasia on the Pnyx&quot;, she is shown with another woman at the site of the Athenian assembly, the center of male public space in the city, while in two paintings by Nicolas-André Monsiau she is shown at the centre of discussions with celebrated Athenian intellectuals and politicians. In &quot;Socrates and Aspasia&quot;, she converses with Socrates and Pericles; in &quot;Aspasia in Conversation with the Most Illustrious Men of Athens&quot;, Euripides, Sophocles, Plato, and Xenophon are also among those included. In both of these paintings, Aspasia is speaking and commanding the attention of these men. Melissa Ianetta argues that Germaine de Staël&#x27;s novel &quot;Corinne&quot; models its heroine after Aspasia, placing her in the same tradition of feminine rhetorical skill.

An alternative nineteenth-century representation of Aspasia positioned her as a respectable wife. The authors Walter Savage Landor and Elizabeth Lynn Linton portrayed Aspasia as a good Victorian wife to Pericles in their novels &quot;Pericles and Aspasia&quot; and &quot;Amymone: A Romance of the Days of Pericles&quot;. Lawrence Alma-Tadema&#x27;s painting &quot;Phidias and the Frieze of the Parthenon&quot; also shows Aspasia as a respectable companion to men. By contrast, Robert Hamerling&#x27;s novel &quot;Aspasia&quot; showed her as a proto-feminist with far more agency than these romanticised accounts.

The twentieth century saw on the one hand increasing interest in Aspasia separately from her relationships with men, and on the other more prurient concern with her sexuality. The former strand of Aspasia&#x27;s reception saw the Latvian author, feminist, and politician Elza Rozenberga, who took the pseudonym Aspazija, model her campaigning for women&#x27;s rights after what she saw as Aspasia&#x27;s example. Aspasia was also taken as a feminist role-model by Judy Chicago, who included her as one of the thirty-nine women given a place in her artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;. Recent novels have tended towards the more explicitly sexualised portrayal of Aspasia, including &quot;Achilles His Armour&quot; by the classicist Peter Green, Madelon Dimont&#x27;s &quot;Darling Pericles&quot;, and Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;Glory and Lightning&quot;, in which Aspasia is raised as a courtesan. The 2018 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;, which features Aspasia in a major role, follows the ancient tradition which portrayed her as a . She is depicted as using her femininity to gain political power by manipulating men and through her connections to other women across the Greek world.

<text>The brachial artery is the major blood vessel of the (upper) arm. It is the continuation of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the cubital fossa at the elbow. It then divides into the radial and ulnar arteries which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm. The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, with the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff), often used to measure the blood pressure.

The brachial artery is closely related to the median nerve; in proximal regions, the median nerve is immediately lateral to the brachial artery. Distally, the median nerve crosses the medial side of the brachial artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint.

==Structure==
The brachial artery gives rise to the following branches:

*Profunda brachii artery (deep brachial artery)
*Superior ulnar collateral artery
*Inferior ulnar collateral artery
*Radial artery (used to palpate radial pulse)(a terminal branch)
*Ulnar artery (a terminal branch)
* Nutrient branches to the humerus

It also gives rise to important anastomotic networks of the elbow and (as the axillary artery) the shoulder.

The biceps head is lateral to the brachial artery. The median nerve is medial to the brachial artery for most of its course.
fracture of lower end of humerous may cause rupture of bracheal artery

<text>John William Sterling (May 12, 1844 – July 5, 1918) was a founding partner of Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP and major benefactor to Yale University.

==Early life and career==
John William Sterling was born in Stratford, Connecticut, the son of Catherine Tomlinson (Plant) and John William Sterling. He graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in 1864 and was a member of Skull and Bones and president of Brothers in Unity during his senior year. He graduated from Columbia Law School as the valedictorian of the class of 1867 and was admitted to the bar in that year. He obtained an M.A. degree in 1874. He became a corporate lawyer in New York City, and in 1871 helped found the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling, which represented Jay Gould, Henry Ford, the Rockefeller family, and Standard Oil.

On his death in 1918, Sterling left a residuary estate of $15 million to Yale, at the time the &quot;largest sum of money ever donated to an institution of higher learning in history&quot;—equivalent to about $200 million in 2011 dollars. After the estate appraisal was complete a year later, the Yale bequest was &quot;about $18 million.&quot; He required Yale to fund &quot;at least one enduring, useful and architecturally beautiful building, which will constitute a fitting Memorial of my gratitude to and affection for my &quot;alma mater&quot;&quot; and &quot;the foundation of Scholarships, Fellowships or Lectureships, the endowment of new professorships and the establishment of special funds for prizes&quot;—these mandates led to the construction of the Sterling Memorial Library, Sterling Law Building, the Hall of Graduate Studies, and the Sterling Hall of Medicine, and the endowment of the Sterling Professorships.

==Personal life==
Sterling never married. In 2003, historian Jonathan Ned Katz uncovered evidence that Sterling lived for nearly fifty years in a same-sex intimate partnership with cotton broker James O. Bloss.

==Death==
Sterling died July 5, 1918, while staying at the fishing lodge of Lord Mount Stephen in Grand-Métis, Quebec; he is entombed at Woodlawn Cemetery.

Sterling&#x27;s sister Cordelia donated the Sterling House and its surrounding estate—part of the Sterling Homestead—to Stratford, Connecticut.

<text>An operator logo is a logo which appears on the status screen of a mobile phone. Originally intended as a way for phone companies to brand phones attached to their networks, the operator logo has since become a method by which owners may customise their phones to reflect their own interests. It helped kick off mobile phone content advertising which became particularly prominent with ring tone adverts.

==History==
The older mobile phones of 90&#x27;s (Black &amp; white LCD Screen) had options to show telecom operator logo instead of the showing the name in plain text. Later various companies provided custom logo and designs to set as Operator logo. These logos can be shared by SMS with other people.

Later on when color mobiles came to market, Colorful logo option came to mobile devices. An industry has sprung up around the use of these logos, and around ring tones, tailored towards phones, such as those made by Nokia, which can receive new logos in a text message.

Several mobile phone companies provide services on their websites where users can design their own logos, and there is also software available which can be used to create them.

<doc id="231462" wikidata="Q1364876" url="?curid=231462" title="Median nerve">
<text>The median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb. It is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus.

The median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, and has contributions from ventral roots of C6-C7 (lateral cord) and C8 and T1 (medial cord).

The median nerve is the only nerve that passes through the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the disability that results from the median nerve being pressed in the carpal tunnel.

==Structure==
The median nerve arises from the branches from lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, courses through the anterior part of arm, forearm, and hand, and terminates by supplying the muscles of the hand.

===Arm===
After receiving inputs from both the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, the median nerve enters the arm from the axilla at the inferior margin of the teres major muscle. It then passes vertically down and courses lateral to the brachial artery between biceps brachii (above) and brachialis (below). At first, it is lateral to the artery and lies anterior to the shoulder joint; it then crosses anteriorly to run medial to the artery in the distal arm and into the cubital fossa. Inside the cubital fossa, the median nerve passes medial to the brachial artery. The median nerve gives off an articular branch to the elbow joint. A branch to pronator teres muscle arise from the median nerve immediately above the elbow joint.

===Forearm===
The median nerve continues in the cubital fossa medial to the brachial artery and passes between the two heads of the pronator teres, deep to the bicipital aponeurosis (aponeurosis of biceps) and superficial the brachialis muscle. It crosses the ulnar artery (branch of brachial artery) while being separated by the deep head of the pronator teres. It then travels between the flexor digitorum superficialis (above) and flexor digitorum profundus (below). The median nerve is accompanied by the median artery (a branch of anterior interosseous artery) during this course. Then, about 5 cm above the flexor retinaculum (wrist), it emerges between the flexor digitorum superficialis (medially) and the flexor carpi radialis (laterally) into the hand.

The main trunk of the median nerve innervates the superficial and deep groups of the muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris. The median nerve does this by giving off two branches as it courses through the forearm:
* &quot;Muscular branches&quot; are given off in the cubital fossa to supply flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis.
* The &quot;anterior interosseous branch&quot; is given off in the upper part of the forearm, courses with the anterior interosseous artery and innervates flexor pollicis longus and the lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus (the ulnar half is supplied by ulnar nerve, as is the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle). It ends with its innervation of pronator quadratus. In addition to its supply to muscles, this nerve also supplies the distal radioulnar joint and wrist joint.

The median nerve also gives off sensory and other branches in the forearm. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises at the distal part of the forearm. It supplies sensory innervation to the thenar eminence of the palm and the central palm. Articular branches are given to the elbow joint and proximal radioulnar joint. Vascular branches supply the radial and ulnar arteries. Meanwhile, a communicating branch is given to the ulnar nerve.

===Hand===
The median nerve enters the hand through the carpal tunnel, deep to the flexor retinaculum along with the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor pollicis longus. From there, it is divided into recurrent muscular branch and digital cutaneous branch:
* The muscular branch (also known as recurrent branch) supplies the thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and superficial part of flexor pollicis brevis)
* Digital cutaneous to the proper palmar digital branch and the common palmar digital branch: The proper palmar digital branch gives out three digital branches to the lateral one and a half digits (two digital branches to the thumb, one digital branch to the lateral side of the index finger). The digital branch to the index finger also supplies the first lumbrical. The common palmar digital branch divides further into two branches. Both the medial and lateral branches supply the second and third interdigital clefts with adjoining index, middle, and lateral half of ring finger. The lateral branch also supplies the second lumbrical.

===Variation===

The naturally occurring anomalies of the median nerve are:
* Bifurcation of the median nerve typically occurs after the nerve exits the carpal tunnel; however, in a small percentage (5-10%) of individuals, the median nerve bifurcates more proximal in the carpal tunnel, wrist, or forearm.
* During gestation, a median artery that serves the hand retracts. However, in some individuals, the median artery does not retract and follows the course next to the median nerve into the hand.
* Martin-Gruber anastomoses can occur when branches of the median nerve cross-over in the forearm and merge with the ulnar nerve to innervate portions of the forehand.
* Riche-Cannieu anastomosis can occur when a connection exists between recurrent branch of the median nerve and deep branch of the ulnar nerve of the hand.

==Function==
The median nerve is the main nerve of the front of the forearm. It supplies the muscles of the front of the forearm and muscles of the thenar eminence, thus controlling the coarse movements of the hand. Therefore, it is also called &quot;labourer&#x27;s nerve&quot;.

===Arm===
The median nerve has no voluntary motor or cutaneous function in the brachium. It gives vascular branches to the wall of the brachial artery. These vascular branches carry sympathetic fibers.

===Forearm===
It innervates all of the flexors in the forearm, except flexor carpi ulnaris and that part of flexor digitorum profundus that supplies the fourth and fifth digits. The latter two muscles are supplied by the ulnar nerve (specifically the muscular branches of ulnar nerve).

The main portion of the median nerve supplies these muscles:

Superficial group:
* Pronator teres
* Flexor carpi radialis
* Palmaris longus

Intermediate group:
* Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle

The anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve supplies these muscles:

Deep group:
* Flexor digitorum profundus (only the lateral half)
* Flexor pollicis longus
* Pronator quadratus

===Hand===
In the hand, the median nerve supplies motor innervation to the first and second lumbrical muscles. It also supplies the muscles of the thenar eminence by a recurrent thenar branch. The rest of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve.

The median nerve innervates the skin of the palmar (volar) side of the index finger, thumb, middle finger, and half the ring finger, and the nail bed. The radial aspect of the palm is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which leaves the nerve proximal to the wrist creases. This palmar cutaneous branch travels in a separate fascial groove adjacent to the flexor carpi radialis and then superficial to the flexor retinaculum. It is, therefore, spared in carpal tunnel syndrome.

==Clinical significance==

=== Injury ===
Injury of median nerve at different levels causes different syndromes with varying motor and sensory deficits.

At the shoulder
* Injury can occur at the brachial plexus

Above the elbow
* Common mechanism of injury: a supracondylar humerus fracture
* Motor deficit:
** Loss of pronation of forearm, weakness in flexion of the hand at the wrist, loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, loss of abduction and opposition of thumb.
** Presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest, due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb, and an adducted thumb.
** Presence of benediction sign when attempting to form a fist, due to loss of flexion of radial half of digits.
* Sensory deficit: loss of sensation in lateral digits including their nail beds, and the thenar area.

At the elbow
* Entrapment at the level of the elbow or the proximal forearm could be due to the pronator teres syndrome.

Within the proximal forearm: anterior interosseous syndrome
* Injury to the anterior interosseous branch in the forearm causes the anterior interosseous syndrome
* Common mechanisms: tight cast, forearm bone fracture
* Motor deficit: loss of pronation of forearm, loss of flexion of radial half of digits and thumb
* Sensory deficit: none

At the wrist
* Common mechanism: wrist laceration
* Motor deficit:
** Weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, loss of abduction and opposition of thumb
** Presence of an ape hand deformity when the hand is at rest may be likely, due to an hyperextension of index finger and thumb, and an adducted thumb. Nevertheless, an ape hand deformity is not a requirement for a carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis.
** Presence of a benediction sign when attempting to form a fist, due to weakness in flexion of radial half of digits.
* Sensory deficit: loss of sensation in lateral digits including their nail beds, and the thenar area.

Within the wrist: carpal tunnel syndrome
* Common mechanism: carpal tunnel syndrome, an injury by nerve compression in the carpal tunnel, without transection of the median nerve, due to overuse by activities such as keyboard typing and cooking
* Motor deficit:
** Weakness in flexion of radial half of digits and thumb, weakness in abduction and opposition of thumb
** Presence of an ape hand deformity or when attempting to form a fist, the benediction sign, due to compression of the median nerve, as opposed to complete median nerve palsy
* Sensory deficit: numbness and tingling in lateral digits including their nail beds, but excluding the thenar eminence which is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve Unlike in wrist laceration, sensation still occurs in the area of the central palm. Sensation is not lost because the palmar cutaneous branch runs above the flexor retinaculum, and is not affected in compression in carpal tunnel syndrome.

=== Assessment ===

When symptoms of tingling, numbness, pain, or muscle weakness occur, various assessments are conducted, including patient-reported subjective surveys, provocative tests meant to elicit or exacerbate symptoms, sensory and motor function tests, and diagnostic equipment.
* Common patient-reported measures of symptoms and function are the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)and, its short version, the CTS-6, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), and the Upper Limb Functional Index.
* Provocative testing to examine free movement and gliding for the entire length of the median nerve is completed using an upper limb tension test. Phalen&#x27;s, Tinel&#x27;s, and Durkan&#x27;s tests are used to assess compression at the wrist in the case of carpal tunnel syndrome.
* Sensory testing is conducted across the dermatomes associated with sensory functioning of the median nerve using monofilaments or two-point discrimination instruments. Motor function tests focus on examining the use of the thenar muscles within the hand most affected by median nerve injury. Common functional tests include the evaluation of grip and pinch strength using dynamometry and gross and fine motor coordination ability using the Purdue pegboard, 9-hole peg test, and other assessment tools.
* Electrodiagnostic testing using surface or needle electromyography is a widely used diagnostic assessment that can identify a specific location of nerve compression/injury or rule out other central nervous system conditions that could mimic a median nerve injury. Sonographic imaging can evaluate the median nerve&#x27;s size, shape, and movement for comparison to normative values and identify locations or causes of nerve compression to support intervention selection, particularly within the carpal tunnel.

Combinations of these assessments are useful for ruling out other conditions, identifying the location of nerve injury or compression, uncovering underlying causes of symptoms (such as tendonitis), determining the severity of the nerve injury, and developing individualized treatment plans based on patient characteristics. Such combinations of median nerve evaluations have been most widely validated in the assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome.

<text>A ringtone is the sound made by a telephone to indicate an incoming telephone call. Originally referring to the sound of electromechanical striking of bells or gongs, the term refers to any sound by any device alerting of an incoming call.

On plain old telephone services (POTS), starting in the late 19th century, the signal is created by superimposing ringing voltage on the direct current line voltage. Electronic telephones could produce a warbling, chirping, or other sounds. Variations of the cadence or tone of the ring signal, called &quot;distinctive ringing&quot;, can be used to indicate characteristics of incoming calls.

Modern telephones, especially smartphones, are manufactured with a preloaded selection of ringtones. Customers can buy or generate custom ringtones for installation on the device as a default ringtone or a distinctive ringtone used to indicate characteristics of incoming calls. Digital ringtones were a large market in the 2000s, at its peak generating up to $4 billion in worldwide sales in 2004, but the market declined steeply by the end of the decade.

==Background and history==
A telephone rings when the telephone network indicates an incoming call, so that the recipient is alerted of the call attempt. Landline telephones typically receive an electric alternating current signal, called &quot;power ringing&quot; or &quot;ringing signal&quot;, generated by the telephone exchange to which the telephone is connected. The ringing current originally operated an electric bell. For mobile phones, the network sends a message to the recipient&#x27;s device, which may activate a sound, or a visual or vibrating indication.

On a POTS interface, this signal is created by superimposing ringing voltage atop the −48 VDC already on the line. This is done at the Central Office, or a neighborhood multiplexer called an &quot;SLC&quot; for Subscriber Line Carrier. (SLC is a trademark of Alcatel-Lucent, but is often used generically.) Telephones with electromagnetic ringers are still in widespread use. The ringing signal in North America is normally specified at ca. 90 volts AC with a frequency of 20 hertz. In Europe it is around 60–90 VAC with a frequency of 25 Hz. Some non-Bell Company system party lines in the US used multiple frequencies for selective ringing. Ringing voltage is produced by various sources. Large central offices used motor-driven generator sets for both ringing and other signals such as dial tone and busy signals. In smaller offices, special sub-cycle magnetic oscillators were used. Typically, solid-state oscillators have replaced them. Originally this voltage was used to trigger an electromagnet to ring a bell installed inside the telephone, or in a nearby mounted ringer box. 

Fixed phones of the late 20th century and later detect this ringing current voltage and trigger a warbling tone electronically. Mobile phones have been fully digital since the early 1990s second-generation (&quot;2G&quot;) devices, hence are signaled to ring as part of the protocol they use to communicate with the cell base stations.

While the sound produced is still called a &quot;ring&quot;, some phones electronically produce a warbling, chirping, or other sound. Variation of the ring signal can be used to indicate characteristics of incoming calls. For example, ringing bursts with a shorter interval between them might be used to signal a call from a given number.

In POTS switching systems, ringing is said to be &quot;tripped&quot; when the impedance of the entire telephone line (&quot;local loop&quot;) is reduced when the telephone handset is lifted off the hook. This signals that the telephone call has been answered. The telephone exchange immediately removes the ringing signal from the line and connects the call.

The ringing pattern is known as ring cadence, in which the high voltage ring current is switched on and off to create the pattern. In North America, the standard ring cadence is two seconds of ringing followed by four seconds of silence. In Australia and the UK, the standard ring cadence is 400 ms on, 200 ms off, 400 ms on, 2000 ms off. These patterns may vary from region to region, and other patterns are used in different countries around the world. Some central offices offer distinctive ring to identify one of multiple telephone numbers assigned to the same line, a pattern once widely used on party line (telephony).

In many systems, including North America Bellcore standards, Caller ID signals are sent during the silent interval between the first and second bursts of the ringing signals.

The caller is informed about the progress of the call by the audible ringing signal, often called &quot;ringback tone&quot;. Power ringing and audible ringing are not generally synchronized.

Seven different gong combinations for the &quot;C&quot; type ringer were included in the model 500 and 2500 landline telephone sets. These gongs provided &quot;distinctive tones&quot; for hearing-impaired customers and also made it possible to distinguish the specific telephone that was ringing when several telephones were placed in close proximity. A &quot;Bell Chime&quot; was also offered, which could be set to sound like a doorbell or to ring like a standard telephone.

While rings, ringers, ring signals, or what might be viewed as the call signals which are the predecessors of ringtones, date back to the beginnings of telephony, modern ringtones appeared in the 1960s and have expanded into tunes and many customizable tones or melodies. Arguably the first ringtone (in the modern sense) appeared in the movie &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; in 1966, where the head of the secret government agency had a red phone that connected directly to the President and rang with a distinctive musical ringtone.

Following a 1975 FCC ruling which permitted third-party devices to be connected to phone lines, manufacturers produced accessory telephone ringers which rang with electronic tones or melodies rather than mechanical bells. People also made their own ringers which used the chip from a musical greeting card to play a melody on the arrival of a call. One such ringer, described in a 1989 book, even features a toy dog which barks and wags its tail when a call arrives. Eventually, electronic telephone ringers became the norm. Some of these ringers produced a single tone, but others produced a sequence of two or three tones or a musical melody. Some novelty phones have a ringer to match, such as a duck that quacks or a car that honks its horn.

Polyphonic ringtone technology dates back to 1999, when the Yamaha MA-1 sound chip was introduced, including four 2-op FM synthesis channels. Ringtones played on the MA series chips are in the MIDI-based synthetic music mobile application format (SMAF). It was succeeded by the MA-2 in 2000, which includes 16 channels with support for ADPCM samples, and the MA-3 in 2001 which includes 32 FM channels and 8 wavetable channels. One of the first software-based polyphonic synths included on phones was miniBAE, developed by Thomas Dolby&#x27;s audio technology company Beatnik. It is an optimized version of Beatnik Audio Engine, which was previously used in products such as WebTV. The first phone to include this synth was the Nokia 3510, released in 2002.

==Types==
*Monophonic: The original ringtones play only one note at a time.
*Polyphonic: A polyphonic ringtone can consist of several notes at a time. The first polyphonic ring tones used sequenced recording methods such as MIDI. Such recordings specify what synthetic instrument should play a note at a given time, and the actual instrument sound is dependent upon the playback device. Later, synthesized instruments could be included along with the composition data, which allowed for more varied sounds beyond the built-in sound bank of each phone. 
*Truetone: A truetone, also known as &quot;realtone&quot;, &quot;Jayliar tone&quot;, &quot;superphonic&quot; ringtone, is an audio recording, typically in a common format such as MP3 or AAC. Truetones, which are often excerpts from songs, became popular as ringtones. The first truetone service was started by au in December 2002. &quot;My Gift to You&quot; by Chemistry was the first song to be distributed as a truetone. This truetone (in Japanese &quot;chaku-uta&quot;) was released in time for Chemistry&#x27;s concert tour in Japan.
*Sing tone: A sing tone is a ringtone created in karaoke style, combining a user&#x27;s recorded voice with a backing track.

==Encoding formats==
Most modern phones support ringtones in MP3 format, and other common audio formats such as AAC, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, and MIDI are often supported as well. Less common formats include:

* 3GP: A multimedia container format that can be used for video ringtones.
* AMR: Audio compression format specialized in speech used by Nokia before mp3 became standard.
* eMelody: Older monophonic Ericsson format.
* iMelody: Monophonic format developed by Ericsson to replace eMelody. 
* KWS: Kyocera&#x27;s ringer format.
* MOT: An older ringer format for Motorola phones.
* Music Macro Language (MML), originally used in early computer and video games, later used in BASIC implementations and ringtones
* .nrt / .rng / .rt / .ext: Nokia&#x27;s monophonic format.
* Nokia / SCKL / OTT: Nokia Smart Messaging format. Allows users to share ringtones via text message.
* PDB: Palm database. This is the format used to load ringtones on PDA phones such as the Kyocera 6035 and the Handspring Treo.
* PMD: Format co-created by Qualcomm and Japanese company Faith which can include MIDI, sampled (PCM) audio, static graphics, animation, text, vibration and LED events.
* QCP: File format generated by Qualcomm PureVoice software. Especially well-suited for simple vocal recordings.
* RMF: a polyphonic format with embedded audio used on Symbian and Danger Hiptop devices.
* RTTTL/RTX: Nokia-developed text formats for Smart Messaging. 
* Samsung: Proprietary key press format.
* Siemens: Can create and read in a Siemens text file format.
* Siemens SEO: Siemens SEO binary format.
* SMAF: Yamaha music format that combines MIDI with instrument sound data (aka Module files). Filenames have the extension &quot;MMF&quot; or &quot;MLD&quot;. 
* SRT: Sipura ringtone for Sipura Technology VoIP phones.
* Mobile XMF: Many of Nokia&#x27;s 2004-2013 phones support this format.

==Generation software==
A ringtone maker is an application that converts a user chosen song or other audio file for use as a ringtone of a mobile phone. The ringtone file is installed in the mobile phone either by direct cable connection, Bluetooth, text messaging, or e-mail. On many websites, users may create ringtones from digital music or audio.

The earliest ringtone maker was Harmonium, developed by Vesa-Matti Paananen, a Finnish computer programmer, and released in 1997 for use with Nokia smart messaging. Some phone manufacturers included features for users to create music tones, either with a &quot;melody composer&quot; or a sample/loop arranger, such as the MusicDJ software included on many Sony Ericsson phones. These often use encoding formats only available to one particular phone model or brand. Other formats, such as MIDI or MP3, are often supported; they must be downloaded to the phone before they can be used as a normal ringtone.

In 2005, &quot;SmashTheTones&quot;, now &quot;Mobile17&quot;, became the first third-party solution for ringtone creation online without requiring downloadable software or a digital audio editor. Later, iPhones included the ability to create a ringtone from a song purchased with the iTunes library.

==Commercial sales and popularity==
In September 1996, IDO sold Digital Minimo D319 by Denso. It was the first mobile phone where a user could input an original melody, rather than having to use preloaded melodies. These phones proved to be popular in Japan, with a book being published in 1998 providing details about how to customize phones to play snippets of popular songs, selling more than 3.5 million copies.

The first downloadable mobile ringtone service was created and delivered in Finland in 1998 when Radiolinja (a Finnish mobile operator now known as Elisa) started their service called Harmonium, invented by Vesa-Matti Pananen. Harmonium contained both tools for individuals to create monophonic ring tones and a mechanism to deliver them over-the-air (OTA) via SMS to a mobile handset. In November 1998, Digitalphone Groupe (SoftBank Mobile) started a similar service in Japan.

Andy Clarke, while working for UK phone provider Orange, helped created the B5 Ringtone License with the UK&#x27;s Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society in 1998. In 1999, Clarke registered ringtone.net and setup what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first &quot;legal&quot; ringtone business. Scott Memphis, leader singer of Sunday Morning Sanctuary, wrote a 2010 hit entitled, &quot;Ringtones &amp; Lullabies&quot; inspired by with the B5 Ringtone Licensing of 1998.

The fact that consumers were willing to pay up to $5 for ringtones, made mobile music a profitable part of the music industry. A significant portion of sales went to the cell phone provider. The Manhattan-based marketing and consulting firm Consect estimated ringtones generated $4 billion in worldwide sales in 2004. According to &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, ringtones generated more than $2 billion in worldwide sales during 2005. The rise of sound files also contributed to the popularization of ringtones. In 2003 for example, the Japanese ringtone market, which alone was worth US$900 million, experienced US$66.4 million worth of sound file ringtone sales. In 2003, the global ringtone industry was worth somewhere between US$2.5 and US$3.5 billion. In 2009, the research firm SNL Kagan estimated that sales of ringtones in the United States peaked at $714 million in 2007.

==Cult following==

Preloaded ringtones have also developed a cult following over the years. A Twitter account named Tech Product Bangers (formerly known as Ringtone Bangers) launched in 2020, which originally only posted preloaded ringtones from mobile phones, but over time has begun to post other music related to technology such as demoes from keyboards and software installation background music, and accordingly changed its name. The account has also published interviews with composers who worked on ringtones. Thomas Dolby, who founded Beatnik and later Retro Ringtones, stated he is &quot;pleased to see an upsurge of interest in classic ringtones&quot;, while several composers who worked at Nokia have expressed surprise over the interest in ringtones.

==Decline of popularity==
SNL Kagan estimated U.S. sales of ringtones in 2008 declined to $541 million, as consumers utilized third-party software and tutorials to create ringtones themselves. Another reason for the decline of ringtones is due to the increase of mobile devices in the late 2000s having internet connectivity, allowing consumers to download full songs from marketplaces such as iTunes and Amazon, rather than buying excerpts for $5 through text. The technological advancements of smartphones is also considered to be a factor in the decline of ringtones, with consumers shifting their focus to software such as games and social media. The decline of ringtones has further continued throughout the 2010s and 2020s, with many people setting the ringtone to silent; Sensor Tower reported in 2021 that ringtone app downloads decreased by 20% from 2016 to 2020.

<doc id="231465" wikidata="Q5025069" url="?curid=231465" title="Camberwick Green">
<text>Camberwick Green is a British children&#x27;s television series that ran from January to March 1966 on BBC1, featuring stop motion puppets. &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; is the first in the &quot;Trumptonshire&quot; trilogy, which also includes &quot;Trumpton&quot; and &quot;Chigley&quot;.

==Background==
The series was written and produced by Gordon Murray and animated by Bob Bura and John Hardwick. Music was by Freddie Phillips while narration and song vocals were provided by Brian Cant. There are thirteen fifteen-minute colour episodes produced by &quot;Gordon Murray Pictures&quot;. The inspiration for the name is believed to have stemmed from the East Sussex village of Wivelsfield Green, supported by the nearby villages of Plumpton (Trumpton) and Chailey (Chigley).

==Story structure==
Each episode begins with a shot of a musical box which rotates while playing a tune. It is accompanied by the following narration:
Then the lid, a hexagon constructed of six triangles in alternating colours, slowly opens up like an iris, or in the manner of a camera shutter, while the box smoothly revolves to the accompaniment of an exquisite Baroque minuet. A hexagonal platform bearing the motionless figure of the puppet character which will play a central role in today&#x27;s episode, slowly rises into position: the platform flush with the shifted triangular cover-tiles, which are now splayed open like the stiff petals of a flower; as the music-box comes to a halt with an audible click. After a brief introduction, the background appears and the story begins.

The series is set in the small, picturesque (and fictitious) village of Camberwick Green, Trumptonshire, which is inhabited by such characters as Police Constable McGarry (Number 452), and Windy Miller, owner of a clanking old – but nevertheless efficiently functional – windmill and a firm believer in old-fashioned farming methods.

The series mixes contemporary technology with Edwardian costume and social attitudes. Almost all the characters have their own theme songs and travelling songs. There are other characters who never appear in the stories, including Mr Honeyman who (according to Peter Hazell&#x27;s song) &quot;keeps the chemist shop&quot;, and an unnamed clown or pierrot, who turns a roller caption to display the show&#x27;s opening and closing credits.

Each week the villagers undergo such domestic crises as a shortage of flour, a swarm of bees, a water shortage and rumours of an unwanted electrical substation being built in the village, but all problems are happily resolved by the end of each episode. The episodes then conclude with the narrator bidding farewell to the puppet character who was seen at the beginning and is shown going back into the musical box.

&quot;Camberwick Green&quot; has no overt fantasy content apart from the musical box. For the most part, it is simply about ordinary people doing everyday things, and perhaps for that reason it remains popular. Along with its two successors, the series was repeated many times on the BBC until 1985, and then on Channel 4 from 1994 to 2000.

==Episodes==
Episode titles were given in &quot;Radio Times&quot; but were not shown on screen.

==Characters==

==Modern use==
The 1970s pop band Candlewick Green shares its name with the originally planned title of the series. (Murray had planned to name the show &quot;Candlewick Green&quot; but found that the person writing his contract had misheard and mangled the name; as he did not object to the new name, Murray went forth with the show under the mangled title.)

In 1987 the indie group Pop Will Eat Itself sampled Brian Cant&#x27;s &quot;Here is a box...&quot; introduction for the start of their song Razorblade Kisses. The song itself is an instrumental reprise of their song Evelyn, but played in a musical box style to make it sound similar to the Camberwick Green tune.

In 1987, Windy Miller was the face of Windmill Bakery&#x27;s wholemeal bread. Ceramic pots depicting Windy hugging a beehive and barrels of marmalade and jam were made to tie in with the promotion.

&quot;Camberwick Green&quot; was spoofed for a 1988 edition of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, as &quot;Gamberwick Greenbelt&quot;. The 90-second sketch depicted a puppet Nicholas Ridley, described as &quot;Old Nicky Ridley, the village idiot&quot;, using a front loader to demolish the whole village for redevelopment. In 2015, &quot;Private Eye&quot; resurrected the spoof as the &quot;Camberwick Greenbelt&quot; strip cartoon, offering satirical comment on social and political impacts on the British countryside.
VIZ magazine produced two rather bleak spoof versions named Camberwick Greggs and Trumpton. In the former the baker is driven out of business by the opening of a branch of Greggs nearby, and the latter revolves around a caricature of Donald Trump, building a wall between Trumpton and Chigley.

The character Windy Miller and his famous windmill appeared in September 2005 along with some other &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; characters in commercials for Quaker Oats on television in the United Kingdom. The puppets and setting are all re creations, because Murray destroyed the originals in the 1970s. The original narrator, Brian Cant, auditioned to do the voice over for the commercials, before the job was instead given to Charlie Higson. 

Episode 5 of the second series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars&quot; features a recreation of the opening of &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;, with a puppet of the show&#x27;s main character, Sam Tyler (John Simm), emerging from the musical box and despairing over his colleague, Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister), who can be seen in puppet form &quot;kicking in a nonce&quot; at the end. This later leads to Sam to threaten Hunt, telling him to &quot;Stay out of &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;!&quot; (a cross-reference to the popular and long-running police TV series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;). It emerges that Sam is tripping after being accidentally overdosed in his hospital bed.

Again, the voice over was not supplied by Brian Cant, but is delivered in a similar style. It differs from the original by saying: &quot;This is a box, a magical box, playing a magical tune. But inside this box there lies a surprise. Do you know who&#x27;s in it today?&quot;

The narration was provided by Brian Little, the co-founder of Hot Animation, the company that created the sequence. His recording was supposed to be a temporary guide track to help the animators time the shots, but the producers of &quot;Life on Mars&quot; were content to retain it for the final version. The one-minute sequence was designed and animated by Paul Couvela, the supervising animator of &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;.

Windy Miller cameos in the closing sequence of the 2009 BBC Children in Need charity single Peter Kay&#x27;s &quot;Animated All Star Band&quot; video.

The music video to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Burn the Witch&quot; pays homage to both &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

Caterham Cars released a limited edition model of their Seven range called the Sprint with one of the colour options as &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; 

==Restoration and commercial releases==
The original masters of &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; – along with those of its sequels &quot;Trumpton&quot; and &quot;Chigley&quot; – were believed to have been lost, with most surviving copies tending to suffer from scratched, wobbly or grainy picture quality and a muffled soundtrack. When boxes of some original film were discovered in Gordon Murray&#x27;s attic – with more footage then discovered by the BBC – the trilogy was restored and remastered for a Blu-ray release in 2011.

===VHS and DVD Releases===
In 1984, eighteen years after the broadcasts on BBC in 1966, Longman Video released the first four episodes on video, as part of its &quot;Children&#x27;s Treasury Collection&quot;.

Later, in 1989, the BBC released a video with the last three episodes (including E12 &quot;Mickey Murphy the Baker&quot; as the first episode, E11 &quot;Mr Carraway&quot; as the second episode and E13 &quot;Mrs Honeyman and her Baby&quot; as the last episode).

Then, in 1996–1997 Telstar Video Entertainment, as part of its &quot;Star Kids&quot; range released three videos.

In 2001, Telstar Video Entertainment Ltd released a single DVD with 12 episodes of the series on it.

In 2006, Entertainment Rights released a single DVD with all 13 episodes of the series on it.

===DVD and Blu ray===
The digitally remastered &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; was released in December 2011 in one multi pack, comprising a Blu-ray disc and a DVD.

<text>Thomas &amp; Friends is a British children&#x27;s television series that aired from 9 October 1984 to 20 January 2021. Based on &quot;The Railway Series&quot; books by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry and his son Christopher, the series was developed for television by Britt Allcroft. The series follows the adventures of Thomas, an anthropomorphic blue steam locomotive on the fictional Island of Sodor along with his friends Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, Toby, as well as others. Over five hundred episodes were produced over the course of 24 seasons.

In the United States, it was first broadcast along with the spin-off series, &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;, on PBS&#x27; PTV Park block on 29 January 1989, while broadcast of the series did shift overtime, it later aired on PBS Kids up until 2017. The rights to the series are currently owned by HIT Entertainment (a subsidiary of Mattel), which acquired Gullane Entertainment in July 2002. HIT was folded into Mattel in 2016.

A new 2D-animated series, &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: All Engines Go&quot;, premiered on 13 September 2021 on Cartoon Network&#x27;s preschool block Cartoonito.

==History==
===Predecessors===
The first attempt to adapt Awdry&#x27;s stories for television came in 1953, when the editor of the &quot;Railway Series&quot; books, Eric Marriott, was approached by the BBC, who wished to use live-action model trains to re-create two stories from Awdry&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;. 00 gauge Hornby Dublo models appeared on sets that reflected the style of the original illustrations. The first episode (based on &quot;The Sad Story of Henry&quot;) was broadcast live on the evening of Sunday 14 June 1953 from Lime Grove Studios. The live broadcast did not fare well: a failure to switch the points caused the model of Henry to derail and it had to be replaced on the rails by one of the operators. The models moved jerkily, and all effects and music had to be superimposed.

News of the broadcast hit the front pages of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Awdry branded the episode &quot;unprofessional&quot;, and the point-switching debacle an &quot;elementary mistake&quot;. As a result, the second episode scheduled for 28 June 1953 was put on hold, and then later cancelled. The BBC offered Awdry and the &quot;Railway Series&quot; publishers greater creative control over the production, but the publishers declined, preferring to focus on publishing new books for the series.

Nearly 20 years later, the BBC featured Awdry&#x27;s stories in the television story-telling show &quot;Jackanory&quot;. Fourteen years before &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; was aired, Ted Ray (sitting in a stationmaster&#x27;s office) read five &quot;Railway Series&quot; books in episodes that aired between 20 September to 2 October 1970.

In 1973, Andrew Lloyd Webber, having read &quot;The Railway Series&quot; as a child, approached publisher Kaye &amp; Ward with a proposal for a musical television series, with songs from himself and lyricist Peter Reeves. However, the publishers and the author refused to give Lloyd Webber&#x27;s company &quot;control of almost everything&quot;, which Lloyd Webber&#x27;s lawyers argued was necessary in order to &quot;secure the investment money from America which would be needed to pay for the animation and the film-making.&quot; The status of the project seemed uncertain, and while Stanley Pickard (Kaye &amp; Ward&#x27;s managing director at the time) told Awdry that he was &quot;maintaining personal contact with Andrew and still had a slight hope that there might be a way out&quot;, Awdry remained apprehensive, saying that &quot;Once the Americans get hold of it the whole series would be vulgarised and ruined.&quot; Eventually, an agreement was reached, and Awdry received an advanced payment of £500.

A pilot episode was commissioned from Granada, which would feature 2D cutouts of the engines moving along a background in a style reminiscent of &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, with involvement from animator Brian Cosgrove. The cutouts and backgrounds were based on illustrations from &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. The pilot episode was completed by early 1976, but Granada ultimately decided not to produce a full series, as they feared that at the time Awdry&#x27;s stories were not popular enough outside the UK to justify the time and money needed to make the series. Andrew Lloyd Webber later established the Really Useful Group in 1977, a name derived from the phrase &quot;Really Useful Engine&quot;. He would go on to work on a musical loosely inspired by &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, called &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, which premiered in 1984, and became one of his most well-known works.

===Early years and the series&#x27; success===
In 1979, British television producer Britt Allcroft was producing a documentary on the Bluebell Railway, a heritage railway in Sussex which featured in the &quot;Railway Series&quot; book &quot;Stepney the &quot;Bluebell&quot; Engine&quot;. As part of her research before filming, Allcroft read some books in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; and was highly entertained and impressed with the stories which Awdry had written, later remarking that &quot;there was something in the stories that I felt I could develop that would connect with children. I saw a strong emotional content that would carry with little children&#x27;s experiences with life.&quot;

Allcroft worked to convince Awdry that she could, with funding, convert the stories into a successful television show. Her efforts were successful, and she purchased the television rights from the publishers of &quot;The Railway Series&quot; at a cost of what was then £50,000. Allcroft still had to work to raise the money to finance production and (despite showing a keen interest) wanted a level of creative control which she did not want to forego. In the end, after several years of searching and having to place a second mortgage on her home, Allcroft raised sufficient funding from her local bank manager. 

By 1981, Allcroft had secured the finances to produce the show. She started to assemble the crew, including producer and director David Mitton, the founder of Clearwater Features Ltd.; crew member Steve Asquith; American-born producer Robert D. Cardona; and composers and songwriters Mike O&#x27;Donnell and Junior Campbell.

====Series 1–3====
The series started production in 1984, produced by Clearwater Features Ltd. (Mitton and Cardona&#x27;s company) and ITV&#x27;s Central Independent Television region. The series was originally shot and produced with live action models at the Clearwater in-house studio in Battersea, a suburb of London, for Series 1. Production was later relocated to Shepperton Studios, Surrey, southwest of London, for subsequent series. The use of moving models was seen at the time of the series&#x27; conception as an effective method of animating the stories. Locomotives and other vehicles were operated by radio controls, while humans and animals were static figures. Stop motion was occasionally employed for instances in which a human or animal character would move. Hand-drawn animation was used in Series 3 to create bees.

The first series (1984) used stories from the first eight books, along with one specially written by the Rev. W. Awdry, &quot;Thomas&#x27;s Christmas Party&quot;. The second series (1986) used stories from Book No. 9 (&quot;Edward the Blue Engine&quot;) to Book No.30 (&quot;More About Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;). The latter book was unusual, as it was written specifically by Christopher Awdry to be adapted by the show. At that time, it was a contractual obligation that the series could only adapt stories that appeared in print. The series also used a story from a Thomas Annual, &quot;Thomas and Trevor&quot;, and a specially written stand-alone story, &quot;Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree&quot;. One episode, &quot;The Missing Coach&quot;, was in the process of being filmed, but was cancelled mid-way through filming as Allcroft decided it was too confusing for young viewers. The production team went on to use &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; instead. The story &quot;Gordon Goes Foreign&quot; from the &quot;Railway Series&quot; book &quot;The Eight Famous Engines&quot; was also planned to be adapted but was scrapped due to budgetary limitations.

In between production of the second and third series, the production team were focused on producing two other television series: &quot;Tugs&quot;, which ran for one series in 1989 for Television South (TVS); and the American television series &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;, which repackaged &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; for the American television market from 1989 to 1996.

Clearwater closed on 31 December 1990, just before production of the third series, with The Britt Allcroft Company becoming the sole producer. Series 3 had its first 16 episodes released on VHS in November 1991 before its broadcast debut in 1992 on CITV. It was made at a cost of £1.3 million (approximately $9.3.million in U.S. dollars at the time). The series was a combination of episodes derived from &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, stories in the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot; magazine (written by Andrew Brenner, who would later become the show&#x27;s head writer starting in Series 17), and original stories by Allcroft and Mitton.

One of the primary reasons for diverging from the original books was that many of the stories not yet used featured large numbers of new characters, which would be expensive to produce. Another reason was that the producers wanted more stories about Thomas, the nominal main character. Awdry complained that the new stories would be unrealistic. Cardona left as producer, while Allcroft joined Mitton as co-producer. Allcroft&#x27;s husband, Angus Wright, took over as executive producer.

====Series 4–5====
Series 4 was first released direct to video between 1994 and 1995, before its broadcast debut on Cartoon Network. The producers planned to introduce some new female characters, including motor car Caroline, Nancy, and The Refreshment Lady. Some commentators took this as a response to accusations of sexism levelled against the series two years earlier. In reality, these were not &quot;new&quot; characters, but rather creations of Awdry from the original &quot;Railway Series&quot; books. Series 4 was almost entirely based on &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. The narrow-gauge engines were introduced and were the focus of a number of episodes. Only one original story (&quot;Rusty to the Rescue&quot;, written by Allcroft and Mitton) was used, the rest were all adapted from the Railway Series books, but this took certain elements of its plot and dialogue from &quot;Stepney the &quot;Bluebell&quot; Engine&quot;.

The fifth series (1998) was first released directly to video before its TV airings on Cartoon Network. It was a radical shift, as all episodes were written by Allcroft and Mitton with no further stories being adapted from the &quot;Railway Series&quot;. This series saw the introduction of new characters, such as Cranky, The Horrid Lorries and Old Slow Coach. It also focused on more dramatic and darker action-oriented plotlines, along with more severe accidents, than the earlier series. After series 5, Angus Wright stepped down as executive producer. It was the final series broadcast on Cartoon Network, as Nickelodeon UK would eventually acquire the broadcast rights to the show for it to air on their newly created Nick Jr. channel in 1999. CN continued to air older series until their broadcast rights fully expired in 2001.

The franchise&#x27;s first film, &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, was released in July 2000 in the UK, US, and Canada. It featured new characters created by Allcroft, along with characters from the show that had introduced &quot;Thomas&quot; to the U.S., &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;. Despite high production values and the popularity of the show, the film was criticised by British reviewers who were unfamiliar with &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;. The movie was well received by young children on both sides of the Atlantic, but made only $19.7 million at the box office, against a cost of The film was broadcast on BBC1 on 1 January 2004 and again on 29 December 2008.

===Later years===
The sixth and seventh series (2002-2003) were first released directly to VHS and DVD as forty-six episodes in the US and fifty-two in the UK, and continued to introduce action-packed storylines, as well as new characters. These series saw the introduction of a writing staff. The sixth series (2002) saw an attempt to create a spin-off based on the successful &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; series. Two episodes introduced a group of construction machine characters known as &quot;The Pack&quot;. The spin-off did not materialise for some time. 

Eventually, in 2006, thirteen episodes were released straight to DVD in two collections: &quot;On Site with Thomas&quot; and &quot;Thomas&#x27; Trusty Friends&quot;. The sixth series was the very first series to premiere on Nick Jr UK, and Nick Jr UK became the very first channel in the UK to air series six first. The sixth series was also rebroadcast a few months later on CITV; it was the first series of the programme broadcast on CITV, since series 3 had aired on it over 10 years ago. The seventh series was the first series since the third series to make its debut on UK television on CITV first, considering the sixth series had previously debuted on Nick Jr UK first.

The fact that older sets were used and that the episodes were shot on 35mm film stock (as opposed to the digital video format used at the time of the episodes&#x27; release) suggest it was filmed some time before Series 8. In Series 7 (2003) the programme title was officially shortened to &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, this name having been used on merchandise and video covers for three years previously. Phil Fehrle replaced Allcroft and Mitton as producer, although Mitton remained as series director. Wright was replaced by Allcroft and Peter Urie as executive producers for Series 6.

In 2003, Allcroft stepped down as executive producer, making Urie the sole executive producer for Gullane Entertainment, and Jocelyn Stevenson the executive producer for HiT Entertainment.

The Britt Allcroft Company (which changed its name to Gullane Entertainment in 2000) was purchased by HiT Entertainment, a company specialising in children&#x27;s entertainment, in September 2002.

====Series 8–10====
The eighth series (2004) was first released directly to VHS and DVD as four episodes in the US and six in the UK, before airing on television on Nick Jr. in the UK and PBS in the US. It introduced a number of significant changes to the show. Many members of the original founding team involved in the original show since 1984 left production, including Allcroft, Mitton, and original composers Mike O&#x27;Donnell and Junior Campbell. The latter two had been embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with HiT before their departure. Asquith, who was part of the original production team since 1984, took over as director, while Simon Spencer replaced Fehrle as producer.

The eighth series was the very last series to air on CITV. The eight series was aired separately in two parts, by the time the second half of the eight series aired, CITV had become its own channel, coincidentally around this time Channel 5&#x27;s preschool programming block, Milkshake!, had also acquired rights to air &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; too, rebroadcasting series 8 in October that same year. CITV would continue to air repeats of series 6-8 before losing all the rights to the programme in 2007.

A new theme song and new incidental music was composed by Ed Welch and Robert Hartshorne, respectively. The episode runtime was increased to seven minutes. The series was produced using digital video cameras, creating a somewhat different look for the show. Other changes included the additions of animated educational sequences and transitions between stories. Urie also left, while Stevenson remained in her role as executive producer. Sam Barlow became the story executive, while Abi Grant and Paul Larson served as script editors. This series saw the adoption of a centralised cast, including Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, Toby and Emily.

HiT Entertainment was itself acquired by Apax Partners, a private equity company, in March 2005.

A straight-to-video film, &quot;Calling All Engines!,&quot; was released in 2005, shortly before series 9. While featuring characters from &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, it was not a direct sequel. It proved successful; this resulted in more direct-to-video specials being produced.

Series 9 (2005) and 10 (2006) saw the expansion of the supporting cast with new and old characters. From Series 9 onwards, the narrator would call out the episodes&#x27; names, and from Series 11 onwards the theme song was begun with the sound of a train whistle. Series 10 aired with twenty-eight episodes rather than the twenty-six of previous years. The eleventh series (2007) was filmed in high definition format. Twenty episodes aired in the original broadcast, while six were first released direct to DVD as &quot;Engines and Escapades&quot; and later aired on TV. Jocelyn Stevenson stepped down as executive producer after Series 10, with Christopher Skala taking her place as executive producer for Series 11. Sharon Miller became the script editor from Series 9 to 11.

====Series 12–21====
Series 12 (2008) saw the introduction of CGI effects (provided by HiT Entertainment&#x27;s subsidiary Hot Animation), with the intent of producing the show entirely in CGI the following year. The traditional models and sets were still used, but with computer-animated faces superimposed on the models to allow for changing facial expressions. Humans and animals were fully computer-animated to allow for walking movement. Only twenty episodes were produced and broadcast (the U.S. broadcast featured six additional episodes from &quot;Engines and Escapades&quot;). Miller became the head writer, starting with Series 12.

HiT announced multiple changes to the show beginning in 2009. One new aspect was the introduction of live-action host segments to &quot;Thomas&quot;″ home video releases. The host took the form of a character who worked on The Fat Controller&#x27;s railway, who would instruct viewers in craft projects. For the final two DVDs featuring Series 12 in 2009, the host was named Mr. Arkwright, played by Robert Slate. In 2010, beginning with the DVD &quot;Splish Splash Splosh&quot;, the host, played by Ben Forster, was named Mr. Perkins. Upon Forster&#x27;s death in 2017, he was replaced by Mark Moraghan, who played &quot;Mr Evans&quot; in the web series.

Other major changes included a move to production in CGI (done for budgetary reasons), rather than the use of physical models, and the addition of a voice cast to support the established narrator. The DVD feature &quot;Hero of the Rails&quot; was the first &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; production to showcase these changes, and Series 13 was the first television series in the new format. The CGI animation for the series was provided by Nitrogen Studios of Vancouver.

In September 2010, Apax was preparing to sell off HiT Entertainment and its franchises, including Thomas – regarded as the single most valuable asset – in order to help clear HiT&#x27;s debts, and in February 2012, sold the company, along with the Thomas properties, to &quot;US toy giant&quot;, Mattel.

During production of Series 16 (2012), Miller stepped down as head writer, and Andrew Brenner (who had written some &quot;Thomas&quot; stories in the third series) assumed the role, after serving as script editor for &quot;Blue Mountain Mystery&quot;. Additionally, Barlow stepped down as story executive after the sixteenth series, and the production of the CGI animation was moved from Nitrogen Studios (of Vancouver) to Arc Productions (of Toronto). &quot;King of the Railway&quot; and Series 17, both released during 2013, served as the first special and series, respectively, developed by the new animation and production teams, respectively.

2014 saw &quot;Tale of the Brave&quot; and Series 18, the second special and series animated by Arc, respectively. 2015 saw &quot;The Adventure Begins&quot;, a special coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the franchise, and &quot;Sodor&#x27;s Legend of the Lost Treasure&quot;; Series 19 began airing that same year. 2016 saw some changes; longtime composers Robert and Peter Hartshorne (father and son team) left the series and Chris Renshaw and Oliver Davis took over. 2016 also saw &quot;The Great Race;&quot; Series 20 began airing the same year. Series 20 was the last series of the show to air on PBS Kids; when Series 21 began airing in 2017, the American broadcast of the show was moved to the Nick Jr. Channel, ending a period of almost 28 years of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; on American public television. 2017 also saw the release of &quot;Journey Beyond Sodor&quot;. The show was pulled away from Nick Jr. at the end of 2019.

====Series 22–24====
A twenty-second series of &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; consisting of 26 episodes was announced. This series saw many changes, such as Edward, Henry and Toby being removed from the Steam Team to make room for two new female steam engines named Nia (Africa) and Rebecca (UK), and the narrator being replaced with Thomas talking to the audience (however, Mark Moraghan, the previous narrator said that he would still work on the series). Series 22 is set after &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: Big World! Big Adventures!&quot;, which came out on 20 July 2018. It introduces gender-balanced and multicultural characters which was and still is a hot topic amongst fans, and features a new theme tune. The series is split into two halves; the first half sees Thomas travelling around the world and visiting India, Australia, and China, while the second half takes place back on the Island of Sodor. The series was released on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu in late 2018.

&quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; was renewed for a 23rd series which debuted in 2019.

The 24th series was released in September 2020. The series was also the final series animated by Jam Filled Toronto, as well as the final series of the entire original television show.

A second live-action animated &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film is in development at Mattel Films with Marc Forster serving as director.

===Reboot===

On 12 October 2020, it was announced by Mattel that the series would be rebooted with &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: All Engines Go&quot; and that Nelvana would co-produce and animate the series. The deal stipulated that 104 11-minute episodes and 2 60-minute specials would be produced, and that the animation would transition from 3D full CGI animation (used since its transition to full CGI in 2009) to 2D animation, with new refreshed redesigns for Thomas and his friends. On 5 February 2021, it was announced that Cartoon Network and Netflix had jointly picked up the broadcast and streaming rights to the series in the United States, respectively.

==Voice cast==

Originally, narrating was used as the only voice in the series until 2008. Britt Allcroft thought it essential to convey the episode as a story that would be read from a book at home. Individual voice-over actors were given to both the UK and US dubs of the series, following the switch to full CGI animation in 2009. The narrators include Ringo Starr, Michael Angelis, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin, Michael Brandon, Pierce Brosnan, Mark Moraghan, John Hasler, and Joseph May.

===Films, specials, and miniseries===

==Production==
===Storytelling===
Up until series 12, narration and dialogue were performed by a single storyteller before the characters gained their own voice actors in series 13 onwards. Starting from series 22 up until series 24, Thomas himself (voiced by John Hasler in the UK dub and Joseph May in the US dub) takes over as the narrator and breaks the fourth wall.

===Models===
The original live action models were filmed on giant 16 x 20 model railway layout sets, which were set up and dismantled one by one for each episode&#x27;s scenes. The models were built to the 1:32 scale, known in model railway circles in &quot;Gauge 1&quot;. From Series 1 to 3, the locomotives used chassis made by Märklin, along with scratch built plastic bodies. Along with the moving eyes, eyelid mechanisms and resin faces, these bodies included smoke generators. For the first five series, the rolling stocks were made using Tenmille kits and most of them were later replaced with duplicates made from resin casts. Later models were constructed entirely from scratch. Some of the models from the sister television series &quot;Tugs&quot; were reused in later episodes of the series.

From Series 5 to 12, some larger-scale models were used for the narrow gauge characters, to more easily fit the complex mechanisms into them while retaining a sufficient level of detail. In Series 6, the characters known as &quot;the Pack&quot; (construction machines) were also constructed on a large scale, and larger models of Thomas and Percy were made to interact with them. In the ninth series, another large-scale Thomas model was built to be at the same scale as the narrow gauge engines and to provide greater possibilities for interaction. It was joined by a large version of James in the tenth series. Among the CGI switch in 2009, some of these models were put on display in a special exhibit at Drayton Manor Theme Park&#x27;s Thomas Land. Nitrogen Studios (who provided the animation for the series from series 12 to 16) also had some of the original models on display.

===Animation techniques===
The live-action models used since 1984 could not lip sync. HIT&#x27;s subsidiary HOT Animation introduced the use of CGI in the show about 20 years later, first to add smoke and other effects. In 2009, HIT introduced a fully CGI series. In Series 12, CGI by Nitrogen Studios was used to animate the characters&#x27; faces and to make the people and animals move. The 13th Series was the first to be fully animated in CGI.

===Music===
Mike O&#x27;Donnell and Junior Campbell composed the show&#x27;s original main title theme, incidental music and 36 songs; these were used for series 1–7, comprising 182 episodes and music videos between 1984 and 2003. The instruments for series 1–2 were synthesised with the Roland Jupiter-6 and instruments for series 3–7 were synthesised with the E-mu Proteus sound module.

In 2004, Robert Hartshorne took O&#x27;Donnell and Campbell&#x27;s place as composer, while Ed Welch became the show&#x27;s songwriter from Series 8 to &quot;The Great Discovery.&quot; Welch left after &quot;The Great Discovery&quot;. Hartshorne took his place as songwriter from Series 12 and onwards. From &quot;Day of the Diesels&quot;/2011-2016, Robert&#x27;s son Peter Hartshorne helped him with the music.

In 2016, the Hartshornes left the series, and Chris Renshaw and Oliver Davis took their places.

A new theme song was introduced in 2018 to accommodate the &quot;Big World, Big Adventures!&quot; rebrand.

===Head writer===

Since series 12, there has been a head writer for the series. Prior to the introduction of a head writer, the script editor performed similar duties. Sharon Miller served as head writer from series 12–16, when she was replaced by Andrew Brenner. Brenner had written many &quot;Thomas&quot; stories for various magazines, as well as his own original stories (several of which were later adapted for television episodes in Series 3 and Series 5, and for which he had remained uncredited). Brenner had been a writer of several other children&#x27;s animated series, such as &quot;Angelina Ballerina&quot;, &quot;Tractor Tom&quot;, &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, &quot;Spot&quot;, &quot;Poppy Cat&quot;, and &quot;Binka&quot;, as well as being the creator of &quot;Caribou Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Humf,&quot; and writer for several magazines featuring children&#x27;s characters such as &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, and Thomas&#x27;s sister series &quot;Tugs&quot;. He took over as head writer for Thomas for &quot;King of the Railway&quot;, serving in this capacity until leaving during the twenty-third series. David Stoten succeeded him as head writer for the twenty-fourth series. Sharon Miller has also been the voice director since the second CGI animated film &quot;Misty Island Rescue&quot;, and continued to work on the series in this capacity until its end.

==Broadcast==

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; was originally broadcast on ITV until 2006. Since then it has been broadcast on Channel 5&#x27;s Milkshake! strand.

In the United States, the series had first appeared in the form of sequences on &quot;Shining Time Station,&quot; during the program&#x27;s 1989 to 1995 run on PBS. The sequences of the series later aired in 1996 on &quot;Mr. Conductor&#x27;s Thomas Tales&quot;. The series aired as &quot;Storytime with Thomas&quot; on Fox Family (now Freeform) from 1999 to 2000. &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; returned in the form of several direct-to-video releases during season 6 (2002 to 2003) and as a stand-alone half-hour program on PBS Kids. It was distributed from 2004 to 2007 by Connecticut Public Television, and then by WNET from 2008 to 2017. It also aired on Sprout from 2005 to 2015. The rights to broadcast the series through PBS expired in December 2017, thus ending a period of almost 30 years of programming related to &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; on American public television. In 2018 and 2019, Nickelodeon held exclusive rights to the series in the United States. In 2020, the streaming rights were sold to Netflix, with traditional television rights (if any) left unresolved. It also airs on Kabillion. In spring 2024 classic episodes of the series became available on the free streaming channel PBS Retro. Early episodes from Seasons 1 through 7 are available on Amazon Prime Video.

The program airs in Australia on ABC Kids and CBeebies and on Four in New Zealand. In France, Southeast Asia, Spain and Italy, it plays on Disney Junior. In Canada, it formerly aired on TVOKids, Family Jr. and the Knowledge Network as a part of its Knowledge Kids block, and currently airs on Treehouse TV. In the Middle East, the show airs on MBC 3 and Spacetoon, and in the United Arab Emirates on e-Junior.

== Mobile apps ==
Mattel partnered with several companies, including Budge Studios and Animoca Brands, to create mobile apps based on &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. In 2010, Callaway Digital Arts created apps based on the brand. By mid-2011, thirteen &quot;Thomas&quot; apps were available. HiT Entertainment and Mattel both released apps under their own names. During the 75th anniversary press release in 2020, Mattel mentioned an intent for more apps.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Common Sense Media rated the show a four out of five stars, writing, &quot;Parents can be assured that this series has educational aspects as well as behavioural modelling. The Thomas the Tank Engine stories were conceived by a young British boy early in the 20th century, who would listen to the trains as they chuffed through the countryside. The stories he told his son – who has consequently passed them on to his own son – have been documented in books and toy train models. Since the series was introduced to television viewers in the 1980s, Thomas &amp; Friends has seen a healthy fan base sprout worldwide.&quot;

Jia Tolentino in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; acknowledged that as a girl she did not &quot;take in anything that was actually happening&quot;, but after reviewing the show and internet posts about it as an adult, criticised what she saw as the &quot;show&#x27;s repressive, authoritarian soul.&quot;

University of Alberta professor Shauna Wilton wrote &quot;A Very Useful Engine: The Politics of Thomas and Friends&quot;. Wilton (who justified her study by arguing that socialisation of children is an important aspect) wrote that she received &quot;a combination of outrage, disbelief, and condescending dismissal&quot; when she announced she was going to study the politicisation of the series, although some people gave her thanks. She stated that despite the inclusion of female characters by the 2000s, in the era after major social revolutions in real life the series was &quot;largely unchanged&quot; from when it was &quot;created in a context of rigid social hierarchies, male dominance in the public sphere, and a strong social culture of good behavior, respecting authority, and following the rules.&quot;

In 2011, a contributor for &quot;Slate&quot; analyzed the &quot;hidden subtexts&quot; of British imperialism in the series, while in 2013 Alex Knapp wrote for &quot;Forbes&quot; about the &quot;baffling economics&quot; of the Island of Sodor.

<text>Trumpton is a British stop-motion children&#x27;s television series from the producers of &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;. First shown on the BBC from January to March 1967, it was the second series in the &quot;Trumptonshire&quot; trilogy, which comprised &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;, &quot;Trumpton&quot; and &quot;Chigley&quot;. Like the other two series, &quot;Trumpton&quot; continued to be repeated well into the 1980s as a part of the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s schedules.

&quot;Trumpton&quot; was narrated by Brian Cant, and animation was by Bob Bura, John Hardwick and Pasquale Ferrari. Scripts were by Alison Prince; all other production details were identical to &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;.

==Background, overview, story and structure== 
The action takes place in the fictional English town of Trumpton, a short distance from the equally fictional village of Camberwick Green, the focus of the first series in the &quot;Trumptonshire Trilogy&quot;. Each episode begins with a shot of Trumpton Town Hall clock: The townsfolk then appear going about their daily business: examples include the unnamed Mayor, Mr Troop the town clerk, Chippy Minton the carpenter and his apprentice son Nibs, Mrs Cobbit the florist, Miss Lovelace the milliner and her trio of Pekingese dogs (Mitzi, Daphne and Lulu), Mr Clamp the greengrocer, Mr Munnings the printer, and Mr Platt the clockmaker.

Although most of the characters and settings are new, the style of the programme follows the pattern established by &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; (from which a few characters make an appearance in Trumpton also), in which domestic problems are cheerfully resolved by the end of the show, leaving the last minute or so for the fire brigade to become the town band and play the episode out.

The fire brigade is perhaps Trumpton&#x27;s most-recognised feature. Captain Flack&#x27;s roll-call was recited in all but one episode: Puppeteer Gordon Murray explained that &quot;Pugh and Pugh are twins you must understand – not Hugh, Pugh&quot;. In the episode &quot;Cuthbert&#x27;s Morning Off&quot;, Cuthbert&#x27;s name is omitted (due to his absence). They are continually being called out to attend some emergency or other (in many cases to resolve fairly trivial matters), but to Captain Flack&#x27;s annoyance never an actual fire. The main reason for this was the difficulty of animating fire, water, and smoke, although a naked flame was successfully animated in episode 8, for the abortive lighting of a bonfire. Nonetheless, after &quot;Right men, action stations!&quot;, the fire brigade often absent-mindedly deployed the fire hose and were quickly halted by Captain Flack (&quot;No, no! Not the hose!&quot;).

Writer Gordon Murray said that the communities of the series are &quot;representative of real locations which are one-and-a-half miles from each other in an equidistant triangle&quot;, but declined to name them for fear of the area being &quot;inundated with tourists&quot;.

==Episodes==
Episode titles were given in &quot;Radio Times&quot; but were not shown on screen.

==Characters==
===The Fire Brigade===
Unusually, Trumpton Fire Brigade has two theme songs. The first, commencing with the famous roll call of firemen&#x27;s names, accompanies every turnout of the Brigade; the second, ending every episode, forms the habitual tune played by the Brigade at the Thursday band concerts. The Fire Brigade appears in every episode. Captain Flack always has a speaking part, as do Fireman Grubb in episode 1 and Fireman Cuthbert in episode 10. In episode 4 the Mayor states &quot;I can&#x27;t think what Trumpton would do without its Fire Brigade&quot;.
* Captain Flack - the Fire Brigade&#x27;s commander.

* Mr Munnings - the printer; his theme song is &#x27;I line up all the letters&#x27;; he appears in the opening titles, and in the storyline of eleven episodes.

* Mrs Cobbit - the flower seller; her theme song is &#x27;Roses, roses, buy my red roses&#x27;; she appears in the opening titles, and in the storyline of every episode; in episode 3 it is revealed that she has not missed a day&#x27;s work in the town square for forty years, except Sundays.
* Mr Platt - the clockmaker; his theme song is &#x27;Clocks are like people&#x27;; he appears in every episode, although unseen (behind his door) in episode 9; he keeps racing-pigeons which feature in episode 12.
* Police Constable Potter - Trumpton&#x27;s policeman; he appears in the opening titles, and in the closing bandstand scene of every episode, and also in the storyline of five episodes; in episode 9 he is equipped with a police motorcycle like his colleague PC McGarry who patrols Camberwick Green.
* Mr Robinson - the window cleaner; his theme song is &#x27;It is hard to see out&#x27;; he appears in five episodes, although only in the background scenes of episodes 1, 2, 4, and 6; he stars in episode 9.

* Auntie - the aunt of Fireman Cuthbert; she appears in only one episode.
* The Artist - he visits Trumpton to paint, appearing in only one episode.

===Visitors from Camberwick Green===
As Camberwick Green is only two miles from Trumpton it is not surprising that many of the familiar Camberwick Green characters make an appearance.
* Mr Crockett - the garage owner; he appears with his son in episode 1, watching the band concert, and he has a starring role in episode 4.
* Mr Jonathan Bell - Farmer Bell often visits Trumpton, and may be seen in background shots in several episodes; he is also in the closing crowd scene at the band concert.

==Remastered version==
In 2011, BBC Studios and Post Production digitally restored all 39 episodes of the Trumptonshire trilogy (&quot;Camberwick Green&quot;, &quot;Trumpton&quot; and &quot;Chigley&quot;) after William Mollett, son-in-law of the creator Gordon Murray, found some original footage in an attic. He then approached the BBC to see if it could track down the missing 40‐year‐old original footage, which was eventually traced to the BBC broadcast archive (now in Perivale, west London) but it soon became very clear that its age meant that restoration would be a difficult and delicate task. Murray and Mollett enlisted the expertise of BBC Studios and Post Production, which cleaned, scanned and digitally restored the film footage frame by frame.

==Appearances in popular culture==
*In 1986, the English indie band Half Man Half Biscuit released an EP, &quot;The Trumpton Riots&quot;, whose title track describes an insurrection on the streets of Trumpton.
*Half Man Half Biscuit also referenced Trumpton on the song &quot;Time Flies By When You&#x27;re the Driver of a Train&quot;, a parody of the &quot;Train Song&quot; from sister programme &quot;Chigley&quot;, on the album &quot;Back in the DHSS&quot;. The lyrics of the parody cite such things as drug use and football hooliganism.
*In 1987, a sketch named &quot;Trumpton Raid&quot; appeared in &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;″s series four. Smith is a news reader on the telephone to Jones (as &quot;Mike Airey&quot; Live from Trumpton) reporting on an early morning raid by American F-111 aircraft on Trumpton.
*In the UK in the early 1990s there were several dance music tracks based on children&#x27;s TV programmes or short educational films. The Prodigy released the track &quot;Charly&quot; in 1991 which was then promptly followed in 1992 by &quot;Sesame&#x27;s Treet&quot; by the Smart E&#x27;s and &quot;A Trip To Trumpton&quot; by Urban Hype, which was based on the original &quot;Trumpton&quot; music by Freddie Phillips with heavy use of &quot;Trumpton&quot; samples.
* Aired 20 April 2007, in the second episode of season four &#x27;Conference&#x27;, Peep Show&#x27;s Alan Johnson addresses the Project Zeus team and rhetorically posits as to whether &#x27;the inventors of google sat around watching Trumpton&#x27;.
*At the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe, Phill Jupitus and Brian Cant presented Trumptonshire Tales. The format consisted of Jupitus interviewing Cant and introducing clips from the series.
*In 2009 Chippy Minton appeared in &quot;The Official BBC Children in Need Medley&quot; music video; he appears at the end of the video and is told by Big Chris from &quot;Roary the Racing Car&quot; that they have just finished. Miss Lovelace and Windy Miller also appear in the video.
*In its explanation of the fiscal multiplier, the BBC radio programme &quot;More or Less&quot; used the Trumpton economy as a model. Notably, firefighter Dibble was laid off due to the financial crisis. (8 April 2011)
*In September 2014, a spoof Twitter account @Trumpton_UKIP was created to parody the accounts of UKIP branches. Initially, the account received little notice: however, several weeks later, during a period when the party had been warning members to be aware of possible fake accounts designed to discredit them, UKIP MEP David Coburn encouraged his own Twitter followers to report the spoof account as a fake, leading to widespread media coverage.
*The music video for Radiohead&#x27;s 2016 single &quot;Burn the Witch&quot; is an animation in the style of Bob Bura and John Hardwick which &quot;crosses Trumpton and The Wicker Man&quot;.
*In December 2016 after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, Huffington Post created a parody video imagining what Trumpton would be like with Trump as the mayor. Original scenes were re-used with a dubbed imitation of Cant narrating satirical lines instead. The famous opening lines are changed to &quot;Here is the clock, the Trumpton clock; telling the time, time to make Trumpton great again – yes, it&#x27;s time to drain the swamp!&quot; The video satirises various controversies of Trump&#x27;s election campaign such as proposals to bar entry to Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico (figuratively represented by Chigley), allegations of sexual assaults on women, and admiration for President Vladimir Putin.

==Home releases==
In 1984, 17 years after the broadcasts on BBC in 1967. Longman Video released eight of the episodes on video as part of its &quot;Children&#x27;s Treasury&quot; collection. There were two releases, each containing four episodes
In 1989, the BBC released a video with the last three episodes (including ep13 &quot;The Greenhouse&quot; as the first episode, ep11 &quot;The Plumber&quot; as the second episode and ep12 &quot;Pigeons&quot; as last episode).

Then, in 1996–1997 Telstar Video Entertainment as part of its &#x27;Star Kids&#x27; range released two videos.
In 2002 a three DVD set entitled &quot;The Complete Collection&quot; was issued by Telstar Video Entertainment Limited (TDVD9033). It featured one disc each of Trumpton, Camberwick Green and Chigley, each disc having all 13 episodes of the respective series.

<doc id="231479" wikidata="Q846961" url="?curid=231479" title="Brachial plexus">
<text>The brachial plexus is a network of nerves (nerve plexus) formed by the anterior rami of the lower four cervical nerves and first thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1). This plexus extends from the spinal cord, through the cervicoaxillary canal in the neck, over the first rib, and into the armpit, it supplies afferent and efferent nerve fibers to the chest, shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand.

==Structure==
The brachial plexus is divided into five &quot;roots&quot;, three &quot;trunks&quot;, six &quot;divisions&quot; (three anterior and three posterior), three &quot;cords&quot;, and five &quot;branches&quot;. There are five &quot;terminal&quot; branches and numerous other &quot;pre-terminal&quot; or &quot;collateral&quot; branches, such as the subscapular nerve, the thoracodorsal nerve, and the long thoracic nerve, that leave the plexus at various points along its length. A common structure used to identify part of the brachial plexus in cadaver dissections is the M or W shape made by the musculocutaneous nerve, lateral cord, median nerve, medial cord, and ulnar nerve.

===Roots===
The five roots are the five anterior primary rami of the spinal nerves, after they have given off their segmental supply to the muscles of the neck.
The brachial plexus emerges at five different levels: C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. C5 and C6 merge to establish the upper trunk, C7 continuously forms the middle trunk, and C8 and T1 merge to establish the lower trunk.
Prefixed or postfixed formations in some cases involve C4 or T2, respectively.
The dorsal scapular nerve comes from the superior trunk and innervates the rhomboid muscles which retract and downwardly rotate the scapula. The subclavian nerve originates in both C5 and C6 and innervates the subclavius, a muscle that involves lifting the first ribs during respiration. The long thoracic nerve arises from C5, C6, and C7. This nerve innervates the serratus anterior, which draws the scapula laterally and is the prime mover in all forward-reaching and pushing actions.

===Trunks===
These roots merge to form the trunks:
* &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;upper&quot; (C5-C6)
* &quot;middle&quot; (C7)
* &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; (C8-T1)

===Divisions===
Each trunk then splits in two, to form six divisions:
* anterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks
* posterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks
* when observing the body in the anatomical position, the anterior divisions are superficial to the posterior divisions

===Cords===
These six divisions regroup to become the three cords or large fiber bundles. The cords are named by their position with respect to the axillary artery.
* The &quot;posterior cord&quot; is formed from the three posterior divisions of the trunks (C5-C8, T1)
* The &quot;lateral cord&quot; is formed from the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks (C5-C7)
* The &quot;medial cord&quot; is simply a continuation of the anterior division of the lower trunk (C8, T1)

===Diagram===


===Branches===
The branches are listed below. Most branches arise from the cords, but a few branches (indicated in italics) arise directly from earlier structures. The five on the left are considered &quot;terminal branches&quot;. These terminal branches are the musculocutaneous nerve, the axillary nerve, the radial nerve, the median nerve, and the ulnar nerve. Due to both emerging from the lateral cord the musculocutaneous nerve and the median nerve are well connected. The musculocutaneous nerve has even been shown to send a branch to the median nerve further connecting them. There have been several variations reported in the branching pattern but these are very rare.

Bold indicates primary spinal root component of nerve. &quot;Italics&quot; indicate spinal roots that frequently, but not always, contribute to the nerve.
==Function==
The brachial plexus provides nerve supply to the skin and muscles of the arms, with two exceptions: the trapezius muscle (supplied by the spinal accessory nerve) and an area of skin near the axilla (supplied by the intercostobrachial nerve). The brachial plexus communicates through the sympathetic trunk via gray rami communicantes that join the plexus roots.

The terminal branches of the brachial plexus (musculocutaneous n., axillary n., radial n., median n., and ulnar n.) all have specific sensory, motor and proprioceptive functions.
==Clinical significance==

===Injury===

Injury to the brachial plexus may affect sensation or movement of different parts of the arm. Injury can be caused by the shoulder being pushed down and the head being pulled up, which stretches or tears the nerves. Injuries associated with malpositioning commonly affect the brachial plexus nerves, rather than other peripheral nerve groups. Due to the brachial plexus nerves being very sensitive to position, there are very limited ways of preventing such injuries. The most common victims of brachial plexus injuries consist of victims of motor vehicle accidents and newborns.

Injuries can be caused by stretching, diseases, and wounds to the lateral cervical region (posterior triangle) of the neck or the axilla. Depending on the location of the injury, the signs and symptoms can range from complete paralysis to anesthesia. Testing the patient&#x27;s ability to perform movements and comparing it to their normal side is a method to assess the degree of paralysis. A common brachial plexus injury is from a hard landing where the shoulder widely separates from the neck (such as in the case of motorcycle accidents or falling from a tree). These stretches can cause ruptures to the superior portions of the brachial plexus or avulse the roots from the spinal cord. Upper brachial plexus injuries are frequent in newborns when excessive stretching of the neck occurs during delivery. Studies have shown a relationship between a newborn&#x27;s weight and brachial plexus injuries; however, the number of cesarean deliveries necessary to prevent a single injury is high at most birth weights. 

For the upper brachial plexus injuries, paralysis occurs in those muscles supplied by C5 and C6 like the deltoid, biceps, brachialis, and brachioradialis. A loss of sensation in the lateral aspect of the upper limb is also common with such injuries. An inferior brachial plexus injury is far less common but can occur when a person grasps something to break a fall or a baby&#x27;s upper limb is pulled excessively during delivery. In this case, the short muscles of the hand would be affected and cause the inability to form a full fist position.

To differentiate between preganglionic and postganglionic injury, clinical examination requires that the physician keep the following points in mind. Preganglionic injuries cause loss of sensation above the level of the clavicle, pain in an otherwise insensate hand, ipsilateral Horner&#x27;s syndrome, and loss of function of muscles supplied by branches arising directly from roots—i.e., long thoracic nerve palsy leading to winging of scapula and elevation of ipsilateral diaphragm due to phrenic nerve palsy.

Acute brachial plexus neuritis is a neurological disorder that is characterized by the onset of severe pain in the shoulder region. Additionally, the compression of cords can cause pain radiating down the arm, numbness, paresthesia, erythema, and weakness of the hands. This kind of injury is common for people who have prolonged hyperabduction of the arm when they are performing tasks above their head.

==== Sports injuries ====
One sports injury that is becoming prevalent in contact sports, particularly in the sport of American football, is called a &quot;stinger.&quot; An athlete can incur this injury in a collision that can cause cervical axial compression, flexion, or extension of nerve roots or terminal branches of the brachial plexus. In a study conducted on football players at United States Military Academy, researchers found that the most common mechanism of injury is, &quot;the compression of the fixed brachial plexus between the shoulder pad and the superior medial scapula when the pad is pushed into the area of Erb&#x27;s point, where the brachial plexus is most superficial.&quot;. The result of this is a &quot;burning&quot; or &quot;stinging&quot; pain that radiates from the region of the neck to the fingertips. Although this injury causes only a temporary sensation, in some cases it can cause chronic symptoms.

==== Penetrating wounds ====
Most penetration wounds require immediate treatment and are not as easy to repair. For example, a deep knife wound to the brachial plexus could damage and/or sever the nerve. According to where the cut was made, it could inhibit action potentials needed to innervate that nerve&#x27;s specific muscle or muscles.

==== Injuries during birth ====
Brachial plexus injuries can occur during the delivery of newborns when after the delivery of the head, the anterior shoulder of the infant cannot pass below the pubic symphysis without manipulation. This manipulation can cause the baby&#x27;s shoulder to stretch, which can damage the brachial plexus to varying degrees. This type of injury is referred to as shoulder dystocia. Shoulder dystocia can cause obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP), which is the actual injury to the brachial plexus. The incidence of OBPP in the United States is 1.5 per 1000 births, while it is lower in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (0.42 per 1000 births). While there are no known risk factors for OBPP, if a newborn does have shoulder dystocia it increases their risk for OBPP 100-fold. Nerve damage has been connected to birth weight with larger newborns being more susceptible to the injury but it also has to do with the delivery methods. Although very hard to prevent during live birth, doctors must be able to deliver a newborn with precise and gentle movements to decrease chances of injuring the child.

=== Tumors ===
Tumors that may occur in the brachial plexus are schwannomas, neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

=== Imaging ===
Imaging of the Brachial Plexus can be done effectively by using a higher magnetic strength MRI Scanner like 1.5 T or more. It is impossible to evaluate the brachial plexuses with plain Xray, CT and ultrasound scanning can manage to view the plexuses to an extent; hence MRI is preferred in imaging brachial plexus over other imaging modalities due to its multiplanar capability and the tissue contrast difference between brachial plexus and adjacent vessels. The plexuses are best imaged in coronal and sagittal planes, but axial images give an idea about the nerve roots. Generally, T1 WI and T2 WI images are used in various planes for the imaging; but new sequences like MR Myelolography, Fiesta 3D and T2 cube are also used in addition to the basic sequences to gather more information to evaluate the anatomy more.

<doc id="231480" wikidata="Q3101720" url="?curid=231480" title="George Leybourne">
<text>George Leybourne (17 March 1842 – 15 September 1884) was a singer and &quot;Lion comique&quot; style entertainer in British music halls during the 19th century who, for much of his career, was known by the title of one of his songs, &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;. Another of his songs, and one that can still be heard, is &quot;The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot;. He remains among the best known 19th century music hall performers.

==Early life==
George Leybourne was born Joseph Saunders in Gateshead; however, at an early age he and his family relocated to London. Before he worked for music halls he worked as an engineer in, amongst other places, South West England. For his early music hall performances in Northern England, including Liverpool and Newcastle he used his real name - Joe Saunders - a fact which, in the past, caused much confusion as to his real name. His first performance documented in London using the stage name George Leybourne was at the Bedford Music Hall in 1863, but it is known that he had performed in some of the smaller East End venues in the months before this.

==Career==

In 1866 with composer Alfred Lee, he wrote the song &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;, premiering it in Leeds during August of that year. It took several months before it became successful. Another of Leybourne&#x27;s major song successes, also dating from 1866, was &quot;The Flying Trapeze&quot;, music by Alfred Lee. The song represented a fascination with trapeze artistes then performing in the UK, including Jules Léotard who had appeared in the Alhambra Music Hall in London. In 1867 it was published in the United States by C. H. Ditson &amp; Co, with music attributed to Gaston Lyle.

During the 1860s, Leybourne, along with several contemporaries including Arthur Lloyd and Alfred Peck Stevens developed a new type of music hall character, the &quot;Lion Comique&quot;; a &quot;dandy&quot; or attractive, fashionable, young man. For this style, performers relied less on copying burlesque, and instead sought inspiration in their everyday experiences and the characters of daily street life. Audiences loved to join in the chorus and &quot;give the bird&quot;. In some of his songs he appeared immaculately dressed in white tie and tails, when he would declare his love for the high life, women, and champagne. However, he also earned a reputation for his many character songs, which were detailed studies of people of various classes.

In 1868, when William Holland became manager of the Canterbury Music Hall, he employed Leybourne with an exclusive contract of £25 a week, providing him with a carriage drawn by four white horses. During the next year by performing, with Holland&#x27;s permission, in several other halls additionally, his salary increased to £120 per week.

Leybourne also wrote the lyrics to the 1871 song &quot;If Ever I Cease to Love&quot;, some of the lyrics of which caused a scandal. It is often remembered presently for its association with Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

The song was sung by Lydia Thompson, for the burlesque adaptation of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s operetta &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, with which she was touring the United States. When he visited New Orleans in 1872, Russian Grand Duke Alexei Romanov saw &quot;Bluebeard&quot; and was fascinated by both the singer and the song.

When Jenny Hill performed at the London Pavilion, she stopped the show, requiring Leybourne to wait for her act to finish, after which he carried her back for an encore.

Leybourne and Alfred Vance, also known as &quot;The Great Vance&quot;, have historically been considered as rivals in popular culture, an understanding elaborated by the 1944 movie &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;. Latest research shows that while they both sang songs extolling the virtues of various alcoholic drinks, their careers were somewhat different. Leybourne concentrated on his music hall performances, while Vance entertained middle-class audiences with &#x27;safe&#x27; concert party shows. It was in their advertisements that the rivalry seemed evident. For the movie &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; Leybourne was played by comedian Tommy Trinder, while Alfred Vance was played by Stanley Holloway.

==Death and legacy==

During a career spanning 23 years Leybourne sang more than 200 songs; however, towards the end of his career he failed to adapt to the changing times and his popularity decreased. He died impoverished in England in Islington, aged 42.

Leybourne is buried at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London with his actress daughter Florence Leybourne, her husband, the music hall performer Albert Chevalier and grandson Frederick. His headstone, with the epitaph &quot;God&#x27;s finger touched him and he slept&quot;, was erected by fellow music hall entertainer Dan Leno, and the Grand Order of Water Rats. George Leybourne&#x27;s grave is cared for by The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.

Leybourne appeared at Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall in London&#x27;s East End, the world&#x27;s oldest surviving grand music hall, and an adjoining modern residential apartment block has been named &quot;George Leybourne House&quot; after him.

On 29 July 1970 a blue plaque commemorating Leybourne was erected by the Greater London Council (&quot;GLC&quot;) at the instigation of the British Music Hall Society and was unveiled by Don Ross at Leybourne&#x27;s former home at 136 Englefield Road, Islington.

<text>The Girl from Tomorrow is an Australian sci-fi children&#x27;s television series produced by Film Australia. The series is based around Alana (Katharine Cullen), a girl from the year 3000. At the start of the series, she is kidnapped by Silverthorn, a criminal from the year 2500, and brought back in time to the year 1990.

While in the year 1990, she befriends Jenny (Melissa Marshall), who helps Alana adapt to life in a time unfamiliar to her, and later helps her to return to her own time.

The series&#x27; second installment, &quot;The Girl from Tomorrow Part II: Tomorrow&#x27;s End&quot; aired in 1992.

==Premise==
In the year 3000, the human race is in a state of Utopia. The major challenge facing them is continuing to rebuild the Earth after &quot;The Great Disaster&quot;, a catastrophic event that took place in 2500 and nearly destroyed the entire Earth.

In order to investigate its causes, the scientist Tulista is sent to the past using the Time Capsule, a device created by a fellow scientist named Bruno. Upon the capsule&#x27;s return, Tulista is held hostage by a criminal from 2500 named Silverthorn, who is intent on conquering the future. Silverthorn realises that even though the year 3000 has no weapons &quot;per se&quot;, his own weapons are no match to the superior technology of the Transducer. He manages to take Tulista&#x27;s student Alana hostage, and escapes into the past where he figures he will have a better chance. Arriving in 1990, Alana escapes and later meets a teenager named Jenny Kelly, whose help she enlists in order to get back to the Capsule before it automatically returns to the future and leaves her stranded in the past. After thinking that the Capsule was destroyed, Jenny and Alana discover that it has been seized by Silverthorn, who is building his power and making vast amounts of money by using information from the Capsule&#x27;s database, and will therefore expel Alana to use it to return to her own time. Along with the help of Jenny&#x27;s family and her teacher, Alana and Jenny must devise a plan to retrieve the Capsule while foiling Silverthorn&#x27;s plans, so that Alana can return home to the year 3000.

==Characters==

===Alana===
Alana (Katharine Cullen) is a fourteen-year-old girl from the year 3000. Alana&#x27;s parents live on Titan, Saturn&#x27;s moon. They sent her to Earth to be educated. On Earth, she has guardians who teach her how to use the Transducer, so she can achieve her ambition of becoming a healer. Alana has three distinctive dots on the side of her face in the temple area. These dots signify that she is mature enough to use a Transducer. Taken in by the Kellys on arriving in 1990, Alana is given the name &#x27;Alana Turner&#x27; and passed off as Irene&#x27;s niece to avoid suspicion.

===Silverthorn===
Silverthorn (John Howard) is a villain from the year 2500. Silverthorn&#x27;s most noticeable traits are his deviousness and tendencies of violence. He can be very charming, but this is a front so he can double-cross people. He is also extremely brave, risking his life to save a drowning boy in order to gain Lorien&#x27;s trust, and tests the Time Gate on himself when none of his cronies are willing. He kidnaps Alana and flees to 1990, where he hopes he can rule the world. While in 1990, Silverthorn makes himself a millionaire by accessing the Time Capsule&#x27;s computer, finding out details of local horse races, then successfully betting on the winners - buying such luxuries as a large white stretch limousine (driven by Eddie) and a large house, as well as setting up a business called Futures Incorporated as a front for his devious plans. However, Silverthorn has an inoperable brain tumour as a result of being exposed to high levels of radiation in his own time period, occasionally suffering severe headaches that can cause him to collapse, and cannot obtain further supplies of the pills he brought with him from 2500 as they contain elements and minerals which have not yet been discovered. He has only one hope of survival - Alana and the Transducer...

===Eddie===
Eddie (Miles Buchanan) is a young street tough who acts as Silverthorn&#x27;s chauffeur and henchman. He isn&#x27;t very bright and occasionally even clumsy, as a result of which Silverthorn gets angry with him, but is tolerated by his employer just so long as he is useful. In &quot;The Girl from Tomorrow Part II: Tomorrow&#x27;s End&quot;, Eddie confesses that he doesn&#x27;t have a driving licence.

===Jenny Kelly===
Jenny (Melissa Marshall) is from 1990. She is a typical teenager going through her rebellious phase. She has dyed her hair purple and plays the drums, she has aspirations of joining a band. When she&#x27;s not at school she helps out in her mum&#x27;s deli. Jenny hates living in Sydney, but when Alana arrives things start to get interesting.

===Petey Kelly===
Petey (James Findlay) is like any other nine-year-old boy from 1990. He is the brother of Jenny. He enjoys dressing up in his home-made superhero outfit, and calls himself &quot;Captain Zero&quot;. Petey also has a great love of sci-fi, which comes in handy when things get tough.

===Irene Kelly===
Irene (Helen O&#x27;Connor) is Jenny and Petey&#x27;s mother. She is the owner of the &quot;Kelly Deli&quot;. Like most mums, she is very protective of her children, so much so that she is more than willing to stand up to Silverthorn alone in order to protect them.

===James Rooney===
James (Andrew Clarke) is the science teacher at the high school Jenny attends. Irene fell for him when she met him after enrolling Alana there. James helped all the others in their efforts to retrieve the Capsule so Alana could return home.

==Technology in the year 2500==
The most often used weapon in use in the year 2500 is the laser pistol. When the pistol is used, the trigger is held allowing energy to build up within the object and once the trigger is released the energy within the object causes it to explode.

==Technology in the year 3000==
In the year 3000, all scientific experiments and technological advancements are carried out within the Science Dome. One area within the Science Dome is the Time Laboratory. This is where all time travel experiments are performed. Technology used in the laboratory includes the Time Capsule, and the temporal flux generators, as well as other diagnostic tools. Below follows a short list of significant technology used in the future.

===The Time Capsule===
The Time Capsule is a time exploration vehicle. It was invented by a scientist named Bruno in the year 3000. The Capsule is exactly in height and width. Its composition in the series is unspecified, but as a real prop, it is a dark green steel frame model of a Rhombicuboctahedron plated with semidiagonal steel bars and plated with semitransparent plexiglas from the inside, except on the front side which is completely transparent. Inside is a command place for one passenger, although the vehicle can accept several people. It stands on a 20 cm tall black base. Its front sides are capable of opening like a two-sided door. The Capsule is equipped with the most advanced computer system available in the future. The history and knowledge from before The Great Disaster is held within its memory banks. The command panel is represented by a green prism in the centre of the vehicle, which communicates with the upper control panel, situated below the topmost side. In the second season, a security device is added - a hexagonal plate palm scanner, right from the front side. The Capsule is equipped with survival mechanisms capable of synthesizing water and protein nutrients from the atmosphere.

Bruno invented the Time Capsule so that people in the year 3000 could investigate the causes of The Great Disaster, a terrible event that almost destroyed the entire Earth. The Capsule&#x27;s computer also responds to verbal commands. When the Time Capsule is programmed with a set of temporal co-ordinates it draws energy from the temporal flux generators and begins to spin slowly at first and then gathering speed, which is followed by two sounds: a saw wave sound gradually increasing in frequency and a looping sequence (sound that exponentially grows in frequency and then falls low again) increasing in frequency, too. Soon when the part of the energy is transferred from the generators to the Capsule, a blue sparkled energy field then forms around the Capsule. Its sides begin to vibrate in light, followed by a slightly yellow glow in the centre of the vehicle. When the energy is sufficient, the vehicle explodes out of its present time in a flash of light and rain of yellow sparks, and explodes into the time set by the co-ordinates, which is followed by the same sawtooth sound, only with decreasing frequency, hence giving the impression of a cooling process. Upon arrival, the Capsule is regularly covered with soot residue. The Time Capsule will only remain in the past for twenty-eight days unless specified differently.

===Personal Computer Companion===
In the year 3000, everybody owns a Computer Companion. It is a miniaturised computer that can be worn on the wrist. The computer is programmed with an artificial intelligence. These computers are capable of a variety of actions. Mostly they are used to tell the time and give advice to the wearer, and they can also record and play holograms. The Companions worn by children also teach manners to the wearer as they will not comply with commands if there is any insincerity in the voice, and only respond when asked politely. The advanced technology contained in the computer enables it to interface with other computers and any other electronic devices.

===The Transducer===
The Transducer is a tool that is used by everyone in the year 3000. Alana was only learning to use the Transducer when she was kidnapped by Silverthorn. The Transducer looks like a headband with a crystal in the centre of a black drop-like plate. The Transducer from the year 3000 has several colours of radiation. Blue is used when the carrier tries to levitate objects, pink for healing, purple for specific interactions with other force fields, and red radiation forms as a result of strong feelings (intentional or unintentional) which destroy matter. The first transducer uses white radiation.

The Transducer was invented in the year 2500 by a woman named Maeve. She invented it to be a tool of healing. After The Great Disaster occurred in the year 2500, the Transducer was mass-produced and the people were taught how to use it. It was to be used as a tool to rebuild the planet. A replica of the original Transducer is held in the Science Dome in the year 3000. The Transducer functions by enhancing and magnifying the telepathic function of the pituitary gland, by doing this the user is able to levitate objects and heal wounds. If used in the wrong way the Transducer can be used as a weapon to destroy things; this is why the people of the year 3000 are taught from an early age to control their emotions.

<doc id="231482" wikidata="Q326827" url="?curid=231482" title="Artistic gymnastics">
<text>Artistic gymnastics is a discipline of gymnastics in which athletes perform short routines on different types of apparatus. The sport is governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), which assigns the &quot;Code of Points&quot; used to score performances and regulates all aspects of elite international competition. Within individual countries, gymnastics is regulated by national federations such as British Gymnastics and USA Gymnastics. Artistic gymnastics is a popular spectator sport at many competitions, including the Summer Olympic Games.

==History==
The gymnastic system was mentioned in writings by ancient authors, including Homer, Aristotle, and Plato. It included many disciplines that later became independent sports, such as swimming, racing, wrestling, boxing, and horse riding. It was also used for military training.

Gymnastics evolved in Bohemia and what later became Germany at the beginning of the 19th century. The term &quot;artistic gymnastics&quot; was introduced to distinguish freestyle performances from those used by the military. The German educator Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, who was known as the father of gymnastics, invented several apparatus, including the horizontal bar and parallel bars. Two of the first gymnastics clubs were Turnvereins and Sokols.

The FIG was founded in 1881 and remains the governing body of international gymnastics. The organization began with three countries and was called the European Gymnastics Federation until 1921, when the first non-European countries joined, and it was reorganized into its modern form.

Gymnastics was included in the 1896 Summer Olympics, but female gymnasts were not allowed to participate in the Olympics until 1928. The World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, held since 1903, were only open to men until 1934. Since then, two branches of artistic gymnastics have developed: women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics (WAG) and men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics (MAG). Unlike men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s branches of many other sports, WAG and MAG differ significantly in technique and apparatuses used at major competitions.

===Women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics===
As a team event, women&#x27;s gymnastics entered the Olympics in 1928 and the World Championships in 1950. Individual women were recognized in the all-around as early as the 1934 World Championships. The existing women&#x27;s program—all-around and event finals on the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise—was introduced at the 1950 World Championships and at the 1952 Summer Olympics.

The earliest champions in women&#x27;s gymnastics tended to be in their 20s, and most had studied ballet for years before entering the sport. Larisa Latynina, the first great Soviet gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at age 22 and her second at 26; she became world champion in 1958 while pregnant. Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia, who followed Latynina and became a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 when she won her first Olympic gold medal.

In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnasts began to decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s – Ludmilla Tourischeva was 16 at her first Olympics in 1968 – younger female gymnasts slowly became the norm as the sport&#x27;s difficulty increased. Smaller, lighter girls generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the redesigned Code of Points. The 58th Congress of the FIG – held in July 1980, just before the Olympics – decided to raise the minimum age for senior international competition from 14 to 15. However, the change, which came into effect two years later, did not eliminate the problem. By the time of the 1992 Summer Olympics, elite gymnasts consisted almost exclusively of &quot;pixies&quot; – underweight young teenagers – and concerns were raised about athletes&#x27; welfare.

In 1997, the FIG responded to this trend by raising the minimum age for international elite competition to 16. This, combined with changes in the Code of Points and evolving popular opinion in the sport, led to the return of older gymnasts. While there are still gymnasts who are successful as teenagers, it is common to see gymnasts competing and winning medals well into their 20s. At the 2004 Olympics, women captained both the second-place American team and the third-place Russians in their mid-20s; several other teams, including those from Australia, France, and Canada, included older gymnasts as well. At the 2008 Olympics, the silver medalist on vault, Oksana Chusovitina, was a 33-year-old mother. By the 2016 Olympics, the average age of female gymnasts was over 20, and it was almost 22 at the 2020 Olympics.

==Apparatus==
Both male and female gymnasts are judged for execution, degree of difficulty, and overall presentation. In many competitions, especially high-level ones sanctioned by the FIG, gymnasts compete in &quot;Olympic order&quot;, which has changed over time but has stayed consistent for at least a few decades.

For male gymnasts, the Olympic order is:

:1) Floor exercise
:2) Pommel horse
:3) Still rings
:4) Vault
:5) Parallel bars
:6) Horizontal bar

For female gymnasts, the Olympic order is:

:1) Vault
:2) Uneven bars
:3) Balance beam
:4) Floor exercise

===Men and women===

====Vault====

The vault is both an event and the primary equipment used in that event. Unlike most gymnastic events employing apparatuses, the vault is standard in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions, with little difference. A gymnast sprints down a runway, which is a maximum of in length, before leaping onto a springboard. Harnessing the energy of the spring, the gymnast directs their body hands-first toward the vault. Body position is maintained while &quot;popping&quot; (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates their body to land standing on the far side of the vault. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more challenging and complex vaults.

In 2004, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue or table. It is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse—about in length and width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface—and is, therefore, safer than the old vaulting horse. This new, safer apparatus led gymnasts to attempt more difficult vaults.

=====Notable champions=====
On the men&#x27;s side, the gymnasts who have won the most Olympic or World Championship titles on vault are Marian Drăgulescu of Romania and Ri Se-gwang of North Korea, with four titles each. Yang Hak-seon, Eugen Mack, Alexei Nemov, Vitaly Scherbo, Li Xiaopeng, and Lou Yun have each won three titles.

On the women&#x27;s side, Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia and Simone Biles of the United States are tied for the most titles, with four. Simona Amânar, Cheng Fei, Elena Zamolodchikova, and Rebeca Andrade have each won three.

====Floor exercise====
The floor event occurs on a carpeted square consisting of rigid foam over a layer of plywood supported by springs or foam blocks. This provides a firm surface that will respond with force when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve extra height and a softer landing than possible on a regular floor.

Men perform without music for 60 to 70 seconds and must touch each floor corner at least once during their routine. Their routines include tumbling passes demonstrating flexibility, strength, balance, and power. They must also show non-acrobatic skills, including circles, scales, and press handstands.

Women perform a 90-second choreographed routine to instrumental music. Their routines include tumbling passes, jumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns. Elite gymnasts may perform up to four tumbling passes.

=====Notable champions=====

On the men&#x27;s side, the gymnasts who have won the most Olympic or World Championship titles on floor are Marian Drăgulescu of Romania, with four (along with Roland Brückner, if the Alternate Olympics are included). Ihor Korobchynskyi, Vitaly Scherbo, and Kenzō Shirai have three titles each.

On the women&#x27;s side, Simone Biles of the United States has the most titles with seven, followed by Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union with four. Gina Gogean, Daniela Silivaș, and Nellie Kim have three titles each.

===Men only===

====Pommel horse====

A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single-leg and double-leg work. Single-leg skills are generally found in the form of &quot;scissors&quot;. In double leg work, the gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on preference). To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on typical circling skills by turning (&quot;moores&quot; and &quot;spindles&quot;) or by straddling their legs (&quot;flares&quot;). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand.

=====Notable champions=====

The gymnasts who have won the most Olympic and/or World Championship titles on pommel horse are Miroslav Cerar of Yugoslavia, Zoltán Magyar of Hungary, and Max Whitlock of Great Britain, with five titles each. Krisztián Berki, Dmitry Bilozerchev, Pae Gil-su, Xiao Qin, Boris Shakhlin, and Marius Urzică, have won at least three titles apiece.

====Still rings====
The still rings are suspended on wire cable from a point off the floor and adjusted in height so the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing. Gymnasts must demonstrate balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnasts include two or three.

=====Notable champions=====

The gymnasts who have won the most Olympic and/or World Championship titles on still rings are Jury Chechi of Italy (6) and Chen Yibing of China (5). Nikolai Andrianov, Albert Azaryan, Alexander Dityatin, Alois Hudec, Akinori Nakayama, Eleftherios Petrounias, and Liu Yang each have at least three such titles, as does Dmitry Bilozerchev if the Alternate Olympics are included.

====Parallel bars====

The parallel bars consist of two bars slightly further than shoulder-width apart and usually high. Gymnasts execute a series of swings, balancing moves, and releases that require strength and coordination.

=====Notable champions=====

The gymnasts who have won the most Olympic and/or World Championship titles on parallel bars are Vladimir Artemov of the Soviet Union (5, including the Alternate Olympics) and Li Xiaopeng and Zou Jingyuan of China (4). Li Jing and Vitaly Scherbo have each won three titles.

====Horizontal bar====

The horizontal bar (also known as the high bar) is a thick steel bar raised above the ground. The gymnast performs &#x27;giants&#x27; (360-degree revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and direction changes. Using the momentum from giants, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back somersault. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a hold on the bar.

=====Notable champions=====

The gymnast who has won the most Olympic and World Championship titles on the horizontal bar is Epke Zonderland of the Netherlands, with four titles. Zou Kai, Leon Štukelj, and Takashi Ono have each won three, as has Dmitry Bilozerchev if the Alternate Olympics are included.

===Women only===

====Uneven bars====

The uneven bars (known as asymmetric bars in the UK) were adapted by the Czechoslovakian Sokol from the men&#x27;s parallel bars sometime before World War I and were shown in international exhibition for the first time at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. They consist of two horizontal bars set at different heights. Gymnasts perform swings, pirouettes, transition moves between the bars, and releases.

Higher-level gymnasts usually wear leather grips to ensure a firm hold on the bars while protecting their hands from painful blisters and tears (known as rips). Gymnasts sometimes wet their grips with water from a spray bottle and may apply chalk to prevent the grips from slipping. Chalk may also be applied to the hands and bar if grips are not worn.

=====Notable champions=====

The gymnasts who have won the most Olympic and/or World Championship titles on uneven bars are Svetlana Khorkina of Russia (7) and Maxi Gnauck of East Germany (5, including the Alternate Olympics). Daniela Silivaș of Romania and Nina Derwael of Belgium have each won three titles. Aliya Mustafina won back-to-back uneven bar Olympic titles in 2012 and 2016.

====Balance beam====
The balance beam existed as early as the 1880s in the form of a &quot;low beam&quot; close to the floor. By the 1920s, the beam was raised much higher due to Swedish influence on the sport.

Gymnasts perform routines ranging from 70 to 90 seconds long, consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, turns, and dance elements on a padded spring beam. Apparatus norms set by the FIG specify that the beam must be high, long, and wide. The event requires balance, flexibility, and strength.

=====Notable champions=====

Of all gymnastics apparatuses—men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s—balance beam has proven the most difficult on which to win multiple Olympic and World Championship titles. Simone Biles has four World titles on this event, and there are only two other gymnasts to have won three Championship titles in total for Olympic and Worlds — Nadia Comăneci and Daniela Silivaș of Romania.

==Competition format==
In Olympic and World Championship competitions, meets are divided into several sessions on different days: qualifications, team finals, all-around finals, and event finals.

During the &quot;qualification&quot; round (abbreviated TQ), gymnasts compete with their national squad in all four (WAG) or six (MAG) events. The scores from this session are not used to award medals but rather to determine which teams advance to the team finals and which individual gymnasts advance to the all-around and event finals. For the 2020 Olympics, teams will consist of four gymnasts, with up to two additional gymnasts per country allowed to compete as individuals. The format of team qualifications is 4–4–3, meaning that all four gymnasts compete in each event, but only the top three scores count. Individual gymnasts may qualify for the all-around and event finals, but their scores do not count toward the team&#x27;s total.

In the &quot;team finals&quot; (abbreviated TF), gymnasts compete with their national squad on all four or six events. The scores from the session determine the medalists in the team competition. The format is 4–3–3, meaning that of the four gymnasts on the team, three compete in each event, and all three scores count.

In the &quot;all-around&quot; finals (abbreviated AA), gymnasts compete individually in all four or six events; their totals determine the all-around medals. Only two gymnasts per country may advance to the all-around finals from the qualification round.

In the &quot;event finals&quot; (abbreviated EF) or &quot;apparatus finals&quot;, the top eight gymnasts in each event (as determined by scores in the qualification round) compete for medals. Only two gymnasts per country may advance to each event final.

Competitions other than the Olympics and World Championships may use different formats. For instance, the 2007 Pan American Games had only one team competition day with a 6–5–4 format, and three athletes per country were allowed to advance to the all-around. The team event is not contested in other meets, such as on the World Cup circuit.

===New life===

Since 1989, competitions have used the &quot;new life&quot; rule, under which scores from one session do not carry over to the next. In other words, a gymnast&#x27;s performance in team finals does not affect their scores in the all-around finals or event finals, and marks from the team qualifying round do not count toward the team finals.

Before this rule was introduced, the scores from the team competition carried over into the all-around and event finals. Final results and medal placement were determined by combining the following scores:

; Qualifiers for all-around and event finals: Team compulsories + team optionals
; Team competition: Team compulsories + team optionals
; All-around competition: Team results (compulsories and optionals) averaged + all-around
; Event finals: Team results (compulsories and optionals) averaged + event final

===Compulsories===

Until 1997, the team competition consisted of two sessions, with every gymnast performing standardized &quot;compulsory routines&quot; in the preliminaries and individualized &quot;optional routines&quot; on the second day. Team medals were determined based on the combined scores of both days, as were the qualifiers to the all-around and event finals. However, the all-around and event finals did not include compulsory routines.

In meets where team titles were not contested, such as the American Cup, there were two days of all-around competition: one for compulsories and another for optionals.

While each gymnast and their coach developed optional routines in accordance with the Code of Points and the gymnast&#x27;s strengths, compulsory routines were created and choreographed by the FIG Technical Committee. The dance and tumbling skills were generally less demanding than those in optional routines, but perfect technique, form, and execution were heavily emphasized. Scoring was exacting, with judges taking deductions for even slight deviations from the required choreography. For this reason, many gymnasts and coaches considered compulsories more challenging than optionals.

Compulsory exercises were eliminated at the end of 1996. The move was highly controversial, with many successful gymnastics federations—including the United States, Russia, and China—arguing that the compulsory exercises helped maintain a high standard of form, technique, and execution among gymnasts. Opponents of compulsory exercises believed that they harmed emerging gymnastics programs.

Some members of the gymnastics community still argue that compulsories should be reinstated, and many gymnastics federations have maintained compulsories in their national programs. Often, gymnasts competing at the lower levels of the sport—for instance, Levels 2-5 in USA Gymnastics, Grade 2 in South Africa, and Levels 3–6 in Australia—only perform compulsory routines.

===Competition levels===
Artistic gymnasts compete only with other gymnasts at their level. Each athlete starts at the lowest level and advances to higher levels by learning more complex skills and achieving qualifying scores at competitions.

====United States====
In the United States, whose program is governed by USA Gymnastics, levels range from 1 to 10, followed by elite. Levels 1 to 2 are usually considered recreational or beginner; 3 to 6 intermediate; and 7 to elite advanced. Competitions begin at Level 3 or, in some gyms, Level 2. A gymnast must be able to perform specific skills in each event to advance to the next level. Once a gymnast has competed in a sectional meet at a given level, they may not drop back to a lower level in the same competitive season. Gymnasts in Levels 1–2 perform basic skills such as handstands and cartwheels. Levels 3–5 consist of compulsory routines; 6 is an in-between level with strict requirements but some leeway for gymnasts to show their creativity; and Levels 7–10 consist of optional routines. Only elite gymnasts compete in accordance with the FIG&#x27;s Code of Points; lower levels have a modified code.

The elite program is divided into two categories: junior for gymnasts younger than 16, and senior for gymnasts 16 and older. (Gymnasts are allowed to compete at the senior level at the beginning of the calendar year in which they will turn 16.) Olympic teams are chosen from the senior elite program.

====United Kingdom====
The British Gymnastics level system goes from 5 (lowest) to 2, and there are separate tracks for elite- and club-level competition.

====Canada====
There are several competitive streams in Canadian gymnastics: recreational, developmental, pre-competitive, provincial, national, and high-performance. Provincial levels range from 5 (lowest) to 1; national levels are pre-novice, novice, open, and high performance; and high-performance levels are novice, junior, and senior.

====Germany====
In Germany, there are different competitive systems for recreational and high-performance gymnasts. Recreational gymnasts have a system of compulsory exercises from 1 to 9 and optional exercises from 4 to 1, with modified Code of Points requirements. For high-performance and junior athletes, there are compulsory and optional requirements defined by age, from ages 6 to 18.

===Age requirements=== 
The FIG imposes a minimum age requirement on gymnasts competing in certain international meets, but it does not impose a maximum age limit. The term &quot;senior&quot; refers to world-class or elite gymnasts who are age-eligible under FIG rules: Female gymnasts must be at least 16 or turning 16 within the calendar year, and the minimum age for men is 18. The term &quot;junior&quot; refers to any gymnast who competes at a world-class or elite level but is too young to be classified as a senior.

Juniors are judged under the same Code of Points as seniors and often exhibit the same difficulty level in their routines. Still, they cannot compete at the Olympics, World Championships, or World Cups. Many meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. But some competitions, such as the Goodwill Games, the Pan American Games, the Pacific Rim Championships, and the All-Africa Games, permit seniors and juniors to compete together.

The age requirement is contentious and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts, and other members of the gymnastics community. Those in favor of the age limits argue that they promote the participation of older athletes and spare younger gymnasts from the stress of competition and high-level training. Opponents point out that junior gymnasts are scored under the same Code of Points as the seniors (with some restrictions) and train mainly with the same skills. They also argue that younger gymnasts need the experience of competing in major events to improve as athletes.

Since stricter age requirements were adopted in the early 1980s, there have been several well-documented and many more suspected cases of juniors with falsified documents competing as seniors. The FIG has only taken disciplinary action in three cases: those of Kim Gwang-Suk of North Korea, who competed at the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships when she may have been as young as 11; Hong Su-jong of North Korea, who competed under three different birth dates in the 2000s; and China&#x27;s Dong Fangxiao, who competed at the 2000 Olympics when she was 14.

While the minimum age requirement applies to both women and men, it is more contentious in the women&#x27;s program because, while most top male gymnasts are in their late teens or early twenties, female gymnasts are typically ready to compete at the international level by their mid-teens. The difference is largely because men&#x27;s skills emphasize strength more than women&#x27;s.

===Scoring===


Scoring at the international level is regulated by the Code of Points.

Under the system established in 2006, two panels judge each routine, evaluating different aspects of the performance. The &quot;D score&quot; covers skill requirements, difficulty value, and connection value (for skills performed back to back with no pause in between); the &quot;E score&quot; covers execution and artistry; the two are added together to produce final scores. The maximum E score is 10, but there is no cap on the D score. Theoretically, this means scores could be infinite. However, average marks for routines in major competitions have generally been in the low to mid-teens.

This system, with its open-ended difficulty score, is very different from the one used for most of the sport&#x27;s history. Before 2006, the highest possible score was a &quot;perfect 10&quot;. Every routine was assigned a start value (SV) based on difficulty. A routine that included all required elements received a base SV—9.4 in 1996, 9.0 in 1997, 8.8 in 2001—and gymnasts could increase their SV to a maximum of 10 by performing more challenging skills and combinations. Then, to score a gymnast&#x27;s routine, judges deducted from the SV for errors in execution.

Some gymnasts and coaches—including Olympic gold medalists Lilia Podkopayeva, Svetlana Boginskaya, Shannon Miller, and Vitaly Scherbo, and Romanian team coach Nicolae Forminte — publicly opposed the new Code of Points when it was first announced. In addition, a 2006 report from the FIG Athletes&#x27; Commission cited significant concerns about scoring, judging, and other subjects. Aspects of the code were revised in 2007, but there are no plans to return to the &quot;perfect 10&quot; format.

===National===
Most countries hold a major competition (National Championships, or &quot;Nationals&quot;) every year that determines the best-performing all-around gymnasts and event specialists. Based on their scores at Nationals, gymnasts may qualify for their country&#x27;s national team or be selected for international meets.

==Dominant teams and nations==

===USSR and post-Soviet republics===
Before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Soviet gymnasts dominated both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnastics, starting with the introduction of the full women&#x27;s program into the Olympics and the overall increased standardization of the Olympic gymnastics competition format, which happened in 1952. The Soviet Union&#x27;s success might be explained by the government&#x27;s heavy investment in sports to support its political agenda on an international stage.

The Soviet Union had many male stars, such as Olympic all-around champions Viktor Chukarin and Vitaly Scherbo, and female stars, such as Olympic all-around champions Larisa Latynina and Svetlana Boginskaya. From 1952 to 1992 inclusive, the Soviet women&#x27;s squad won almost every team title in World Championship and Olympic competition, with only four exceptions: the 1984 Olympics, which the country boycotted, and the 1966, 1979, and 1987 World Championships. Most of the top Soviet gymnasts were from the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Byelorussian SSR.

Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, its gymnasts performed together for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics as the Unified Team, winning both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team competitions.

Russia has continued the Soviet tradition, medaling at every World and Olympic competition in both MAG and WAG disciplines, except at the 2008 Olympics. Ukraine maintained a strong team for more than a decade—Ukrainian Lilia Podkopayeva was the all-around champion at the 1996 Olympics—but it has declined in recent years. Belarus has maintained a strong men&#x27;s team. Other former republics have been less successful.

===Romania===
The Romanian team first achieved wide-scale success at the 1976 Summer Olympics with the performance of Nadia Comăneci, who was the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in Olympic competition. After that, using the centralized training system pioneered by Béla Károlyi, they remained a dominant force in women&#x27;s team and individual events for nearly four decades.

Romania was one of only two teams ever to defeat the Soviets in head-to-head World or Olympic competition, winning at the 1979 and 1987 World Championships. (The other was the Czechoslovakian women&#x27;s team at the 1966 World Championships.) The Romanian women also won team medals at every Olympics from 1976 to 2012 inclusive, including gold medals in 1984, 2000, and 2004. At the 16 World Championships from 1978 to 2007 inclusive, they failed to medal only twice (in 1981 and 2006) and won the team title seven times, including five victories in a row (1994–2001). From 1976 to 2000, they placed gymnasts—such as Daniela Silivaș, Lavinia Miloșovici, and Simona Amânar—on the all-around podium at every Olympics, and usually did the same at the World Championships through 2015, including producing World all-around champions Aurelia Dobre (1987) and Maria Olaru (1999).

The decline of Romanian gymnastics began after the 2004 Summer Olympics. At the 2006 World Championships, they failed to medal in the team competition, and only Sandra Izbașa won any individual medals. They won bronze medals at the 2007 World Championships, 2008 Summer Olympics, and 2012 Summer Olympics but failed to medal at the 2010, 2011, or 2014 World Championships.

Things took a drastic turn at the 2015 World Championships, where Romania did not even qualify for the team final. In 2016, it failed to qualify a full team to the 2016 Summer Olympics, placing seventh at the 2016 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event. It earned one Olympic spot, which was filled by 3-time Olympic champion Cătălina Ponor.

At the 2018 World Championships, Romania placed 13th in qualifications and did not make the team final. At the 2019 World Championships, it finished 22nd out of 24 teams—beating only the Czech Republic and Egypt—and again failed to qualify a team to the 2020 Summer Olympics, with only Maria Holbură earning an individual spot. After the Olympics were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a second Romanian gymnast, Larisa Iordache, earned an individual spot through the 2021 European Championships.

While less successful than the women&#x27;s program, the Romanian men&#x27;s program has produced individual medalists such as Marian Drăgulescu and Marius Urzică at World and Olympic competitions.

===United States===

While isolated American gymnasts, including Kurt Thomas and Cathy Rigby, won medals at World Championship competitions in the 1970s, the United States team was largely considered a &quot;second power&quot; until the late 1980s, when American gymnasts began medaling consistently in major, fully attended competitions.

At the 1984 Olympics, which the Soviet bloc boycotted, the American men won the gold with a team composed of Bart Conner, Tim Daggett, Mitch Gaylord, Jim Hartung, Scott Johnson, and Peter Vidmar. The women&#x27;s team—composed of Pam Bileck, Michelle Dusserre, Kathy Johnson, Julianne McNamara, Mary Lou Retton, and Tracee Talavera—won a silver medal, and Retton became the first American Olympic all-around champion.

In 1991, Kim Zmeskal became the first American all-around winner at the World Championships. At the 1992 Olympics, the American women won their first team medal (bronze) at a fully attended Games, as well as their highest all-around ranking, a silver medal for Shannon Miller. In men&#x27;s gymnastics, Trent Dimas won the horizontal bar final.

The U.S. women&#x27;s team has become increasingly successful in the modern era, with the 1996 Olympic team victory of the Magnificent Seven, the 2003 Worlds team victory, and multiple medals in both WAG and MAG at the 2004 Olympics. At the 2012 Olympics and 2016 Olympics, the U.S. women won the team gold. The United States has produced the last six women&#x27;s Olympic all-around champions—Carly Patterson (2004), Nastia Liukin (2008), Gabby Douglas (2012), Simone Biles (2016, 2024) and Sunisa Lee (2021)—as well as individual gymnasts such as World all-around champions Zmeskal (1991), Shannon Miller (1993, 1994), Chellsie Memmel (2005), Shawn Johnson (2007), Bridget Sloan (2009), Jordyn Wieber (2011), Biles (2013, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2023), and Morgan Hurd (2017). At the 2005 World Championships, American women won the gold and silver in the all-around and in every event final except vault (where Alicia Sacramone placed third). They continue to be one of the most dominant forces in the sport.

The men&#x27;s team made the medal podium at the 2004, 2008, and 2024 Olympics, as well as the 2003 and 2011 World Championships. Paul Hamm, the most successful U.S. male gymnast, became the first American man to win a World all-around title in 2003. He followed this up by winning the all-around at the 2004 Olympics. Jonathan Horton won a silver medal on the horizontal bar at the 2008 Olympics and a bronze in the all-around at the 2010 World Championships, and Danell Leyva won the all-around bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics and two silver medals (parallel bars and horizontal bar) at the 2016 Olympics.

===China===
China has had successful men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs over the past 25 years. The Chinese men won team gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and every World Championship team title from 1994 to 2014 (except 2001, when they placed fifth). They have produced individual gymnasts like Olympic all-around champions Li Xiaoshuang (1996) and Yang Wei (2008).

The Chinese women&#x27;s team won gold at the 2006 World Championships and 2008 Olympics, and has produced individual gymnasts like Mo Huilan, Kui Yuanyuan, Yang Bo, Cheng Fei, Sui Lu, Huang Huidan, Yao Jinnan, and Fan Yilin. Chinese women who have won individual Olympic gold medals are Ma Yanhong, Lu Li, Liu Xuan, He Kexin, Deng Linlin, and Guan Chenchen.

Though for many years considered a two-event team (uneven bars and balance beam), China has developed successful all-arounders like Olympic bronze medalists Liu Xuan (2000), Zhang Nan (2004), and Yang Yilin (2008). Like the Soviet Union, they have been accused of grueling and sometimes cruel training methods, as well as age falsification.

===Japan===
The Japanese men&#x27;s team was dominant during the 1960s and 1970s, winning every Olympic team title from 1960 through 1976 thanks to individual gymnasts such as Olympic all-around champions Sawao Katō and Yukio Endō. Several innovations pioneered by Japanese gymnasts during this era have remained in the sport, including the Tsukahara vault.

More recently, Japanese men have re-emerged as top contenders since winning a team gold at the 2004 Olympics. Six-time World champion and two-time Olympic all-around gold medalist Kōhei Uchimura is widely considered to be the best all-around gymnast ever, and Hiroyuki Tomita won 10 World and Olympic medals from 2003 to 2008.

The women have been less successful, but there have been individual standouts such as Olympic and World medalist Keiko Tanaka-Ikeda, who competed in the 1950s and 1960s, and more recently Koko Tsurumi, Rie Tanaka, Natsumi Sasada, Yuko Shintake, Asuka Teramoto, Sae Miyakawa, Hitomi Hatakeda, Aiko Sugihara, and Mai Murakami. Tsurumi won a bronze medal in the all-around and silver on bars at the 2009 World Championships, and Murakami won gold on floor in 2017, the first Japanese woman to win a World gold medal since Tanaka-Ikeda.

===Germany===
The German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, had a very successful gymnastics program before the reunification of Germany. Its MAG and WAG teams frequently won silver or bronze medals at the World Championships and Olympics, led by male gymnasts such as Andreas Wecker and Roland Brückner, and female gymnasts such as Maxi Gnauck, Karin Janz, and Erika Zuchold.

The Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, had international stars like Eberhard Gienger, Willi Jaschek, and Helmut Bantz.

Since its reunification, Germany has produced some medal-winning gymnasts, including Fabian Hambüchen, Philipp Boy, and Marcel Nguyen among the men and Pauline Schäfer, Elizabeth Seitz, Sophie Scheder, and Tabea Alt among the women. The former Soviet/Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina also competed for Germany from 2006 to 2012, winning two World medals and an Olympic silver on vault.

===Czechoslovakia===
The Czechoslovakian women&#x27;s team was the main threat to the dominance of the Soviet women&#x27;s team for decades. They won team medals at every World Championships and Olympics from 1934 to 1970, with the exceptions of the 1950 Worlds and 1956 Olympics. Among their leaders were Vlasta Děkanová, the first women&#x27;s World all-around champion, and Věra Čáslavská, who won all five European, World and Olympic all-around titles during the 1964–68 Olympic cycle—a feat never matched by any other gymnast, male or female. Čáslavská also led Czechoslovakia to the world team title in 1966, making the country one of only two (Romania being the other) ever to defeat the Soviet women&#x27;s team at a major competition.

The Czechoslovakian men&#x27;s success at the World Championships was the greatest of any country before World War II: They were first in the medal table more than any other nation and won the most team titles during the pre-WWII period.

Together, Czechoslovakia and its precursor, the Austro-Hungarian constituent Bohemia, produced four men&#x27;s World all-around champions: Josef Čada in 1907, Ferdinand Steiner in 1911, František Pecháček in 1922, and Jan Gajdoš in 1938. Their most decorated athlete was Ladislav Vácha, who won 10 individual World and Olympic medals.

===Hungary===
Led by individuals such as 10-time Olympic medalist (with five golds) Ágnes Keleti, the Hungarian women&#x27;s team medaled at the first four Olympics that included women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics competitions (1936–1956), as well as at the 1954 World Championships. After a long decline, World and Olympic vault champion Henrietta Ónodi put them back on the map in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Hungarian men never had the same level of success as the women. However, Zoltán Magyar dominated the pommel horse in the 1970s, winning eight of a possible nine European, World, and Olympic titles from 1973 to 1980. Szilveszter Csollány, a World and Olympic champion on rings, also won medals at major competitions for a decade starting in the early 1990s. In more recent years, Krisztián Berki has won World and Olympic titles on the pommel horse.

===Other nations===
Several other nations have been strong competitors in WAG and MAG. The rise of various countries&#x27; programs in recent years is partly due to the large exodus of coaching talent from the USSR and other former Eastern Bloc countries.

In the past two decades, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and South Korea have produced World and Olympic medalists and have started winning team medals at continental, World and Olympic competitions. Individual gymnasts from Croatia, Greece, North Korea, Slovenia, Spain, and Ireland have also been successful in major competitions.

==Health consequences==

=== Physical health ===
Gymnastics sits on many lists of the world&#x27;s most dangerous sports. Artistic gymnastics carries an inherently high risk of spinal and other injuries, and in extremely rare cases, gymnasts have sustained fatal injuries. Julissa Gomez, an American gymnast, died in 1991 after breaking her neck while vaulting three years earlier. Several other gymnasts have been paralyzed from accidents in training or competition, including Elena Mukhina of the Soviet Union and Sang Lan of China.

=== Mental health ===
The pressure of the sport can make it even more dangerous to athletes. During the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, gymnast Simone Biles took a step back from competition to assess her mental health and ensure she was not putting herself at a greater risk of physical injury. Other athletes have expressed their support and called for a greater emphasis on mental health in gymnastics.

== Controversies and abuse ==
Eating disorders are also common, especially in women&#x27;s gymnastics, in which gymnasts are motivated and sometimes pushed by coaches to maintain a below-normal body weight. The problem gained public attention in the 1990s after the death of Christy Henrich, a U.S. national team member who suffered from anorexia and bulimia.

Abusive coaching and training practices in gymnastics gained widespread attention after Joan Ryan&#x27;s book &quot;Little Girls in Pretty Boxes&quot; was published in 1995. USA Gymnastics began investigating several coaches in their program for abuse. In the late 2010s, many individual gymnasts—including former elite competitors from Australia, Britain, and the United States—began to speak out about the abuse they had experienced. This followed several years of allegations of sexual abuse by gymnastics coaches and other authority figures, including the former U.S. team doctor Larry Nassar. In April 2020, Maggie Haney, former coach of Olympian Laurie Hernandez, was suspended for eight years following her allegations of verbal and emotional abuse toward her gymnasts.

During the 1996 Olympics, Kerri Strug injured her foot after her first vault. However, her vault was standing between Team USA and a gold medal. Strug performed her second vault, landing on one foot, and was carried off by her coach, crying in pain. Strug&#x27;s teammate, Dominique Moceanu also opened up about the abuse she experienced. She said that she competed in the Olympics with a tibial stress fracture. Additionally, she fell on her head during her beam routine and discussed how none of these injuries were properly treated. After being the coordinators for Team USA for nearly three decades in 2016, Bela and Marta Karolyi retired. After allegations that gymnasts were experiencing sexual abuse while training at the Karolyi ranch, it was officially closed in 2018.

Upon investigations of those working closely with Larry Nassar, John Geddert, head coach of the 2012 Women&#x27;s Olympic Team, was suspended by USA Gymnastics for sexual assault, physical abuse, and human trafficking, and committed suicide shortly after being charged in February 2021. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had heard allegations from gymnasts regarding their sexual abuse as early as 2015 but did not address them until years later when Nassar was sentenced to prison in 2017. At the time of Nassar&#x27;s court hearing, more than 160 women had spoken up about the abuse they endured. In a Senate hearing from September 2021, the victims and their representatives claimed that Nassar had abused 120 more women from the time the FBI knew about his allegations until the time they took action against him.

<doc id="231484" wikidata="Q5097214" url="?curid=231484" title="Chigley">
<text>Chigley (1969) is the third and final stop-motion children&#x27;s television series in Gordon Murray&#x27;s &quot;Trumptonshire&quot; trilogy. Production details are identical to &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; and &quot;Trumpton&quot;.

As in &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; and &quot;Trumpton&quot;, the action centres on a small community, the village of Chigley, near Camberwick Green in Trumptonshire. Chigley is more of an industrial area than Camberwick Green and Trumpton.

A digitally restored version of the series from the rediscovered original film masters emerged in 2012.

==Background, Overview, Story and structure== 
Winkstead Hall, a stately home, is central to life in Chigley. The aristocratic owner, Lord Belborough, and his butler Brackett, also operate a heritage railway. They are called on to transport or collect goods in every episode, much to Lord Belborough&#x27;s delight, as he loves driving the engine, &quot;Bessie&quot;. Another character frequently delighted by these excursions is Winnie Farthing, whom Lord Belborough and Brackett nearly always invite to join them for a train ride. The notable song unique to Chigley, &quot;Time flies by when I&#x27;m the driver of a train&quot;, was always sung during these sequences. Winkstead Hall and its grounds are regularly opened to the public, who have access to the picture gallery and tea gardens (both regularly seen). Other parts of the Hall and its estate which also feature in the programmes include the library, the hall, the kitchen garden (and greenhouses), the engine shed (home of &quot;Bessie&quot;), and the pump room (home of &quot;Binnie&quot;, Lord Belborough&#x27;s stationary steam beam engine).

Chigley features many guest appearances by characters from the previous two series. This was at least partly for economic reasons, as it allowed the re-use of theme songs and puppets, thus saving money on recording and manufacture.

Lord Belborough invites everyone to the grounds of Winkstead Hall after the daily 6 o&#x27;clock whistle (which marks the end of the day&#x27;s work at the local biscuit factory), when he plays his vintage Dutch organ, while the workers dance. This scene forms the conclusion of each episode.

Chigley also happened to be the first programme on the BBC to feature the copyright year in Roman numerals in the credits (MCMLXIX) nearly seven years prior to most other regular BBC programmes from 1976 (MCMLXXVI) to the present time.

==Episodes==
Episode titles were given in &quot;Radio Times&quot; but were not shown on-screen.

==Characters==
===Winkstead Hall===
The Winkstead Hall estate is a large stately home whose activities, including a heritage railway, dominate life in Chigley village.
* Lord Belborough – the owner of the hall, a peer of the realm, and driver of the steam locomotive Bessie; he appears in every episode.
* Mr Brackett – Lord Belborough&#x27;s butler, and fireman on the steam railway; he appears in every episode.

* Mr Roger Varley – the Camberwick Green chimney sweep is also employed part-time at Winkstead Hall as maintenance engineer for the steam engines &quot;Bessie&quot; and &quot;Binnie&quot;; he appears in 2 episodes.

===The Villagers===
Only a relatively small number of Chigley villagers are introduced in the series, as many storylines involve existing Trumpton or Camberwick Green characters visiting Chigley.
* Mr Swallow – the wharfinger at Treddle&#x27;s Wharf, at the intersection of Trumpton Canal with both road and rail networks; he appears in 10 episodes.
* Mr Harry Farthing – the potter at Chigley Pottery, who is also a sculptor; he appears in 8 episodes.
* Winnie Farthing – the potter&#x27;s daughter; a frequent train passenger, she appears in 10 episodes.
* Mr S. Rumpling – the bargee, whose canal boat (based at Chigley and registered at Trumpton) is a major source of supply to the village; he appears in 6 episodes.
* Mr Clutterbuck – the local builder; he appears in 2 episodes.
* Horace – a labourer employed by Mr Clutterbuck; he appears in 1 episode.
* Cyril – a labourer employed by Mr Clutterbuck; he appears in 1 episode.
* Corporation dustmen – the two corporation dustmen, one of whom is named as Harry, appear in 1 episode.
* Dancing women – two unnamed Chigley women dance with the factory workers at the six o&#x27;clock whistle; they appear in all 13 episodes.

===The biscuit factory===
The factory is the village&#x27;s chief source of employment. Cresswell&#x27;s Chigley Biscuits is the company which owns and operates the facility, and operates a fleet of delivery lorries transporting the finished biscuits from the factory to the railway station at Wintlebury.
* Mr Cresswell – the owner and general manager of the factory; he appears in 4 episodes, and is referenced in a fifth.
* Mr Fletcher – the loading bay supervisor; he appears in the closing dance scene of every episode, and in the storyline of 3 episodes.
* Mr McGregor – one of the delivery drivers; he is chiefly known for being unavailable for work in episode 12.
* Mr Patterson – one of the delivery drivers; he is commended for his skill in not knocking down Jimmy Rankin in episode 4.
* Willie Munn – works on the biscuit cutting machine; he is the nephew of Mr Clamp, the Trumpton greengrocer, and he has a starring role in episode 12.
* The workers – a large number of unnamed factory workers are seen throughout the series, in and around the factory, and at the evening dance after the six o&#x27;clock whistle; they appear in every episode; the number of workers is unknown, but at least 16, as that number are seen on screen together at the six o&#x27;clock whistle.

===Visitors===
Chigley was frequently visited by tradesmen and other characters from neighbouring communities, allowing the re-use of Trumpton and Camberwick Green figures.

===Unseen characters===
* Mrs Tripp – the milkman&#x27;s wife
* Mrs McGarry – the policeman&#x27;s wife
* Millicent Mopp – the doctor&#x27;s sister
* Mr Wilkins – the Trumpton plumber
* Jimmy Rankin – a boy who narrowly avoided being knocked down by a Cresswell&#x27;s delivery van

==Home releases==
In 1984, 15 years after its broadcast on the BBC in 1969. Longman Video released one video with the first four episodes as part of its &#x27;Children&#x27;s Treasury&#x27; collection.

5 years later, in 1989, the BBC released a video with the three more episodes (ep.13 &quot;A Present for Lord Belborough&quot;, ep.11 &quot;Apples Galore&quot; and ep.10 &quot;Trouble with the Crane&quot;).


And in 1996–1997, Telstar Video Entertainment released two videos as part of its &#x27;Star Kids&#x27; range.

In 2011, &quot;Chigley&quot; and the two earlier series &quot;Camberwick Green&quot; and &quot;Trumpton&quot; were digitally-restored from the rediscovered original film masters.

==Cultural references==
* The indie group Half Man Half Biscuit parodied the Chigley Train Song in their song &quot;Time Flies By (When You&#x27;re the Driver of a Train)&quot;. They also released a single entitled &quot;The Trumpton riots&quot; containing many character references.
* In the comic book &quot;Preacher&quot;, the train song was sung by Jesus de Sade, a sexually depraved character, whilst riding a bicycle, naked.
* The Oasis song &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; contains the line &quot;Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball&quot;. This was, according to lead guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher, inspired by Brackett the butler from Chigley.
* In the first episode of the 2003 BBC sitcom &quot;Early Doors&quot;, bar patrons Joe and Duffy et al. tease bartender Ken about his hobby train set by serenading him with the first line of the Chigley Train Song.

It was released in the United States on September 27, 2002, by Buena Vista Pictures through their Touchstone Pictures banner.

==Plot==

On a beach in Pigeon Creek, Alabama, 10-year-olds Jake Perry and Melanie Smooter inspect the result of lightning striking sand. Jake asserts that they will be married one day.

In the present, Melanie is a New York fashion designer who has adopted the surname &quot;Carmichael&quot; to hide her poor Southern roots. After wealthy Andrew Hennings proposes, Melanie returns to her hometown to Pigeon Creek, Alabama, to announce her engagement to her parents Earl and Pearl Smooter and to finalize her divorce from her estranged husband Jake, whom she married as a pregnant teenager and left after she miscarried their baby. Meanwhile, Kate Hennings, Andrew&#x27;s mother and current Mayor of New York City, doubts Melanie&#x27;s suitability to wed her son, whom she is grooming to run for President of the United States.

Melanie visits Jake, who has refused to sign divorce papers over the years since she left for New York. After he orders her out of the house, Melanie empties Jake&#x27;s checking account, hoping to spur him into ending the marriage. Angry, Jake leaves to meet some friends at the local bar. Melanie follows and gets drunk, insults her old school friends, and outs her longtime friend, Bobby Ray. Jake scolds her and takes her home, preventing her from driving drunk, and Melanie wakes to find the signed divorce papers on her bed.

Melanie goes to the Carmichael plantation and apologizes to Bobby Ray, whose family lives there. She is cornered there by Kate&#x27;s assistant Barry Lowenstein, who is sent to gather information on Melanie&#x27;s background, posing as a reporter for the New York Post. Bobby Ray backs up her pretense that she is a relative and the family mansion is her childhood home. Melanie reconciles with her friends and learns that after she split with Jake, he followed her to New York to win her back. Intimidated by the city and her success, he returned home to make something of himself first. She and Jake have a heart-to-heart, and Melanie realizes why he never signed their divorce papers.

Andrew arrives to surprise Melanie, but upon discovering her true background and that she is married, he angrily leaves. He later returns, saying he still wants to marry her, and the wedding is set into motion. Melanie&#x27;s New York friends arrive. While visiting a restaurant/resort with a glassblowing gallery, they admire its glass sculptures. Melanie realizes that Jake is the artist and owns the resort.

During Melanie and Andrew&#x27;s wedding at the Carmichael estate, Wallace Buford, Melanie&#x27;s attorney, halts the ceremony. He has the divorce papers, which Melanie hadn&#x27;t signed. As Melanie is about to sign the papers, she realizes that her love for Jake is still there. She tells Andrew that she gave her heart to Jake and never got it back. She and Andrew wish each other well; Kate then berates Melanie and her mother, for which Melanie punches Kate. Before running off to find Jake, she tells everyone who is friends and family of the bride to stick around.

Melanie finds Jake at the beach planting lightning rods in the sand to create more glass sculptures. She tells him they are still married, and they return to what would have been Melanie and Andrew&#x27;s wedding reception, where they have their first dance as husband and wife.

A mid-credits sequence shows that they have a baby daughter, Melanie continues to thrive as a designer, and Jake opens a &quot;Deep South Glass&quot; franchise in New York. Andrew is engaged to a girl named Erin Vanderbilt.

==Cast==

In addition, Dakota Fanning and Thomas Curtis appear briefly as the childhood versions of Melanie and Jake, respectively.

==Production==
===Casting===
Charlize Theron was considered for the lead role before Reese Witherspoon was cast.

Katharine Towne was cast as Witherspoon&#x27;s character&#x27;s assistant who ultimately ends up marrying the Patrick Dempsey character, but all other scenes were dropped in the final cut.

===Filming===
Although centered in a fictional version of the town of Pigeon Creek, near a fictional version of Greenville, Alabama, the film was mostly shot in Georgia. The Carmichael Plantation, which Melanie tells the reporter is her childhood home, is the Oak Hill Berry Museum, a historic landmark in Georgia which is near the campus of Berry College in Rome, Georgia.

&quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; was the first film allowed to be shot in New York City after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It was also the first film allowed to film at Tiffany &amp; Co. since &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961).

The streets and storefronts of Crawfordville, Georgia, were used as the backdrop for the Catfish Festival and other downtown scenes. The coonhound cemetery was on Moore Street in Crawfordville and the bar was located at Heavy&#x27;s Barbecue near the town. Glass that forms when lightning hits sand, as in the film, is called fulgurite.

Jake&#x27;s glassblowing shop was filmed at an old mill named Starr&#x27;s Mill, in Fayette County, Georgia. Wynn&#x27;s Pond in Sharpsburg, Georgia, is where Jake lands his plane. The historic homes shown at Melanie&#x27;s return to Pigeon Creek were shot in Eufaula, Alabama.

==Release==

===Critical response===
This film received mostly mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a critical score of 38% based on 160 reviews, with an average rating of 5.19/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Reese Witherspoon is charming enough, but the road to Alabama is well-traveled.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun Times,&quot; awarded it three out of four stars, commenting, &quot;It is a fantasy, a sweet, light-hearted fairy tale with Reese Witherspoon at its center. She is as lovable as Doris Day would have been in this role... So I enjoyed Witherspoon and the local color, but I am so very tired of the underlying premise.&quot; Andrew Sarris, critic for the &quot;New York Observer,&quot; said that the movie &quot;Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial New Yorker if 26-year-old Reese Witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character, Melanie Carmichael, with a massive infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic.&quot;

===Box office performance===
The film grossed over US$35 million in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office, beating &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; and &quot;Barbershop&quot;. At the time, it had the highest September opening weekend, surpassing &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. For a decade, the film would hold this record until 2012 when &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; took it. Despite getting dethroned by &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, it still made $21.3 million during its second weekend. By the end of its run in the United States, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; grossed over US$130 million, and another US$53,399,006 internationally. With a reported budget of US$30 million, it was a box office hit, despite the mixed reviews.

===Home media===
&quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on February 4, 2003, it was released on Blu-ray on November 6, 2012, as part of its 10th anniversary. It sold 2 million DVD copies on its first day of release, and sold 7.40 million copies earning a profit of over 128.7 million dollars.

<doc id="231487" wikidata="Q699655" url="?curid=231487" title="ThunderCats (1985 TV series)">
<text>ThunderCats is an American animated science fantasy television series produced by Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment and Leisure Concepts. It debuted in 1985, based on the characters created by Tobin Wolf. The series, for which Leonard Starr was the head writer, follows the adventures of a group of catlike humanoid aliens. The animation for the episodes was provided by the Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation, with Masaki Iizuka as production manager. The studio was acquired in 1989 to form Walt Disney Animation Japan. Season 1 of the show aired in 1985, consisting of 65 episodes. Seasons 2, 3, and 4 each contained twenty episodes, starting with a five-part story.

The series was originally distributed by Rankin/Bass&#x27; then-parent company Telepictures Corporation, which would merged with Lorimar Productions in 1986. In 1989, Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by and folded into Warner Bros., whose television syndication arm assumed distribution of the show; Warner Bros. had the rights to the series (and all Lorimar-Telepictures programming) from that point on. Leisure Concepts, which helped co-develop the show, acted as a licensing agent for the series.

It also aired on Cartoon Network as part of the Toonami block.

There were also several comic book series produced: Marvel Comics&#x27; version, 1985 to 1988; and five series by Wildstorm, an imprint of DC Comics, beginning in 2003.

A film adaptation of the series was announced in June 2007; Aurelio Jaro was making an animated feature film of &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, based on a script written by Paul Sopocy. Jerry O&#x27;Flaherty, veteran video game art director, had signed on to direct. The film was planned to be produced by Spring Creek Productions. It was originally set for a summer 2010 release, but the movie has since been put on hold. Concept art for the film has also been leaked online.

==Production==
The first season cost $15 million to make. Stanley Weston oversaw the creation of the series.

== Plot ==
&quot;ThunderCats&quot; follows the adventures of the eponymous team of heroes, cat-like humanoid aliens on a planet called Third Earth. The series plot begins with the dying planet Thundera meeting its end, forcing the ThunderCats (a sort of Thunderean nobility) to flee their homeworld. The fleet is attacked by the Thundereans&#x27; enemies, the Mutants of Plun-Darr, who destroy most of the starships in the &quot;ThunderFleet&quot;, but spare the flagship hoping to capture the legendary mystic Sword of Omens they believe is on board. The sword holds the Eye of Thundera, the source of the ThunderCats&#x27; power, which is embedded in the hilt. Though the Mutants damage the flagship, the power of the Eye drives them back. The damage to the ship means the journey to their original destination is not possible, instead having to journey to &quot;Third Earth&quot;, which will take much longer than they had anticipated. The eldest of the ThunderCats, Jaga, volunteers to pilot the ship while the others sleep in capsules. However, he dies of old age in the process, but not before ensuring they will reach their destination safely. The flagship contains the young Lord of the ThunderCats, Lion-O, as well as the ThunderCats Cheetara, Panthro, Tygra, WilyKit and WilyKat, and Snarf.

When the ThunderCats awaken from their suspended animation on Third Earth after ten &quot;galacto-years&quot;, Lion-O discovers that his suspension capsule has slowed, rather than stopped, his aging. He has now become essentially a child in the body of an adult. Together, the ThunderCats and the friendly natives of Third Earth construct the &quot;Cat&#x27;s Lair&quot;, their new home and headquarters, but before long, the Mutants have tracked them down to Third Earth. The intrusion of these two alien races upon the world does not go unnoticed, however, as a demonic, mummified sorcerer calling himself Mumm-Ra recruits the Mutants to aid him in his campaign to acquire the Eye of Thundera and destroy the ThunderCats so that his evil may continue to hold sway over Third Earth.

== Episodes ==

== Setting ==
=== Season 1 ===
The basic plot above sets the stage the first season of the show, and serves as the basis for stories mixing elements of science fiction and fantasy into a traditional good-versus-evil tale, introducing recurring allies and villains into the world of the &quot;ThunderCats&quot;. Futuristic technology is just as central to the series as magic and myth, but even in the midst of all this action, the series never underemphasizes the importance of moral values in solving problems. Each episode would normally include a short dénouement, featuring the characters recuperating after the events of the story and taking the time to single out a personal value or wholesome approach that helped save the day, or could have done so if they had seen it.

The first half of Season 1 featured a gentle continuity, with early episodes following on from one another and establishing recurring concepts, although this became less common as the season transitioned into its second half, which comprised mostly incidental one-shot adventures. Tying the second half of season one together was the overarching five-part adventure written by series head writer Leonard Starr, &quot;Lion-O&#x27;s Annointment&quot;, in which an unarmed Lion-O faced off against first each of the other ThunderCats, and then Mumm-Ra, so he could truly earn his title as Lord of the ThunderCats. The five parts were:

# &quot;Day One: The Trial Of Strength&quot; – Lion-O had to out-do Panthro in a strength contest.
# &quot;Day Two: The Trial Of Speed&quot; – Lion-O had to beat Cheetara in a race.
# &quot;Day Three: The Trial Of Cunning&quot; – Lion-O had to outwit both of the &quot;ThunderKittens&quot;, WilyKat and WilyKit, in an underground location.
# &quot;Day Four: The Trial Of Mind-Power&quot; – Lion-O was pitted against Tygra in a mind-based challenge.
# &quot;Last Day: The Trial Of Evil&quot; – Lion-O had to defeat Mumm-Ra. In his &quot;Trial Of Evil&quot;, Lion-O discovered that Mumm-Ra was highly dependent on the sarcophagus inside which he had been mummified.

On all four days except the last, the Mutants tried to interfere with Lion-O&#x27;s trials so that they could force the ThunderCats to remain leaderless. The other ThunderCats were each then forced to involve themselves in the conflict specifically to foil the Mutants&#x27; interferences—all while trying to avoid assisting Lion-O in his anointment trials.

Although intended to be viewed consecutively (as the adventures depicted occurred one day after the other), the five parts of the mini-series were erroneously aired (and released on DVD) with multiple other episodes between each installment.

=== Season 2 ===
When the series returned in 1987, it was revealed that the evil wizard Mumm-Ra had survived. &quot;ThunderCats – Ho!&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Mumm-Ra Lives!&quot;, set the pattern for the following three seasons, each of which began with a five-part mini-series—again written by Leonard Starr—that established the new characters and concepts that would go on to influence the rest of the season. In the case of &quot;Mumm-Ra Lives!&quot;, these concepts included the debut of the villainous Lunataks, which became a third faction that existed for the rest of the series, and the new team of ThunderCats from &quot;ThunderCats – Ho!&quot; receiving their own headquarters and vehicles.

=== Season 3 ===
The 1988 season began with the Peter Lawrence-scripted &quot;ThunderCubs&quot; which, though named for its plot about the ThunderCats being transformed into children, was principally about Mumm-Ra reconstructing Thundera in order to retrieve both the weapon that had originally destroyed it (the Sword of Plun-Darr) and the legendary Treasure of Thundera. In the course of the adventure, the treasure—containing the Book of Omens, a tome holding all the secrets of the ThunderCats, and many other mystical items—was scattered across the New Thundera, ushering in a new concept for the series: a season with an actual story arc. Continuity between episodes became tighter as the ThunderCats, Mutants, Lunataks and Mumm-Ra alternated their adventures between Third Earth and New Thundera, searching for the treasure and exploiting its powers. The season also featured the running theme of the Ancient Spirits of Evil having to take a more active hand in pushing Mumm-Ra into action, culminating in another unique feature of the season—an actual finale episode, &quot;The Last Day&quot;, in which the Ancient Spirits of Evil give Mumm-Ra one last chance to destroy the ThunderCats by sunset. Besides demonstrating their threat by making Ma-Mutt disappear, the Ancient Spirits of Evil stated that Mumm-Ra&#x27;s failure will also have the Mutants and the Lunataks removed from Third Earth as well. Ultimately, Mumm-Ra failed and the Ancient Spirits of Evil exiled him to the farthest corner of the Universe.

=== Season 4 ===
In the opening miniseries, Peter Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Return to Thundera!&quot;, the ThunderCats returned to New Thundera to rebuild their society, but before departing, they destroyed Mumm-Ra&#x27;s pyramid. This enraged the Ancient Spirits of Evil to the point that they brought Mumm-Ra back and installed him within a new pyramid on New Thundera. The season proved to be quite divorced from what had gone before, with adventures consigned almost entirely to New Thundera, and most villainous opposition coming from either Mumm-Ra or assorted new villains. The Mutants, Lunataks, and Captain Cracker all returned for one episode each. However, in the series finale, several conclusions are reached:
* Mumm-Ra stands up to and successfully asserts himself over the Ancient Spirits of Evil.
* The mystery of the Book of Omens is at last solved.
* The tumultuous and terrifying environment of Thundera is at last rendered peaceful and pristine.

== Cast ==
Despite its large cast of characters, &quot;ThunderCats&quot; featured a rather small circle of voice actors, with only six actors providing voices for the entire first season. Every actor provided multiple voices, although the distinctive baritone of Earle Hyman (Panthro) left the actor providing only very occasional guest voices in comparison with his fellow performers. In particular, as the first season&#x27;s only female actor, Lynne Lipton (Cheetara and WilyKit) provided voices for every single female character that appeared in the season. Earl Hammond (Mumm-Ra and Jaga) and Bob McFadden (Snarf and Slythe) would most regularly provide the voices of guest characters.

1986&#x27;s &quot;Thundercats—Ho!&quot; added Gerrianne Raphael to the cast as the voice of Pumyra, while 1987&#x27;s &quot;Mumm-Ra Lives!&quot; saw the addition of Doug Preis as the voice of Alluro.

Warner Home Video/Warner Bros. Family Entertainment released the entire original 1980s series of &quot;ThunderCats&quot; in the US over a number of volumes in the following order:
=== Complete series ===
Warner Home Video have released the entire &quot;ThunderCats&quot; series in the UK in the following order:
== Reception ==
In January 2009, IGN named &quot;ThunderCats&quot; as the 49th-best show in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.

== Spinoffs ==
=== Film ===
On 16 November 1987, a VHS called &#x27;Thundercats Ho!&#x27; was released in the UK by Video Collection International. The film was submitted to the BBFC, who recorded it being 90 m 31s excluding 5 seconds cut for a Universal rating. It was actually the first five episodes of season 2 edited to look like a feature-length film. Season 2 never aired in the UK. This VHS may have been shown on American TV by stations without access to the individual episodes.

In 2008–2009, Warner Bros. was in the process of creating an animated film based on &quot;ThunderCats&quot;. It was rumored to be an original story expanding on the events of the first episode and the film&#x27;s concept artwork (released in July 2009) contained the main character Lion-O and three locations. A two-minute test scene was filmed and presented to Warner Bros.; however, the movie has been put on indefinite hold, perhaps due to the critical and commercial failure of the 2008 movie &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (another Warner Bros. CGI project).

In March 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. was once more actively developing a live-action &quot;ThunderCats&quot; film with Adam Wingard attached to direct the film, with a screenplay by Wingard and Simon Barrett, and Roy Lee and Dan Lin serving as producers.

=== 2011 series ===

A new &quot;ThunderCats&quot; animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation began airing on Cartoon Network from July 2011. Animation production was provided by Japanese animation studio Studio 4°C. Sam Register was the executive producer and was joined by Michael Jelenic and Ethan Spaulding as the producers for the series. The show explained Lion-O&#x27;s ascension to the Thunderean throne with a more original feel and darker style than the 1980s series. The new series made it clear in the very beginning, however, that they are not adhering to the original story line. In the original series the Thunder Cats leave Thundera, as the last of their race, to eventually arrive on the 3rd earth. In the new series the very first line states that the Thundereans are already on the 3rd earth. As the first few episodes progress the new writers seem to use Thundera but it is not clear if they are referring to a planet or kingdom. Former Lion-O voice actor Larry Kenney returned to play the role Lion-O&#x27;s father Claudus in the opening two-part episode of the new series.

In January 2011, a promotional poster featuring re-imagined designs for Lion-O, Cheetara, Panthro, and Tygra as well as design for the Sword of Omens and vehicles were shown at the London Toy Fair. The series began airing on Cartoon Network on July 29, 2011 with an hour-long premiere, while the UK premiere on Cartoon Network began on 10 September the same year.

Despite an early positive response (with the animation in particular receiving heavy praise from critics), the series failed to make any real impact and viewing figures slowly declined after the first episode, with blame falling on a relatively dark and complicated storyline considering the show was aimed at 6-12 year olds. Merchandise struggled to sell, and as a result the show was cancelled after only one season.

=== &quot;ThunderCats Roar&quot; ===
== In other media ==
=== Comic books ===

There were also several comic book series produced. A &quot;ThunderCats&quot; comic book series based on the animated series was originally published by Marvel Comics through its Star Comics imprint in 1985, lasting for 3 years and 24 issues. During this time, a new series was published by Marvel UK consisting of 129 issues and was also published for three years. Beginning in 2002 &quot;ThunderCats&quot; titles were published by Wildstorm Productions, an imprint of DC Comics (Warner Bros.&#x27; corporate sibling), and included 5 non-canon mini-series and several one-shots.

Dynamite would partner with WB create a new Thundercats comic with a spinoff Cheetos comic released in July 2024.

=== Video games ===
Two video games based on the franchise exist: &quot;ThunderCats: The Lost Eye of Thundera&quot;, a 1987 side-scrolling video game; and &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, a 2012 Nintendo DS game based on the show&#x27;s revival. Many years later, Cartoon Network&#x27;s official website featured a game that allowed visitors to play as Lion-O and rescue fellow ThunderCats while venturing into Mumm-Ra&#x27;s tomb (this game, titled &quot;ThunderCats: Tomb of Mumm-Raa&quot;, can be found on an archived Toonami database).

== Merchandise ==
LJN produced the ThunderCats action figures from 1984 to 1987. The ThunderCats line was based on the animated series which was actually created in 1983. Due to difficulties, it would not air until 1985. Each figure had an action feature of some sort, and the line also included a unique &quot;laser&quot; light-up feature that interacted between the Cats&#x27; Lair playset, some figures, and some accessories. Lion-O&#x27;s eyes and Mumm-Ra&#x27;s eyes would illuminate when a special battery-powered key ring that came with the figure was pressed into a slot in their backs. PVC companions were packaged with some figures in 1986, including WilyKat with Tygra, WilyKit with Cheetara, Snarf with Lion-O, and Ma-Mutt with Mumm-Ra. The PVC companion figures were also produced as full size articulated figures.

LJN did produce a few variant figures including the young Tygra version and the silver rat-eye daggers for Rataro. There are also a few slight color variations of Lion-O, such as red and orange-haired versions. The third series of figures from 1987 are harder to find along with the Tongue-A-Saurus and Astral Moat Monster. Driller and Stinger are the toughest figures to track down; Stinger&#x27;s wings are very fragile, making it next to impossible to find a loose, complete figure.

An unproduced final series of figures would have included The Mad Bubbler, Red-Eye of the Lunataks, Ratilla, Cannon-Blaster and Quick-Jaws from the Bezerkers as well as the Feliner, Thunderstrike and Luna Tacker. Photos of these were featured in the 1987 LJN catalog.

Other ThunderCats merchandise of the 1980s included, among other items, a board game, TV tray table, an electronic racing set, tin lunch box, clothing and apparel. A retro spurt occurred in the mid-1990s and 2000s (decade) that began with the familiar 1980s ThunderCats emblem on T-shirts and has since grown to include new T-shirt designs and various other ThunderCats-themed apparel such as hats and belt buckles, plus a tan backpack with the ThunderCats on it.

In May 2009, Warner Brothers gave Hard Hero the rights to produce a line of collectible statues based on the ThunderCats characters.

In 2011, Bandai released a new toylines, based on both the classic and the 2011 series.

In February 2011, Mezco Toyz acquired the ThunderCats license to produce large scale rotocast figures based on the 1980s animated series. Lion-O was the first announced figure in their toyline.

Jerry Macaluso, owner of Pop Culture Shock, collectible statue company, announced in March 2010 that he had acquired his &quot;dream license&quot;. The company went on to produce premium format ThunderCats statues (1:4 scale, over 30 inches) of Lion-O and Mumm-Ra. Prototypes of Cheetara and Tygra were developed and displayed online and at San Diego Comic-Con, respectively, but did not reach minimum pre-order thresholds. The prototypes were donated to the ThunderCats Museum in 2014.

<doc id="231500" wikidata="Q5310140" url="?curid=231500" title="Dual-modulus prescaler">
<text>A dual modulus [[prescaler]] is an electronic circuit used in high-frequency synthesizer designs to overcome the problem of generating narrowly spaced frequencies that are nevertheless too high to be passed directly through the feedback loop of the system. The modulus of a prescaler is its frequency divisor. A dual-modulus prescaler has two separate frequency divisors, usually M and M+1.

==The problem==
A frequency synthesizer produces an output frequency, fo, which, divided by the modulus, N, is the reference frequency, fr:

formula_1

The modulus is generally restricted to integer values, as the comparator will match when the waveform is in phase. Typically, the possible frequency multiples will be the channels for which the radio equipment is designed, so fr will usually be equal to the channel spacing. For example, on narrow-band radiotelephones, a channel spacing of 12.5 kHz is typical.

Suppose that the programmable divider, using N, is only able to operate at a maximum clock frequency of 10 MHz, but the output fo is required to be in the hundreds of MHz range. Interposing a fixed prescaler that can operate at this frequency range with a division ratio M of, say, 40 drops the output frequency into the operating range of the programmable divider. However, a factor of 40 has been introduced into the equation, so the output frequency is now:

formula_2

If fr remains at 12.5 kHz, only every 40th channel can be obtained. Alternatively, if fr is reduced by a factor of 40 to compensate; it becomes 312.5 Hz, which is much too low to give good filtering and lock performance characteristics. It also means that programming the divider becomes more complex, as the modulus needs to be verified so that only those that give true channels are used, not every 1/40th of a channel that is available.

==The solution==
The solution is the dual modulus prescaler. The main divider is split into two parts, the main part N and an additional divider A, which is strictly less than N. Both dividers are clocked from the output of the dual-modulus prescaler, but only the output of the N divider is fed back to the comparator. Initially, the prescaler is set to divide by M + 1. Both N and A count down until A reaches zero, at which point the prescaler is switched to a division ratio of M. At this point; the divider N has completed A counts. Counting continues until N reaches zero, which is an additional N - A counts. At this point, the cycle repeats.

formula_3

So while we still have a factor of M being multiplied by N, we can add an additional count, A, which effectively gives us a divider with a fractional part. Only the prescaler needs to be constructed from high-speed parts, and the reference frequency can remain equal to the desired output frequency spacing.

The diagram below shows the elements and arrangement of a frequency synthesizer with a dual-modulus prescaler. (Compare with the diagram on the main synthesizer page).

One can compute A and N from the formulae:

formula_4

where V is the combined division ratio V = MN+A. For this to work properly, A must be strictly less than M, as well as less than or equal to N. These restrictions on values of A imply that you can&#x27;t get every division ratio V. If V falls below M(M - 1), some channels will be missing.

==Example==

Today, most dual-modulus prescalers exist inside PLL chips, making it impossible to probe actual signals during operation. The first dual-modulus prescalers were discrete ECL devices, separate from the PLL chips. Here is an example of a dual-modulus prescaler in use. This circuit happens to use a Motorola MC145158 with a Fujitsu MB-501 dual-modulus prescaler operating in the 128/129 mode. The PLL is locked at 917.94 MHz (fo) with a channel spacing frequency of 30 kHz (fr). The total integer count, therefore, is 30,598. Dividing this by 128 (M) yields a quotient of 239 with a remainder of 6, N, and A, respectively. The result of this frequency choice is that the prescaler spends most of its time counting at 128 and just a brief period at 129.

This is shown by the upper purple trace, the modulus control, A, counter output. These two screen captures differ only in the horizontal scale. The lower, yellow trace is the N counter output whose frequency corresponds to the channel spacing frequency of 30 kHz. The green trace is the output from the dual-modulus prescaler, which happens to correspond to 7.1714 MHz in the case that the prescaler is at 128 and 7.1158 when it is at 129. It is plainly obvious that the modulus control is low for precisely 6 cycles of the prescaler output. What is not obvious is the fact that the frequency changes by less than one percent between the two states of the modulus control. There will be cases where A = 0, resulting in the dual-modulus prescaler counting only by 128. This would happen at 906.24, 910.08, 913.92, 917.76, 921.60 MHz, and so on.

<doc id="231503" wikidata="Q11773777" url="?curid=231503" title="Sun Wukong">
<text>Sun Wukong (, ), also known as the Monkey King, is a literary and religious figure best known as one of the main characters in the 16th-century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. In the novel, Sun Wukong is a monkey born from a stone who acquires supernatural powers through Taoist practices. After rebelling against heaven, he is imprisoned under a mountain by the Buddha. Five hundred years later, he accompanies the monk Tang Sanzang riding on the White Dragon Horse and two other disciples, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing, on a journey to obtain Buddhist sutras, known as the West or Western Paradise, where Buddha and his followers dwell.

Sun Wukong possesses many abilities. He has supernatural strength and is able to support the weight of two heavy mountains on his shoulders while running &quot;with the speed of a meteor&quot;. He is extremely fast, able to travel 108,000 li (54,000km, 34,000mi) in one somersault. He has vast memorization skills and can remember every monkey ever born. As king of the monkeys, it is his duty to keep track of and protect every monkey. Sun Wukong acquires the 72 Earthly Transformations, which allow him to access 72 unique powers, including the ability to transform into animals and objects. He is a skilled fighter, capable of defeating the best warriors of heaven. His hair has magical properties, capable of making copies of himself or transforming into various weapons, animals and other things. He has partial weather manipulation skills, can freeze people in place, and can become invisible.

The supernatural abilities displayed by Wukong and some other characters were widely thought of as &quot;magic powers&quot; by readers at the time of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;&#x27;s writing, without much differentiation between them despite the various religious traditions that inspired them and their different and varied functions, and were often translated as such in non-Chinese versions of the book.

==History==
As one of the most enduring Chinese literary characters, Wukong has a varied and highly debated background and colorful cultural history. His inspiration might have come from an amalgam of influences, generally relating to religious concepts.
One source for inspiration came from differing ways gibbons were venerated during the Chinese Chu kingdom (700–223 BC), and various legends about gibbons and monkeys in Chu and its successors. These legends and religious practices, alongside doctrine from Taoist organizations that reinforced them and combined elements from all five kinds of traditional religious Taoism gave rise to stories and art motifs during the Han dynasty, eventually contributing to the Sun Wukong figure.

==Background==
===Birth and early life of Sun Wukong===
According to &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Sun Wukong is born from a strong magic stone that sits atop the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The stone is said to receive the nurture of heaven (yang), which possesses a positive nature, and earth (yin), which possesses a negative nature, and thus is able to produce living beings, according to Taoist philosophies. The stone develops a magic womb, which bursts open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball.

When the wind blows on the egg, the egg becomes the stone monkey. As his eyes move, two beams of golden light shoot toward the Jade palace and startle the Jade Emperor. When he sees the light he orders two of his officers to investigate. They report the stone monkey, and that the light is dying down as the monkey eats and drinks. The Jade Emperor believes him to be nothing special.

On the mountain, the monkey joins a group of other wild monkeys. After playing, the monkeys regularly bathe in a stream. One day, they decide to seek the source of the stream and climb the mountain to a waterfall. They declare that whoever goes through the waterfall, finds the stream&#x27;s source, and comes out again will become their king. The stone monkey volunteers and jumps into the waterfall.

The stone monkey finds a large iron bridge over rushing water, across which is a cave. He persuades the other monkeys to jump in also, and they make it into their home. He then reminds them of their prior declaration, so they declare him their king. He takes the throne and calls himself Handsome Monkey King (美猴王). This happiness does not last. When one of his older monkey friends dies, the Monkey King is very upset. He decides to strike out from his island on a self-made raft, in search of an Immortal to teach him how to beat death.

He comes ashore and wanders around. Humans see him and flee, uncertain of his ape-like appearance. He takes some clothes that were left out to dry and continues on foot. His face hidden by a hood, he travels through towns and sees many examples of human degeneracy and vice. He continues on and into a forest. The Monkey King hears a woodcutter singing an interesting song, and when questioning the woodcutter about the origin he learns it was taught to the woodcutter by an Immortal who resides in the forest.

The Monkey King comes to the entrance of a temple in which a magical Taoist martial artist named Puti Zushi resides. Puti Zushi initially refuses to let him in, but the Monkey King refuses to leave and waits outside the entrance for months. Puti Zushi is impressed by the Monkey King&#x27;s persistence and allows him to enter. He accepts the Monkey King as a student, giving him his religious name, &quot;Sun Wukong&quot;, and teaches him many advanced Taoist practices, including the Way of Immortality.

He later advises Sun Wukong never to needlessly show off his skills, because others might ask him to teach them, and if he does teach them, they may go on to cause trouble, but if he doesn&#x27;t teach them, they will resent him for it. He then forbids Sun Wukong from ever revealing who it was that taught him, and the loyal Monkey King promises never to reveal the identity of his Master. Later, whenever Sun Wukong is asked about his powers and skills, he honestly replies that he learned everything in his dreams. Throughout the rest of the book, however, Sun Wukong is, repeatedly, referred to as a member of the &quot;Monad Sect&quot;.

After the Monkey King returns home, he learns that a demon called the Demon King of Confusion is kidnapping the monkeys of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to use as slaves. He subsequently kills the demon and his minions, saving the kidnapped monkeys. He also brings the entire weapon storage of a nearby country for his subjects but is unable to find a weapon fit for himself. Upon hearing that Dragon Kings possess many treasures, he travels the oceans and finds the palace of a Dragon King.

At the entrance, Sun Wukong asks for an introduction, but Dragon King Ao Guang tells his guards to turn him away. Sun Wukong barges in anyway, brushing off protests from the guards, insisting the Dragon King must be confused to turn away a fellow king. Inside, he introduces himself and encourages the Dragon King to give him a weapon. Quickly realizing Sun Wukong is quite formidable, the Dragon King feigns willingness and hospitality, ordering his underlings to bring out weapon after weapon, starting from basic spears and swords but quickly escalating to genuine treasures. Sun Wukong tests each weapon, but none are robust enough for the Monkey King, who is unhappy with the situation.

Sun Wukong then acquires the golden-banded staff Ruyi Jingu Bang/Ding Hai Shen Zhen (如意金箍棒/定海神针), the stabilizer of the Four Seas and a treasure of Ao Guang. The Monkey King is the only creature strong enough to wield the staff-like weapon and there is an instant affinity between them. The golden-banded staff can change its size, elongate, fly, and attack opponents according to its master&#x27;s will. It weighs 13,500 &quot;jīn &quot;or 7960kg. When not wielding the weapon, the Monkey King shrinks it down to the size of a sewing needle and stores it in his ear.

In addition to taking the magical staff, the Monkey King encourages the Dragon King to gift him attire fit for a King. The Dragon King calls upon the Dragon Kings for assistance, and they arrive and give Sun Wukong a golden chain mail shirt (鎖子黃金甲, &quot;Suǒzihuángjīnjiǎ&quot;), a phoenix-feather cap ( ), and cloud-walking boots ( ). Sun Wukong thanks the Dragon Kings and leaves happy.

Upon his return to the mountain, Wukong demonstrates the new weapon to his monkey tribe and draws the attention of other beastly powers, who seek to ally with him. He forms a fraternity, the Seven Sages (七聖), with the Bull Demon King (), the Saurian Demon King (), the Roc Demon King (), the Lion Spirit King (), the Macaque Spirit King (), and the snub-nosed monkey Spirit King ().

The Monkey King, now sentenced to death for extorting the Dragon Kings, then defies Hell&#x27;s attempt to collect his soul. He wipes his name out of the Book of Life and Death, a collection of books claimed to have every name of every mortal alive and the ability to manipulate lifespan, along with the names of all monkeys known to him. The kings of the Diyu report him to the Jade Emperor. The heavenly army uses everything, even trying to erase him from existence altogether, but ultimately fails.

===Havoc in Heaven===

Hoping that a promotion and a rank among the gods will make him more manageable, the Jade Emperor invites the Monkey King to Heaven. The Monkey King believes he is receiving an honourable place as one of the gods as he is told he will be made &quot;Protector of the Horses&quot;, a fancy term the Heavens coined for a stable boy, the lowest job in heaven. When he discovers the importance of status in Heaven, and how he has been given the lowest position, the Monkey King sets the Cloud Horses free from the stable, then returns to his own kingdom and proclaims himself The Great Sage, Heaven&#x27;s Equal.

The Heavens reluctantly recognize his self-proclaimed title after Gold Star advises the Jade Emperor against rushing into military action against the &quot;brash, rude and impudent&quot; monkey, warning that failing to defeat Monkey would harm the reputation of Heaven. Gold Star advises the Jade Emperor to superficially appease Sun Wukong&#x27;s vanity while treating him as a pet, and invite him back to Heaven to keep him from causing trouble on earth. The Jade Emperor agrees after Gold Star laughs that, in reality, the fanciful title is a meaningless joke revealing Sun Wukong&#x27;s overconfidence and ignorance of the important workings of Heaven.

Sun Wukong suspects a trap but is happy when Gold Star, acting as an envoy, addresses him as the Great Sage Equal of Heaven and presents him with official papers. Gold Star tells Sun Wukong he has been granted a far more important position as &quot;Guardian of the Heavenly Peach Garden&quot;, which peach-loving Sun Wukong accepts. Later, when seven heavenly maidens are sent by Queen Mother Xi Wangmu to pluck peaches for the Royal Banquet, Sun Wukong discovers every important god and goddess has been invited to the banquet except for him. When he tells the maidens he is the Great Sage Equal of Heaven, the maidens giggle, replying that everyone in Heaven knows he is merely an immortal who tends to the peach garden. The Monkey King&#x27;s indignation then turns to open defiance.

During the preparations for the Royal Banquet, Sun Wukong sneaks in to taste the fine foods and drink royal wine. In a tipsy state, the Monkey King roams Heaven while all the gods and goddesses are on their way to the banquet. He reaches high levels of the palace that the authorities of Heaven leave unguarded, for they can only be accessed by deities of the highest and purest spiritual power. Upon realizing that he is at the top of the 33 layers of the heavenly palace, Sun Wukong steals and consumes Laozi&#x27;s Pills of Immortality and Xi Wangmu&#x27;s Peaches of Immortality, takes the remainder of the Jade Emperor&#x27;s royal wine, and then escapes back to his kingdom in preparation for his rebellion.

The Jade Emperor refuses to accept Gold Star&#x27;s counsel to find another peaceful way to deal with Sun Wukong and orders his forces to mobilize. Laughing continuously and fully enjoying himself, and with a combination of martial prowess, guile, and quick-witted creative responses to many different types of powerful Heavenly weapons used against him, the Monkey King single-handedly defeats the Army of Heaven&#x27;s 100,000 celestial warriors, all 28 constellations, Nezha, and all of the Four Heavenly Kings.

Then Guanyin, the Boddhisattva of Mercy, and her disciple Muzha/Moksha arrive. Guanyin sends Muzha to inspect the situation and fight Sun Wukong. Muzha is defeated, and then Guanyin suggests the Jade Emperor&#x27;s nephew Erlang Shen fight Wukong. Wukong and Erlang are evenly matched and eventually, both turn into terrifying figures, which scares Wukong&#x27;s monkey army away. Sun Wukong is disheartened and turns into a fish to run away, then both of them keep shapeshifting to turn into more powerful things than the other, finally, Laozi throws his Diamond Jade ring at Wukong from behind while he is fighting, knocking him senseless and enabling Erlang to bind him up.

After several failed attempts at execution, Sun Wukong is locked into Laozi&#x27;s eight-way trigram crucible for 49 days to be distilled into an elixir by samadhi fires; this will allow Laozi to regain his pills of longevity. The fire of the crucible is hot enough to burn beings of so much unspeakable power that they rival Buddha himself.

When the cauldron is opened 49 days later, the Monkey King jumps out, having survived by hiding in a corner marked by the wind trigram, where there is less fire. The heat from the samadhi fires has reinforced his bodily frame, making him stronger than ever before and impervious to greater damage. The heat gives him a new ability; the Monkey King can now recognize evil with his new &quot;huǒyǎn-jīnjīng&quot; (, ). Sun Wukong then proceeds to destroy the crucible and makes his way to Heaven&#x27;s main chamber to confront the Jade Emperor and his senior advisors.

===Imprisonment===
The Jade Emperor and the authorities of Heaven appeal to the Buddha, who arrives from his temple in the West in person. After listening to Sun Wukong, who makes a case that he should be the new Jade Emperor, the Buddha makes a bet that the Monkey King cannot escape from his palm. The Monkey King smugly accepts the bet. He leaps and flies all the way to the edge of the universe. Seeing nothing there but five towering pillars, the Monkey King believes that he has reached the end of all existence.

To prove his trail, he marks a pillar with a phrase declaring himself the Great Sage Equal to Heaven and urinates on the middle pillar. He then leaps back and returns to Buddha&#x27;s palm to claim his victory in winning the bet. Sun Wukong is then very surprised to find that the five &quot;pillars&quot; he found are merely fingers of the Buddha&#x27;s hand, finding it impossible to believe. When the Monkey King tries to escape the palm, Buddha turns his hand into a mountain of rocks, sending Sun Wukong hurtling back down to earth.

Before the Monkey King can lift the mountain off, the Buddha seals him there, using a paper talisman bearing the mantra, &quot;Om Mani Padme Hum&quot;, in gold letters. The Monkey King remains imprisoned in stocks for five hundred years, to &quot;learn patience and humility&quot;, with only his head and hands protruding from the base of the mountain. The Buddha arranges two earth spirits to feed the Monkey King iron pellets when he is hungry, and molten copper when he is thirsty.

===Disciple to Tang Sanzang===
Five hundred years later, the Bodhisattva Guanyin searches for disciples to protect a pilgrim on a journey to the West to retrieve the Buddhist sutras. In the hearing of this, the Monkey King offers to serve the pilgrim, Tang Sanzang, a monk of the Tang dynasty, in exchange for his freedom after the pilgrimage is complete. Understanding Sun Wukong will be difficult to control, Guanyin gives Tang Sanzang a gift from the Buddha: a magical circlet which, once the Monkey King is tricked into putting it on, can never be removed. When Tang Sanzang chants a certain sutra, the band will tighten and cause an unbearable headache. Guanyin gives the Monkey King three special hairs, only to be used in dire emergencies. Under Tang Sanzang&#x27;s supervision, the Monkey King is allowed to journey to the West.

Throughout the novel, the Monkey King faithfully helps Tang Sanzang on his journey to India. They are joined by &quot;Pigsy&quot; ( ) and &quot;Sandy&quot; ( ), both of whom accompany the priest to atone for their previous crimes. Tang Sanzang&#x27;s safety is constantly under threat from demons and other supernatural beings, as well as bandits, as they believe that by eating Tang Sanzang&#x27;s flesh, one will obtain immortality and great power. The Monkey King often acts as Tang Sanzang&#x27;s bodyguard to combat these threats. The group encounters a series of eighty-one tribulations before accomplishing their mission and returning safely to China.

During the journey, the Monkey King learns about virtues and the teachings of Buddhism. There, the Monkey King attains Buddhahood, becoming the &quot;Victorious Fighting Buddha&quot; ( ), for his service and strength. The Monkey King is revealed to know about the fate of Tang Sangzang and also of his knowledge in many other things, as on three occasions he knew that the monk was supposed to suffer and he also cured a king who had been ill for many years, and knew properties of herbs no one knew of. Wukong also mentions being sworn brothers with Erlang Shen.

==Names and titles==
Sun Wukong is known/pronounced as &quot;Syun1 Ng6-hung1&quot; in Cantonese, &quot;Son Gokū&quot; in Japanese, &quot;Sonogong&quot; in Korean, &quot;Sun Ngō͘-Khong&quot; in Minnan/Hokkien, &quot;Tôn Ngộ Không&quot; in Vietnamese, &quot;Sung Ghokong&quot; or &quot;Sung Gokhong&quot; in Javanese, &quot;Sun Ngokong&quot; in Thai, &quot;Wu Khone&quot; in Burmese, and &quot;Sun Gokong&quot; in Malay.

Listed in the order that they were acquired:
;&quot; Shí Hóu&quot; (): Means &quot;stone monkey&quot; This refers to his physical essence, being born from a sphere of rock after millennia of incubation on the Bloom Mountains/Flower-Fruit Mountain.
;&quot; Měi Hóuwáng&quot; (): Means &quot;Handsome Monkey-King&quot;, Houwang for short. The adjective &quot;Měi&quot; means &quot;beautiful, handsome, pretty&quot;. It also means &quot;to be pleased with oneself&quot;, referring to his ego. &quot;Hóu&quot; (&quot;monkey&quot;) also highlights his &quot;naughty and impish&quot; character.
;&quot; Sūn Wùkōng&quot; (): The name given to him by his first master, Patriarch Bodhi (Subodhi). The surname &quot;Sūn&quot; was given as an in-joke about the monkey, as monkeys are also called &quot;húsūn&quot; (), and can mean either a literal or a figurative monkey (or a macaque). The surname &quot;Sūn&quot; () and the &quot;monkey&quot; &quot;Sūn&quot; () only differ in that the latter carries an extra &quot;dog&quot; (&quot;quǎn&quot;) radical to highlight that refers to an animal. The Monkey King later conferred his new surname to his entire clan back on Mount Huaguo. The given name, &quot;Wùkōng&quot;, means &quot;awakened to emptiness&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;aware of vacuity&quot;. The name &quot;Sun Wukong&quot; first appeared in the play &quot;Drama of Journey to the West&quot; (西遊記雜劇) by Yang Jingxian (楊景賢, d. early 1400s). In the play, Bodhisattva Guanyin gives him the name during a scene in which she has a circlet put on his head and presents a robe to cover his animal body.
;&quot; Bìmǎwēn&quot; (): The title of the keeper of the Heavenly Horses, a punning of &quot;bìmǎwēn&quot; (; lit. &quot;avoiding the horses&#x27; plague&quot;). A monkey was often put in a stable, as people believed its presence could prevent the horses from catching illness. Sun Wukong was given this position by the Jade Emperor after his first intrusion into Heaven. He was promised that it was a good position to have and that he would be in the highest position. After discovering it was one of the lowest jobs in Heaven, he became angry, smashed the entire stable, set the horses free, and then quit. From then on, the title bìmǎwēn was used by his adversaries to mock him.
;&quot; Qítiān Dàshèng&quot; (): Means &quot;The Great Sage, Heaven&#x27;s Equal&quot;. Wùkōng took this title suggested to him by one of his demon friends, after he wreaked havoc in heaven people who heard of him called him Great Sage (Dàshèng, 大聖). The title originally holds no power, though it is officially a high rank. The Jade Emperor later granted the title the responsibility to guard the Heavenly Peach Garden, keeping Sun Wukong busy so he would not make trouble.
;&quot; Xíngzhě&quot; (): Meaning &quot;ascetic&quot;, it refers to a wandering monk, a priest&#x27;s servant, or a person engaged in performing religious austerities. Tang Sanzang calls Wukong &quot;Sūn-xíngzhě&quot; when he accepts him as his companion. This is pronounced in Japanese as &quot;gyōja&quot;, making him Son-gyōja.
;&quot; Dòu-zhànshèng-fó&quot; (鬥戰勝佛): &quot;Victorious Fighting Buddha&quot;. Wukong was given this name once he ascended to Buddhahood at the end of the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. This name is also mentioned during the traditional Chinese Buddhist evening services, specifically during the eighty-eight Buddha&#x27;s repentance.
;&quot;Língmíng-shí-hóu&quot; (): &quot;Intelligent Stone Monkey&quot;. Wukong is revealed to be one of the four spiritual primates that do not belong to any of the ten categories that all beings in the universe are classified under. His fellow spiritual primates are the Six-Eared Macaque (), who is one of his antagonists in the main storyline, the Red-Bottomed Horse Monkey (), and the Long-Armed Ape Monkey (), neither of who make actual appearances, only mentioned in passing by the Buddha. The powers and abilities of each are equal to that of the others. 
;&quot; Sūn Zhǎnglǎo&quot; (): Used as an honorific for a monk.

In addition to the names used in the novel, the Monkey King has other names in different languages:
*&quot;Kâu-chê-thian&quot; () in Minnan (Taiwan): &quot;Monkey, Equal of Heaven&quot;.
*&quot;Maa5 lau1 zing1&quot; () in Cantonese (Hong Kong and Guangdong): &quot;Monkey Imp&quot;, called so by his enemies.

==Abilities==
Apart from his powerful staff, martial arts skills, and superhuman physical prowess, Sun Wukong is notable for wielding a sundry of magic powers, some featured many times throughout the novel and others only once, and most of them cultivated during his Taoist training under Puti Zushi. Said powers include, but are not limited to:
*Cloud Somersaulting ():
:The Monkey King&#x27;s infamous ability to travel or &quot;leap&quot; 108,000 li (54,000km, 34,000mi) in one somersault. The ability, oft portrayed as Wukong riding a nimbus-like cloud, requires a magic hand sign, an oral spell, a fist clench, and a body shake. Wukong&#x27;s master Puti Zushi taught this ability to the monkey to give him a style of flying that compliments his penchant for jumping.
*Seventy-two Transformations ():
:Also known as Multitude of Terrestrial Killers (). A power originally learned by the Monkey King from his master Puti Zushi to avoid the Three Calamities (), sent by heaven to punish those who attain immortality by means of Taoist self-cultivation. The Monkey King was given the choice between either learning the &quot;Multitude of the Heavenly Ladle&quot; () that permits 36 changes, or the &quot;Multitude of Terrestrial Killers/Earthly Fiends&quot; that allows for 72, and chose the latter. It allows the monkey to transform his body into virtually anything, from humanoid forms to animal ones, including small insects, to miscellaneous objects and even entire buildings, or to simply change his size (from gigantic to microscopically small). While fighting Nezha, the Monkey King copied the latter&#x27;s war form with three heads and six arms (), showcasing his ability to precisely alter specific parts of his body. Overall, the &quot;Seventy-two Changes&quot; metaphorically designate an endless variety of transformations (not limited to just 72 in a literal sense), and in addition, it is suggested that for each of the 72 Changes, Sun Wukong has an extra life as well.
*Immortal Breath ():
:The Monkey King&#x27;s magic breath, which is what allows him to transform his hairs and staff, among other such mystic effects as: manipulating his own spirit, healing wounds, or divinely empowering others.
*Bod(y/ies) Beyond The Body ():
:The Monkey King&#x27;s ability to transform any one of his 84,000 hairs into whatever he wishes upon the command &quot;Change!&quot; (): from humanoid figures to animals (like insects), to miscellaneous items (tools, money, and even food). However, the monkey mainly uses this power throughout the novel to spawn clones of himself, with Wukong boasting that a single hair can be multiplied into millions and even billions. A seemingly separate ability (denoted as such in the novel) is called Method of Bodily Division (), also allowing the Monkey King to create clones of himself.
*Method of Imitating/Modelling Heaven and Earth ():
:An extension of the Monkey King&#x27;s shapeshifting powers, it allows him to grow into a monstrous, giant-sized form upon uttering the command &quot;Grow!&quot; (). Such form is described as being 10,000 zhang () in height, but this may be metaphorical for a much larger, cosmically proportioned size, since Sun Wukong boasts about his ability to fill the universe with his body should he will it.
*Three Live-Saving Hairs ():
:Three special hairs created from willow branch leaves that are gifted to the Monkey King by Guanyin, allowing him to create anything he wishes specifically in fulfillment of his duties as Tripitaka&#x27;s guardian; they are notably distinct from Wukong&#x27;s other magic hairs.
*Diamond Body (); AKA Copper Head, Iron Limbs ):
:Refers to the Monkey King&#x27;s near-invulnerable body, immune to hits from blades or mallets, lightning, fire, poison, etc.
*Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils ():
:Truth-seeing eyes, able to distinguish certain dualities (good from evil, truth from lies, the rich from poor, etc.) as well as see through illusions and magical disguises/transformations. It also allows Wukong to see far distances in a clairvoyant fashion (1,000 li during the day and between 300 to 500 li at night).
*Method of Bodily Concealment ():
:A spell that allows Wukong to become invisible to the eyes of humans and even gods and spirits. See also Gathering Mists, Intangible Form (), a method of stealth, by means of transforming, almost, into air and wind, used by Wukong. 
*Body-Departing Spirit ():
:AKA Means of the Spirit Leaving the Body (); essentially the ability of astral projection.
*Body-Fixing Method ():
:A spell that lets the Monkey King freeze humans, gods, and spirits alike in place, for up to a full day&#x27;s worth of time. This is usually done by repeatedly saying the command &quot;Freeze!&quot; () and pointing at a target.
*Lock-Breaking Method ():
:Allows Wukong, with only a point of his finger or staff, to open any lock.
*Protective Circles ():
:The Monkey King draws a circle on the ground with his staff, which functions as a protective ward or barrier as tough as an iron wall. Used to protect Tripitaka, it dissuades enemies from approaching, whether they be tigers, wolves, ogres, or demons.
*Fire Avoidance Spell ():
:Allows Wukong to survive fire; it does not work against the True Samādhi Fire ().
*Water Avoidance Spell (); Method of Water Restriction ():
:Spells that, respectively, allow the Monkey King to ward off water and to travel through water unimpeded, by opening waterways. Still, the monkey is unable to properly fight underwater.

==Immortality==
Sun Wukong is said to have gained immortality through nine different means and instances, which together made him one of the most immortal and invincible beings in all of creation.

===Disciple to Puti Zushi===
After feeling down about the future and death, Wukong sets out to find the immortal Taoist patriarch Puti Zushi to learn how to be immortal. There, Wukong learns spells to grasp all five elements and cultivate the way of immortality, as well as the 72 Earthly Transformations. After seven years of training with the sage, Wukong gains the secret formula to immortality. It is noted that the Court of Heaven does not approve of this method of immortality.

===Book of Mortals===
In the middle of the night, Wukong&#x27;s soul is tied up and dragged to the World of Darkness. He is informed there that his life in the human world has come to an end. In anger, Wukong fights his way through the World of Darkness to complain to &quot;The Ten Kings&quot;, who are the judges of the dead. The Ten Kings try to address the complaint and calm Wukong by saying many people in the world have the same name and the fetchers of the dead may have gotten the wrong name. Wukong demands to see the register of life and death, then scribbles out his name, thus making him untouchable by the fetchers of death, along with the names of all of the monkeys in his tribe. It is because Wukong has learned magical arts as a disciple to Puti Zushi that he can scare the Ten Kings, demanding from them the book of mortals and removing his name, thus making him even more immortal. After this incident, the Ten Kings complained to the Jade Emperor.

===Peach of Immortality===
Soon after the Ten Kings complained to the Jade Emperor, the Court of Heaven appoints Sun Wukong as &quot;Keeper of the Heavenly Horses&quot;, a fancy name for a stable boy. Angered by this, Wukong rebels, and the Havoc in Heaven begins. During the Havoc in Heaven, Wukong is assigned to be the &quot;Guardian of the Heavenly Peach Garden&quot;. The garden includes three types of peaches, each of which grants over 3,000 years of life. The first type blooms every three thousand years. Anyone who eats it will become immortal, and their body will become both light and strong. The second type blooms every six thousand years. Anyone who eats it will be able to fly and enjoy eternal youth.

The third type blooms every nine thousand years. Anyone who eats it will become &quot;eternal as heaven and earth, as long-lived as the sun and moon&quot;. While serving as the guardian, Wukong does not hesitate to eat the peaches, thus granting him immortality and the abilities that come with the peaches. If Wukong had not been appointed as the Guardian of the Heavenly Peach Garden, he would not have eaten the Peaches of Immortality and would not have gained another level of immortality.

===Heavenly Wine===
Because of Wukong&#x27;s rebellious antics, Wukong is not considered as an important celestial deity and is thus not invited to the Queen Mother of the West&#x27;s royal banquet. After finding out that every other important deity was invited, Wukong impersonates one of the deities that was invited and shows up early to see why the banquet is important. He immediately is distracted by the aroma of the wine and decides to steal and drink it. The heavenly wine has the ability to turn anyone who drinks it into an immortal.

===Pills of Longevity===
While drunk from the heavenly wine, Wukong stumbles into Laozi&#x27;s alchemy lab, where he finds Laozi&#x27;s pills of longevity, known as &quot;The Immortals&#x27; Greatest Treasure&quot;. Filled with curiosity about the pills, Wukong eats a gourd of them. Those who eat the pills will become immortal. If Wukong had not been drunk from the heavenly wine, he would not have stumbled into Laozi&#x27;s alchemy lab and eaten the pills of longevity.

===Aftermath of immortality===
Following Wukong&#x27;s three cause-and-effect methods of immortality during his time in heaven, he escapes back to his home at the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The Court of Heaven finds out what Wukong has done and a battle to capture Wukong ensues. Due to the five levels of immortality Wukong has achieved, his body became nearly invincible and survives the multiple execution attempts by heaven. In the notable last execution, Wukong was placed inside Laozi&#x27;s furnace in the hope that he would be distilled into the elixir of the pills of immortality. Wukong survives 49 days of the samadhi fire in Laozi&#x27;s furnace and gains the ability to recognize evil.

Meanwhile, being refined in the crucible extracts yet more of the impurities of mortality and leaves him with another immortality. In desperation, the Court of Heaven seeks help from Buddha, who imprisons Wukong under a mountain, after having tricked him into agreeing to a wager. Wukong&#x27;s immortality and abilities ultimately come into use after Guanyin suggests he becomes a disciple of Tang Sanzang in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. In the story, he protects Sanzang from evil demons who wish to eat Sanzang to achieve immortality. Wukong&#x27;s own immortality protects him from the various ways the demons try to kill him, such as fighting, beheading, disembowelling, poisoning, and boiling oil.

Early in the Pilgrimage, Wukong ate another Pill of Immortally, meant for the Black Wind Bear Guai. Sometime during the journey, Wukong and his companions obtain ginseng fruit (; Man-fruit), a fruit even rarer and more powerful than the Peaches of Immortality, as only 30 of them will grow off one particular tree only found on the Longevity Mountain () every 10,000 years. While one smell can grant 360 years of life, consuming one will grant another 47,000 years of life.

In addition to all of the immortality-granting wines and medicines that the Monkey King had consumed while in heaven, upon reaching the Buddha&#x27;s temple, pilgrims were provided with Buddhist equivalents of such foods, therefore making Sun Wukong even more immortal; a 9-fold immortal.

==In &quot;Xiyoubu&quot;==
The brief satirical novel &quot;Xiyoubu&quot; (西遊補, &quot;Supplement to the Journey to the West,&quot; c. 1640) follows Sun Wukong as he is trapped in a magical dream world created by the Qing Fish Demon, the embodiment of desire (情, qing). Wukong travels back and forth through time, during which he serves as the adjunct King of Hell and judges the soul of the recently dead traitor Qin Hui during the Song dynasty, takes on the appearance of a beautiful concubine and causes the downfall of the Qin dynasty, and faces King Paramita, one of his five sons born to the demoness Princess Iron Fan, on the battlefield during the Tang dynasty.

The events of the &quot;Xiyoubu&quot; take place between the end of chapter 61 and the beginning of chapter 62 of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. The author, Tong Yue (童說), wrote the book because he wanted to create an opponent—in this case, desire-itself—that Sun Wukong could not defeat with his great strength and martial skill.

==Influence==

In &quot;The Shaolin Monastery&quot; (2008), Tel Aviv University professor Meir Shahar claims that Sun influenced a legend concerning the origins of the Shaolin staff method. The legend takes place during the Red Turban Rebellion of the Yuan dynasty. Bandits lay siege to the monastery, but it is saved by a lowly kitchen worker wielding a long fire poker as a makeshift staff. He leaps into the oven and emerges as a monstrous giant big enough to stand astride both Mount Song and the imperial fort atop Shaoshi Mountain, which are five miles apart. The bandits flee upon seeing him. The Shaolin monks later realize that the kitchen worker was the Monastery&#x27;s local guardian deity, Vajrapani, in disguise. Shahar compares the worker&#x27;s transformation in the stove with Sun Wukong&#x27;s time in Laozi&#x27;s crucible, their use of the staff, and the fact that Sun Wukong and his weapon can both grow to gigantic proportions.

<text>Glaciology (; ) is the scientific study of glaciers, or, more generally, ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.

Glaciology is an interdisciplinary Earth science that integrates geophysics, geology, physical geography, geomorphology, climatology, meteorology, hydrology, biology, and ecology. The impact of glaciers on people includes the fields of human geography and anthropology. The discoveries of water ice on the Moon, Mars, Europa and Pluto add an extraterrestrial component to the field, which is referred to as &quot;astroglaciology&quot;.

==Overview==

A glacier is a persistent body of dense ice, a form of rock) formed from snow falling and accumulating over a long period of time; glaciers move very slowly, either descending from high mountains, as in valley glaciers, or moving outward from centers of accumulation, as in continental glaciers.

Areas of study within glaciology include glacial history and the reconstruction of past glaciation. A glaciologist is a person who studies glaciers. A glacial geologist studies glacial deposits and glacial erosive features on the landscape. Glaciology and glacial geology are key areas of polar research.

==Types==

Glaciers can be identified by their geometry and the relationship to the surrounding topography. There are two general categories of glaciation which glaciologists distinguish: &quot;alpine glaciation&quot;, accumulations or &quot;rivers of ice&quot; confined to valleys; and &quot;continental glaciation&quot;, unrestricted accumulations which once covered much of the northern continents.

*Alpine – ice flows down the valleys of mountainous areas and forms a tongue of ice moving towards the plains below. Alpine glaciers tend to make topography more rugged by adding and improving the scale of existing features. Various features include large ravines called &quot;cirques&quot; and arêtes, which are ridges where the rims of two cirques meet. 
*Continental – an ice sheet found today, only in high latitudes (Greenland/Antarctica), thousands of square kilometers in area and thousands of meters thick. These tend to smooth out the landscapes.

==Zones of glaciers==
*Accumulation zone – where the formation of ice is faster than its removal.
*Ablation (or wastage) zone – when the sum of melting, calving, and evaporation (sublimation) is greater than the amount of snow added each year.

==Glacier equilibrium line and ELA==
The glacier equilibrium line is the line separating the glacial accumulation area above from the ablation area below. 
The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and its change over the years is a key indicator of the health of a glacier. A long term monitoring of the ELA may be used as indication to climate change.

==Movement==

When a glacier is experiencing an accumulation input by precipitation (snow or refreezing rain) that exceeds the output by ablation, the glacier shows a &quot;positive glacier mass balance&quot; and will advance. Conversely, if the loss of volume (from evaporation, sublimation, melting, and calving) exceeds the accumulation, the glacier shows a &quot;negative glacier mass balance&quot; and the glacier will melt back. During times in which the volume input to the glacier by precipitation is equivalent to the ice volume lost from calving, evaporation, and melting, the glacier has a steady-state condition.

Some glaciers show periods where the glacier is advancing at an extreme rate, that is typically 100 times faster than what is considered normal, it is referred to as a &quot;surging glacier&quot;. Surge periods may occur at an interval of 10 to 15 years, e.g. on Svalbard. This is caused mainly due to a long lasting accumulation period on subpolar glaciers frozen to the ground in the accumulation area. When the stress due to the additional volume in the accumulation area increases, the pressure melting point of the ice at its base may be reached, the basal glacier ice will melt, and the glacier will surge on a film of meltwater.

=== Rate of movement ===
The movement of glaciers is usually slow. Its velocity varies from a few centimeters to a few meters per day. The rate of movement depends upon the factors listed below:
* Temperature of the ice. A &quot;polar glacier&quot; shows cold ice with temperatures well below the freezing point from its surface to its base. It is frozen to its bed. A &quot;temperate glacier&quot; is at a melting point temperature throughout the year, from its surface to its base. This allows the glacier to slide on a thin layer of meltwater. Most glaciers in alpine regions are temperate glaciers.
* Gradient of the slope. 
* Thickness of the glacier
* Subglacial water dynamics

==Glacial Terminology ==

; Ablation : Wastage of the glacier through sublimation, ice melting and iceberg calving.
; Ablation zone :Area of a glacier in which the annual loss of ice through ablation exceeds the annual gain from precipitation.
; Arête :An acute ridge of rock where two cirques meet.
; Bergschrund : Crevasse formed near the head of a glacier, where the mass of ice has rotated, sheared and torn itself apart in the manner of a geological fault.
; Cirque, Corrie or cwm : Bowl shaped depression excavated by the source of a glacier.
; Creep : Adjustment to stress at a molecular level.
; Flow : Movement (of ice) in a constant direction.
; Fracture : Brittle failure (breaking of ice) under the stress raised when movement is too rapid to be accommodated by creep. It happens, for example, as the central part of a glacier moves faster than the edges.
; Glacial landform : Collective name for the morphologic structures in/on/under/around a glacier.
; Moraine : Accumulated debris that has been carried by a glacier and deposited at its sides (lateral moraine) or at its foot (terminal moraine).
; Névé : Area at the top of a glacier (often a cirque) where snow accumulates and feeds the glacier.
; Nunatak/Rognon/Glacial Island : Visible peak of a mountain otherwise covered by a glacier.
; Horn : Spire of rock, also known as a pyramidal peak, formed by the headward erosion of three or more cirques around a single mountain. It is an extreme case of an arête.
; Plucking/Quarrying : Where the adhesion of the ice to the rock is stronger than the cohesion of the rock, part of the rock leaves with the flowing ice.
; Tarn : A post-glacial lake in a cirque. 
; Tunnel valley : The tunnel that is formed by hydraulic erosion of ice and rock below an ice sheet margin. The tunnel valley is what remains of it in the underlying rock when the ice sheet has melted.

==Glacial deposits==
Source:

===Stratified===
;Outwash sand/gravel :From front of glaciers, found on a plain.
; Kettles :When a lock of stagnant ice leaves a depression or pit.
; Eskers :Steep sided ridges of gravel/sand, possibly caused by streams running under stagnant ice.
; Kames :Stratified drift builds up low, steep hills.
; Varves :Alternating thin sedimentary beds (coarse and fine) of a proglacial lake. Summer conditions deposit more and coarser material and those of the winter, less and finer.

===Unstratified===

; Till-unsorted :(Glacial flour to boulders) deposited by receding/advancing glaciers, forming moraines, and drumlins.
; Moraines : (Terminal) material deposited at the end; (ground) material deposited as glacier melts; (lateral) material deposited along the sides.
; Drumlins :Smooth elongated hills composed of till.
; Ribbed moraines :Large subglacial elongated hills transverse to former ice flow.

<text>In electronics, a varicap diode, varactor diode, variable capacitance diode, variable reactance diode or tuning diode is a type of diode designed to exploit the voltage-dependent capacitance of a reverse-biased p–n junction.

== Applications ==
Varactors are used as voltage-controlled capacitors. They are commonly used in voltage-controlled oscillators, parametric amplifiers, and frequency multipliers. Voltage-controlled oscillators have many applications such as frequency modulation for FM transmitters and phase-locked loops. Phase-locked loops are used for the frequency synthesizers that tune many radios, television sets, and cellular telephones.

The varicap was developed by the Pacific Semiconductor subsidiary of the Ramo Wooldridge Corporation who received a patent for the device in June 1961. The device name was also trademarked as the &quot;Varicap&quot; by TRW Semiconductors, the successor to Pacific Semiconductors, in October 1967. This helps explain the different names for the device as it came into use.

== Operation ==

Varactors are operated in a reverse-biased state, so no DC current flows through the device. The amount of reverse bias controls the thickness of the depletion zone and therefore the varactor&#x27;s junction capacitance. Capacitance change characteristic depends on doping profile. Generally, for abrupt junction profile, the depletion region thickness is proportional to the square root of the applied voltage, and capacitance is inversely proportional to the depletion region thickness. Thus, the capacitance is inversely proportional to the square root of applied voltage. For hyperabrupt junction profile capacitance change is more non-linear, but hyperabrupt varicaps have larger capacitance variation and can work with lower voltages.

All diodes exhibit this variable junction capacitance, but varactors are manufactured to exploit the effect and increase the capacitance variation.

The figure shows an example of a cross section of a varactor with the depletion layer formed of a p–n junction. This depletion layer can also be made of a MOS or a Schottky diode. This is important in CMOS and MMIC technology.

==Use in a circuit==
===Tuning circuits===
Generally the use of a varicap diode in a circuit requires connecting it to a tuned circuit, usually in parallel with any existing capacitance or inductance. A DC voltage is applied as reverse bias across the varicap to alter its capacitance. The DC bias voltage must be blocked from entering the tuned circuit. This can be accomplished by placing a DC blocking capacitor with a capacitance about 100 times greater than the maximum capacitance of the varicap diode in series with it and by applying DC from a high impedance source to the node between the varicap cathode and the blocking capacitor as shown in the upper left circuit in the accompanying diagram.

Since no significant DC current flows in the varicap, the value of the resistor connecting its cathode back to the DC control voltage resistor can be somewhere in the range of 22 kΩ to 150 kΩ and the blocking capacitor somewhere in the range of 5–100 nF. Sometimes, with very high-Q tuned circuits, an inductor is placed in series with the resistor to increase the source impedance of the control voltage so as not to load the tuned circuit and decrease its Q.

Another common configuration uses two back-to-back (anode to anode) varicap diodes. (See lower left circuit in diagram.) The second varicap effectively replaces the blocking capacitor in the first circuit. This reduces the overall capacitance and the capacitance range by half, but has the advantage of reducing the AC component of voltage across each device and has symmetrical distortion should the AC component possess enough amplitude to bias the varicaps into forward conduction.

When designing tuning circuits with varicaps it is usually good practice to maintain the AC component of voltage across the varicap at a minimal level, usually less than 100 mV peak to peak, to prevent changing the diode capacitance too much, which would distort the signal and add harmonics.

A third circuit, at top right in diagram, uses two series-connected varicaps and separate DC and AC signal ground connections. The DC ground is shown as a traditional ground symbol, and the AC ground as an open triangle. Separation of grounds is often done to (i) prevent high-frequency radiation from the low-frequency ground node, and (ii) prevent DC currents in the AC ground node changing bias and operating points of active devices such as varicaps and transistors.

These circuit configurations are quite common in television tuners and electronically tuned broadcast AM and FM receivers, as well as other communications equipment and industrial equipment. Early varicap diodes usually required a reverse voltage range of 0–33 V to obtain their full capacitance ranges, which were still quite small, approximately 1–10 pF. These types were – and still are – extensively used in television tuners, whose high carrier frequencies require only small changes in capacitance.

In time, varicap diodes were developed which exhibited large capacitance ranges, 100–500 pF, with relatively small changes in reverse bias: 0–5 V or 0–12 V. These newer devices allow electronically tuned AM broadcast receivers to be realized as well as a multitude of other functions requiring large capacitance changes at lower frequencies, generally below 10 MHz. Some designs of electronic security tag readers used in retail outlets require these high capacitance varicaps in their voltage-controlled oscillators.

The three leaded devices depicted at the top of the page are generally two common cathode connected varicaps in a single package. In the consumer AM/FM tuner depicted at the right, a single dual-package varicap diode adjusts both the passband of the tank circuit (the main station selector), and the local oscillator with a single varicap for each. This is done to keep costs down – two dual packages could have been used, one for the tank and one for the oscillator, four diodes in all, and this is what was depicted in the application data for the LA1851N AM radio chip. Two lower-capacitance dual varactors used in the FM section (which operates at a frequency about one hundred times greater) are highlighted by red arrows. In this case four diodes are used, via a dual package for the tank / bandpass filter and a dual package for the local oscillator.

==Harmonic multiplication==
In some applications, such as harmonic multiplication, a large signal amplitude alternating voltage is applied across a varicap to deliberately vary the capacitance at signal rate to generate higher harmonics, which are extracted through filtering. If a sine wave current of sufficient amplitude is applied driven through a varicap, the resultant voltage gets &quot;peaked&quot; into a more triangular shape, and odd harmonics are generated.

This was one early method used to generate microwave frequencies of moderate power, 1–2 GHz at 1–5 watts, from about 20 watts at a frequency of 3–400 MHz before adequate transistors had been developed to operate at this higher frequency. This technique is still used to generate much higher frequencies, in the 100 GHz – 1 THz range, where even the fastest GaAs transistors are still inadequate.

==Substitutes for varicap diodes==
All semiconductor junction devices exhibit the effect, so they can be used as varicaps, but their characteristics will not be controlled and can vary widely between batches.

Popular makeshift varicaps include LEDs, 1N400X series rectifier diodes, Schottky rectifiers and various transistors used with their collector-base junctions reverse biased, particularly the 2N2222 and BC547. Reverse biasing the emitter-base junctions of transistors also is quite effective as long as the AC amplitude remains small. Maximum reverse bias voltage is usually between 5 and 7 Volts, before the avalanche process starts conducting. Higher-current devices with greater junction area tend to possess higher capacitance. The Philips BA 102 varicap and a common zener diode, the 1N5408, exhibit similar changes in junction capacitance, with the exception that the BA 102 possesses a &quot;specified&quot; set of characteristics in relation to junction capacitance (whereas the 1N5408 does not) and the &quot;Q&quot; of the 1N5408 is less.

Before the development of the varicap, motor driven variable capacitors or saturable-core reactors were used as electrically controllable reactances in the VCOs and filters of equipment like World War II German spectrum analyzers.

<doc id="231516" wikidata="Q1560034" url="?curid=231516" title="HMS Triton (N15)">
<text>HMS &quot;Triton&quot; was a submarine of the Royal Navy named for the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, the personification of the roaring waters. She was the lead ship of the T class (or &quot;Triton&quot; class) of diesel-electric submarines. Her keel was laid down on 28 August 1936 by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched on 5 October 1937, and commissioned on 9 November 1938.

==Career==
At the onset of the Second World War, &quot;Triton&quot; was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 26–29 August 1939, the flotilla deployed to its war bases at Dundee and Blyth.

===The sinking of HMS &quot;Oxley&quot;===
When the Admiralty was notified that the United Kingdom would declare war on Germany, five submarines of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla were ordered to patrol on the Obrestad line off Norway on 24 August 1939. Thus, on 3 September all British submarines were in their combat patrol sectors.

At 1955 on 10 September 1939, &quot;Triton&quot; had surfaced, fixed a position off the Obrestad Light, set a slow zigzag patrol, and began charging batteries. Lieutenant Commander Steel, having verified that the area was clear and having posted lookouts, gave the bridge to the officer of the watch and went below, leaving orders that he was to be called if anything unusual appeared. At 2045, he was called to the bridge when an object in the water could be seen very fine on the port bow.

Steel ordered propulsion shifted to the main motors, the signalman to the bridge, and torpedo tubes 7 and 8 readied for firing. The object was recognised as a submarine low in the water.

Once on the bridge, the signalman sent three challenges over several minutes with the box lamp, none of which were answered. Steel wondered if the boat could be , which should have been patrolling next in line, but some distance away. Steel and his bridge crew studied the silhouette, but could not distinguish what type of submarine it was.

A fourth challenge was sent: three green rifle-grenade flares. After firing, Steel counted slowly to 15 and then decided that they were seeing a German U-boat. He ordered tubes 7 and 8 fired with a three-second interval. Less than a minute later, an explosion was heard.

&quot;Triton&quot; moved into the area to investigate and heard cries for help. The light from the Aldis lamp revealed three men floundering amid oil and debris.

Lieutenant Guy C. I. St.B. Watkins and Lieutenant Harry A. Stacey entered the water and rescued Lieutenant Commander H.G. Bowerman, &quot;Oxley&quot;″s commanding officer, as well as Able Seaman Gluckes, a lookout. The third person in the water, Lieutenant F.K. Manley, was seen to be swimming strongly when he suddenly sank from view. Neither Manley&#x27;s body nor any other survivors from &quot;Oxley&quot; were found.

A Board of Enquiry found that Steel had done all he reasonably could in the circumstances. &quot;Oxley&quot; was out of position, &quot;Triton&quot; had acted correctly, and the first Allied submarine casualty of World War II was due to &quot;friendly fire.&quot; During the war, the loss of &quot;Oxley&quot; was attributed to an accidental explosion. After the war, it was explained to have been a collision with &quot;Triton&quot;. The truth was not revealed until the 1950s.

===Home waters and the Mediterranean===
&quot;Triton&quot; continued her war patrols, first in Baltic waters. On 8 April, in the lead-up to the German invasion of Norway, she fired ten torpedoes at the German cruisers , &quot;Lützow&quot; and off Skagen. All torpedoes missed their targets. On 10 April 1940, she sank the German steamers , &quot;Wigbert&quot;, and the patrol vessel &quot;Rau 6&quot; in the Kattegat.

Later, she was redeployed to the Mediterranean Sea, based in Alexandria. During her first patrol in the Gulf of Genoa, Lieutenant Watkins, now &quot;Triton&quot;″s commanding officer, decided to enter the harbour of Savona. She found a supply ship at anchor in the harbour, at which she fired a single torpedo and claimed an 8,000-ton kill, though the sinking could not be confirmed. No other ships were available to torpedo, so Watkins surfaced &quot;Triton&quot;. The submarine began shelling a large factory and a gas works on the shore, damaging both of them before departing. According to Italian sources, &quot;Triton&quot;″s target was not a merchant ship; the submarine apparently mistook the chimney of the pump station for the funnel of a merchant ship, and fired the torpedoes against the shore. The Cieli Electric Station sustained slight damage from the gunfire.

==Sinking==
On 28 November 1940, &quot;Triton&quot; left Malta for a patrol in the southern Adriatic Sea. On 6 December, the Italian merchant &quot;Olimpia&quot; was torpedoed by a British submarine in the area. Her distress message was picked up by the Royal Navy, which assumed that the attack had been carried out by &quot;Triton&quot;. The submarine was never heard from again, and was declared lost with all hands on 18 December. &quot;Olimpia&quot; was successfully towed to port by Italian escort units. The Italian Navy claimed that &quot;Triton&quot; was sunk by torpedo boats, probably &quot;Confienza&quot;, possibly by &quot;Clio&quot;, but the date cited was several days after contact was lost. British sources claimed that &quot;Triton&quot; was sunk by naval mines in the Strait of Otranto.

<text>Vande Mātaram (Devanagari: वंदे मातरम् Bengali: বন্দে মাতরম্‌ ; ) is a poem that was adopted as the national song of the Republic of India in 1950. It is written in Sanskritised Bengali by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in the 1870s, and was first published in 1882 as part of Chatterjee&#x27;s Bengali novel &quot;Anandmath&quot;.

The poem is an ode to the motherland, personified as the &quot;mother goddess&quot; in later verses, of the people. This initially referred to Bengal, with the &quot;mother&quot; figure therefore being Banga Mata (Mother Bengal), though the text does not mention this explicitly. Indian nationalist and philosopher Sri Aurobindo referred to &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; as the &quot;national Anthem of Bengal&quot;. 

Nonetheless, the poem played a vital role in the Indian independence movement. It first gained political significance when it was recited by Rabindranath Tagore at Congress in 1896. By 1905, it had become popular amongst political activists and freedom fighters as a marching song. The first two verses of the poem were adopted as the National Song of India in October 1937 by the Congress. The song, as well as &quot;Anandmath&quot;, were banned under British colonial rule under threat of imprisonment, making its use revolutionary. The ban was ultimately overturned by the Indian government upon independence in 1947.

On 24 January 1950, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; as the Republic&#x27;s national song. President of India Rajendra Prasad stated that the song should be honoured equally with the national anthem of India, &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot;. While the Constitution of India does not make reference to a &quot;national song&quot;, the Government filed an &quot;affidavit&quot; at the Delhi High Court in November 2022 stating that &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; and &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; would “stand on the same level”, and that citizens should show equal respect to both.

The first two verses of the song make abstract reference to the &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;motherland&quot;, without any religious connotation. However, later verses mention Hindu goddesses such as Durga.

Unlike the national anthem, there are no rules or decorum to be observed when reciting &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;.

Indian Muslims and Sikhs have opposed the singing of Vande Mataram since in Islam and Sikhism, the homeland cannot be considered as a goddess.

==Etymology==
The root of the Sanskrit word Vande is &quot;Vand&quot;, which appears in &quot;Rigveda&quot; and other Vedic texts. According to Monier Monier-Williams, depending on the context, &quot;vand&quot; means &quot;to praise, celebrate, laud, extol, to show honour, do homage, salute respectfully&quot;, or &quot;deferentially, venerate, worship, adore&quot;, or &quot;to offer anything respectfully to&quot;. The word &quot;Mātaram&quot; has Indo-European roots in &quot;mātár-&quot; (Sanskrit), &quot;méter&quot; (Greek), &quot;mâter&quot; (Latin) which mean &quot;mother&quot;.

==Lyrics of the song==
The first two verses of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; adopted as the &quot;National Song&quot; read as follows:

===Lyrics===
The complete original lyrics of the &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; are available at 

==Translation==

The first translation of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay&#x27;s novel &quot;Anandamath&quot;, including the poem &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, into English was by Nares Chandra Sen-Gupta, with the fifth edition published in 1906 titled &quot;The Abbey of Bliss&quot;.

Here is the translation in prose of the above two stanzas rendered by Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. This has also been adopted by the Government of India&#x27;s national portal. The original &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; consists of six stanzas and the translation in prose for the complete poem by Shri Aurobindo appeared in &quot;Karmayogin&quot;, 20 November 1909.

&lt;poem&gt;
Mother, I bow to thee!
Rich with thy hurrying streams,
Bright with thy orchard gleams,
Cool with the winds of delight,
Dark fields waving, Mother of might,
Mother free.

Glory of moonlight dreams,
Over thy branches and lordly streams,
Clad in thy blossoming trees,
Mother, giver of ease,
Laughing low and sweet,
Mother, I kiss thy feet,
Speaker sweet and low,
Mother, to thee I bow. [Verse 1]

Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,
When the swords flash out in seventy million hands,
And seventy million voices roar
Thy dreadful name from shore to shore?
With many strengths who art mighty and strong,
To thee I call, Mother and Lord!
Thou who savest, arise and save!
To her I cry who ever her foemen drove
Back from plain and Sea
And shook herself free. [Verse 2]

Thou art wisdom, thou art law,
Thou art heart, our soul, our breath
Thou art love divine, the awe
In our hearts that conquers death.
Thine the strength that nerves the arm,
Thine the beauty, thine the charm.
Every image divine.
In our temples is but thine. [Verse 3]

Thou art Goddess Durga, Lady and Queen,
With her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,
Thou art Goddess Kamala (Lakshmi), lotus-throned,
And Goddess Vani (Saraswati), bestower of wisdom known
Pure and perfect without peer,
Mother lend thine ear,
Rich with thy hurrying streams,
Bright with thy orchard gleams,
Dark of hue O candid-fair [Verse 4]

In thy soul, with jewelled hair
And thy glorious smile divine,
Loveliest of all earthly lands,
Showering wealth from well-stored hands!
Mother, mother mine!
Mother sweet, I bow to thee,
Mother great and free! [Verse 5]
&lt;/poem&gt;


Apart from the above prose translation, Sri Aurobindo also translated &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; into a verse form known as &quot;Mother, I praise thee!&quot;. Sri Aurobindo commented on his English translation of the poem that &quot;It is difficult to translate the National Song of India into verse in another language owing to its unique union of sweetness, simple directness and high poetic force.&quot;

===Translation into other languages===
Vande Mataram has inspired many Indian poets and has been translated into numerous Indian languages, such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, Assamese, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu and others.

Arif Mohammad Khan translated Vande Mataram into Urdu. It can be read in Urdu (Devanagari script) as:
==History and significance==

===Composition===
Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was one of the earliest graduates of the newly established Calcutta University. After his BA, he joined the colonial government as a civil servant, becoming a Deputy Collector and later a Deputy Magistrate. Chattopadhyay was very interested in recent events in Indian and Bengali history, particularly the Revolt of 1857 and the previous century&#x27;s Sanyasi Rebellion. Around the same time, the administration was trying to promote &quot;God Save the King&quot; as the anthem for Indian subjects, which Indian nationalists disliked. It is generally believed that the concept of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; came to Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay when he was still a government official, around 1876. He wrote &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; at Chinsura (Chuchura), in a white colour house of Adhya Family near Hooghly river (near Jora Ghat) in West Bengal.

Chattopadhyay wrote the poem in a spontaneous session using words from Sanskrit and Bengali. The poem was published in Chattopadhyay&#x27;s book &quot;Anandamath&quot; (pronounced &quot;Anondomôţh&quot; in Bengali) in 1882, which is set in the events of the Sannyasi Rebellion. Jadunath Bhattacharya was asked to set a tune for this poem just after it was written.

===Indian independence movement===

&quot;&quot;Vande Mataram&quot; was one of the most popular songs of protest during the Indian independence movement. The colonial government in response banned the book and made the recital of the song in public a crime. The colonial government imprisoned many independence activists for disobeying the order, but workers and general public repeatedly violated the ban many times by gathering together in the presence of colonial officials and singing it. Rabindranath Tagore sang &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; in 1896 at the Calcutta Congress Session held at Beadon Square. Dakhina Charan Sen sang it five years later in 1901 at another session of the Congress at Calcutta. Poet Sarala Devi Chaudurani sang the song in the Benares Congress Session in 1905. Lala Lajpat Rai started a journal called &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; from Lahore. Hiralal Sen made India&#x27;s first political film in 1905 which ended with the chant. Matangini Hazra&#x27;s last words as she was shot to death by the Crown police were &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;.
In 1907, Bhikaiji Cama (1861–1936) created the first version of India&#x27;s national flag (the Tiranga) in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1907. It had &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; written on it in the middle band.

A book titled &quot;Kranti Geetanjali&quot; published by Arya Printing Press (Lahore) and Bharatiya Press (Dehradun) in 1929 contains first two stanzas of this lyric on page 11 as &quot;Matra Vandana&quot; and a ghazal (Vande Mataram) composed by Bismil was also given on its back, i.e. page 12. The book written by the famous martyr of Kakori Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil was proscribed by the colonial government.

Mahatama Gandhi supported adoption and the singing of the Vande Mataram song. In January 1946, in a speech in Guwahati (Assam), he urged that &quot;Jai Hind should not replace Vande-mataram&quot;. He reminded everyone present that Vande-mataram was being sung since the inception of the Congress. He supported the &quot;Jai Hind&quot; greeting, but remanded that this greeting should not be to the exclusion of Vande Mataram. Gandhi was concerned that those who discarded Vande Mataram given the tradition of sacrifice behind it, one day would discard &quot;Jai Hind&quot; also.

===Debate on adoption as national song of India===
Parts of the Vande Mataram was chosen as the national song in 1937 by the Indian National Congress as it pursued the independence of India from colonial rule, after a committee consisting of Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Acharya Deva, and Rabindranath Tagore recommended the adoption. The entire song was not selected by Hindu leaders in order to respect the sentiments of non-Hindus, and the gathering agreed that anyone should be free to sing an alternate &quot;unobjectionable song&quot; at a national gathering if they do not want to sing Vande Mataram because they find it &quot;objectionable&quot; for a personal reason. According to the gathered leaders, including the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, though the first two stanzas began with an unexceptionable evocation of the beauty of the motherland, in later stanzas there are references to the Hindu goddess Durga. The All-India Muslim League and Muhammad Ali Jinnah opposed the song. Thereafter, with the support of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian National Congress decided to adopt only the first two stanzas as the national song to be sung at public gatherings, and other verses that included references to Durga and Lakshmi were expunged.

Rajendra Prasad, who was presiding the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950, made the following statement which was also adopted as the final decision on the issue:

...The composition consisting of the words and music known as Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it. (Applause). I hope this will satisfy the Members.
:—&quot;Constituent Assembly of India&quot;, Vol. XII, 24-1-1950

==Performances and interpretations==
The poem has been set to a large number of tunes. The oldest surviving audio recordings date to 1907, and there have been more than a hundred different versions recorded throughout the 20th century. Many of these versions have employed traditional Indian classical ragas. Versions of the song have been visualised on celluloid in a number of films, including &quot;Leader&quot;, &quot;Amar Asha&quot;, and &quot;Anand Math&quot;. It is widely believed that the tune set for All India Radio station version was composed by Ravi Shankar. Hemant Kumar composed music for the song in the movie Anand Math in 1952. Many singers like Lata Mangeshkar, K.S.Chithra sung made it cult classic. In 2002, BBC World Service conducted an international poll to choose ten most famous songs of all time. Around 7000 songs were selected from all over the world. &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, from the movie &quot;Anand Math&quot;, was ranked second. All India Radio&#x27;s version and some other versions are in Desh raga.

In July 2017, the Madras High Court ruled that the Vande Mataram shall be sung or played at least once a week in all schools, universities and other educational institutions of Tamil Nadu. The Court also ruled that the song should be played or sung in government offices and industrial facilities at least once a month.
