<text>The French Revolutionary Wars () were a series of sweeping military conflicts resulting from the French Revolution that lasted from 1792 until 1802. They pitted France against Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and several other countries. The wars are divided into two periods: the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802). Initially confined to Europe, the fighting gradually assumed a global dimension. After a decade of constant warfare and aggressive diplomacy, France had conquered territories in the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries, and the Rhineland due to its very large and powerful military, which had been totally mobilized for war against most of Europe with mass conscription of the vast French population. French success in these conflicts ensured military occupation and the spread of revolutionary principles over much of Europe.

As early as 1791, the other monarchies of Europe looked with outrage at the revolution and its upheavals; and they considered whether they should intervene, either in support of King Louis XVI, to prevent the spread of revolution, or to take advantage of the chaos in France. Austria stationed significant troops on its French border and together with Prussia, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which threatened severe consequences should anything happen to King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. After Austria refused to recall its troops from the French border and to back down on the perceived threat of using force, France declared war on Austria and Prussia in the spring of 1792; both countries responded with a coordinated invasion that was eventually turned back at the Battle of Valmy in September. This victory emboldened the National Convention to abolish the monarchy. A series of victories by the new French armies abruptly ended with defeat at Neerwinden in the spring of 1793. The French suffered additional defeats in the remainder of the year and these difficult times allowed the Jacobins to rise to power and impose the Reign of Terror to unify the nation.

In 1794, the situation improved dramatically for the French as huge victories at Fleurus against the Austrians and Dutch and at the Black Mountain against the Spanish signaled the start of a new stage in the wars. By 1795, the French had captured the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic. The French also put Spain and Prussia out of the war with the Peace of Basel. A hitherto unknown general named Napoleon Bonaparte began his first campaign in Italy in April 1796. In less than a year, French armies under Napoleon destroyed the Habsburg forces and evicted them from the Italian peninsula, winning almost every battle and capturing 150,000 prisoners. With French forces marching toward Vienna, the Austrians sued for peace and agreed to the Treaty of Campo Formio, ending the First Coalition against the Republic.

The War of the Second Coalition began in 1798 with the French invasion of Egypt, headed by Napoleon. The Allies took the opportunity presented by the French effort in the Middle East to regain territories lost from the First Coalition. The war began well for the Allies in Europe, where they gradually pushed the French out of Italy and invaded Switzerland – racking up victories at the battles of Magnano, Cassano, and Novi along the way. However, their efforts largely unraveled with the French victory at Zurich in September 1799, which caused Russia to drop out of the war. Meanwhile, Napoleon&#x27;s forces won a series of Egyptian and Ottoman armies at the battles of the Pyramids, Mount Tabor, and Abukir, but lost a crucial Siege of Acre 1799 that turned the tide of the campaign. The perceived victories in Egypt further enhanced Napoleon&#x27;s popularity back in France, and he returned to France in the autumn of 1799, but leaving the French army in a desperate situation in Egypt as the Egyptian campaign ultimately ended in failure. Furthermore, the Royal Navy had won the Battle of the Nile in 1798, further strengthening British control of the Mediterranean and weakening the French Navy for the rest of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Napoleon&#x27;s arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. This brought a decisive French victory at the Battle of Marengo in June 1800, after which the Austrians withdrew from the peninsula once again. Another crushing French victory at Hohenlinden in Bavaria forced the Austrians to seek peace for a second time, leading to the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801. With Austria and Russia out of the war, Britain found itself increasingly isolated and agreed to the Treaty of Amiens with Napoleon&#x27;s government in 1802, concluding the Revolutionary Wars. However, the lingering tensions proved too difficult to contain, and the Napoleonic Wars began over a year later with the formation of the Third Coalition, continuing the series of Coalition Wars.

==Geopolitical context==
When the French Revolution started at the end of the 18th century the European continent had five great powers, these being Great Britain, France, Austria, Russia, and Prussia. Weak European states included Sweden, Spain, Poland, Holland, and the Ottoman Empire. Western Germany was divided into hundreds of tiny principalities, cities, and minor states, some of which were independents while others were effectively controlled by Austria. The great powers had agrarian industries, except for Great Britain which was wealthy because of trade.

==War of the First Coalition==

===1791–1792===
The key figure in initial foreign reaction to the French Revolution was Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother of Queen Marie Antoinette of France. Leopold had initially looked on the Revolution with equanimity, but became more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with emigrant French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of King Louis XVI of France and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a non-committal gesture to placate the sentiments of French monarchists and nobles, it was seen in France as a serious threat and was denounced by the revolutionary leaders.

France eventually issued an ultimatum demanding that Leopold renounce any hostile alliances and withdraw his troops from the French border. The reply was evasive, and the French Assembly voted for war on 20 April 1792 against Francis II, the successor of Leopold II, after a long list of grievances presented by foreign minister Charles François Dumouriez. Dumouriez prepared an immediate invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, where he expected the local population to rise against Austrian rule as they had earlier in 1790. However, the revolution had thoroughly disorganized the army, and the forces raised were insufficient for the invasion. Following the declaration of war, French soldiers deserted &quot;en masse&quot; and in one case murdered their general, Théobald Dillon.

While the revolutionary government frantically raised fresh troops and reorganized its armies, a mostly Prussian Allied army under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick assembled at Koblenz on the Rhine. The duke then issued a proclamation called the Brunswick Manifesto (July 1792), written by the French king&#x27;s cousin, Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, the leader of an émigré corps within the Allied army, which declared the Allies&#x27; intent to restore the king to his full powers and to treat any person or town who opposed them as rebels to be condemned to death by martial law. This, however, had the effect of strengthening the resolve of the revolutionary army and government to oppose them by any means necessary.

On 10 August, a crowd stormed the Tuileries Palace, seizing the king and his family. The Commune of Paris later assumed the powers of the municipality. On 19 August 1792, the invasion by Brunswick&#x27;s army commenced, with Brunswick&#x27;s army easily taking the fortresses of Longwy and Verdun. The invasion continued, but at Valmy on 20 September, the invaders came to a stalemate against Dumouriez and Kellermann in which the highly professional French artillery distinguished itself. Although the battle was a tactical draw, it gave a great boost to French morale. Further, the Prussians, finding that the campaign had been longer and more costly than predicted, decided that the cost and risk of continued fighting was too great and, with winter approaching, they decided to retreat from France to preserve their army. The next day, the monarchy was formally abolished as the First Republic was declared (21 September 1792).

Meanwhile, the French had been successful on several other fronts, occupying Savoy and Nice, which were parts of the Savoyard state, while General Custine invaded Germany, occupying several German towns along the Rhine and reaching as far as Frankfurt. Dumouriez went on the offensive in the Austrian Netherlands once again, winning a great victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November and occupying the entire country by the beginning of winter.

===1793===

Spain and Portugal entered the anti-French coalition in January 1793. Britain began military preparations in late 1792 and declared that war was inevitable unless France gave up its conquests, notwithstanding French assurances they would not attack Holland or annex the Low Countries. Britain expelled the French ambassador following the execution of Louis XVI and on 1 February, France responded by declaring war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic.

France drafted hundreds of thousands of men, beginning a policy of using mass conscription to deploy more of its manpower than the autocratic states could manage to do (first stage, with a decree of 24 February 1793 ordering the draft of 300,000 men, followed by the general mobilization of all the young men able to be drafted, through the famous decree of 23 August 1793). Nonetheless, the Coalition allies launched a determined drive to invade France during the Flanders Campaign.

France suffered severe reverses at first. They were driven out of the Austrian Netherlands, and serious revolts flared in the west and south of France. One of these, at Toulon, was the first serious taste of action for an unknown young artillery officer Napoleon Bonaparte. He contributed to the siege of the city and its harbour by planning an effective assault with well-placed artillery batteries raining projectiles down on rebel positions. This performance helped make his reputation as a capable tactician, and it fueled his meteoric rise to military and political power.

By the end of the year, large new armies had turned back foreign invaders, and the Reign of Terror, a fierce policy of repression, had suppressed internal revolts. The French military was in the ascendant. Lazare Carnot, a scientist and prominent member of the Committee of Public Safety, organized the fourteen armies of the Republic, and was then nicknamed the Organizer of the Victory.

===1794===


The year 1794 brought increased success to the French armies. On the Alpine frontier, there was little change, with the French invasion of Piedmont failing. On the Spanish border, the French under General Dugommier rallied from their defensive positions at Bayonne and Perpignan, driving the Spanish out of Roussillon and invading Catalonia. Dugommier was killed in the Battle of the Black Mountain in November.

On the northern front in the Flanders Campaign, the Austrians and French both prepared offensives in Belgium, with the Austrians besieging Landrecies and advancing towards Mons and Maubeuge. The French prepared an offensive on multiple fronts, with two armies in Flanders under Pichegru and Moreau, and Jourdan attacking from the German border. The French withstood several damaging but inconclusive actions before regaining the initiative at the battles of Tourcoing and Fleurus in June. The French armies drove the Austrians, British, and Dutch beyond the Rhine, occupying Belgium, the Rhineland, and the south of the Netherlands.

On the middle Rhine front in July, General Michaud&#x27;s Army of the Rhine attempted two offensives in July in the Vosges, the second of which was successful but not followed up, allowing for a Prussian counter-attack in September. Otherwise this sector of the front was largely quiet over the course of the year.

At sea, the French Atlantic Fleet succeeded in holding off a British attempt to interdict a vital cereal convoy from the United States on the Glorious First of June, though at the cost of one quarter of its strength. In the Caribbean, the British fleet landed in Martinique in February, taking the whole island by 24 March and holding it until the Treaty of Amiens, and in Guadeloupe in April, where they captured the island briefly but were driven out by Victor Hugues later in the year. In the Mediterranean, following the British evacuation of Toulon, the Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli agreed with admiral Samuel Hood to place Corsica under British protection in return for assistance capturing French garrisons at Saint-Florent, Bastia, and Calvi, creating the short-lived Anglo-Corsican Kingdom.

By the end of the year French armies had won victories on all fronts, and as the year closed they began advancing into the Netherlands.

===1795===

The year opened with French forces in the process of attacking the Dutch Republic in the middle of winter. The Dutch people rallied to the French call and started the Batavian Revolution. City after city was occupied by the French. The Dutch fleet was captured, and the stadtholder William V fled to be replaced by a popular Batavian Republic, a sister republic which supported the revolutionary cause and signed a treaty with the French, ceding the territories of North Brabant and Maastricht to France on 16 May.

With the Netherlands falling, Prussia also decided to leave the coalition, signing the Peace of Basel on 6 April, ceding the west bank of the Rhine to France. This freed Prussia to finish the Third Partition of Poland.

The French army in Spain advanced in Catalonia while taking Bilbao and Vitoria and marching toward Castile. By 10 July, Spain also decided to make peace, recognizing the revolutionary government and ceding the territory of Santo Domingo, but returning to the pre-war borders in Europe. This left the armies on the Pyrenees free to march east and reinforce the armies on the Alps, and the combined army overran Piedmont.

Meanwhile, in Africa and Asia, the Dutch Cape Colony and Ceylon were invaded by the British.

Meanwhile, Britain&#x27;s attempt to reinforce the rebels in the Vendée by landing troops at Quiberon failed, and a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government from within ended when Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s garrison used cannon to fire grapeshot into the attacking mob (which led to the establishment of the Directory).

On the Rhine frontier, General Pichegru, negotiating with the exiled Royalists, betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of Mannheim and the failure of the siege of Mainz by Jourdan. This was a moderate setback to the position of the French.

In northern Italy, victory at the Battle of Loano in November gave France access to the Italian peninsula.

===1796===

The French prepared a great advance on three fronts, with Jourdan and Moreau on the Rhine, and Bonaparte in Italy. The three armies were to link up in Tyrol and march on Vienna. Jourdan and Moreau advanced rapidly into Germany, and Moreau had reached Bavaria and the edge of Tyrol by September, but Jourdan was defeated by Archduke Charles at Amberg, and both armies were forced to retreat back across the Rhine.

Napoleon, on the other hand, was completely successful in a daring invasion of Italy. He left Paris on 11 March for Nice to take over the weak and poorly supplied Army of Italy, arriving on 26 March. The army was already being reorganised and supplied when he arrived, and he found that the situation was rapidly improving. He was soon able to carry out the plan for the invasion of Italy that he had been advocating for years, which provided for an advance over the Apennines near Altare to attack the enemy position of Ceva.

The Montenotte Campaign opened after Johann Beaulieu&#x27;s Austrian forces attacked the extreme French eastern flank near Genoa on 10 April. Bonaparte countered by attacking and crushing the isolated right wing of the allied armies at the Battle of Montenotte on 12 April. The next day he defeated an Austro-Sardinian force at the Battle of Millesimo. He then won a victory at the Second Battle of Dego, driving the Austrians northeast, away from their Piedmontese allies. Satisfied that the Austrians were temporarily inert, Bonaparte harried Michelangelo Colli&#x27;s Piedmontese at Ceva and San Michele Mondovi before whipping them at the Battle of Mondovì. A week later, on 28 April, the Piedmontese signed the Armistice of Cherasco, withdrawing from the hostilities. On 18 May they signed the Treaty of Paris (1796), ceding Savoy and Nice and allowing the French bases to be used against Austria.

After a short pause, Napoleon carried out a brilliant flanking manoeuvre, and crossed the Po at Piacenza, nearly cutting the Austrian line of retreat. The Austrians escaped after the Battle of Fombio, but had their rear-guard mauled at Lodi on 10 May, after which the French took Milan. Bonaparte then advanced eastwards again, drove off the Austrians in the Battle of Borghetto and in June began the Siege of Mantua. Mantua was the strongest Austrian base in Italy. Meanwhile, the Austrians retreated north into the foothills of the Tyrol.

During July and August, Austria sent a fresh army into Italy under Dagobert Wurmser. Wurmser attacked toward Mantua along the east side of Lake Garda, sending Peter Quasdanovich down the west side in an effort to envelop Bonaparte. Bonaparte exploited the Austrian mistake of dividing their forces to defeat them in detail, but in so doing, he abandoned the siege of Mantua, which held out for another six months (Carl von Clausewitz mentioned in On War that the siege might have been able to be kept up if Bonaparte had circumvallated the city). Quasdanovich was overcome at Lonato on 3 August and Wurmser at Castiglione on 5 August. Wurmser retreated to the Tyrol, and Bonaparte resumed the siege.

In September, Bonaparte marched north against Trento in Tyrol, but Wurmser had already marched toward Mantua by the Brenta valley, leaving Paul Davidovich&#x27;s force to hold off the French. Bonaparte overran the holding force at the Battle of Rovereto. Then he followed Wurmser down the Brenta valley, to fall upon and defeat the Austrians at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Wurmser elected to march for Mantua with a large portion of his surviving troops. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte&#x27;s attempts to intercept them but were driven into the city after a pitched battle on 15 September. This left nearly 30,000 Austrians trapped in the fortress. This number rapidly diminished due to disease, combat losses, and hunger.

The Austrians sent yet another army under József Alvinczi against Bonaparte in November. Again the Austrians divided their effort, sending Davidovich&#x27;s corps from the north while Alvinczi&#x27;s main body attacked from the east. At first they proved victorious over the French at Bassano, Calliano, and Caldiero. But Bonaparte ultimately defeated Alvinczi in the Battle of Arcole southeast of Verona. The French then turned on Davidovich in great strength and chased him into the Tyrol. Wurmser&#x27;s only sortie was late and ineffectual.

The rebellion in the Vendée was also finally crushed in 1796 by Hoche, but Hoche&#x27;s attempt to land a large invasion force in Ireland was unsuccessful.

===1797===

On 14 February, British admiral Jervis met and defeated a Spanish fleet off Portugal at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. This prevented the Spanish fleet from rendezvousing with the French, removing a threat of invasion to Britain. However, the British fleet was weakened over the rest of the year by the Spithead and Nore mutinies, which kept many ships in port through the summer.

On 22 February French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the &quot;La Legion Noire&quot; (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate landed near Fishguard (Wales). They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor&#x27;s forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February.

In Italy, Napoleon&#x27;s armies were laying siege to Mantua at the beginning of the year, and a second attempt by Austrians under Joseph Alvinczy to raise the siege was driven off at the Battle of Rivoli, where the French scored a decisive victory. Finally, on 2 February, Wurmser surrendered Mantua and 18,000 troops. The Papal forces sued for peace, which was granted at Tolentino on 19 February. Napoleon was now free to attack the Austrian heartland. He advanced directly toward Austria over the Julian Alps, sending Barthélemy Joubert to invade the Tyrol.

Archduke Charles of Austria hurried from the German front to defend Austria, but he was defeated at the Battle of Tagliamento on 16 March, and Napoleon proceeded into Austria, occupying Klagenfurt and preparing for a rendezvous with Joubert in front of Vienna. In Germany, the armies of Hoche and Moreau crossed the Rhine again in April after the previous year&#x27;s failure. The victories of Napoleon had frightened the Austrians into making peace, and they concluded the Peace of Leoben in April, ending hostilities. However, his absence from Italy had allowed the outbreak of the revolt known as the Veronese Easters on 17 April, which was put down eight days later.

Although Britain remained at war with France, this effectively ended the First Coalition. Austria later signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, ceding the Austrian Netherlands to France and recognizing the French border at the Rhine. Austria and France also partitioned the Republic of Venice between them.

===1798===


With only Britain left to fight and not enough of a navy to fight a direct war, Napoleon conceived of an invasion of Egypt in 1798, which satisfied his personal desire for glory and the Directory&#x27;s desire to have him far from Paris. The military objective of the expedition is not entirely clear, but may have been to threaten British dominance in India.

Napoleon sailed from Toulon to Alexandria, taking Malta on the way, and landing in June. Marching to Cairo, he won a great victory at the Battle of the Pyramids; however, his fleet was sunk by Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, stranding him in Egypt. Napoleon spent the remainder of the year consolidating his position in Egypt.

The French government also took advantage of internal strife in Switzerland to invade, establishing the Helvetic Republic and annexing Geneva. French troops also deposed Pope Pius VI, establishing a republic in Rome.

An expeditionary force was sent to County Mayo, in Ireland, when it was part of the Republic of Connacht, to assist in the rebellion against Britain in the summer of 1798. It had some success against British forces, most notably at Castlebar, but was ultimately routed while trying to reach Dublin. French ships sent to assist them were captured by the Royal Navy off County Donegal.

The French were also under pressure in the Southern Netherlands and Luxembourg where the local people revolted against conscription and anti-religious violence (Peasants&#x27; War). The French had occupied this territory in 1794, but it was officially theirs from 1797 due to a treaty with Austria. The French forces easily handled the Peasants&#x27; rebellion in the Southern Netherlands, and were able to put down the revolting forces in under 2 months.

The French in 1798 fought an undeclared war at sea against the United States, that was known variously as the &quot;Quasi-War&quot;, the &quot;Half War&quot; and the &quot;Pirate Wars&quot;. It was resolved peaceably with the Convention of 1800.

==War of the Second Coalition==

Britain and Austria organized a new coalition against France in 1798, including for the first time the Russian Empire, although no action occurred until 1799 except against the Kingdom of Naples.

===1799===

In Egypt, Napoleon had consolidated his control of the country for the time being. Soon after the beginning of the year, he mounted an invasion of Ottoman Syria, capturing El Arish and Jaffa. On 17 March, he laid siege to Acre, and defeated an Ottoman effort to relieve the city at the Battle of Mount Tabor on 17 April. However, his repeated assaults on Acre were driven back by Ottoman and British forces under the command of Jezzar Pasha and Sir Sidney Smith. By May, with plague rampant in his army and no sign of success against the city, Napoleon was forced to retreat into Egypt. In July, Turkey, with the help of the British navy, mounted an invasion by sea from Rhodes. Napoleon attacked the Turkish beachheads and scored a crushing victory at the Battle of Abukir, capturing or killing the entire enemy army. In August, Napoleon decided to return to Europe, hearing of the political and military crisis in France. Leaving his army behind with Kléber in command, he sailed through the British blockade to return to Paris and resolved to take control of the government there in a coup.

In Europe, the French Army of Observation, organized with 30,000 men in four divisions, crossed the Rhine at Kehl and Basel in March 1799. The following day, it was renamed the Army of the Danube. Under command of Jourdan, the army advanced in four columns through the Black Forest. First Division, the right wing, assembled at Hüningen, crossed at Basel and advanced eastward along the north shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. André Masséna, commanding the Army of Switzerland, sent a Demi-brigade to secure the Swiss town of Schaffhausen, on the north shore of the Rhine, which guaranteed communications between the two forces. The Advanced Guard crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme led it north-east through the mountains via Freudenstadt. This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, by the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.

The major part of the Imperial army, under command of the Archduke Charles, had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. This was less than distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.

In March 1799, the Army of the Danube engaged in two major battles, both in the southwestern German theater. At the intensely fought Battle of Ostrach, 21–2 March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, under the command of Archduke Charles, defeated Jourdan&#x27;s Army of the Danube. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions to the west at Meßkirch (Messkirch, Mößkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. At the second battle, in Stockach, on 27 March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he himself established a base at Hornberg. From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, Jean Augustin Ernouf, and traveled to Paris to ask for more and better troops and, ultimately, to request a medical leave.
The Army was reorganized, and a portion placed under the command of André Masséna and merged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the reorganization and change in command, the Army participated in several skirmishes and actions on the eastern part of the Swiss Plateau, including the Battle of Winterthur. After this action, three forces of the Imperial army united north of Zürich, completing a partial encirclement of Masséna&#x27;s combined Army of the Danube and Army of Switzerland. A few days later, at the First Battle of Zurich, Masséna was forced west, across the Limmat. In late summer, 1799, Charles was ordered to support imperial activities in the middle Rhineland; he withdrew north across the Rhine, and marched toward Mannheim, leaving Zürich and northern Switzerland in the hands of the inexperienced Alexander Korsakov and 25,000 Russian troops. Although the highly capable Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze remained in support, his 15,000 men were not able to counter Korsakov&#x27;s poor defensive arrangements. Three weeks later, at the Second Battle of Zurich, the Russian force was annihilated, and Hotze was killed south of Zürich. This left Masséna in control of northern Switzerland, and forced Alexander Suvorov into an arduous three-week march into the Vorarlberg, where his troops arrived, starving and exhausted, in mid-October.

Napoleon himself invaded Syria from Egypt, but after a failed siege of Acre retreated to Egypt, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount a coup that made him First Consul, the head of the French government.

===1800===
In Italy, the Austrians under General Michael von Melas attacked first, and by the third week in April had advanced to the Var, with Masséna and half his army in Genoa besieged by land, by the Austrians and under tight blockade by the Royal Navy. In response Berthier moved – not to the threatened frontier, but to Geneva – and Masséna was instructed to hold Genoa until 4 June. The Army of the Reserve was joined by Napoleon, and in mid-May set out to cross the Alps to attack the Austrian rear. The bulk of the army crossed by the Great St Bernard Pass, still under snow, and by 24 May 40,000 troops were in the valley of the Po. Artillery was man-hauled over with great effort and ingenuity; however an Austrian-held fort on the Italian side (although bypassed by infantry and cavalry) prevented most of the artillery reaching the plains of Northern Italy until the start of June.

Once over the Alps, Napoleon did not proceed directly to the relief of Genoa. Instead, he advanced on Milan, to improve his lines of communication (via the Simplon and St Gotthard passes) and to threaten Melas&#x27;s lines of communication with Mantua and Vienna, in the belief that this would cause Melas to raise the siege of Genoa. He entered Milan on 2 June and by crossing to the South bank of the Po completely cut Melas&#x27;s communications. Taking up a strong defensive position at Stradella, he confidently awaited an attempt by the Austrian army to fight its way out.

However, Melas had not raised the siege of Genoa, and on 4 June, Masséna had duly capitulated. Napoleon then faced the possibility that, thanks to the British command of the Mediterranean, far from falling back, the Austrians could instead take Genoa as their new base and be supplied by sea. His defensive posture would not prevent this; he had to find and attack the Austrians before they could regroup. He therefore advanced from Stradella towards Alessandria, where Melas was, apparently doing nothing. Convinced that Melas was about to retreat, Napoleon sent strong detachments to block Melas&#x27;s routes northwards to the Po, and southwards to Genoa. At this point, Melas attacked, and for all the brilliance of the previous campaign, Napoleon found himself at a significant disadvantage in the consequent Battle of Marengo (14 June). Napoleon and the French came under huge pressure in the early hours of the battle. Melas believed he had already won and turned over delivery of the final blow to a subordinate. Suddenly, the prompt return of a detached French force under Desaix and a vigorous French counter-attack converted the battle into a decisive French victory. The Austrians lost half of their army, but Desaix was one of the French victims.

Melas promptly entered into negotiations, which led to the Austrians evacuating Northern Italy west of the Ticino and suspending military operations in Italy. Napoleon returned to Paris after the victory, leaving Brune to consolidate in Italy and begin a march toward Austria.

In the German theater, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine at the beginning of 1800. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Electorate of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day&#x27;s march from French-held Switzerland.
General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau&#x27;s true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe&#x27;s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans. Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray&#x27;s army, Moreau&#x27;s army lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray&#x27;s army was still guarding the passes on the other side. On 3 May 1800 Moreau and Kray fought the Battles of Engen and Stockach. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat to Meßkirch, where they enjoyed a more favourable defensive position. However, it also meant that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off.

On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Meßkirch. At nearby Krumbach, where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Meßkirch. Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen, followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby Biberach an der Ris ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000-man-strong French &quot;Center&quot;, commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. After being flanked by General Moreau, who approached Ulm from the east and overwhelmed his outposts at Battle of Höchstädt, Kray retreated to Munich. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.

A several month armistice followed, during which Kray was replaced by the Archduke John, with the Austrian army retiring behind the River Inn. Austrian reluctance to accept negotiated terms caused the French to end the armistice in mid-November, effective in two weeks. When the armistice ended, John advanced over the Inn towards Munich. His army was defeated in small engagements at the battles of Ampfing and Neuburg an der Donau, and decisively in the forests before the city at Hohenlinden on 3 December. Moreau began a march on Vienna, and the Austrians soon sued for peace, ending the war on the continent.

===1801===

By 9 February, the Austrians had signed the Treaty of Lunéville, ending the war on the continent. The war against the United Kingdom continued (with Neapolitan harbours closed to her by the Treaty of Florence, signed on 28 March), and the Turks invaded Egypt in March, losing to Kléber at Heliopolis. The exhausted French force in Egypt, however, surrendered to the British in August.

The naval war also continued, with the United Kingdom maintaining a blockade of France by sea. Russia, Prussia, Denmark-Norway, and Sweden formed the Second League of Armed Neutrality to prevent their merchant ships from being searched by the Royal Navy. British Admiral Horatio Nelson defied orders and attacked the Danish fleet in harbour at the Battle of Copenhagen, destroying much of it. An armistice prevented him from continuing into the Baltic Sea to attack the Russian fleet at Reval (Tallinn). Meanwhile, off Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois repulsed a British attack under Saumarez in the First Battle of Algeciras, destroying . In the Second Battle of Algeciras, four days later, the British captured a French ship of the line and two Spanish ships of the line accidentally blew each other up, killing around 2,000 French and Spanish sailors for the loss of 12 Britons.

===1802===
In 1802, the British and French signed the Treaty of Amiens, ending the war. The peace held for less than a year but still constituted the longest period of peace between the two countries during the period 1793–1815. The treaty is generally considered to be the most appropriate point to mark the transition between the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, although Napoleon was not crowned emperor until 1804.

==Influence==
The French Revolution transformed nearly all aspects of French and European life. The powerful sociopolitical forces unleashed by a people seeking liberté, égalité, and fraternité made certain that even warfare was not spared this upheaval. Eighteenth-century armies – with their rigid protocols, static operational strategy, unenthusiastic soldiers, and aristocratic officer classes – underwent massive remodeling as the French monarchy and nobility gave way to liberal assemblies obsessed with external threats. The fundamental shifts in warfare that occurred during the period have prompted scholars to identify the era as the beginning of &quot;modern war&quot;.

In 1791 the Legislative Assembly passed the &quot;Drill-Book&quot; legislation, implementing a series of infantry doctrines created by French theorists because of their defeat by the Prussians in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The new developments hoped to exploit the intrinsic bravery of the French soldier, made even more powerful by the explosive nationalist forces of the Revolution. The changes also placed a faith on the ordinary soldier that would be completely unacceptable in earlier times; French troops were expected to harass the enemy and remain loyal enough to not desert, a benefit other Ancien Régime armies did not have.

Following the declaration of war in 1792, an imposing array of enemies converging on French borders prompted the government in Paris to adopt radical measures. The day 23 August 1793 would become a historic one in military history; on that date the National Convention called a levée en masse, or mass conscription, for the first time in human history. By summer of the following year, conscription made some 500,000 men available for service and the French began to deal blows to their European enemies.

Armies during the Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and combined with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, the west bank of the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the Valois and Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France&#x27;s old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.

In addition to opening a flood of tactical and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also laid the foundation for modern military theory. Later authors who wrote about &quot;nations in arms&quot; drew inspiration from the French Revolution, in which dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war and incorporated nationalism into the fabric of military history. Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. Clausewitz correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way that people think. War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.

<text>Blight is a specific symptom affecting plants in response to infection by a pathogenic organism.

==Description==
Blight is a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs. Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights. Several notable examples are:
* Late blight of potato, caused by the water mold &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; (Mont.) de Bary, the disease which led to the Great Irish Famine
* Southern corn leaf blight, caused by the fungus &quot;Cochliobolus heterostrophus&quot; (Drechs.) Drechs, anamorph &quot;Bipolaris maydis&quot; (Nisikado &amp; Miyake) Shoemaker, incited a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970.
* Chestnut blight, caused by the fungus &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot; (Murrill) Barr, has nearly completely eradicated mature American chestnuts in North America.
* Citrus blight, caused by an unknown agent, infects all citrus scions.
* Fire blight of pome fruits, caused by the bacterium &quot;Erwinia amylovora&quot; (Burrill) Winslow et al., is the most severe disease of pear and also is found in apple and raspberry, among others.
* Bacterial leaf blight of rice, caused by the bacterium &quot;Xanthomonas oryzae&quot; (Uyeda &amp; Ishiyama) Dowson.
* Bacterial seedling blight of rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;), caused by pathogen &quot;Burkholderia plantarii&quot;
* Early blight of potato and tomato, caused by species of the ubiquitous fungal genus &quot;Alternaria&quot;
* Leaf blight of the grasses e.g. &quot;Ascochyta&quot; species and &quot;Alternaria triticina&quot; that causes blight in wheat
* Bur oak blight, caused by the fungal pathogen &quot;Tubakia iowensis&quot;.
* South American leaf blight, caused by the ascomycete &quot;Pseudocercospora ulei&quot;, also called &quot;Microcyclus ulei&quot;, ended the cultivation of the rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) in South America.

On leaf tissue, symptoms of blight are the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue. However, leaf spots may, in advanced stages, expand to kill entire areas of leaf tissue and thus exhibit blight symptoms.

Blights are often named after their causative agent. For example, &quot;Colletotrichum&quot; blight is named after the fungus &quot;Colletotrichum capsici&quot;, and &quot;Phytophthora&quot; blight is named after the water mold &quot;Phytophthora parasitica&quot;.

When blights have been particularly vast and consequential in their effects, they have become named historical events, such as the 19th Century Potato Blight, also known locally from its primary consequence as the &quot;Great famine&quot;, the Great Famine of Ireland, and Highland Potato Famine, and the near extinction of the Bermuda cedar during the 1940s and 1950s in the event described as &quot;The Blight&quot; or &quot;The Cedar Blight&quot;.

<text>Listening is the act of paying attention to sounds. It includes listening to the sounds of nature, listening to music, and perhaps most importantly, interpersonal listening, i.e. listening to other human beings. When listening to another person, one hears what they are saying and tries to understand what it means.

Interpersonal listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback.

Interpersonal listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor interpersonal listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind.

Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later.

Listening can also function rhetorically as a means of promoting Cross-cultural communication. Krista Ratcliffe (author of &quot;Rhetorical Listening and Cross - Cultural Communication&quot;) 

== What is interpersonal listening? ==
Interpersonal listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. Semiotician Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. &quot;Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.&quot; People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear.

Listening differs from obeying. A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or not to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted.

=== How does one listen? ===
Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion.

People listen for 45 percent of their time when they communicate.

According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener.

;Alerting: The first level involves detection of environmental sound cues. Certain places have certain sounds associated with them. For example, a home has certain sounds associated with it that makes it familiar and comfortable to the occupant. An intrusion—a sound that is not familiar (e.g., a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window)—alerts whoever lives there to potential danger.

;Deciphering: The second level involves detecting patterns when interpreting sounds; for example, a child waiting for the sound of his mother&#x27;s return home. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g., jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that signal his mother&#x27;s approach.

;Understanding: The third level means knowing how what one says will affect another. This sort of listening is important in psychoanalysis, the study of the unconscious mind. According to Barthes, the psychoanalyst must suspend judgment while listening to the patient in order to communicate with the latter&#x27;s unconscious without bias. In the same way, lay listeners must suspend judgment when listening to others.

All three levels of listening , and sometimes all at once. The second and third levels overlap and intertwine, in that obtaining, understanding, and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In this way anyone, on hearing a doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning).

=== Active listening ===
&quot;Active listening&quot; involves listening to what is being said and attempting to understand it. It can be described in many ways. Active listening requires that the listener be attentive, nonjudgmental, and non-interrupting. An active listener analyzes what the speaker is saying for its implicature or subtext as well as for meanings contained explicitly in the verbal communication. An active listener looks for nonverbal messages from the speaker in order to comprehend the full meaning of what is being said. Active listening has many benefits. It is more effective listening. It also strengthens one&#x27;s leadership skills.

Active listening is an exchange between two or more individuals. If they are active listeners, the quality of the conversation will be better and clearer. Active listeners connect with each other more efficiently in their conversations. Active listening can create a deeper, more positive relationship between individuals.

Active listening changes the speaker&#x27;s perspective. Active listening is a catalyst in one&#x27;s personal growth, which enhances personality change and group development. People will more likely listen to themselves if someone else is allowing them to speak and get their message across.

Active listening allows people to be present in a conversation. &quot;Listening is a key factor in cultivating relationships because the more we understand the other person, the more connection we create, as taught in nonviolent-communication Dharma teachings. As someone recently stated, &#x27;We should listen harder than we speak.&#x27;&quot;

=== Listening in language learning ===
Along with speaking, reading, and writing, listening is one of the &quot;four skills&quot; of language learning. All language-teaching approaches, except for grammar translation, incorporate a listening component. Some teaching methods, such as total physical response, involve students simply listening and responding.

In &quot;intensive listening&quot; learners attempt to listen with maximum accuracy to a relatively brief sequence of speech; in &quot;extensive listening&quot; learners listen to lengthy passages for general comprehension. While intensive listening may be more effective for developing specific aspects of listening ability, extensive listening is more effective in building fluency and maintaining learner motivation.

People are usually not conscious of how they listen in their first, or native, language unless they encounter difficulty. A research project focused on facilitating language learning found that L2 (second language) learners, in the process of listening, make conscious use of whatever strategies they unconsciously use in their first language, such as inferring, selective attention, or evaluation.

Factors activated in speech perception include phonetic quality, prosodic patterns, pausing, and speed of input. These all influence the comprehensibility of listening input. A common store of semantic information in memory is used in both first- and second-language speech comprehension, but research has found separate stores of phonological information for speech. Semantic knowledge required for language understanding (scripts and schemata related to real-world people, places, and actions) is accessed through phonological tagging of whatever language is heard.

In a study, involving 93 participants, investigating the relationship between second-language listening and a range of tasks, it was discovered that listening anxiety was a major obstacle to developing speed and explicitness in second-language listening tasks. Additional research explored whether listening anxiety and comprehension are related, and as the investigators expected they were negatively correlated.

=== Rhetorical listening ===

==== Background ====
Krista Ratcliffe contended that much literacy teaching in the U.S. emphasizes classical Western rhetorical theory that foregrounds speaking and writing but ignores listening. These theories mainly focus on how the rhetor&#x27;s speech can persuade the audience. The goal of classical rhetoric studies was to address what the audience should listen for, rather than how they listen.

Shari Stenberg extended this perspective to explicate the absence of listening in the academe.

Western teaching methods maintained the inherited rhetorical Greek noun , which means reasoning and logic, while ignoring its verb that refers to speaking as well as, in etymological term, to &quot;lay down&quot;, to &quot;listen&quot;. Listening may occur within two different stances: the divided logos and the restored logos. These differ in how they (re)shape the functions and outcomes of listening. The hearer listens in the divided logos while simultaneously producing their responses to the speaker. Whereas within the restored logos, the listener exploits the listening time to live in someone&#x27;s else experiences, then reflect on, and make meanings, to offer a response.

An example of divided logos was Aristotle&#x27;s theory. Despite its concern with teaching students the oral discourse that mandates listening to produce and analyze enthymemes, listening was displaced and diminished. The attention given to speaking without listening &quot;perpetuates a homogenized mode of speech based on competition rather than dialogue.&quot; Ratcliffe attributed this listening neglect to Western cultural biases that are represented as: 1) speaking is gendered as masculine while listening as feminine; 2) Listening is subjugated to ethnicity: white people speak while people of color listen; in other words, in cross-cultural relationships, there is one superior member in the conversation who does not need to listen as closely; 3) Western culture prefers to depend on sight, not sound, as its primary interpretative trope.

==== Defining rhetorical listening ====
Ratcliffe encouraged language scholars to adopt listening as a novel strategy for deriving meaning and comprehending discourses related to gender and race. The primary objective was to facilitate cross-cultural conversations. Ratcliffe defined rhetorical listening as a technique for creative interpretation, originating from a space within language where listeners can assert their influence. This approach utilizes listening as a tool to gain insight into the perspectives and voices of others, promoting interpretation, reflection, and the creation of fresh significance. To this end, Ratcliffe asserted that rhetorical listening embodies an “stance of openness that a person may choose to assume in relation to any person, text, or culture.” As an outcome of this openness, Ratcliffe claimed that rhetorical listening cultivates conscious willingness in people, thereby fostering effective communication, particularly in cross-cultural settings.

Steven Pedersen highlights the negative impact on communication of stereotypes and prejudices, which cause dis-identification. Conversely, rhetorical listening promotes cross-cultural understanding and allows students and teachers to disrupt reciprocal resistance.

Rhetorical listening requires an attentive consideration of individuals&#x27; intentions to seek understanding, which surpasses mere passive listening. Stenberg cautioned against interpretative limitations that may arise from such intentions. Within the framework of rhetorical listening, the term &quot;understanding&quot; metaphorically transforms into &quot;standing under&quot;—encompassing a comprehensive view of various perspectives. This vantage point allows for the (re)conceptualization of one&#x27;s own ideas and ethics. Instead of merely accumulating others&#x27; ideas, people cultivate these ideas, thereby enhancing their language skills and evolving their perspectives, ultimately paving the way for new .

==== Practicing rhetorical listening in the classroom ====
Based on Krista Ratcliffe&#x27;s work on rhetorical listening, Meagan Rodgers developed the intent/effect tactic as one way for students to practice rhetorical listening in the English composition classroom. The application of this tool is meant to disrupt racially discriminatory stereotypes and utterances. Rodgers found in her classroom-based research that even if a person does not perceive themselves to be racist, racism or racial stereotypes are subconsciously perpetuated when a majority/dominant group or laughs at racial differences of a minority group member. Rather than confronting students and jeopardizing their willingness to participate in classroom discussions, the intent/effect strategy invites students to (1) consider numerous perspectives of a statement, and (2) understand that well-meant comments (intent) can be perceived as deleterious (effect) by others.

Another strategy for teachers to practice rhetorical listening and improve cultural sensitivity in the classroom is by applying practices from Deaf Studies. This kind of listening pedagogy requires students (1) to be attentive and reduce distracting noises; (2) share their story, including their cultural background, so that classmates can be familiar with their perspective; (3) engage in “critical dialogue” in order to understand others; and (4) pay attention to their classmates’ body language and the messages it sends.

Rhetorical listening in the classroom can also be used to shed more light onto why students are silent. Janice Cools discusses several reasons for silence in the ESL/ELL composition classroom, such as students holding back their wisdom on purpose to avoid being harassed by peers and instructors for giving a wrong answer. The fear and doubt that can result from this type of response might lead to feelings of incompetence and discomfort in an individual and cause them to continue in silence in the classroom. A further reason why students choose silence is because they were taught to be silent, especially at the secondary school level in some cultures, e.g. Puerto Rico. 

Cools suggests asking students in writing why they are (not) silent in their classes, &quot;how [they] interpret other students&#x27; silences [...] and what a professor should infer from [students&#x27;] silence.&quot; Students have told her that silence can be beneficial as it shows their focus on the material, gives them an opportunity to get to know a different perspective while listening to their peers, and allows them to reflect and process questions. Moreover, discussions can be perceived as interruption because classmates do not have expert knowledge. Cools concludes that silence in the classroom should be appreciated and respected.

<doc id="233055" wikidata="Q238879" url="?curid=233055" title="Rate-monotonic scheduling">
<text>In computer science, rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS) is a priority assignment algorithm used in real-time operating systems (RTOS) with a static-priority scheduling class. The static priorities are assigned according to the cycle duration of the job, so a shorter cycle duration results in a higher job priority.

These operating systems are generally preemptive and have deterministic guarantees with regard to response times. Rate monotonic analysis is used in conjunction with those systems to provide scheduling guarantees for a particular application.

==Introduction==
A simple version of rate-monotonic analysis assumes that threads have the following properties:

*No resource sharing (processes do not share resources, &quot;e.g.&quot; a hardware resource, a queue, or any kind of semaphore blocking or non-blocking (busy-waits))
*Deterministic deadlines are exactly equal to periods
*Static priorities (the task with the highest static priority that is runnable immediately preempts all other tasks)
*Static priorities assigned according to the &quot;rate monotonic&quot; conventions (tasks with shorter periods/deadlines are given higher priorities)
*Context switch times and other thread operations are free and have no impact on the model

It is a mathematical model that contains a calculated simulation of periods in a closed system, where round-robin and time-sharing schedulers fail to meet the scheduling needs otherwise. Rate monotonic scheduling looks at a run modeling of all threads in the system and determines how much time is needed to meet the guarantees for the set of threads in question.

=== Optimality ===
The rate-monotonic priority assignment is &quot;optimal&quot; under the given assumptions, meaning that if any static-priority scheduling algorithm can meet all the deadlines, then the rate-monotonic algorithm can too. The deadline-monotonic scheduling algorithm is also optimal with equal periods and deadlines, in fact in this case the algorithms are identical; in addition, deadline monotonic scheduling is optimal when deadlines are less than periods. For the task model in which deadlines can be greater than periods, Audsley&#x27;s algorithm endowed with an exact schedulability test for this model finds an optimal priority assignment.

== Upper bounds on utilization ==

=== Least upper bound ===
 proved that for a set of periodic tasks with unique periods, a feasible schedule that will always meet deadlines exists if the CPU utilization is below a specific bound (depending on the number of tasks). The schedulability test for RMS is:

:formula_1

where is the utilization factor, is the computation time for process , is the release period (with deadline one period later) for process , and is the number of processes to be scheduled. For example, for two processes. When the number of processes tends towards infinity, this expression will tend towards:

:formula_2

Therefore, a rough estimate when formula_3 is that RMS can meet all of the deadlines if total CPU utilization, , is less than 70%. The other 30% of the CPU can be dedicated to lower-priority, non-real-time tasks. For smaller values of or in cases where is close to this estimate, the calculated utilization bound should be used.

In practice, for the formula_4 process, formula_5 should represent the worst-case (i.e. longest) computation time and formula_6 should represent the worst-case deadline (i.e. shortest period) in which all processing must occur.

=== Relationship to queueing theory ===
In queueing theory, is called the interarrival time, and is called the service time. These two parameters are often specified as rates:
:formula_7 is the arrival rate, and
:formula_8 is the service rate.

The utilization for each task, denoted , is then:
:formula_9
as above.

=== Upper bound for harmonic task sets ===

Liu and Layland noted that this bound may be relaxed to the maximum possible value of 1.0, if for tasks formula_10, formula_6 where formula_12 and formula_13, formula_10 is an integer multiple of formula_6, which is to say that all tasks have a period that is not just a multiple of the shortest period, formula_16, but instead that any task&#x27;s period is a multiple of all shorter periods. This is known as an harmonic task set. An example of this would be: formula_17. It is acknowledged by Liu and Layland that it is not always feasible to have a harmonic task set and that in practice other mitigation measures, such as buffering for tasks with soft-time deadlines or using a dynamic priority assignment approach may be used instead to allow for a higher bound.

=== Generalization to harmonic chains ===

Kuo and Mok showed that for a task set made up of harmonic task subsets (known as &quot;harmonic chains&quot;), the least upper bound test becomes:
:formula_18
In the instance where for each task, its period is an exact multiple of every other task that has a shorter period, the task set can be thought of as being composed of harmonic task subsets of size 1 and therefore formula_19, which makes this generalization equivalent to Liu and Layland&#x27;s least upper bound. When formula_20, the upper bound becomes 1.0, representing full utilization.

=== Stochastic bounds ===

It has been shown that a randomly generated periodic task system will usually meet all deadlines when the utilization is 88% or less, however this fact depends on knowing the exact task statistics (periods, deadlines) which cannot be guaranteed for all task sets, and in some cases the authors found that the utilization reached the least upper bound presented by Liu and Layland.

=== Hyperbolic bound ===
The hyperbolic bound is a tighter sufficient condition for schedulability than the one presented by Liu and Layland:
:formula_21,
where is the CPU utilization for each task. It is the tightest upper bound that can be found using only the individual task utilization factors.

== Resource sharing ==

In many practical applications, resources are shared and the unmodified RMS will be subject to priority inversion and deadlock hazards. In practice, this is solved by disabling preemption or by priority inheritance. Alternative methods are to use lock-free algorithms or avoid the sharing of a mutex/semaphore across threads with different priorities. This is so that resource conflicts cannot result in the first place.

=== Disabling of preemption ===

*The codice_1 and codice_2 primitives that lock CPU interrupts in a real-time kernel, e.g. MicroC/OS-II
*The codice_3 family of primitives which nest the locking of device interrupts (FreeBSD 5.x/6.x),

=== Priority inheritance ===

*The &quot;basic priority inheritance protocol&quot; promotes the priority of the task that holds the resource to the priority of the task that requests that resource at the time the request is made. Upon release of the resource, the original priority level before the promotion is restored. This method does not prevent deadlocks and suffers from &quot;chained blocking&quot;. That is, if a high priority task accesses multiple shared resources in sequence, it may have to wait (block) on a lower priority task for each of the resources. The real-time patch to the Linux kernel includes an implementation of this formula.

*The priority ceiling protocol enhances the basic priority inheritance protocol by assigning a &quot;ceiling priority&quot; to each semaphore, which is the priority of the highest job that will ever access that semaphore. A job cannot preempt a lower priority critical section if its priority is lower than the ceiling priority for that section. This method prevents deadlocks and bounds the blocking time to at most the length of one lower priority critical section. This method can be suboptimal, in that it can cause unnecessary blocking. The priority ceiling protocol is available in the VxWorks real-time kernel. It is also known as &quot;Highest Locker&#x27;s Priority Protocol&quot; (HLP).

Priority inheritance algorithms can be characterized by two parameters. First, is the inheritance lazy (only when essential) or immediate (boost priority before there is a conflict). Second is the inheritance optimistic (boost a minimum amount) or pessimistic (boost by more than the minimum amount):

In practice there is no mathematical difference (in terms of the Liu-Layland system utilization bound) between the lazy and immediate algorithms, and the immediate algorithms are more efficient to implement, and so they are the ones used by most practical systems.

An example of usage of basic priority inheritance is related to the &quot;Mars Pathfinder reset bug&quot; which was fixed on Mars by changing the creation flags for the semaphore so as to enable the priority inheritance.

== Interrupt Service Routines ==

All interrupt service routines (ISRs), whether they have a hard real-time deadline or not should be included in RMS analysis to determine schedulability in cases where ISRs have priorities above all scheduler-controlled tasks. An ISR may already be appropriately prioritized under RMS rules if its processing period is shorter than that of the shortest, non-ISR process. However, an ISR with a period/deadline longer than any non-ISR process period with a critical deadline results in a violation of RMS and prevents the use of the calculated bounds for determining schedulability of a task set.

=== Mitigating mis-prioritized ISRs ===

One method for mitigating a mis-prioritized ISR is to adjust the analysis by reducing the ISR&#x27;s period to be equal to that of the shortest period, if possible. Imposing this shorter period results in prioritization that conforms to RMS, but also results in a higher utilization factor for the ISR and therefore for the total utilization factor, which may still be below the allowable bound and therefore schedulability can be proven. As an example, consider a hardware ISR that has a computation time, formula_22 of 500 microseconds and a period, formula_23, of 4 milliseconds. If the shortest scheduler-controlled task has a period, formula_16 of 1 millisecond, then the ISR would have a higher priority, but a lower rate, which violates RMS. For the purposes of proving schedulability, set formula_25 and recalculate the utilization factor for the ISR (which also raises the total utilization factor). In this case, formula_26 will change from formula_27 to formula_28. This utilization factor would be used when adding up the total utilization factor for the task set and comparing to the upper bound to prove schedulability. It should be emphasized that adjusting the period of the ISR is for analysis only and that the true period of the ISR remains unchanged.

Another method for mitigating a mis-prioritized ISR is to use the ISR to only set a new semaphore/mutex while moving the time-intensive processing to a new process that has been appropriately prioritized using RMS and will block on the new semaphore/mutex. When determining schedulability, a margin of CPU utilization due to ISR activity should be subtracted from the least upper bound. ISRs with negligible utilization may be ignored.

==Examples==
===Example 1===

Under RMS, P2 has the highest release rate (i.e. the shortest release period) and so would have the highest priority, followed by P1 and finally P3.

==== Least Upper Bound ====

The utilization will be: 

:formula_29.

The sufficient condition for formula_30 processes, under which we can conclude that the system is schedulable is:

:formula_31

Because formula_32, and because being below the Least Upper Bound is a sufficient condition, the system is guaranteed to be schedulable.

===Example 2===

Under RMS, P2 has the highest release rate (i.e. the shortest release period) and so would have the highest priority, followed by P3 and finally P1.

==== Least Upper Bound ====
Using the Liu and Layland bound, as in Example 1, the sufficient condition for formula_30 processes, under which we can conclude that the task set is schedulable, remains:

:formula_31

The total utilization will be: 
:formula_35.

Since formula_36, the system is determined &quot;not&quot; to be guaranteed to be schedulable by the Liu and Layland bound.

==== Hyperbolic Bound ====
Using the tighter Hyperbolic bound as follows:

:formula_37

it is found that the task set &quot;is&quot; schedulable.

===Example 3===

Under RMS, P2 has the highest rate (i.e. the shortest period) and so would have the highest priority, followed by P3 and finally P1.

==== Least Upper Bound ====
Using the Liu and Layland bound, as in Example 1, the sufficient condition for formula_30 processes, under which we can conclude that the task set is schedulable, remains:

:formula_31

The total utilization will be: 

:formula_40.

Since formula_41, the system is determined &quot;not&quot; to be guaranteed to be schedulable by the Liu and Layland bound.

==== Hyperbolic Bound ====
Using the tighter Hyperbolic bound as follows:

:formula_42

Since formula_43 the system is determined to &quot;not&quot; be guaranteed to be schedulable by the Hyperbolic bound.

==== Harmonic Task Set Analysis ====
Because formula_44, tasks 2 and 3 can be considered a harmonic task subset. Task 1 forms its own harmonic task subset. Therefore, the number of harmonic task subsets, , is .

:formula_45

Using the total utilization factor calculated above (0.81875), since formula_46 the system is determined to be schedulable.

<doc id="233059" wikidata="Q2588594" url="?curid=233059" title="River Plym">
<text>The River Plym is a river in Devon, England. It runs from Dartmoor in the centre of the county southwest to meet the River Meavy, then south towards Plymouth Sound. The river is popular with canoeists, and the Plym Valley Railway runs alongside a section of the river.

==Course==
The river&#x27;s source is around above sea level on Dartmoor, in an upland marshy area called Plym Head. From the upper reaches, which contain antiquities and mining remains, the river flows roughly southwest past clay workings at Shaugh before the Dewerstone, where it meets the River Meavy. The course then changes to run southwards, between Plymouth and Plympton passing through the National Plymbridge Woods and under the ancient Plym Bridge. Its upper tidal estuary is known as the Laira and the lower part is called Cattewater, which is navigable and leads towards Plymouth Sound. It is approximately long.

==Nomenclature==
The name Plym is thought to have its origins in Old English and means the &quot;plum tree&quot; (), from a back-formation from the name of Plympton. The port of Plymouth took its name from the river.

==History==

, a River-class antisubmarine frigate, was named after the river during World War II. It carried out convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic and was later destroyed in the UK&#x27;s first nuclear explosion.

When it was in operation, the Cann Quarry Canal left the river at Marsh Mills.

The Plym Valley Railway runs alongside the River Plym. It opened in 1856 as a section of the South Devon and Tavistock Railway, which followed the river as far as the tributary with the River Meavy. The line closed to passengers in 1962, and goods services stopped four years later. The new railway is a volunteer-run railway that operates steam and diesel-hauled train rides. The first section from Plym Valley from Marsh Mills station opened in 2001, with an extension to Lee Moor Crossing in 2008. In 2013, the line was extended to Plymbridge. The remainder of the line forms part of the Plym Valley Trail, a cycle route from Plymouth to Ilfracombe.

==Leisure==
The River Plym is popular for canoeing. The upper section of Dartmoor from Cadover Bridge to Shaugh Bridge is considered challenging and has been described by the British Canoe Union as the hardest section of the river to navigate. It is often the first river to fill during heavy rain and one of the first to drop afterward. Experienced canoeists judge the water level carefully around the weather. This section has some pool drops, which are not recommended for novices. Lower sections beyond Shaugh Bridge to Bickleigh Bridge are easier to navigate past the first rapid, provided the river is at a sufficient water level.

In addition, the Plym is rich with brown trout, sea trout, and salmon. Angling is allowed in both lower and upper areas with much of the water being managed by Plymouth &amp; District Freshwater Angling Association.

<text>Liang Fa (1789–1855), also known by other names, was the second Chinese Protestant convert and the first Chinese Protestant minister and evangelist. He was ordained by Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary in the Qing Empire. His tract &quot;Good Words to Admonish the Age&quot; was influential on Hong Xiuquan, who went on to lead the Taiping Rebellion.

==Name==
Liang Fa is the pinyin romanization of Liang&#x27;s usual Chinese name, which his father used. is the Jyutping romanization of the same name in Cantonese, the usual spoken dialect of Guangdong&#x27;s natives. His personal name is the common Chinese verb for &quot;to send&quot; but in Chinese grammar can also be understood as its past participle, &quot;[he who is] sent&quot;. He is also known as , &quot;&quot;, &quot;Afa&quot;, &quot; or &quot; from the Southern Chinese habit of forming affectionate nicknames using the prefix &quot;Ā-&quot; (now , formerly ). was apparently his complete name, although it was used less often. It variously appears as &quot;Leang Kung-fa&quot;, &quot;Leang Kung-fah&quot;, and &quot;Leong Kung Fa&quot;.

==Life==
Liang was born in the village of Gulao (then known as &quot;Lohtsun&quot;), Gaoming County, in Sanzhou (&quot;Samchow&quot;), Guangdong, in 1789. Although he came from a poor family, they made an effort to give him a classical Chinese education at the village school. This consisted of the Four Books, three of the Five Classics, and the Sacred Edict. They were unable to afford his schooling until he was 11; at age 15, he was compelled to seek work as a brush-maker in Guangzhou (then known as &quot;Canton&quot;). He soon left this to apprentice as a printer, for whom he carved characters onto wooden blocks. After four years, he left to a nearby village to ply the trade. He returned to Gulao in 1810 to mourn his mother&#x27;s death and then returned to the area around Guangzhou.

In 1811 and 1812, Cai Luxing (, known at the time as &quot;Tsae Low-heen&quot;) was helping Robert Morrison to publish his Chinese translation of the New Testament and in one of those years Liang began to assist in carving the work&#x27;s printing blocks. An imperial edict of 1812 prohibited the publication of Christian texts in Chinese; it declared that Christianity was a menace to Chinese culture as it &quot;neither holds spirits in veneration nor ancestors in reverence&quot;. Nonetheless, Cai&#x27;s younger brother—probably named Gao—became the Protestants&#x27; first Chinese convert, baptized at a secluded seaside spring on July 16, 1814, and Liang became their second. The missionary William Milne employed Liang as his Chinese teacher and Liang went with him to the Malacca mission in April 1815 to assist him with printing his Chinese-language tracts. At his request, he was baptized by Milne at noon on November 3, 1816, so that there would be no shadows present. He adopted the pen name &quot;Student of the Good&quot;.

Liang returned to China in April 1819 to see his family. Under Morrison&#x27;s supervision, he prepared 200 copies of a 37-page tract of &quot;Miscellaneous Exhortations&quot; for his friends and neighbors. The police reacted harshly, arresting him and burning both the copies and the printing blocks used to publish them. Morrison got him released two days later, but he had already been beaten thirty times with a bamboo cane and compelled to pay $70. He remained forty days with his family and then returned to Malacca. He returned again in 1820, successfully converting and baptizing his wife before returning to Malacca the next year.

Following Milne&#x27;s death, he came home in 1823. On November 20, he had Morrison baptize his son Jinde (&quot;Tsin-tih&quot;). A month later, Morrison appointed him as a lay evangelist for the London Missionary Society and in 1827 ordained him as a full minister, the first native Chinese to do so. He preached at hospitals and chapels and, after writing his own tracts, thought to distribute Christian literature to the scholars gathered for the prefectural and provincial imperial exams. He printed 7,000 or 70,000 tracts in a single year and personally distributed them to the thousands who came for the tests in Guangzhou and in the prefectural seats of Guangdong. It was at one such session that Hong Xiuquan first encountered Liang&#x27;s work &quot;Good Words to Admonish the Age&quot;. He converted a printer named Lin (&quot;Lam&quot;); Li San, who became his assistant; and others. Liang accompanied Wat Ngong, another Chinese Christian printer, on his trek in 1830, distributing their Christian tracts across southwest Guangdong. He continued the practice for three or four more years. There are unclear references to some long-standing dispute between Wat and Liang that was eventually resolved; they worked together in Malacca and again to continue the mission with another native worker after Morrison&#x27;s death.

The 1833 Government of India Act ended the East India Company&#x27;s legal monopoly on Britain&#x27;s share of the Canton trade. Amid the diplomatic crisis occasioned by the increase in opium smuggling and Lord Napier&#x27;s resort to force to assert his right to act as the British consul in Guangzhou, the Emperor personally expressed disbelief that westerners were responsible for the Chinese-language magazines and broadsides being distributed by the English. Qing subjects were forbidden to teach to the language, and a crackdown was ordered. Morrison died in August 1834 and, several days into Liang&#x27;s distribution of tracts at Guangzhou&#x27;s provincial exams a few weeks later, the city&#x27;s police came for him and his companions. Liang escaped to Macao, but an assistant in Guangzhou and several family members in Sanzhou were seized. Unlike his father, John Morrison helped Liang by paying the $800 for the ten captives himself.

He again left for Malacca with his son Lou. He was formally attached to the London mission there in 1837 and, while working there with Wat Ngong, caused a &quot;spike&quot; in conversions, netting more than thirty converts in a span of months. When many of these new converts later abandoned the faith, it prompted disputes within the LMS about the meaning and requirements for baptism. Liang moved to the mission at Singapore the next year. He finally returned to China in July 1839. He then joined Peter Parker&#x27;s missionary hospital on Hog Lane in Guangzhou&#x27;s Thirteen Factories trading ghetto. At an 1841 congressional hearing in Washington, Parker quoted Liang as saying &quot;When I meet men in the streets and villages and tell them the folly of worshipping idols they laugh at me. Their hearts are very hard. But when men are sick and are healed their hearts are very soft&quot;. For similar reasons, he opposed Britain&#x27;s persecution of the First Opium War, saying its support of opium smugglers and assaults on China would turn its people against Christianity in general and British missionaries in particular. In 1845, Liang became the hospital&#x27;s chaplain, leading regular services and visiting patients. Parker noted him often sharing his conversion story and scriptural passages.

Liang helped Robert Morrison&#x27;s son-in-law Benjamin Hobson locate a residence and establish his clinic in Guangzhou&#x27;s western suburbs in 1848. Liang then moved his work there, since it began to treat more than two hundred patients daily. Four men and six women joined him for services, but more than a hundred might watch their ceremony. He baptized Hok Chau, who worked at the hospital illustrating Hobson&#x27;s medical treatises, in 1852; Chau later went on to succeed Liang as minister there.

He was unhappy with his son Jinde&#x27;s government job, which required him to work on Sundays. He also had a daughter and a third child, who died in 1832.

He died on 12 April 1855.

==Works==

Liang Fa wrote under the pen name &quot;Student of the Good&quot; or &quot;Retired Student of the Good&quot;.

He is primarily remembered for his &quot;Quànshì Liángyán&quot; , formerly romanized as &quot;K&#x27;euen She Lëang Yen&quot; and &quot;Ch&#x27;üan-shih Liang-yen&quot; and variously translated as &quot;Good Words to Admonish the Age&quot;, &quot;Good News to Admonish the Ages&quot;, &quot;Good News to Admonish the World&quot;, &quot;Good Words to Exhort the World&quot;, &quot;Good Words Exhorting the Age&quot;, &quot;Good Words Exhorting Mankind&quot;, &amp;c. Revised by Morrison, it was printed in Guangzhou in early 1832 and in Malacca later that year. It comprised a form of the New Testament in vernacular Chinese based upon Morrison&#x27;s classical Chinese translation, along with ten homilies, some of Liang&#x27;s tracts, an attack on Chinese religions, and his conversion story. Although often called a &quot;tract&quot;, it was over 500 pages long in nine stand-alone chapters or scrolls (&quot;juan&quot;), which appear to have often been printed in four-volume sets. It largely dwelt on the omnipotence of God the Father, the degrading nature and effects of idolatry and other sins, and the personal choice between salvation and damnation. Its actual text long went unstudied since only four copies are known to have survived the suppression of the Taipings: one copy of the Malacca edition is held by the New York Public Library, one copy of the Guangzhou edition is held by Harvard University, and two more were held by the London Missionary Society. A third and fourth edition, both abridged, were also printed at Singapore.

He also published:
* , autobiographical &amp; probably a second edition
* , reprinted 1832 by the British &amp; Foreign School Society. 
* , a translation of the Morning Service of Church of England, with the prayers done by Liang and the hymns by others
* .

Liang also assisted Milne&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Chinese Magazine&quot; and created &quot;The Monthly Total Record of the Inspection of the Worldly Customs&quot; (《察世俗每月統記傳》 Cha Shisu Meiyue Tongji Zhuan), one of the first Chinese magazines.

==Legacy==
Liang was an important participant in the establishment of Protestantism in China, but is most remembered for the influence of his tracts on Hong Xiuquan and his Taiping rebels, for whom &quot;Good Words to Admonish the Age&quot; became a sacred text.

Liang&#x27;s grave was found to be on land purchased for the expansion of Lingnan University (formerly Canton Christian College and now Sun Yat-sen University). He was re-interred in the center of the college campus on the site reserved for the college chapel. The site was dedicated 7 June 1920.

<text>Round-robin is a document signed by multiple parties in a circle to make it more difficult to determine the order in which it was signed, thus preventing a ringleader from being identified.

==Origin==

The term dates from the 17th-century French &quot;Rond ruban&quot; (&quot;round ribbon&quot;). This described the practice of signatories to petitions against authority (usually Government officials petitioning the Crown) appending their names on a document in a non-hierarchical circle or ribbon pattern (and so disguising the order in which they have signed) so that none may be identified as a ringleader.

This practice was adopted by sailors petitioning officers in the Royal Navy (first recorded 1731).
The practice was also known as &quot;Karakasarenban&quot; () in feudal Japan. Early examples of it, such as 1557 treaty including Mōri Motonari as a prominent signer, were used for signing alliances between multiple military clans and were intended more for removing the hierarchy and emphasizing the equal status between signers rather than for a disguise. Later usages, including 1681 plea signed by a group of farmers in 25 villages and a similar plea in 1754 signed by 30 local village lords, has more emphasis on hiding the ringleader. In modern Japan, there are more casual usages of the similar style of signing for ceremonial purposes including school graduation and significant events in group sports.

==Spanish–American War==

A round-robin letter was authored in Cuba after the cessation of hostilities in 1898 by a committee of 10 brigade commanders of the American Army&#x27;s V Corps including acting brigade commander Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish–American War, to accelerate the departure of the American Army back to the United States during the rainy disease-plagued summer season. This letter was leaked to the press and embarrassed the administration of US President William McKinley.

<doc id="233071" wikidata="Q931872" url="?curid=233071" title="Pulse detonation engine">
<text>A pulse detonation engine (PDE) is a type of propulsion system that uses detonation waves to combust the fuel and oxidizer mixture.

The engine is pulsed because the mixture must be renewed in the combustion chamber between each detonation wave and the next. Theoretically, a PDE can operate from subsonic up to a hypersonic flight speed of roughly Mach 5. An ideal PDE design can have a thermodynamic efficiency higher than other designs like turbojets and turbofans because a detonation wave rapidly compresses the mixture and adds heat at constant volume. Consequently, moving parts like compressor spools are not necessarily required in the engine, which could significantly reduce overall weight and cost. Key issues for further development include fast and efficient mixing of the fuel and oxidizer, the prevention of autoignition, and integration with an inlet and nozzle.

, no practical PDE has been put into production, but several testbed engines have been built and one was successfully integrated into a low-speed demonstration aircraft that flew in sustained PDE powered flight in 2008.

== History ==
PDEs have been considered for propulsion since 1940.

The first known flight of an aircraft powered by a pulse detonation engine took place at the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port on 31 January 2008. The project was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. The aircraft selected for the flight was a heavily modified Scaled Composites Long-EZ, named &quot;Borealis&quot;. The engine consisted of four tubes producing pulse detonations at a frequency of 80 Hz, creating up to 200 pounds of thrust (890 newtons). Many fuels were considered and tested by the engine developers in recent years, but a refined octane was used for this flight. A small rocket system was used to facilitate the liftoff of the Long-EZ, but the PDE operated under its own power for 10 seconds at an altitude of approximately 100 feet (30 m). The flight took place at a low speed whereas the appeal of the PDE engine concept lies more at high speeds, but the demonstration showed that a PDE can be integrated into an aircraft frame without experiencing structural problems from the 195-200 dB detonation waves. No more flights are planned for the modified Long-EZ, but the success is likely to fuel more funding for PDE research. The aircraft itself has been moved to the National Museum of the United States Air Force for display.

In June 2008, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) unveiled Blackswift, which was intended to use this technology to reach speeds of up to Mach 6. However the project was reported cancelled soon afterward, in October 2008.

== Operation ==

The basic operation of the PDE is similar to that of the pulse jet engine. In the pulse jet, air is mixed with fuel to create a flammable mixture that is then ignited in an open chamber. The resulting combustion greatly increases the pressure of the mixture to approximately 100 atmospheres (10 MPa), which then expands through a nozzle for thrust.

To ensure that the mixture exits to the rear, thereby pushing the aircraft forward, a series of shutters are used to close off the front of the engine. Careful tuning of the inlet ensures the shutters close at the right time to force the air to travel in one direction only through the engine. Some pulse jet designs used a tuned resonant cavity to provide the valving action through the airflow in the system. These designs normally look like a U-shaped tube, open at both ends.

In either system, the pulse jet has problems during the combustion process. As the fuel burns and expands to create thrust, it is also pushing any remaining unburnt charge rearward, out of the nozzle. In many cases some of the charge is ejected before burning, which causes the famous trail of flame seen on the V-1 flying bomb and other pulse jets. Even while inside the engine, the mixture&#x27;s volume is constantly changing which inefficiently converts fuel into usable energy.

All regular jet engines and most rocket engines operate on the &quot;deflagration&quot; of fuel, that is, the rapid but subsonic combustion of fuel. The pulse detonation engine is a concept currently in active development to create a jet engine that operates on the supersonic &quot;detonation&quot; of fuel. Because the combustion takes place so rapidly, the charge (fuel/air mix) does not have time to expand during this process, so it takes place under almost constant volume. Constant volume combustion is more efficient than open-cycle designs like gas turbines, which leads to greater fuel efficiency.

As the combustion process is so rapid, mechanical shutters are difficult to arrange with the required performance. Instead, PDEs generally use a series of valves to time the process carefully.

Most PDE research is military in nature, as the engine could be used to develop a new generation of high-speed, long-range reconnaissance aircraft that would fly high enough to be out of range of any current anti-aircraft defenses, while offering range considerably greater than the SR-71, which required a massive tanker support fleet.

Key difficulties in pulse detonation engines are achieving DDT without requiring a tube long enough to make it impractical and drag-imposing on the aircraft (adding a U-bend into the tube extinguishes the detonation wave); reducing the noise (often described as sounding like a jackhammer); and damping the severe vibration caused by the operation of the engine.

== Uses ==

If both fuel and oxidizer are carried by the vehicle a pulse detonation engine is independent of the atmosphere and it can be used in spaceflight. On 26 July 2021 (UTC), Japan&#x27;s space agency JAXA successfully tested a pulse detonation rocket engine in space on a S-520 sounding rocket flight. The upper stage of the rocket used a rotating detonation engine (RDE) as the main engine and a S-shaped pulse detonating engine was used to de-spin the stage after the main engine burn. PDE operated three times in the flight for a total of 14 cycles.

<doc id="233074" wikidata="Q1196582" url="?curid=233074" title="Round-robin scheduling">
<text>Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing.
As the term is generally used, time slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority (also known as cyclic executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can be applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in computer networks. It is an operating system concept.

The name of the algorithm comes from the round-robin principle known from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something in turn.

==Process scheduling==
To schedule processes fairly, a round-robin scheduler generally employs time-sharing, giving each job a time slot or &quot;quantum&quot; (its allowance of CPU time), and interrupting the job if it is not completed by then. The job is resumed next time a time slot is assigned to that process. If the process terminates or changes its state to waiting during its attributed time quantum, the scheduler selects the first process in the ready queue to execute. In the absence of time-sharing, or if the quanta were large relative to the sizes of the jobs, a process that produced large jobs would be favored over other processes.

Round-robin algorithm is a pre-emptive algorithm as the scheduler forces the process out of the CPU once the time quota expires.

For example, if the time slot is 100 milliseconds, and &quot;job1&quot; takes a total time of 250 ms to complete, the round-robin scheduler will suspend the job after 100 ms and give other jobs their time on the CPU. Once the other jobs have had their equal share (100 ms each), &quot;job1&quot; will get another allocation of CPU time and the cycle will repeat. This process continues until the job finishes and needs no more time on the CPU. 

* Job1 = Total time to complete 250 ms (quantum 100 ms).
# First allocation = 100 ms.
# Second allocation = 100 ms.
# Third allocation = 100 ms but &quot;job1&quot; self-terminates after 50 ms.
# Total CPU time of &quot;job1&quot; = 250 ms

Consider the following table with the arrival time and execute time of the process with the quantum time of 100 ms to understand the round-robin scheduling:


Another approach is to divide all processes into an equal number of timing quanta such that the quantum size is proportional to the size of the process. Hence, all processes end at the same time.

==Network packet scheduling==

In best-effort packet switching and other statistical multiplexing, round-robin scheduling can be used as an alternative to first-come first-served queuing.

A multiplexer, switch, or router that provides round-robin scheduling has a separate queue for every data flow, where a data flow may be identified by its source and destination address. The algorithm allows every active data flow that has data packets in the queue to take turns in transferring packets on a shared channel in a periodically repeated order. The scheduling is work-conserving, meaning that if one flow is out of packets, the next data flow will take its place. Hence, the scheduling tries to prevent link resources from going unused.

Round-robin scheduling results in max-min fairness if the data packets are equally sized, since the data flow that has waited the longest time is given scheduling priority. It may not be desirable if the size of the data packets varies widely from one job to another. A user that produces large packets would be favored over other users. In that case fair queuing would be preferable.

If guaranteed or differentiated quality of service is offered, and not only best-effort communication, deficit round-robin (DRR) scheduling, weighted round-robin (WRR) scheduling, or weighted fair queuing (WFQ) may be considered.

In multiple-access networks, where several terminals are connected to a shared physical medium, round-robin scheduling may be provided by token passing channel access schemes such as Token Ring, or by polling or resource reservation from a central control station.

In a centralized wireless packet radio network, where many stations share one frequency channel, a scheduling algorithm in a central base station may reserve time slots for the mobile stations in a round-robin fashion and provide fairness. However, if link adaptation is used, it will take a much longer time to transmit a certain amount of data to &quot;expensive&quot; users than to others since the channel conditions differ. It would be more efficient to wait with the transmission until the channel conditions are improved, or at least to give scheduling priority to less expensive users. Round-robin scheduling does not utilize this. Higher throughput and system spectrum efficiency may be achieved by channel-dependent scheduling, for example a proportionally fair algorithm, or maximum throughput scheduling. Note that the latter is characterized by undesirable scheduling starvation. This type of scheduling is one of the very basic algorithms for Operating Systems in computers which can be implemented through a circular queue data structure.

<text>A reconnaissance aircraft (colloquially, a spy plane) is a military aircraft designed or adapted to perform aerial reconnaissance with roles including collection of imagery intelligence (including using photography), signals intelligence, as well as measurement and signature intelligence. Modern technology has also enabled some aircraft and UAVs to carry out real-time surveillance in addition to general intelligence gathering.

Before the development of devices such as radar, military forces relied on reconnaissance aircraft for visual observation and scouting of enemy movement. An example is the PBY Catalina maritime patrol flying boat used by the Allies in World War II: a flight of U.S. Navy Catalinas spotted part of the Japanese fleet approaching Midway Island, beginning the Battle of Midway.

==History==

Prior to the 20th century, machines for powered and controllable flight were not available to military forces, but some attempts were made to use lighter than air craft. During the Napoleonic Wars and Franco-Prussian War, balloons were used for aerial reconnaissance by the French.

In World War I, aircraft were deployed during early phases of battle in reconnaissance roles as &#x27;eyes of the army&#x27; to aid ground forces. Aerial reconnaissance from this time through 1945 was mostly carried out by adapted versions of standard fighters and bombers equipped with film cameras. Photography became the primary and best-known method of intelligence collection for reconnaissance aircraft by the end of World War II.

World War I also saw use of floatplanes to locate enemy warships. After the battle of Jutland demonstrated the limitations of seaplane tenders, provisions were made for capital ships to carry, launch, and recover observation seaplanes. These seaplanes could scout for enemy warships beyond the visual range of the ship&#x27;s lookouts, and could spot the fall of shot during long range artillery engagements. Observation seaplanes were replaced by helicopters after World War II.

After World War II and during the Cold War the United States developed several dedicated reconnaissance aircraft designs, including the U-2 and SR-71, to monitor the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union. Other types of reconnaissance aircraft were built for specialized roles in signals intelligence and electronic monitoring, such as the RB-47, RB-57, Boeing RC-135 and the Ryan Model 147 drones.

Since the Cold War much of the strategic reconnaissance aircraft role has passed over to satellites, and the tactical role to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This has been proven in successful uses by the United States in Desert Storm operations.

<doc id="233078" wikidata="Q1268314" url="?curid=233078" title="Montebello Islands">
<text>The Montebello Islands, also rendered as the Monte Bello Islands, are an archipelago of around 174 small islands, about 92 of which are named, lying north of Barrow Island and off the Pilbara coast of north-western Australia. The islands form a marine conservation reserve of administered by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. The islands were the site of three British atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, in 1952 and 1956.

==Description==
The islands of the archipelago have a collective land area of about . The largest islands, Hermite and Trimouille, have an area of and respectively. They consist of limestone rock and sand. The rocky parts are dominated by &quot;Triodia&quot; hummock grassland with scattered shrubs, while the sandy areas support grasses such as sedges, and shrubs, mainly &quot;Acacia&quot;. Patches of mangroves grow in sheltered bays and channels of the archipelago, especially on Hermite Island. The climate is hot and arid with an annual average rainfall of about 320 mm.

=== Wildlife ===
==== Birds ====
The islands have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of fairy and roseate terns, and of sooty oystercatchers. Greater crested terns breed there irregularly, sometimes in large numbers. Other birds breeding on the islands include ospreys, white-bellied sea eagles, pied oystercatchers, Caspian terns and bridled terns. The islands support 12–15 breeding pairs of beach stone-curlews. Yellow white-eyes have been recorded.

==== Mammals ====
Invasive feral cats and black rats have been eradicated from the islands, allowing endangered rufous hare-wallabies (mala) and Shark Bay mice to be translocated to the islands under the conservation management strategy for those threatened species, and they are now common on many of the larger islands.

==History==
Archaeological remains show that the islands were visited by indigenous Australians until about 8248 BP, when a period of global warming and rising sea levels caused the Montebellos to become separated from the mainland, and forced their abandonment.

In 1622 &quot;Tryall&quot;, an English East India Company-owned East Indiaman, was wrecked on the Tryal Rocks, a reef of uncharted submerged rocks about north-west of the outer edge of the Montebello Islands. The ship&#x27;s factor, Thomas Bright, along with 35 others, sailed a longboat to the Montebello Islands and spent seven days ashore there, before sailing the longboat to Bantam in Java. It was the first recorded shipwreck in Australian waters and the first extended stay in Australia by Europeans.

In 1801, Nicolas Baudin, leading a French Navy exploration expedition, named the island group after the Battle of Montebello of 1800, Hermite Island after Admiral Jean-Marthe-Adrien L&#x27;Hermite, and Trimouille Island after French general Louis II de la Trémoille. 

The islands were economically significant for pearl fishing from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of the Second World War.

===British nuclear weapons tests===

The Montebello Islands were the site of three atmospheric nuclear weapon tests by the British military: one in 1952, and two in 1956.

HMS &quot;Plym&quot;, moored in Main Bay on Trimouille Island, was the site of Operation Hurricane, the first-ever atomic weapon tested by the United Kingdom, on 3 October 1952.

While subsequent British tests were conducted at sites on mainland Australia, in 1956 there were two land-sited tower-mounted tests, on Trimouille and Alpha Islands. The second of those, codenamed &quot;Mosaic G2&quot;, was the largest nuclear explosion in Australia, with an official yield of 60 kilotons. Mosaic G2 was later described as an &quot;exceptionally dirty explosion&quot;, the fallout from which contaminated large areas of mainland Australia, as far away as the Queensland towns of Mount Isa, Julia Creek, Longreach and Rockhampton.

==Islands==

Of the smaller islands, the largest are:
* North-West Island
* Primrose Island
* Bluebell Island
* Alpha Island
* Crocus Island
* Campbell Island
* Delta Island
* Renewal Island
* Ah Chong Island

There are also 10 named groups of small islets, whose individual islands have not yet been named:

* Corkwood Islands
* Fig Islands
* Hakea Islands
* Jarrah Islands
* Jasmine Islands
* Karri Islands
* Marri Islands
* Minnieritchie Islands
* Mulga Islands
* Quandong Islands

<text>Bruno Akrapović (born 26 September 1967) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player.

==Club career==
Starting his career in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the time part of Yugoslavia, Akrapović spent the majority of his career playing for various clubs in the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, among others VfL Wolfsburg, Mainz 05 and Energie Cottbus. He played alongside Jürgen Klopp at Mainz between 1994 and 1997.

==International career==
Akrapović made his senior debut for Bosnia and Herzegovina in a March 2000 friendly match against Macedonia and has earned a total of 14 caps, scoring one goal. His final international was a September 2002 European Championship qualification match against Romania.

==Managerial career==
On 16 January 2010, Akrapović received his UEFA Pro Licence in the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s educational facility in Jablanica.

Akrapović managed Shkëndija in the Macedonian First League and RNK Split in Croatia, before relocating to Bulgaria in 2017 to become the manager of Lokomotiv Plovdiv where he won the Bulgarian Cup twice in a row in the seasons 2018–19 and 2019–20, as well as the Bulgarian Supercup in 2020.

On 14 June 2022, Akrapović was appointed as manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Wehda. On 20 October 2022, he was sacked after only two wins in eight matches. On 30 December 2022, Akrapović was appointed as manager of Cypriot side Akritas Chlorakas. On 27 February 2023, he was sacked after only two months.

On 8 January 2024, Akrapović became the manager of his native Bosnian Premier League club Željezničar, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract. His first game in charge of Željezničar was a 0–0 home draw against Zrinjski Mostar on 17 February 2024. He suffered his first defeat as Željezničar manager on 26 February, losing 2–0 away to Široki Brijeg. He was victorious in his first Sarajevo derby, beating rivals Sarajevo 3–0 at home on 3 March 2024. Following a series of poor results, and with Željezničar sitting in the relegation zone with four points from their previous six games, Akrapović and the club mutually terminated his contract on 20 April 2024.

==Personal life==
Akrapović&#x27;s wife is Italian and their son Aaron Akrapović used to represent the Italy U17 national team.

<doc id="233082" wikidata="Q170518" url="?curid=233082" title="Burn">
<text>A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ionizing radiation (such as sunburn, caused by ultraviolet radiation). Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire. Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace. In the home, risks are associated with domestic kitchens, including stoves, flames, and hot liquids. In the workplace, risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).
Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters, and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.
Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.
In 2015, fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries. This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 176,000 deaths. Among women in much of the world, burns are most commonly related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, they are more likely a result of unsafe workplace conditions. Most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world, particularly in Southeast Asia. While large burns can be fatal, treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes, especially in children and young adults. In the United States, approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries. The long-term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected.
==History==
Cave paintings from more than 3,500 years ago document burns and their management. The earliest Egyptian records on treating burns describes dressings prepared with milk from mothers of baby boys, and the 1500 BCE Edwin Smith Papyrus describes treatments using honey and the salve of resin. Many other treatments have been used over the ages, including the use of tea leaves by the Chinese documented to 600 BCE, pig fat and vinegar by Hippocrates documented to 400 BCE, and wine and myrrh by Celsus documented to the 1st century CE. French barber-surgeon Ambroise Paré was the first to describe different degrees of burns in the 1500s. Guillaume Dupuytren expanded these degrees into six different severities in 1832.

The first hospital to treat burns opened in 1843 in London, England, and the development of modern burn care began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. During World War I, Henry D. Dakin and Alexis Carrel developed standards for the cleaning and disinfecting of burns and wounds using sodium hypochlorite solutions, which significantly reduced mortality. In the 1940s, the importance of early excision and skin grafting was acknowledged, and around the same time, fluid resuscitation and formulas to guide it were developed. In the 1970s, researchers demonstrated the significance of the hypermetabolic state that follows large burns.

The &quot;Evans formula&quot;, described in 1952, was the first burn resuscitation formula based on body weight and surface area (BSA) damaged. The first 24 hours of treatment entails 1ml/kg/% BSA of crystalloids plus 1 ml/kg/% BSA colloids plus 2000ml glucose in water, and in the next 24 hours, crystalloids at 0.5 ml/kg/% BSA, colloids at 0.5 ml/kg/% BSA, and the same amount of glucose in water.

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth. Superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days, followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days. Individuals with more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain. Full-thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture. While superficial burns are typically red in color, severe burns may be pink, white or black. Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred, but these findings are not definitive. More worrisome signs include: shortness of breath, hoarseness, and stridor or wheezing. Itchiness is common during the healing process, occurring in up to 90% of adults and nearly all children. Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury. Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress.


==Cause==
Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal (heat-related), chemical, electrical, and radiation. In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%). Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%), and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1–2% resulting from a suicide attempt. These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%.

Burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor. Smoking and alcoholism are other risk factors. Fire-related burns are generally more common in colder climates. Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults.

===Thermal===
In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns. Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%. Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire. Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam. Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns. Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30% of burns in children. Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact. Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries. This is a particular risk for adolescent males. In the United States, for non-fatal burn injuries to children, white males under the age of 6 comprise most cases.  Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.

===Chemical===

Chemical burns can be caused by over 25,000 substances, most of which are either a strong base (55%) or a strong acid (26%). Most chemical burn deaths are secondary to ingestion. Common agents include: sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners, sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach, and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in paint remover, among others. Hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure. Formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells.

===Electrical===

Electrical burns or injuries are classified as high voltage (greater than or equal to 1000 volts), low voltage (less than 1000 volts), or as flash burns secondary to an electric arc. The most common causes of electrical burns in children are electrical cords (60%) followed by electrical outlets (14%). Lightning may also result in electrical burns. Risk factors for being struck include involvement in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing, golf and field sports, and working outside. Mortality from a lightning strike is about 10%.

While electrical injuries primarily result in burns, they may also cause fractures or dislocations secondary to blunt force trauma or muscle contractions. In high voltage injuries, most damage may occur internally and thus the extent of the injury cannot be judged by examination of the skin alone. Contact with either low voltage or high voltage may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

===Radiation===

Radiation burns may be caused by protracted exposure to ultraviolet light (such as from the sun, tanning booths or arc welding) or from ionizing radiation (such as from radiation therapy, X-rays or radioactive fallout). Sun exposure is the most common cause of radiation burns and the most common cause of superficial burns overall. There is significant variation in how easily people sunburn based on their skin type. Skin effects from ionizing radiation depend on the amount of exposure to the area, with hair loss seen after 3 Gy, redness seen after 10 Gy, wet skin peeling after 20 Gy, and necrosis after 30 Gy. Redness, if it occurs, may not appear until some time after exposure. Radiation burns are treated the same as other burns. Microwave burns occur via thermal heating caused by the microwaves. While exposures as short as two seconds may cause injury, overall this is an uncommon occurrence.

===Non-accidental===
In those hospitalized from scalds or fire burns, 310% are from assault. Reasons include: child abuse, personal disputes, spousal abuse, elder abuse, and business disputes. An immersion injury or immersion scald may indicate child abuse. It is created when an extremity, or sometimes the buttocks are held under the surface of hot water. It typically produces a sharp upper border and is often symmetrical, known as &quot;sock burns&quot;, &quot;glove burns&quot;, or &quot;zebra stripes&quot; - where folds have prevented certain areas from burning. Deliberate cigarette burns most often found on the face, or the back of the hands and feet. Other high-risk signs of potential abuse include: circumferential burns, the absence of splash marks, a burn of uniform depth, and association with other signs of neglect or abuse.

Bride burning, a form of domestic violence, occurs in some cultures, such as India where women have been burned in revenge for what the husband or his family consider an inadequate dowry. In Pakistan, acid burns represent 13% of intentional burns, and are frequently related to domestic violence. Self-immolation (setting oneself on fire) is also used as a form of protest in various parts of the world.

== Pathophysiology ==

At temperatures greater than , proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down. This results in cell and tissue damage. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are caused by failure of the skin to perform its normal functions, which include: protection from bacteria, skin sensation, body temperature regulation, and prevention of evaporation of the body&#x27;s water. Disruption of these functions can lead to infection, loss of skin sensation, hypothermia, and hypovolemic shock via dehydration (i.e. water in the body evaporated away). Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium.

In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss, making the blood more concentrated. Poor blood flow to organs like the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers.

Increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years. This is associated with increased cardiac output, metabolism, a fast heart rate, and poor immune function.

==Diagnosis==
Burns can be classified by depth, mechanism of injury, extent, and associated injuries. The most commonly used classification is based on the depth of injury. The depth of a burn is usually determined via examination, although a biopsy may also be used. It may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn on a single examination and repeated examinations over a few days may be necessary. In those who have a headache or are dizzy and have a fire-related burn, carbon monoxide poisoning should be considered. Cyanide poisoning should also be considered.

=== Size ===

The size of a burn is measured as a percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected by partial thickness or full thickness burns. First-degree burns that are only red in color and are not blistering are not included in this estimation. Most burns (70%) involve less than 10% of the TBSA.

There are a number of methods to determine the TBSA, including the Wallace rule of nines, Lund and Browder chart, and estimations based on a person&#x27;s palm size. The rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over 16 years of age. More accurate estimates can be made using Lund and Browder charts, which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children. The size of a person&#x27;s handprint (including the palm and fingers) is approximately 1% of their TBSA. 

===Severity===
To determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit, the American Burn Association devised a classification system. Under this system, burns can be classified as major, moderate, and minor. This is assessed based on a number of factors, including total body surface area affected, the involvement of specific anatomical zones, the age of the person, and associated injuries. Minor burns can typically be managed at home, moderate burns are often managed in a hospital, and major burns are managed by a burn center. Severe burn injury represents one of the most devastating forms of trauma. Despite improvements in burn care, patients can be left to suffer for as many as three years post-injury.

==Prevention==
Historically, about half of all burns were deemed preventable. Burn prevention programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns. Preventive measures include: limiting hot water temperatures, smoke alarms, sprinkler systems, proper construction of buildings, and fire-resistant clothing. Experts recommend setting water heaters below . Other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures, and splash guards on stoves. While the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear, there is tentative evidence of benefit with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children.

==Management==
Resuscitation begins with the assessment and stabilization of the person&#x27;s airway, breathing and circulation. If inhalation injury is suspected, early intubation may be required. This is followed by care of the burn wound itself. People with extensive burns may be wrapped in clean sheets until they arrive at a hospital. As burn wounds are prone to infection, a tetanus booster shot should be given if an individual has not been immunized within the last five years. In the United States, 95% of burns that present to the emergency department are treated and discharged; 5% require hospital admission. With major burns, early feeding is important. Protein intake should also be increased, and trace elements and vitamins are often required. Hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in addition to traditional treatments.

===Intravenous fluids===
In those with poor tissue perfusion, boluses of isotonic crystalloid solution should be given. In children with more than 10–20% TBSA (Total Body Surface Area) burns, and adults with more than 15% TBSA burns, formal fluid resuscitation and monitoring should follow. This should be begun pre-hospital if possible in those with burns greater than 25% TBSA. The Parkland formula can help determine the volume of intravenous fluids required over the first 24 hours. The formula is based on the affected individual&#x27;s TBSA and weight. Half of the fluid is administered over the first 8 hours, and the remainder over the following 16 hours. The time is calculated from when the burn occurred, and not from the time that fluid resuscitation began. Children require additional maintenance fluid that includes glucose. Additionally, those with inhalation injuries require more fluid. While inadequate fluid resuscitation may cause problems, over-resuscitation can also be detrimental. The formulas are only a guide, with infusions ideally tailored to a urinary output of &gt;30 mL/h in adults or &gt;1mL/kg in children and mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg.

While lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution is often used, there is no evidence that it is superior to normal saline. Crystalloid fluids appear just as good as colloid fluids, and as colloids are more expensive they are not recommended. Blood transfusions are rarely required. They are typically only recommended when the hemoglobin level falls below 60-80 g/L (6-8 g/dL) due to the associated risk of complications. Intravenous catheters may be placed through burned skin if needed or intraosseous infusions may be used.

=== Wound care ===
Early cooling (within 30 minutes of the burn) reduces burn depth and pain, but care must be taken as over-cooling can result in hypothermia. It should be performed with cool water and not ice water as the latter can cause further injury. Chemical burns may require extensive irrigation. Cleaning with soap and water, removal of dead tissue, and application of dressings are important aspects of wound care. If intact blisters are present, it is not clear what should be done with them. Some tentative evidence supports leaving them intact. Second-degree burns should be re-evaluated after two days.

In the management of first and second-degree burns, little quality evidence exists to determine which dressing type to use. It is reasonable to manage first-degree burns without dressings. While topical antibiotics are often recommended, there is little evidence to support their use. Silver sulfadiazine (a type of antibiotic) is not recommended as it potentially prolongs healing time. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of dressings containing silver or negative-pressure wound therapy. Silver sulfadiazine does not appear to differ from silver containing foam dressings with respect to healing.

===Medications===
Burns can be very painful and a number of different options may be used for pain management. These include simple analgesics (such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and opioids such as morphine. Benzodiazepines may be used in addition to analgesics to help with anxiety. During the healing process, antihistamines, massage, or transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to aid with itching. Antihistamines, however, are only effective for this purpose in 20% of people. There is tentative evidence supporting the use of gabapentin and its use may be reasonable in those who do not improve with antihistamines. Intravenous lidocaine requires more study before it can be recommended for pain.

Intravenous antibiotics are recommended before surgery for those with extensive burns (&gt;60% TBSA). , guidelines do not recommend their general use due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance and the increased risk of fungal infections. Tentative evidence, however, shows that they may improve survival rates in those with large and severe burns. Erythropoietin has not been found effective to prevent or treat anemia in burn cases. In burns caused by hydrofluoric acid, calcium gluconate is a specific antidote and may be used intravenously and/or topically. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in those with burns that involve more than 40% of their body appears to speed healing without affecting the risk of death. The use of steroids is of unclear evidence.

Allogeneic cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in murine collagen (Stratagraft) was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2021.

===Surgery===
Wounds requiring surgical closure with skin grafts or flaps (typically anything more than a small full thickness burn) should be dealt with as early as possible. Circumferential burns of the limbs or chest may need urgent surgical release of the skin, known as an escharotomy. This is done to treat or prevent problems with distal circulation, or ventilation. It is uncertain if it is useful for neck or digit burns. Fasciotomies may be required for electrical burns.

Skin grafts can involve temporary skin substitutes, derived from animal (human donor or pig) skin or synthesized. They are used to cover the wound as a dressing, preventing infection and fluid loss, but will eventually need to be removed. Alternatively, human skin can be treated to be left on permanently without rejection.

There is no evidence that the use of copper sulphate to visualise phosphorus particles for removal can help with wound healing due to phosphorus burns. Meanwhile, absorption of copper sulphate into the blood circulation can be harmful.

===Alternative medicine===
Honey has been used since ancient times to aid wound healing and may be beneficial in first- and second-degree burns. There is moderate evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness burns. The evidence for aloe vera is of poor quality. While it might be beneficial in reducing pain, and a review from 2007 found tentative evidence of improved healing times, a subsequent review from 2012 did not find improved healing over silver sulfadiazine. There were only three randomized controlled trials for the use of plants for burns, two for aloe vera and one for oatmeal.

There is little evidence that vitamin E helps with keloids or scarring. Butter is not recommended. In low income countries, burns are treated up to one-third of the time with traditional medicine, which may include applications of eggs, mud, leaves or cow dung. Surgical management is limited in some cases due to insufficient financial resources and availability. There are a number of other methods that may be used in addition to medications to reduce procedural pain and anxiety including: virtual reality therapy, hypnosis, and behavioral approaches such as distraction techniques.

=== Patient support ===
Burn patients require support and care – both physiological and psychological. Respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ system failure are common in hospitalized burn patients. To prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature, burn patients with over 20% of burn injuries should be kept in an environment with the temperature at or above 30 degree Celsius.

Metabolism in burn patients proceeds at a higher than normal speed due to the whole-body process and rapid fatty acid substrate cycles, which can be countered with an adequate supply of energy, nutrients, and antioxidants. Enteral feeding a day after resuscitation is required to reduce risk of infection, recovery time, non-infectious complications, hospital stay, long-term damage, and mortality. Controlling blood glucose levels can have an impact on liver function and survival.

Risk of thromboembolism is high and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that does not resolve with maximal ventilator use is also a common complication. Scars are long-term after-effects of a burn injury. Psychological support is required to cope with the aftermath of a fire accident, while to prevent scars and long-term damage to the skin and other body structures consulting with burn specialists, preventing infections, consuming nutritious foods, early and aggressive rehabilitation, and using compressive clothing are recommended.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis is worse in those with larger burns, those who are older, and females. The presence of a smoke inhalation injury, other significant injuries such as long bone fractures, and serious co-morbidities (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, psychiatric illness, and suicidal intent) also influence prognosis. On average, of those admitted to burn centers in the United States, 4% die, with the outcome for individuals dependent on the extent of the burn injury. For example, admittees with burn areas less than 10% TBSA had a mortality rate of less than 1%, while admittees with over 90% TBSA had a mortality rate of 85%. In Afghanistan, people with more than 60% TBSA burns rarely survive. The Baux score has historically been used to determine prognosis of major burns. However, with improved care, it is no longer very accurate. The score is determined by adding the size of the burn (% TBSA) to the age of the person and taking that to be more or less equal to the risk of death. Burns in 2013 resulted in 1.2 million years lived with disability and 12.3 million disability adjusted life years.

=== Complications ===
A number of complications may occur, with infections being the most common. In order of frequency, potential complications include: pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections and respiratory failure. Risk factors for infection include: burns of more than 30% TBSA, full-thickness burns, extremes of age (young or old), or burns involving the legs or perineum. Pneumonia occurs particularly commonly in those with inhalation injuries.

Anemia secondary to full thickness burns of greater than 10% TBSA is common. Electrical burns may lead to compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis due to muscle breakdown. Blood clotting in the veins of the legs is estimated to occur in 6 to 25% of people. The hypermetabolic state that may persist for years after a major burn can result in a decrease in bone density and a loss of muscle mass. Keloids may form subsequent to a burn, particularly in those who are young and dark skinned. Following a burn, children may have significant psychological trauma and experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Scarring may also result in a disturbance in body image. To treat hypertrophic scars (raised, tense, stiff and itchy scars) and limit their effect on physical function and everyday activities, silicone sheeting and compression garments are recommended. In the developing world, significant burns may result in social isolation, extreme poverty and child abandonment.

==Epidemiology==
In 2015 fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries. This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 238,000 dying. This is down from 300,000 deaths in 1990. This makes it the fourth leading cause of injuries after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and violence. About 90% of burns occur in the developing world. This has been attributed partly to overcrowding and an unsafe cooking situation. Overall, nearly 60% of fatal burns occur in Southeast Asia with a rate of 11.6 per 100,000. The number of fatal burns has changed from 280,000 in 1990 to 176,000 in 2015.

In the developed world, adult males have twice the mortality as females from burns. This is most probably due to their higher risk occupations and greater risk-taking activities. In many countries in the developing world, however, females have twice the risk of males. This is often related to accidents in the kitchen or domestic violence. In children, deaths from burns occur at more than ten times the rate in the developing than the developed world. Overall, in children it is one of the top fifteen leading causes of death. From the 1980s to 2004, many countries have seen both a decrease in the rates of fatal burns and in burns generally.

===Developed countries===
An estimated 500,000 burn injuries receive medical treatment yearly in the United States. They resulted in about 3,300 deaths in 2008. Most burns (70%) and deaths from burns occur in males. The highest incidence of fire burns occurs in those 1835 years old, while the highest incidence of scalds occurs in children less than five years old and adults over 65. Electrical burns result in about 1,000 deaths per year. Lightning results in the death of about 60 people a year. In Europe, intentional burns occur most commonly in middle aged men.

===Developing countries===
In India, about 700,000 to 800,000 people per year sustain significant burns, though very few are looked after in specialist burn units. The highest rates occur in women 16–35 years of age. Part of this high rate is related to unsafe kitchens and loose-fitting clothing typical to India. It is estimated that one-third of all burns in India are due to clothing catching fire from open flames. Intentional burns are also a common cause and occur at high rates in young women, secondary to domestic violence and self-harm.

<doc id="233083" wikidata="Q1675849" url="?curid=233083" title="Les Wexner">
<text>Leslie Herbert Wexner (born September 8, 1937) is an American billionaire businessman, the co-founder and chairman emeritus of Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (formerly Limited Brands). 

Wexner retained Jeffrey Epstein as his financial manager from 1987 to 2007 and was initially the &quot;main client&quot; of Epstein’s money-management firm, according to Bloomberg. Epstein ran his business out of a house Wexner owned and sometimes resided in while Advisor of Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

==Early life and education==
Wexner was born in Dayton, Ohio, on September 8, 1937, to parents Bella née Cabakoff (1908–2001) and Harry Louis Wexner (1899–1975). Both his parents were of Russian-Jewish origin. His father was born in Russia and his mother was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She moved to Columbus, Ohio as a toddler. Wexner has a younger sister, Susan. 

Wexner attended Bexley High School and Ohio State University. He initially expressed an interest in architecture but graduated in 1959 with a major in business administration. While a student at Ohio State University, he joined the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. Wexner served in the Air National Guard. He briefly attended the Moritz College of Law.

==Career==
Wexner began his retail career working in his parents&#x27; clothing store, &quot;Leslie&#x27;s&quot;, which had been named after him. According to Wexner, he began working at his parents&#x27; store so they could take a vacation. Wexner analyzed the sales and inventory, identifying the most and least profitable items. When his father refused to adjust the inventory, Wexner decided to open his own store.
In 1963, Wexner&#x27;s aunt lent him $5,000, which he combined with a matching loan from a bank in order to start The Limited. The store took its name from its focus on moderately priced merchandise, such as skirts, sweaters and shirts, that sold quickly and quickly generated revenue. Wexner opened the first store on August 10, 1963, in the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. One year later, Wexner&#x27;s parents closed their store and joined their son in running The Limited. He opened the second Limited store in August 1964. He took Limited Brands public in 1969, listed as LTD on the NYSE.

A. Alfred Taubman served as a mentor for Wexner, starting in the mid 1960s, and the two partnered on many deals involving Taubman&#x27;s shopping malls.

Wexner expanded The Limited considerably in the 1970s, having opened the 100th store in 1976. He took on significant debt in 1978 to purchase the importer and manufacturer Mast Industries, which provided him with essential business advantages over competitors.

In the 1980s, Wexner doubled his retail holdings by purchasing other companies and became known as a major retail owner at malls in America. Most notably, he acquired the lingerie business Victoria&#x27;s Secret in 1982. Started as an MBA project by Stanford graduate Roy Raymond, Victoria&#x27;s Secret attracted Wexner&#x27;s interest due to the unique, high quality merchandise and Victorian-era decor of the shop that featured red-velvet sofas. Wexner described Raymond as &quot;very guarded&quot;, stating, &quot;When I met him, it was as if he met the devil.&quot; Six months later, when Raymond was facing bankruptcy, he contacted Wexner and offered to sell Victoria&#x27;s Secret. Wexner bought the company for $1 million, and by 1992 it was worth an estimated $1 billion. After Wexner assumed ownership, Victoria&#x27;s Secret became widely known for marketing its items with the use of super models featured in an annual fashion show, overseen by Ed Razek. By 2015, sales were in decline and 2018 was the final year for the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show.

In 1993, Wexner hired Len Schlesinger, a Harvard Business School professor, whom he later appointed as a company director, to advise him.

Over the years, Wexner built L Brands, a retailing and marketing conglomerate that included Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Pink (Victoria&#x27;s Secret for teens), Bath &amp; Body Works, Henri Bendel, The White Barn Candle Company, and La Senza. Previous brands that were spun off include Lane Bryant, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Lerner New York, The Limited Too (now Tween Brands, Inc.), Structure 9, Aura Science, The Limited (which closed its brick-and-mortar stores while retaining its online presence), and Express (which closed its Canadian stores and hundreds of its U.S.-based stores).

In 2012, &quot;CNN Money&quot; described Wexner as the longest serving CEO of a Fortune 500 company. He was on Harvard Business Review’s Top 100 Best Performing CEOs in the World, ranked number 11 in 2015, and number 34 in 2016. In February 2020, Wexner announced that he was transitioning from CEO of L Brands into the role of chairman emeritus.

===Jeffrey Epstein association===
Wexner hired Jeffrey Epstein as his financial manager from 1987 to 2007. He was the primary client of Epstein, who claimed to only work with clients with a net worth of one billion USD or greater. Wexner purchased his New York property, the Herbert N. Straus House, in 1989 and sold it to Epstein in the mid-1990s following Wexner&#x27;s marriage to Abigail. In July 1991, Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney and also instated him as a trustee on the board of the Wexner Foundation.
Wexner has been accused of failing to take action when complaints were raised against Epstein, after executives of L Brands reported in the mid-1990s that Epstein was abusing his power and connection to Wexner by posing as a recruiter for Victoria&#x27;s Secret models. Maria Farmer contacted local and federal authorities about an assault she allegedly endured by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell while working as an artist-in-residence on Wexner&#x27;s Ohio property in 1996. Within a year of Farmer&#x27;s complaint, actress Alicia Arden filed a police report in Los Angeles detailing that Epstein had misrepresented himself as a recruiter for Victoria&#x27;s Secret prior to another alleged assault.

In early 2006, Epstein was charged in Florida with &quot;multiple counts of molestation and unlawful sexual activity with a minor&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 18 months after the charges were filed, Wexner cut his ties with Epstein.

In August 2019, following Epstein&#x27;s second incarceration and prior to his death, Wexner addressed the Wexner Foundation, releasing a written statement that his former financial advisor, Jeffrey Epstein, had &quot;misappropriated vast sums of money&quot; from him and from his family. Wexner retained the services of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton criminal defense attorney and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Mary Jo White.

Wexner faced additional public scrutiny in late 2019 and early 2020, when a group of wrestlers who are survivors of the Ohio State University abuse scandal publicly called on state and federal officials to conduct further inquiry into Maria Farmer&#x27;s allegations of sexual assault at the Wexner property. The wrestlers called for accountability for the Wexner family&#x27;s alleged involvement in Epstein&#x27;s abuse and raised the issue of the continuing influence of Abigail and Leslie Wexner serving as the &quot;biggest and best-known benefactors&quot; of the university.

L Brands shareholders filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 14, 2021, stating that Wexner, among others, created an &quot;entrenched culture of misogyny, bullying and harassment&quot;, and was aware of abuses being committed by Jeffrey Epstein, which breached Wexner&#x27;s fiduciary duty to the company and devalued the brand. The complaint also names Wexner&#x27;s wife, current chair Sarah E. Nash, and former marketing officer Ed Razek, whose &quot;widely known misconduct&quot; was allegedly allowed at the company.

==In the media==
He was profiled in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; in August 1985, where he felt he had a dybbuk, a spirit from Jewish folklore. He said the spirit continually poked him to succeed, and that it looked like himself.

In 2022, Wexner was mentioned in the pop song &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret&quot;, for profiting off women and contributing to their toxic body ideals. When Jax sings that &quot;I know Victoria&#x27;s secret, and girl, you wouldn&#x27;t believe. She&#x27;s an old man who lives in Ohio making money off of girls like me&quot;, she refers to Wexner. 

Wexner&#x27;s relationship with Epstein was one of the subjects of the 2022 Hulu documentary &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret: Angels and Demons&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In 1989, Wexner and his mother Bella were the first to make a $1 million personal donation to the United Way. Both of their names were inscribed in marble and are on display in the lobby of the United Way Headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia.

Wexner was listed by Forbes in 2017, the wealthiest of seven billionaires from Ohio who made the list. He was a major funder of the Wexner Center for the Arts at the Ohio State University, which is named in honor of his father.

Wexner explained that because &quot;growing up, my folks moved around a lot, and I never got a good Jewish education&quot;, he felt unprepared to take leadership roles in the Jewish community. So, in 1985, he joined Rabbi Herbert A. Friedman to establish the Wexner Foundation&#x27;s first core program, aimed &quot;to educate Jewish communal leaders in the history, thought, traditions and contemporary challenges of the Jewish people&quot;.
In 1991, Wexner formed with billionaire Charles Bronfman the Study Group, which is more widely known as the Mega Group. The group was a loosely organized club of some of the country&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential businessmen who were concerned with Jewish issues. Max Fischer, Michael Steinhardt, Leonard Abramson, Edgar Bronfman, and Laurence Tisch were some of the members. The group would meet twice a year for two days of seminars related to the topic of philanthropy and Judaism. In 1998, Steven Spielberg spoke about his personal religious journey. The group, which Wexner co-chaired with Charles Bronfman, went on to inspire a number of philanthropic initiatives such as the Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education, Birthright Israel, and the upgrading of national Hillel.

Wexner served on the Board of Trustees of Ohio State University from 1988 to 1997. In December 2005, Wexner was appointed to his second term and was elected chairman in 2009. It was announced in June 2012 that Wexner&#x27;s chairmanship was to end, eight years before his appointment would have ended.

On May 11, 2004, Wexner received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship at a dinner in Columbus. The award was presented by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

On February 16, 2011, Wexner pledged a donation of $100 million to Ohio State, to be allocated to the university&#x27;s academic Medical Center and James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, with additional gifts to the Wexner Center for the Arts and other areas. This gift is the largest in the university&#x27;s history.

Through the L Brands Foundation, Wexner and L Brands contributed $163.4 million to the Columbus Foundation.

On February 10, 2012, Ohio State University Medical Center officially changed its name to the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University commemorating &quot;Mr. Wexner&#x27;s indelible, lifelong legacy of leadership at Ohio State&quot;, according to university president E. Gordon Gee, during over 30 years of &quot;ardent support&quot; of the institution.

==Personal life==
On January 23, 1993, Wexner married Abigail S. Koppel, an attorney. The couple have four children.

Formerly of the Bexley area, Wexner now lives in New Albany, a community northeast of Columbus. He owns a 30-room, $47 million, Georgian-inspired estate, on nearly , that was built in 1990. The estate was, for 20 years, the location of the Annual New Albany Classic Invitational Grand Prix &amp; Family Day (an equestrian show) benefiting The Center for Family Safety and Healing. In February 2018, Abigail Wexner announced the end of the event, citing the growing number of equestrian competitions.

Wexner has owned the mid-18th century Foxcote House in Warwickshire, England, since 1997.

George W. Bush appointed Wexner to serve in the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.

Wexner was inducted as an honorary member of the 104th Sphinx Senior Class at Ohio State University on May 7, 2010.

On February 10, 2012, the Ohio State University board of trustees voted to rename the Ohio State University Medical Center in honor of Wexner. Now, the medical center is known as the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

==Political activities==
Wexner hosted a fundraiser in 2012 for Mitt Romney and donated $250,000 to Restore Our Future, Romney&#x27;s super PAC. In 2015, Wexner donated $500,000 to the Right to Rise USA super Pac that supported the 2016 presidential campaign of Jeb Bush.

&quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; reported on September 14, 2018, that Wexner had renounced his affiliation with the Republican Party due to changes in its nature. Wexner made his comment shortly after former President Barack Obama gave a speech on the same Columbus Partnership panel that Wexner addressed.

<doc id="233084" wikidata="Q11279562" url="?curid=233084" title="Trainspotting (novel)">
<text>Trainspotting is the first novel by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh, first published in 1993. It is written in either Scots, Scottish English or British English, revolving around various residents of Leith, Edinburgh, who either use heroin, are friends of the core group of heroin users, or engage in destructive activities that are effectively addictions. The novel is set in the late 1980s and has been described by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;the voice of punk, grown up, grown wiser and grown eloquent&quot;. The title is an ironic reference to the characters’ frequenting of the disused Leith Central railway station.

The novel has since achieved a cult status and served as the basis for the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996), directed by Danny Boyle. Two sequels, &quot;Porno&quot;, and &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Trousers&quot; were published in 2002 and 2018 respectively. A prequel, &quot;Skagboys&quot;, was published in 2012.

== Characters ==
* Mark &quot;Rent Boy&quot; Renton – The novel&#x27;s protagonist and most frequent narrator, Renton is the voice of reason among his group of friends, many of whom he dislikes. He narrates his daily life – from supporting his heroin addiction with dole money and petty theft to interacting with the &quot;normal world&quot; – with a cynical approach. He is intelligent and capable of participating in mainstream society, but he is misanthropic and depressed, and uses heroin to give purpose to his life as well as for hedonistic purposes. 
* Simon &quot;Sick Boy&quot; Williamson – A promiscuous, amoral con artist and one of Renton&#x27;s close friends. He is often on the lookout for potential scams and has little respect for the many women he seduces. Sick Boy swears off heroin after the death of the infant Dawn, implied to be his daughter, who asphyxiates while her mother Lesley and Sick Boy are on a heroin binge. 
* Daniel &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy – Naive and childlike, Spud is both the whipping boy and only real source of comfort among Renton&#x27;s circle of friends, who feel protective of him even as they take advantage of him. Spud is kind, sensitive, and loves animals. Spud is sent to Saughton Prison for a section of the novel for petty theft.
* Francis &quot;Franco&quot; Begbie – A violent psychopath and alcoholic, Begbie bullies his &quot;friends&quot; to go along with whatever he says, assaulting or intimidating anyone who challenges him. He expresses intense loyalty to his friends even though he considers junkies beneath him.
* Davie Mitchell – Another Leith native and acquaintance of Renton. Davie is a university graduate and holds down a decent job. His life is thrown into chaos when he contracts HIV. He narrates the chapters &quot;Bad Blood&quot; and &quot;Traditional Sunday Breakfast&quot;.
* Tommy Lawrence MacKenzie – A childhood friend of Renton&#x27;s, Tommy asks Renton for heroin to try after his girlfriend dumps him, which Renton reluctantly provides. Tommy&#x27;s resulting addiction, illness and death weighs heavily on Renton&#x27;s conscience.
* Rab &quot;Second Prize&quot; McLaughlin – A friend of the main group, who is often inebriated and gets into frequent fights while drunk, which he always loses. Second Prize had a promising career as a pro footballer for Manchester United, but he was fired from the team after a few years because of his drinking problem.

==Structure==
The novel is split into seven sections. The first six sections contain multiple chapters from various perspectives; the final section contains one chapter. The novel&#x27;s plot is nonlinear.

Most chapters are narrated in first-person, stream-of-consciousness style in some combination of Scots and Standard English. Some chapters are written from a third-person omniscient stance to convey the actions and thoughts of several characters in a scene.

==Plot summary==

=== Section 1: Kicking ===
While watching a Jean-Claude Van Damme video, Mark and Simon (a.k.a. Sick Boy) decide to go buy heroin from Johnny Swan (also called &quot;Mother Superior&quot;) since they are both feeling symptoms of withdrawal. They cook up with Raymie and Alison. After being informed that he should go and see Kelly, who has just had an abortion, Renton goes home to finish his video instead.

Mark tries to come off heroin by acquiring a bare room and all the things he will require when coming down (canned soup, headache medicine, and pails for vomit). When withdrawal begins to set in, however, he resolves to get another hit to ease the decline. Unable to find any heroin, he acquires opium suppositories which, after a bout of diarrhoea, he must recover from a bookie&#x27;s lavatory. Simon attempts to pick up girls while being annoyed by Mark, who wants to watch videos. Sick Boy eventually loses Renton.

An infant, Dawn, later dies. Her mother Lesley is a heroin addict and acquaintance of the group. The cause of death is unclear; characters speculate that it may have been a cot death or caused by neglect. The Skag Boys are unsure of how to respond. Sick Boy becomes more emotional and distressed than the others and eventually breaks down, stating he is kicking heroin for good. Simon does not explicitly state that he was the child&#x27;s father. Mark wants to comfort his friend, but is unsure how and cooks a shot for himself to deal with the situation. A sobbing Lesley asks him to also cook her up a hit, which Mark does but makes sure he injects himself before her.

After an argument with his girlfriend Carol, Second Prize meets Tommy in a pub, and Tommy confronts a man who is punching his girlfriend. They are shocked to find the woman supports her abusive boyfriend instead of her would-be liberators by digging her nails into Tommy&#x27;s face, inciting a brawl. While the couple slips out unnoticed, Tommy and Second Prize find themselves taking the blame for the whole affair from the pub locals.

Spud and Renton, who have been assigned interviews as part of their job-seeking benefits, deliberately fail to get jobs, while attempting to obscure that it is deliberate.

=== Section 2: Relapsing ===
Renton, Begbie and their girlfriends meet up for a drink before going to a party, but it ends when Begbie throws a glass off a balcony, hitting someone and splitting open their head, setting off a pub brawl.

Tommy visits Renton&#x27;s flat (shortly after Renton relapsed) after being dumped by his girlfriend. Renton reluctantly gives him heroin, setting off Tommy&#x27;s decline into addiction, HIV/AIDS, and later, death.

Later, Renton&#x27;s brother Billy and his friends Lenny, Naz Peasbo, and Jackie are waiting for their friend Granty to arrive for a game of cards, as he is holding the money pot. They later find out that Granty is dead and his girlfriend disappeared with the money, prompting them to beat Jackie, whom they knew to have been sleeping with her.

=== Section 3: Kicking Again ===
Begbie and Lexo pull a crime, so Begbie decides to lie low in London with Renton. 

Spud kicks heroin, and visits his grandmother, where his mixed-race uncle Dode is staying. Dode has had many troubles with racism growing up. One day, he and Spud went to a pub and were assaulted by skinheads. This abuse led to a fight, which left Dode hospitalised, where Spud visits him.

Renton kicks heroin and is restless. He picks up a girl at a nightclub, Dianne, unaware that she is only fourteen. He is later forced to lie to her parents at breakfast the following morning. Despite his guilt and discomfort, he sleeps with Dianne again when she appears at his flat. Spud, Renton and Sick Boy take ecstasy and stroll to the Meadows where Sick Boy and Renton try to kill a squirrel but stop after Spud becomes upset, remembering Dawn. Mark is ashamed and Spud forgives him.

=== Section 4: Blowing It ===
Renton and Spud are in court for stealing books. Renton gets a suspended sentence owing to his attempts at rehabilitation, while Spud is sentenced to ten months in prison. Renton relapses and has to suffer heroin withdrawal at his parents&#x27; house, where he experiences hallucinations of Dawn, the television programme he is watching, and the lecture provided by his father. He is later visited by Sick Boy and goes out to a pub with his parents, whose enthusiasm acts as a veneer for their authoritative treatment.

Renton&#x27;s brother Billy dies in Northern Ireland with the British Army. Renton attends the funeral; there, he almost starts a fight with some of his father&#x27;s Unionist relatives, and ends up having sex with Billy&#x27;s pregnant girlfriend in the toilet.

===Section 5: Exile===
Renton is stranded in London with no place to sleep. He tries to fall asleep in an all-night porno theatre, where he meets Gi, an old homosexual who lets him stay at his flat. Later, Renton, Spud, Begbie, Gav, Alison and others venture out for another drink and something to eat.

===Section 6: Home===
Spud, Begbie, and a teenager engage in a robbery. Spud later comments on Begbie&#x27;s paranoia and how the teenager is likely to get ripped off by the pair. Gav tells Renton the story of how Matty died of toxoplasmosis after attempting to rekindle his relationship with his ex using a kitten.

The group attends Matty&#x27;s funeral. Later, Renton returns to Leith for Christmas and meets Begbie, who beats up an innocent man after having seen his alcoholic father in the disused Leith Central railway station. He visits a former drug dealer, Johnny Swan, who has had his leg amputated as a result of heroin use, and he visits Tommy, who is dying of AIDS.

===Section 7: Exit===
Renton, Sick Boy, Begbie, Spud and Second Prize go to London to engage in a heroin deal and see a Pogues gig. Renton steals the cash and goes to Amsterdam. Renton thinks that he will send Spud his cut, as he is the only &#x27;innocent&#x27; party.

==Stage adaptation==
Soon after publication, the book was adapted for the stage by Harry Gibson. The stage version inspired the subsequent film, and regularly toured the UK in the mid-1990s. This adaptation starred Ewen Bremner and later Tam Dean Burn as Renton.

The US stage premier occurred in San Francisco in 1996. It was produced and shown in the upstairs room (a tiny 50-seat theatre) at the Edinburgh Castle Pub, the small, but legendary literary and arts bar. The play was produced and directed by Alan Black, the head of the Scottish Cultural and Arts Foundation, which was an organization that held Scottish-connected events in San Francisco in the 90s. The play was a huge success. It was twice extended and hundreds of hopeful viewers had to be turned away because of a lack of space in the tiny theater above the pub.

The Los Angeles production won the 2002 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Direction, and the 2002 LA Weekly Theater Award for Direction, for director Roger Mathey.

In 2013, In Your Face Theatre and Seabright Productions staged a new immersive production of Gibson&#x27;s adaptation rebranded as &quot;Trainspotting Live&quot;. Directed by Adam Spreadbury-Maher and Greg Esplin, this production has gone on to sell out at three Edinburgh Festival Fringes and played to critical acclaim in London, on several UK tours and in New York City.

In 2021, the novel was further adapted into a musical.

==Film adaptation==

The film was directed by Danny Boyle, with an adapted screenplay written by John Hodge. It starred Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner. Welsh made a cameo appearance as the drug dealer Mikey Forrester. The film was ranked 10th by the British Film Institute (BFI) in its list of Top 100 British films of all time. It also brought Welsh&#x27;s book to an international cinema audience and added to the phenomenal popularity of the novel. 

== Reception ==
&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was longlisted for the 1993 Booker Prize (and was apparently rejected for the shortlist after &quot;offending the sensibilities of two judges&quot;).

Welsh claimed that the book had sold over one million copies in the UK by 2015, and been translated into thirty languages.

<doc id="233089" wikidata="Q146354" url="?curid=233089" title="Polyvinyl acetate">
<text>Polyvinyl acetate (PVA, PVAc, poly(ethenyl ethanoate)), commonly known as wood glue (a term that may also refer to other types of glues), PVA glue, white glue, carpenter&#x27;s glue, school glue, or Elmer&#x27;s Glue in the US, is a widely available adhesive used for porous materials like wood, paper, and cloth. An aliphatic rubbery synthetic polymer with the formula (C4H6O2)&quot;n&quot;, it belongs to the polyvinyl ester family, with the general formula −[RCOOCHCH2]−. It is a type of thermoplastic.

== Properties ==
The degree of polymerization of polyvinyl acetate is typically 100 to 5000, while its ester groups are sensitive to base hydrolysis and slowly convert PVAc into polyvinyl alcohol and acetic acid.

The glass transition temperature of polyvinyl acetate is between 30 and 45 °C depending on the molecular weight.

PVAc dispersions such as Elmer&#x27;s Glue-All contain polyvinyl alcohol as a protective colloid. In alkaline conditions, boron compounds such as boric acid or borax cause the polyvinyl alcohol to cross-link, forming tackifying precipitates or toys, such as Slime and Flubber.

A number of microorganisms can degrade polyvinyl acetate. Most commonly, damage is caused by filamentous fungi; however, algae, yeasts, lichens, and bacteria can also degrade polyvinyl acetate.

== Discovery ==
Polyvinyl acetate was discovered in Germany in 1912 by Fritz Klatte.

The monomer, vinyl acetate, was first produced on an industrial scale by the addition of acetic acid to acetylene with a mercury(I) salt, but it is now primarily made by palladium-catalyzed oxidative addition of acetic acid to ethylene.

== Preparation ==
PVA is a vinyl polymer. Polyvinyl acetate is prepared by the polymerization of vinyl acetate monomer (free-radical vinyl polymerization of the monomer vinyl acetate).

== Applications ==
As a dispersion in water (usually an emulsion), PVAc preparations are used as adhesives for porous materials, particularly for wood, paper, and cloth, and as a consolidant for porous building stone, in particular sandstone. PVAc is considered a food-safe material, and is thus used often in such applications (e.g., in food packaging material). 

Uses:
* As wood glue, PVAc is known as &quot;white glue&quot; and the yellow as &quot;carpenter&#x27;s glue&quot;.
* As paper adhesive during paper packaging conversion.
* In bookbinding and book arts, due to its flexible strong bond and non-acidic nature (unlike many other polymers). The use of PVAc on the Archimedes Palimpsest during the 20th century greatly hindered the task of disbinding the book and preserving and imaging the pages in the early 21st century, in part because the glue was stronger than the parchment it held together.
* In handicrafts.
* As envelope adhesive.
* As wallpaper adhesive.
* As a primer for drywall and other substrates.
* As a gum base in chewing gum.
* As a water-soluble support material for 3D printing, usually for the fused filament fabrication method.
* As an adhesive for cigarette paper.
* As the coating layer on Gouda cheese.

The stiff homopolymer PVAc, but mostly the softer copolymer, a combination of vinyl acetate and ethylene, vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE), is also used in paper coatings, paint and other industrial coatings, as a binder in nonwovens in glass fibers, sanitary napkins, filter paper and in textile finishing.

Polyvinyl acetate is also the raw material to make other polymers like:
* Polyvinyl alcohol −[HOCHCH2]−: Polyvinyl acetate is partially or completely hydrolysed to give polyvinyl alcohol. This reversible saponification and esterification reaction was a strong hint for Hermann Staudinger in the formulation of his theory of macromolecules.
* Polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP): Polyvinyl acetate is partially hydrolyzed and then esterified with phthalic acid.

<text>Radio control (often abbreviated to RC) is the use of control signals transmitted by radio to remotely operate a device. Examples of simple radio control systems are garage door openers and keyless entry systems for vehicles, in which a small handheld radio transmitter unlocks or opens doors. Radio control is also used for control of model vehicles from a hand-held radio transmitter. Industrial, military, and scientific research organizations make use of radio-controlled vehicles as well. A rapidly growing application is control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) for both civilian and military uses, although these have more sophisticated control systems than traditional applications.

==History==
The idea of controlling unmanned vehicles (for the most part in an attempt to improve the accuracy of torpedoes for military purposes) predates the invention of radio. The latter half of the 1800s saw development of many such devices, connected to an operator by wires, including the first practical application invented by German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1870.
Getting rid of the wires via using a new wireless technology, radio, appeared in the late 1890s. In 1897 British engineer Ernest Wilson and C. J. Evans patented a radio-controlled torpedo or demonstrated radio-controlled boats on the Thames river (accounts of what they did vary). At an 1898 exhibition at Madison Square Garden, Nikola Tesla demonstrated a small boat that used a coherer-based radio control. With an eye towards selling the idea to the US government as a torpedo, Tesla&#x27;s 1898 patent included a clockwork frequency changer so an enemy could not take control of the device.
In 1903, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a radio based control system called the &quot;Telekino&quot; at the Paris Academy of Sciences. In the same year, he applied for several patents in other countries. It was intended as a way of testing Astra-Torres airship, a dirigible of his own design, without risking human lives. Unlike the previous mechanisms, which carried out actions of the &#x27;on/off&#x27; type, Torres established a system for controlling any mechanical or electrical device with different states of operation. This method required a transmitter capable of sending a family of different code words by means of a binary telegraph key signal, and a receiver, which was able to set up a different state of operation in the device being used, depending on the code word. It was able to select different positions for the steering engine and different velocities for the propelling engine independently, and also to act over other mechanisms such an electric light, for switching it, and a flag, for raising or dropping it, at the same time, and so up to 19 different actions. In 1904, Torres chose to carry out the first test on a three-wheeled land vehicle with a range of 20 to 30 meters. In 1906, in the presence of an audience which included King Alfonso XIII of Spain, Torres demonstrated the invention in the Port of Bilbao, guiding the electrically powered launch &quot;Vizcaya&quot; from the shore with people on board, which was controlled at a distance over 2 km.

In 1904, &quot;Bat&quot;, a Windermere steam launch, was controlled using experimental radio control by its inventor, [Jack Kitchen]. In 1909 French inventor [Gabet] demonstrated what he called his &quot;Torpille Radio-Automatique&quot;, a radio-controlled torpedo.

In 1917, Archibald Low, as head of the secret Royal Flying Corps (RFC) experimental works at Feltham, was the first person to use radio control successfully on an aircraft, a 1917 Aerial Target. It was &quot;piloted&quot; from the ground by future world aerial speed record holder Henry Segrave. Low&#x27;s systems encoded the command transmissions as a countermeasure to prevent enemy intervention. By 1918 the secret D.C.B. Section of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Signals School, Portsmouth under the command of Eric Robinson V.C. used a variant of the Aerial Target’s radio control system to control from ‘mother’ aircraft different types of naval vessels including a submarine.
During World War I American inventor John Hays Hammond, Jr. developed many techniques used in subsequent radio control including developing remote controlled torpedoes, ships, anti-jamming systems and even a system allowing his remote-controlled ship targeting an enemy ship&#x27;s searchlights. In 1922 he installed radio control gear on the obsolete US Navy battleship USS &quot;Iowa&quot; so it could be used as a target ship (sunk in gunnery exercise in March 1923).

The Soviet Red Army used remotely controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and fielded at least two teletank battalions at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500–1500 m, the two constituting a &quot;telemechanical group&quot;. There were also remotely controlled cutters and experimental remotely controlled planes in the Red Army.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s World War One development of their radio-controlled 1917 &#x27;Aerial Target&#x27; (AT) and 1918 &#x27;Distant Control Boat&#x27; (DCB) using Low&#x27;s control systems led eventually to their 1930s fleet of &quot;Queen Bee&quot;. This was a remotely controlled unmanned version of the de Havilland &quot;Tiger Moth&quot; aircraft for Navy fleet gunnery firing practice. The &quot;Queen Bee&quot; was superseded by the similarly named &quot;Airspeed Queen Wasp&quot;, a purpose-built target aircraft of higher performance.

==Second World War==
Radio control was further developed during World War II, primarily by the Germans who used it in a number of missile projects. Their main effort was the development of radio-controlled missiles and glide bombs for use against shipping, a target otherwise both difficult and dangerous to attack. However, by the end of the war, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was having similar problems attacking Allied bombers and developed a number of radio command guided surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles, none of which saw service.

The effectiveness of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s systems, primarily comprising the series of Telefunken &quot;Funk-Gerät&quot; (or FuG) 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; twin-axis, single joystick-equipped transmitters mounted in the deploying aircraft, and Telefunken&#x27;s companion FuG 230 &quot;Straßburg&quot; receiver placed in the ordnance to be controlled during deployment and used by both the Fritz X unpowered, armored anti-ship bomb and the powered Henschel Hs 293 guided bomb, was greatly reduced by British efforts to jam their radio signals, eventually with American assistance. After initial successes, the British launched a number of commando raids to collect the missile radio sets. Jammers were then installed on British ships, and the weapons basically &quot;stopped working&quot;. The German development teams then turned to wire-guided missiles once they realized what was going on, but the systems were not ready for deployment until the war had already moved to France.

The German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; operated &quot;FL-Boote&quot; (&quot;ferngelenkte Sprengboote&quot;) which were radio controlled motor boats filled with explosives to attack enemy shipping from 1944.

Both the British and US also developed radio control systems for similar tasks, to avoid the huge anti-aircraft batteries set up around German targets. However, no system proved usable in practice, and the one major US effort, &quot;Operation Aphrodite&quot;, proved to be far more dangerous to its users than to the target. The American Azon guided free-fall ordnance, however, proved useful in both the European and CBI Theaters of World War II.

Radio control systems of this era were generally electromechanical in nature, using small metal &quot;fingers&quot; or &quot;reeds&quot; with different resonant frequencies each of which would operate one of a number of different relays when a particular frequency was received. The relays would in turn then activate various actuators acting on the control surfaces of the missile. The controller&#x27;s radio transmitter would transmit the different frequencies in response to the movements of a control stick; these were typically on/off signals. The radio gear used to control the rudder function on the American-developed Azon guided ordnance, however, was a fully proportional control, with the &quot;ailerons&quot;, solely under the control of an on-board gyroscope, serving merely to keep the ordnance from rolling.

These systems were widely used until the 1960s, when the increasing use of solid state systems greatly simplified radio control. The electromechanical systems using reed relays were replaced by similar electronic ones, and the continued miniaturization of electronics allowed more signals, referred to as &quot;control channels&quot;, to be packed into the same package. While early control systems might have two or three channels using amplitude modulation, modern systems include twenty or more using frequency modulation.

==Radio-controlled models==
The first general use of radio control systems in models started in the early 1950s with single-channel self-built equipment; commercial equipment came later. The advent of transistors greatly reduced the battery requirements, since the current requirements at low voltage were greatly reduced and the high voltage battery was eliminated. In both tube and early transistor sets the model&#x27;s control surfaces were usually operated by an electromagnetic &#x27;escapement&#x27; controlling the stored energy in a rubber-band loop, allowing simple on/off rudder control (right, left, and neutral) and sometimes other functions such as motor speed.

Crystal-controlled superheterodyne receivers with better selectivity and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. Multi-channel developments were of particular use to aircraft, which really needed a minimum of three control dimensions (yaw, pitch and motor speed), as opposed to boats, which required only two or one.

As the electronics revolution took off, single-signal channel circuit design became redundant, and instead radios provided proportionally coded signal streams which a servomechanism could interpret, using pulse-width modulation (PWM).

More recently, high-end hobby systems using pulse-code modulation (PCM) features have come on the market that provide a computerized digital data bit-stream signal to the receiving device, instead of the earlier PWM encoding type. However, even with this coding, loss of transmission during flight has become more common, in part because of the ever more wireless society. Some more modern FM-signal receivers that still use &quot;PWM&quot; encoding instead can, thanks to the use of more advanced computer chips in them, be made to lock onto and use the individual signal characteristics of a particular PWM-type RC transmitter&#x27;s emissions alone, &quot;without&quot; needing a special &quot;code&quot; transmitted along with the control information as PCM encoding has always required.

In the early 21st century, 2.4 gigahertz spread spectrum RC control systems have become increasingly utilized in control of model vehicles and aircraft. Now, these 2.4 GHz systems are being made by most radio manufacturers. These radio systems range in price from a couple thousand dollars, all the way down to under US$30 for some. Some manufacturers even offer conversion kits for older digital 72 MHz or 35 MHz receivers and radios. As the emerging multitude of 2.4 GHz band spread spectrum RC systems usually use a &quot;frequency-agile&quot; mode of operations, like FHSS that do not stay on one set frequency any longer while in use, the older &quot;exclusive use&quot; provisions at model flying sites needed for VHF-band RC control systems&#x27; frequency control, for VHF-band RC systems that only used one set frequency unless serviced to change it, are not as mandatory as before.

==Modern military and aerospace applications==
Remote control military applications are typically not radio control in the direct sense, directly operating flight control surfaces and propulsion power settings, but instead take the form of instructions sent to a completely , computerized automatic pilot. Instead of a &quot;turn left&quot; signal that is applied until the aircraft is flying in the right direction, the system sends a single instruction that says &quot;fly to this point&quot;.

Some of the most outstanding examples of remote radio control of a vehicle are the Mars Exploration Rovers such as Sojourner.

==Industrial radio remote control==
Today radio control is used in industry for such devices as overhead cranes and switchyard locomotives. Radio-controlled teleoperators are used for such purposes as inspections, and special vehicles for disarming of bombs. Some remotely controlled devices are loosely called robots, but are more properly categorized as teleoperators since they do not operate autonomously, but only under control of a human operator.

An industrial radio remote control can either be operated by a person, or by a computer control system in a machine to machine (M2M) mode. For example, an automated warehouse may use a radio-controlled crane that is operated by a computer to retrieve a particular item. Industrial radio controls for some applications, such as lifting machinery, are required to be of a fail-safe design in many jurisdictions.

Industrial remote controls work differently from most consumer products. When the receiver receives the radio signal which the transmitter sent, it checks it so that it is the correct frequency and that any security codes match. Once the verification is complete, the receiver sends an instruction to a relay which is activated. The relay activates a function in the application corresponding to the transmitters button. This could be to engage an electrical directional motor in an overhead crane.
In a receiver there are usually several relays, and in something as complex as an overhead crane, perhaps up to twelve or more relays are required to control all directions. In a receiver which opens a gate, two relays are often sufficient.

Industrial remote controls are getting more and higher safety requirements. For example: a remote control may not lose the safety functionality in case of malfunction. This can be avoided by using redundant relays with forced contacts.

<doc id="233097" wikidata="Q7732627" url="?curid=233097" title="The Eustace Diamonds">
<text>The Eustace Diamonds is a novel by Anthony Trollope, first published between 1871 and 1873 as a serial in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;. It is the third of the &quot;Palliser&quot; series of novels, though the characters of Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Lady Glencora are only in the background.

==Background==
Anthony Trollope wrote &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot; between 4 December 1869 and 25 August 1870. He would later state that in writing the novel he was inspired by the sensation novel genre, particularly the work of Wilkie Collins. The specific point of comparison comes with Collins&#x27; &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), which had been recently published. Both books are tightly plotted, featuring a criminal investigation of the theft of a precious stone.

The novel was serialised in twenty installments of the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, beginning on 1 July 1871 and extending until 1 February 1872. A three-volume edition was published in book form in December 1872. At the time of the novel&#x27;s publication, Trollope was touring Australia.

==Plot summary==
Lizzie Greystock, a fortune-hunter, ensnares the sickly, dissipated Sir Florian Eustace and is soon left a very wealthy widow and mother. While clever and beautiful, Lizzie has several character flaws; the greatest of these is an almost pathological delight in lying, even when it cannot benefit her. (Trollope comments that Lizzie sees lies as &quot;more beautiful than the truth.&quot;) Before he dies, the disillusioned Sir Florian discovers all this, but does not think to change the generous terms of his will.

The diamonds of the book&#x27;s title are a necklace, a family heirloom that Sir Florian gave to Lizzie to wear. Though they belong to her husband&#x27;s estate (and thus eventually will be the property of her son), Lizzie refuses to relinquish them. She lies about the terms under which they were given to her, leaving their ownership unclear. The indignant Eustace family lawyer, Mr Camperdown, strives to retrieve the necklace, putting the Eustaces in an awkward position. On the one hand, the diamonds are valuable and Lizzie may not have a legal claim to them, but on the other, they do not want to antagonise the mother of the heir to the family estate (Lizzie having only a life interest).

Meanwhile, after a respectable period of mourning, Lizzie searches for another husband, a dashing &quot;Corsair&quot; more in keeping with her extravagantly romantic fantasies. She becomes engaged to an honourable, but dull politician, Lord Fawn, but they have a falling out when her character becomes better known, especially her determination to keep the diamonds. She then considers her cousin, Frank Greystock, even though he is already engaged to Lucy Morris, a poor but much beloved governess of the Fawn daughters. Greystock is a successful lawyer and member of parliament, but his income is inadequate to his position and spendthrift lifestyle. Lizzie believes he can shield her from the legal proceedings being initiated by Mr Camperdown. Another more Corsair-like possibility is one of the guests at her Scottish home, the older Lord George de Bruce Carruthers, a man who supports himself in a somewhat mysterious manner.

Among the other guests is a young woman named Lucinda Roanoke, whose financially straitened aunt, Mrs Carbuncle, is desperate to marry her off. Despite Lucinda&#x27;s deep detestation of the brutish Sir Griffin Tewett, the aunt has her way and the mismatched couple become engaged.

Things take a dramatic turn on a trip to London. Lizzie, out of fear of Mr Camperdown, keeps her diamonds with her in a conspicuous strongbox. One night, at an inn, the strongbox is stolen and everybody assumes the jewellery is lost. As it turns out, Lizzie had taken the gems out and put them under her pillow, but acting on her first instincts, she perjures herself when she has to report the theft to the magistrate, thinking that she can sell the diamonds and let the robbers take the blame. Suspicion falls on both Lizzie and Lord George, acting either together or separately. In any case, the thieves, aided by Lizzie&#x27;s disloyal maid, Patience Crabstick, try again and succeed in their second attempt. Lizzie feigns illness and takes to her bed. Lady Glencora Palliser pays Lizzie a visit to offer her sympathy.

The police begin to unravel the mystery, putting Lizzie in a very uncomfortable position. In the end, the diamonds are lost, the police discover the truth, and Lizzie is forced to confess her lies, though she escapes legal retribution since her testimony is needed to convict the criminals. Both Frank Greystock and Lord George become disgusted by her conduct and desert her. Lucinda Roanoke grows to loathe Sir Griffin more and more intensely until, on what would have been the day of their wedding, she loses her sanity. Frank Greystock returns to Fawn Court to marry Lucy Morris. Mr Emilius, a foreign crypto-Jewish clergyman, woos Lizzie while she is in a vulnerable state and succeeds in marrying her (though it is hinted earlier in the book, and is later confirmed in &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;, that he is already married).

==Reception==
The novel was widely popular at the time, with many considering it a return to form after several other commercial failures. Known readers included poet Edward FitzGerald, who, in a letter to a friend, wrote that it &quot;interested [him] almost as much as Tichborne&quot;.

Of all of Trollope&#x27;s &#x27;political&#x27; novels, &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot; can be viewed as the least political, with the plot focusing primarily on the theft of the eponymous diamonds. As such, popular perception of the novel places it somewhat separately from the rest of the Palliser sequence, focusing as it does primarily on a new set of characters.

<text>Anna of the Five Towns is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in 1902 and one of his best-known works.

==Plot background==

The plot centres on Anna Tellwright, daughter of a wealthy but miserly and dictatorial father, living in the Potteries area of Staffordshire, England. Her activities are strictly controlled by the Methodist church. The novel tells of Anna&#x27;s struggle for freedom and independence against her father&#x27;s restraints.

==&quot;The Five Towns&quot;==

In reality, Stoke-on-Trent is an amalgamation (in 1910) of six towns: in order from northwest to southeast, the towns are Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. &quot;The Five Towns&quot; is a name given to it in novels by Arnold Bennett, who was born in Hanley and lived in the district. He said that he believed &quot;Five Towns&quot; was more euphonious than &quot;Six Towns&quot;, so he omitted Fenton (sometimes referred to as &quot;the forgotten town&quot;). He called Stoke &quot;Knype&quot; but used recognisable aliases for the other four towns.

==Plot==

Anna lives with her young step-sister, Agnes, and her twice-widowed father, Ephraim Tellwright, in Bursley. Once an active preacher and teacher in the Methodist movement, her father has become a domestic tyrant and, through his miserly attitude to money, a fairly wealthy man.

On her 21st birthday, Tellwright unceremoniously hands over to Anna an unexpected inheritance from her grandmother: several parcels of shares along with rented residential and industrial property that he has carefully hoarded and re-invested over the years. Anna is now a rich woman but she has no experience in business and financial dealings, save the management of the household expenses her father reluctantly hands her every week.

She visits the rundown ‘building’ (earthenware manufactory) operated by Titus and Willie Price, which she now owns. The Prices’ business is grossly in debt and they claim to be unable to pay the arrears, but manage to give Anna ten pounds. She is also invited to visit the up-to-date and prosperous works of Henry Mynors and is advised by her father to invest in this as a sleeping partner. She is well aware that Mynors, whom she knows through shared church activities, is in love with her but is unsure of her own feelings.

Anna is invited to visit the Isle of Man by Alderman and Mrs Sutton, who see Anna as a suitable friend for their over-indulged daughter, Beatrice. Mynors is also invited. By the end of the visit, Anna and Henry are engaged to be married, but Anna still harbours secret feelings for Willie Price, whom she also knows well from the Methodist movement.

On her return to Bursley, Anna is devastated to learn of the suicide of Titus Price. She blames herself and her father’s squeezing of the Prices’ business but Willie comes to call and explains that the crash of a major customer was the catalyst for his father’s suicide.

It becomes clear that Willie must declare himself bankrupt and the creditors (which include Anna) allow him enough money to emigrate to Australia. Mynors takes the large Price family residence for the marital home, even though it will need much refurbishment. He and Anna agree to marry as soon as possible and make a home for Agnes as well.

Henry discovers a discrepancy in the church accounts and it comes to light that the Prices have been embezzling money in order to prop up their business. Anna and Henry determine to jointly make up the discrepancy so that the Prices will not be blamed. However, the news leaks out and the whole community is soon abuzz.

Anna decides that Willie should not leave Bursley empty-handed and slips a note to him, on condition that he will not read it until he arrives in Melbourne. The note contains a money order (in the book, a &#x27;bank-note&#x27;) for one hundred pounds.

Anna and Henry marry. No more is heard of Willie Price; the story hints that he too kills himself.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for the BBC Home Service&#x27;s Saturday Night Theatre by Olivia Manning in February 1962. In 1985 BBC2 broadcast a four-part serialisation of &quot;Anna of the Five Towns&quot;, starring Lynsey Beauchamp and Peter Davison and adapted by John Harvey. In 2017, to mark Arnold Bennett&#x27;s 150th birthday, a stage version of &quot;Anna&quot; by Deborah McAndrew was put on at the New Vic Theatre in Stoke.

In 2011, Helen Edmundson wrote an adaptation of &quot;Anna of the Five Towns&quot; which was broadcast in two parts on BBC Radio 4.

<doc id="233099" wikidata="Q7754941" url="?curid=233099" title="The Old Wives' Tale">
<text>The Old Wives&#x27; Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in 1908. It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother&#x27;s draper&#x27;s shop, into old age. It covers a period of about 70 years from roughly 1840 to 1905, and is set in Bursley (modeled on Burslem) and Paris. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett&#x27;s finest works. 

Bennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says
and

Bennett also found inspiration in Maupassant&#x27;s novel &quot;Une Vie&quot;.

== Plot details ==
The book is divided into four parts. The first section, &quot;Mrs Baines&quot;, details the adolescence of both Sophia and Constance, and their life in their father&#x27;s shop and house (a combined property). The father is ill and bedridden, and the main adult in their life is Mrs Baines, their mother.

By the end of the first book, Sophia (whose name reflects her sophistication, as opposed to the constant Constance) has eloped with a travelling salesman. Constance meanwhile marries Mr Povey, who works in the shop.

The second part, &quot;Constance&quot;, details the life of Constance from that point forward up until the time she is reunited with her sister in old age. Her life, although outwardly prosaic, is nevertheless filled with personal incident, including the death of her husband, Mr Povey, and her concerns about the character and behaviour of her son.

The third part, &quot;Sophia&quot;, carries forward the story of what happened to Sophia after her elopement. Abandoned by her husband in Paris, Sophia eventually becomes the owner of a successful pension.

The final part, &quot;What Life Is&quot;, details how the two sisters are eventually reunited. Sophia returns to England and the house of her childhood, where Constance still lives.

==Details and legacy==
According to Tom Wolfe (&quot;Hooking Up&quot;, p. 148), the book was &quot;wildly successful,&quot; with the author demurring with &quot;I don&#x27;t read my reviews, I measure them.&quot;

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; No. 87 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

A facsimile edition of the manuscript has been published, which is a testament to Bennett&#x27;s calligraphic skills. The original manuscript is in the Lilly Library, Indiana.

It was adapted into a 1921 film &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; starring Fay Compton. It was made into a TV series by the BBC in 1988 as &quot;Sophia and Constance&quot;.

<doc id="233100" wikidata="Q680879" url="?curid=233100" title="Glide bomb">
<text>A glide bomb or stand-off bomb is a standoff weapon with flight control surfaces to give it a flatter, gliding flight path than that of a conventional bomb without such surfaces. This allows it to be released at a distance from the target rather than right over it, allowing a successful attack without exposing the launching aircraft to anti-aircraft defenses near the target. Glide bombs can accurately deliver warheads in a manner comparable to cruise missiles at a fraction of the cost—sometimes by installing flight control kits on simple unguided bombs—and they are very difficult for surface-to-air missiles to intercept due to their tiny radar signatures and short flight times. The only effective countermeasure in most cases is to shoot down enemy aircraft before they approach within launching range, making glide bombs very potent weapons where wartime exigencies prevent this.

World War II-era glide bombs like the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 pioneered the use of remote control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target as a pioneering form of precision-guided munition. Modern systems are generally self-guided or semi-automated, using GPS or laser designators to hit their target.

The term &quot;glide bombing&quot; does not refer to the use of glide bombs, but a style of shallow-angle dive bombing.

==Early efforts==

===German designs===

====World War I====
In October 1914, Wilhelm von Siemens suggested what became known as the Siemens torpedo glider, a wire-guided flying missile which would essentially have comprised a naval torpedo with an attached airframe. It was not intended to be flown into a target, but rather at a suitable altitude and position, a signal would be transmitted, causing the airframe components to detach from the torpedo which would then enter the water and continue towards its target. Guidance signals were to be transmitted through a thin copper wire, and guide flares were to be carried to help control.

Siemens-Schuckertwerke was already occupied with remote controlled boats (the FL-boats or &quot;Fernlenkboote&quot;), and had some experience in this area. Flight testing was performed under the supervision of an engineer called Dorner from January 1915 onwards, using airships as carriers and different types of biplane and monoplane glider airframes to which a torpedo was fitted. The last test flight was performed on February 8, 1918.

It was planned to use the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII bomber as a carrier craft, but the Armistice stopped the project.

====World War II====

=====Development=====
During World War II, the first operational glide bombs were developed by the Germans as an anti-shipping weapon. Ships are typically very difficult to attack: a direct hit or an extremely near miss is needed to do any serious damage, and hitting a target as small as a ship was difficult in this period. At first dive bombers were used with some success in this role, but their successes were countered by ever-increasing anti-aircraft defenses on the Royal Navy ships they were attacking. By 1941, accurate bombing was as difficult as ever, with the added problem of evading anti-aircraft fire.

The German solution was the development of a number of glide bombs employing radio control guidance. One was created by fitting a control package on the rear of an otherwise standard bomb, starting with their 1400 kg armor-piercing bomb to create the &quot;Ruhrstahl SD 1400&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;Fritz&quot;-X. This weapon was designed specifically to pierce the deck armor of heavy cruisers and battleships. The bomb aimer dropped the bomb from high altitude while the aircraft was still approaching the ship, and guided it to impact with the target by sending commands to spoilers attached to its rear. This proved to be difficult to do, because as the bomb dropped toward the target it fell further behind the launch aircraft, eventually becoming difficult to see. This problem was solved by having the launch aircraft slow down and enter a climb to avoid overtaking the bomb as it fell.

In addition it proved difficult to properly guide the bomb to impact as the angle of descent changed, and if the bomb was not aimed accurately so as to end up roughly right over the target, there was little that could be done at later stages to fix the problem. Nevertheless, the Fritz X proved useful with crews trained on its use. In test drops from , experienced bomb aimers could place half the bombs within a radius and 90% within .

Design work started as early as 1939, and a version of the guidance package mounted to standard 500 kg bombs was tested in September 1940. It was found that the bomb was unable to penetrate a ship&#x27;s armor, so changes were made to fit an armor-piercing warhead before the system finally entered service in 1943. The basic A-1 model was the only one to be produced in any number, but developments included the B model with a custom armor-piercing warhead, and the C model with a conical warhead which was designed to hit the water short of the ship and then travel a short distance underwater to hit the ship below the waterline. The guidance system for the Hs 293 series was the same as the Fritz-X unpowered munition; it used a &quot;Funkgerät&quot; FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; radio control transmitter with a single two-axis joystick in the deploying bomber, and an FuG 230 &quot;Straßburg&quot; receiver in the munition.

=====Operational use=====
Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Germany damaged the Italian battleship &quot;Italia&quot; and sank the &quot;Roma&quot; with Fritz-X bombs. Attacks were also made on the USS &quot;Savannah&quot;, causing much damage and loss of life. HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was hit by three Fritz-X, and although casualties were few, the ship had to be towed to Malta for repairs and was out of action for six months. The cruiser USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was very slightly damaged by several near misses from Fritz-X bombs. The light cruiser HMS &quot;Uganda&quot; was also hit and put out of action for thirteen months as a result.

A more widely employed weapon was the Henschel Hs 293, which included wings and a rocket motor to allow the bomb to glide some distance away from the launch aircraft. This weapon was designed for use against thinly armored but highly defended targets such as convoy merchantmen or their escorting warships. When launched, a small liquid-fueled rocket fired to speed the weapon up and get it out in front of the releasing aircraft, which was flown to approach the target just off to one side. The bomb then dropped close to the water and glided in parallel to the launch aircraft, with the bomb aimer adjusting the flight left or right. As long as the bomb was dropped at roughly the right range so it did not run out of altitude while gliding in, the system was easy to use, at least against slow-moving targets.

The Hs 293 was first used operationally in the Bay of Biscay against RN and RCN destroyers, sloops and frigates. Its combat debut was made on August 25, 1943, when the sloop HMS &quot;Bideford&quot; was slightly damaged by a missile which failed to fully detonate, but killed one crewman. Another sloop, HMS &quot;Landguard&quot;, survived a near miss with slight damage. The Germans attacked again two days later, sinking HMS &quot;Egret&quot; on August 27, 1943; they also seriously damaged HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. Over one-thousand Allied soldiers died on 25 November 1943 when a Hs 293 sank the troopship from Mediterranean convoy KMF 26.

=====Allied countermeasures=====
Several defensive measures were implemented right away. Ships capable of maneuvering at high speed were instructed to make tight turns across the weapon&#x27;s flight path in order to complicate the missile operator&#x27;s efforts. Attacking aircraft were interdicted with air patrols and heavy-caliber anti-aircraft weapons, disrupting either the visual or radio links to the guided weapons. Smoke was used to hide ships at anchor. Allied aircraft also attacked the home bases of the special German units equipped with these weapons, primarily (&quot;Gruppen&quot; II and III of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 100 and &quot;Gruppe&quot; II of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 40).

American, British and Canadian scientists also developed sophisticated radio jammers to disrupt the guidance signal. Ultimately nine different jamming systems were deployed in the European theater against these weapons. While early models proved inadequate, by the time the Allies were preparing for the invasion of France in 1944 more capable systems were deployed, and the success rate of guided weapons declined considerably. Even more important to the defeat of the weapons was Allied command of the airspace and the interception of incoming bombers by Allied fighter aircraft.

The Hs 293 was also used in August 1944 to attack bridges over the Sée and Sélune at the southern end of the Cherbourg peninsula in an attempt to break US general Patton&#x27;s advance, but this mission was unsuccessful. A similar mission against bridges on the river Oder, designed to slow the Soviet advance into Germany, was made in April 1945 but failed.

The Germans also experimented with television guidance systems on the Hs 293D models. The use was problematic – as the bomb approaches the target, even tiny amounts of control input would cause the target to jump around the TV display, so much of the difficulty was in developing control systems that would become progressively less sensitive as the pilot required. A wire-guided version was also developed, but this Hs 293B variant was never deployed.

===UK program===
In 1939 Sir Dennistoun Burney and Nevil Shute Norway, worked together on an air-launched gliding torpedo, the &quot;Toraplane&quot;, and a gliding bomb, &quot;Doravane&quot;. Despite much work and many trials the Toraplane could not be launched with repeatable accuracy and it was abandoned in 1942.

===US designs===
The US Army Air Force started a wide-spanning development program of both glide bombs, known as &quot;GB&quot;, and similar systems designed to fall more vertically, as &quot;VG&quot;. Several models of both concepts were used in limited numbers during WWII.

The first to be used operationally was the Aeronca GB-1, essentially an autopilot attached to a small glider airframe carrying a bomb. It was intended to allow the 8th Air Force bombers to drop their payloads far from their targets and thus avoid having to overfly the most concentrated areas of anti-aircraft artillery fire. It was first used on 28 May 1944 against the Eifeltor marshalling yard in Cologne, but only 42 of 113 bombs released reached anywhere near the target; most &quot;spun in and exploded 15 miles from the target... many of the batteries failed to hold [their] charge&quot;).

More advanced models in the GB series included the television guided GB-4, GB-5, GB-12, and GB-13, which used contrast-seekers for anti-ship use, and the command-guided GB-8, &#x27;Azon&#x27;, &#x27;Razon&#x27;, as well as the infrared-guided &#x27;Felix&#x27;. US Navy glide bombs included the &#x27;Bat&#x27; and its earlier variant, the &#x27;Pelican&#x27;. The longer-range Bat used an active radar seeker and was used in the Pacific on August 13, 1944, but could not distinguish between targets in a cluttered environment and could be easily spoofed by even simple radar countermeasures. Only four examples of an experimental glide bomb, the &#x27;Pratt-Read LBE&#x27;, were produced.

==Post-WWII developments==

After the war, the increasing sophistication of electronics allowed these systems to be developed as practical devices; from the 1960s air forces deployed a number of such systems, including the USAF&#x27;s AGM-62 Walleye. Contrast seekers were also steadily improved, becoming very effective in the widely used AGM-65 Maverick missile. Both were standard systems until the 1980s when the development of laser guidance and GPS based systems made them unnecessary for all but the most accurate of roles. Various TV-based systems remain in limited service for super-accurate uses, but have otherwise been removed.

In the anti-ship role, direct attack from an aircraft even at long range became more dangerous due to the deployment of anti-aircraft missiles on ships. Weapons such as the Bat had ranges too short to keep the attacking aircraft out of range, especially in a force provided with air cover. This was addressed with the introduction of small jet engines that greatly extended the range, producing the anti-shipping missile class that remains widely used today.
Similarly, the need to attack well-defended targets such as airbases and military command posts led to the development of newer generations of glide bombs. European air forces use a glide package with a cluster bomb warhead for remotely attacking airbases. Laser and GPS guidance systems are used.
===Notable glide bombs===

* AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon is an American glide bomb introduced in 1998.
* DRDO Glide Bombs are developed by India. It has a winged (Gaurav) and non-winged (Gautham). These are developed by DRDO and manufactured by Adani Defence &amp; Aerospace.
* GBU-44/B Viper Strike is an American glide bomb.

* Glide bombs adapted from existing unguided bombs such as FAB-500 and FAB-1500 using inexpensive UMPK kits have been used extensively by Russian forces in the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to their low cost and reduced vulnerability to Ukrainian air defenses compared to more sophisticated cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles with longer flight times and more easily detected propulsion systems. Russian forces have been using Su-34 and Su-35 jets to launch glide bombs from within Russian-held territory beyond the range of Ukrainian air defenses. These glide bombs can carry between 250kg and 3 tonnes of explosives for over 60km and have been cited as one of the primary reasons for the Ukrainian retreat from the town of Avdiivka in February 2024 by the Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Syrskyi.
* H-2 SOW, H-4 SOW, Takbir and GIDS REK are glide bombs developed by Pakistan. The H-4 may be a copy or a Pakistani variant of the Denel Raptor II glide bomb.
* HOPE/HOSBO are a family of glide bombs under development by German defence firm Diehl Defence.
* NPO Bazalt subsidiary of Russian company Techmash is developing a glide cluster bomb PBK-500U Drel.
*UMPB D-30SN is a Russian glide bomb introduced in 2024.

<text>The Fortress of Louisbourg () is a tourist attraction as a National Historic Site and the location of a one-quarter partial reconstruction of an 18th-century French fortress at Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Its two sieges, especially that of 1758, were turning points in the Anglo-French struggle for what today is Canada.

The original settlement was founded in 1713 by settlers from Terre-Neuve, and initially called Havre à l&#x27;Anglois. Subsequently, the fishing port grew to become a major commercial port and a strongly defended fortress. The fortifications eventually surrounded the town. The walls were constructed mainly between 1720 and 1740. By the mid-1740s Louisbourg, named for Louis XIV of France, was one of the most extensive (and expensive) European fortifications constructed in North America.

The site was supported by two smaller garrisons on Île Royale located at present-day St. Peter&#x27;s and Englishtown. The Fortress of Louisbourg suffered key weaknesses, since it was erected on low-lying ground commanded by nearby hills and its design was directed mainly toward sea-based assaults, leaving the land-facing defences relatively weak. A third weakness was that it was a long way from France or Quebec, from which reinforcements might be sent. It was captured by British colonists in 1745, and was a major bargaining chip in the negotiations leading to the 1748 treaty ending the War of the Austrian Succession. It was returned to the French in exchange for border towns in what is today Belgium. It was captured again in 1758 by British forces in the Seven Years&#x27; War, after which its fortifications were systematically destroyed by British engineers. The British continued to have a garrison at Louisbourg until 1768 but had abandoned the site by 1785.

The fortress and town were partially reconstructed, in a project that started in 1961 and continued into the 1970s. The head stonemason for this project was Ron Bovaird. This reconstruction work provided jobs for unemployed coal miners, but relied on expropriating an entire community known as West Louisbourg. Additional restoration was completed in 2018–2020 and again in 2022–2023 after Hurricane Fiona. The earlier of the two projects was intended to protect the site from rising water and to restore parts of the fortress.

The Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic site is operated by Parks Canada as a living history museum. The site stands as the largest reconstruction project in North America.

==History==

French settlement on Île Royale (now Cape Breton Island) can be traced to the early 17th century following settlements in Acadia that were concentrated on &quot;Baie Française&quot; (now the Bay of Fundy) such as at Port-Royal and other locations in present-day peninsular Nova Scotia.
A French settlement at Sainte Anne (now Englishtown) on the central east coast of Île Royale was established in 1629 and named Fort Sainte Anne, lasting until 1641. A fur trading post was established on the site from 1651 to 1659, but Île Royale languished under French rule as attention was focused on the St. Lawrence River/Great Lakes colony of Canada (which then comprised parts of what is now Quebec, Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois), Louisiana (which encompassed the current Mississippi Valley states and part of Texas), and the small agricultural settlements of mainland Acadia.

The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 gave Britain control of part of Acadia (peninsular Nova Scotia) and Newfoundland; however, France maintained control of its colonies at Île Royale, Île Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward Island), Canada and Louisiana, with Île Royale being France&#x27;s only territory directly on the Atlantic seaboard (which was controlled by Britain from Newfoundland to present-day South Carolina) and it was strategically close to important fishing grounds on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, as well as being well placed for protecting the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

In 1713, France set about constructing Port Dauphin and a limited naval support base at the former site of Fort Sainte-Anne; however, the winter icing conditions of the harbour led the French to choose another harbour on the southeastern part of Île Royale. The harbour, being ice-free and well protected, soon became a winter port for French naval forces on the Atlantic seaboard and they named it Havre Louisbourg after King Louis XIV.

===First siege===

British forces besieged Louisbourg in 1745. The British captured the fortress, but returned it to the French at the end of the War of Austrian Succession.
The Fortress was besieged in 1745 by a New England force backed by a Royal Navy squadron. The New England attackers succeeded when the fortress capitulated on June 16, 1745. A major expedition by the French to recapture the fortress led by Jean-Baptiste de La Rochefoucauld de Roye, duc d&#x27;Anville, the following year was destroyed by storms, disease and British naval attacks before it ever reached the fortress.

===Louisbourg returned===

In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of the Austrian Succession, restored Louisbourg to France in return for territory gained in the Austrian Netherlands and the British trading post at Madras in India. Maurepas, the ministre de la marine, was determined to have it back. He regarded the fortified harbour as essential to maintaining French dominance in the fisheries of the area. The disgust of the French in this transaction was matched by that of the English colonists.

The New England forces left, taking with them the famous Louisbourg Cross, which had hung in the fortress chapel. This cross was rediscovered in the Harvard University archives only in the latter half of the 20th century; it is now on long-term loan to the Louisbourg historic site.Having given up Louisbourg, Britain in 1749 created its own fortified town on Chebucto Bay which they named Halifax. It soon became the largest Royal Navy base on the Atlantic coast and hosted large numbers of British army regulars. The 29th Regiment of Foot was stationed there; they cleared the land for the port and settlement.
===Second siege===
Britain&#x27;s American colonies were expanding into areas claimed by France by the 1750s, and the efforts of French forces and their First Nation allies to seal off the westward passes and approaches through which American colonists could move west soon led to the skirmishes that developed into the French and Indian War in 1754. The conflict widened into the larger Seven Years&#x27; War by 1756, which involved all of the major European powers.

A large-scale French naval deployment in 1757 fended off an attempted assault by the British in 1757. However, inadequate naval support the following year allowed a large British combined operation led by Jeffrey Amherst to land for the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg which ended after a siege of six weeks on 26 July 1758, with a French surrender. The fortress was used by the British as a launching point for its 1759 Siege of Quebec that culminated in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

===20th century===
The site of the fortress was designated a National Historic Site in 1920. In 1961, the government of Canada decided to undertake a historical reconstruction of one-fifth of the town and fortifications with the aim being to recreate Louisbourg as it would have been at its height in 1744. The $26 million project required an interdisciplinary effort by archeologists, historians, engineers, and architects. Some craftsmen came from other countries but most of the reconstruction work was completed by locals, including unemployed coal miners from the industrial Cape Breton area. Over the years, they constructed some 60 buildings and two bastions. Many of the workers learned 18th century French masonry techniques and other skills to create an accurate replica.

Dozens of researchers worked on the project over a span of five decades. They included British-born archeologists Bruce W. Fry and Charles Lindsay; and Canadian historians B. A. Balcom, Kenneth Donovan, Brenda Dunn, John Fortier, Margaret Fortier, Allan Greer, A.J.B. Johnston, Eric Krause, Anne Marie Lane Jonah, T.D. MacLean, Christopher Moore, Robert J. Morgan, Christian Pouyez, Gilles Proulx and many more. Among the architects, Yvon LeBlanc, one of the first Acadian architects, was responsible for most of the town-site buildings, with input from researchers who contributed to various committees. According to one source, accuracy was assured by a review of &quot;750,000 pages of documents and 500 maps and plans have been copied from archives in France, England, Scotland, the United States and Canada&quot;.
Today, the entire site of the fortress, including the one-fifth reconstruction, is the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site of Canada, operated by Parks Canada. Offerings include guided and unguided tours, and the demonstration and explanation of period weapons, including muskets and a cannon, by enactors wearing period clothing. Children&#x27;s programming includes puppet shows. The Museum / Caretakers Residence (built ) within the site is a Classified Federal Heritage Building. The fortress also greatly aided the local economy of the town of Louisbourg, as it struggled to diversify economically with the decline of the North Atlantic fishery and the decline of coal mining.

On 5 May 1995, Canada Post issued the &#x27;Fortress of Louisbourg&#x27; series to mark the 275th anniversary of the official founding of the fortress, the 250th anniversary of the siege by the New Englanders, the 100th anniversary of the commemoration by the Society of Colonial Wars, and the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway (S &amp; L). The Fortress of Louisbourg series includes: &#x27;The Harbour and Dauphin Gate&#x27;, &#x27;18th Century Louisbourg&#x27;; &#x27;The King&#x27;s Bastion&#x27;; &#x27;The King&#x27;s Garden, Convent, Hospital, and British Barracks&#x27; and &#x27;The Fortifications and Ruins Fronting the Sea and Rochfort Point&#x27;. The 43¢ stamps were designed by Rolf P. Harder.

The museum that operates from the Fortress is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

==Fortified town==
The Fortress of Louisbourg was the capital for the colony of Île-Royale, and was located on the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island near its southeastern point. The location for the fortress was chosen because it was easy to defend against British ships attempting to either block or attack the St. Lawrence River, at the time the only way to get goods to Canada and its cities of Quebec and Montreal. South of the fort, a reef provided a natural barrier, while a large island provided a good location for a battery. These defences forced British ships to enter the harbour via a channel. The fort was built to protect and provide a base for France&#x27;s lucrative North American fishery and to protect Quebec City from British invasions. For this reason, it has been given the nicknames ‘Gibraltar of the North’ or the ‘Dunkirk of America.’ The fort was also built to protect France&#x27;s hold on one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, the Grand Banks. One hundred and sixteen men, ten women, and twenty-three children originally settled in Louisbourg.

===Population===

The population of Louisbourg quickly grew. In 1719, 823 people called this maritime city their home. Seven years later, in 1726, the population was 1,296, in 1734 it was 1,616, and by 1752, the population of Louisbourg was 4,174. Of course, population growth did not come without consequences. Smallpox ravaged the population in 1731 and 1732, but Louisbourg continued to grow, especially economically.
===Economy===

Louisbourg was a large enough city to have a commercial district, a residential district, military arenas, marketplaces, inns, taverns and suburbs, as well as skilled labourers to fill all of these establishments. For the French, it was the second most important stronghold and commercial city in New France. Only Quebec was more important to France.

Unlike most other cities in New France, Louisbourg did not rely on agriculture or the seigneurial system. Louisbourg itself was a popular port and was the third busiest port in North America (after Boston and Philadelphia.) It was also popular for its exporting of fish, and other products made from fish, such as cod liver oil. The North Atlantic fishing trade employed over ten thousand people, and Louisbourg was seen as the ‘nursery for seamen.’ Louisbourg was an important investment for the French government because it gave them a strong commercial and military foothold in the Grand Banks. For France, the fishing industry was more lucrative than the fur trade. In 1731, Louisbourg fishermen exported 167,000 quintals of cod and 1600 barrels of cod-liver oil. There were roughly 400 shallop-fishing vessels out each day vying for the majority of the days catch. Also, 60 to 70 ocean-going schooners would head out from Louisbourg to catch fish further down the coast. Louisbourg&#x27;s commercial success was able to bring ships from Europe, The West Indies, Quebec, Acadia, and New England.

===Fortifications===

Louisbourg was also known for its fortifications, which took the original French builders 28 years to complete. The first engineer behind the project was Jean-Francois du Vergery de Verville. Verville picked Louisbourg as his location because of its natural barriers. The engineering work was continued by Etienne Verrier and finally, by Louis Franquet; the latter was the &quot;highest ranking engineering officer in North America&quot;.

The fort itself cost France 30 million French livres, which prompted King Louis XV to joke that he should be able to see the peaks of the buildings from his Palace in Versaille. The original budget for the fort was four million livres. Two and a half miles of wall surrounded the entire fort. On the western side of the fort, the walls were high, and across, protected by a wide ditch and ramparts.

The site had four gates that led into the city. The Dauphin Gate, which is currently reconstructed, was the busiest, leading to the extensive fishing compounds around the harbour and to the main road leading inland. The Frederick Gate, also reconstructed, was the waterfront entrance. The Maurepas Gate, facing the narrows, connected the fishing establishments, dwellings and cemeteries on Rocheford Point and was elaborately decorated as it was very visible to arriving ships. The Queen&#x27;s Gate on the sparsely populated seaward side saw little use. Louisbourg was also home to six bastions, two of which have been reconstructed: the Dauphin bastion, commonly referred to as a &#x27;demi-bastion&#x27; because of its modification; the King&#x27;s bastion; the Queen&#x27;s bastion; the Princess bastion; the Maurepas bastion; and the Brouillon bastion. On the eastern side of the fort, 15 guns pointed out to the harbour. The wall on this side was only high and across. 

Louisbourg was one of the &quot;largest military garrisons in all of New France&quot;, and many battles were fought and lives lost here because of it. The fort had the embrasures to mount 148 guns; however, historians have estimated that only 100 embrasures had cannons mounted. Disconnected from the main fort, yet still a part of Louisbourg, a small island in the harbour entrance was also fortified. The walls on the Island Battery were high, and thick. Thirty-one 24-pound guns were mounted facing the harbour. The island itself was small, with room for only a few small ships to dock there. An even larger fortified battery, the Royal Battery, was located across the harbour from the town and mounted 40 guns to protect the harbour entrance.

===Important structures===

During the 1700s, Louisbourg boasted the finest hospital in North America and the second-largest building in the fort town. The hospital had a tall spire that would rival that of the King&#x27;s bastion and was run by the Brothers of Saint-Jean-de-Dieu. By 1744, the hospital was well equipped for surgery and other medical care by the staff of six Brothers who had access to 40 medicines. It contained 100 beds and buildings that housed a &quot;bakery, kitchen, laundry, well and stables, plus housing for black slaves&quot;. 
Although most of the population was Roman Catholic during French control of the site, the Church was not powerful or wealthy. The Military Chapel was staffed by Recollets (missionaries) and everyone was welcome to attend the services. This structure is among those that have been fully restored.

===Demolition===
The French soldiers and inhabitants were expelled back to France after the British capture in 1758. The fortifications and town at Louisbourg were systematically destroyed by British engineers beginning in 1760 to prevent the town and port from being used in the future by the French, should the peace process return Cape Breton island to France, or by anyone else. Demolition by British engineers took six years. The British kept a garrison at Louisbourg until 1768. Some of the cut-stones from Louisbourg were shipped to Halifax to be re-used and, in the 1780s, to Sydney, Nova Scotia. During the reconstruction of Fortress Louisbourg, more than one million artifacts were uncovered by archaeologists.

==Climate==
Louisbourg experiences a marine influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;).
Looking at weather data from Louisbourg, NS, we can see the follow average high and low temperatures for the 2020/2021 winter:
* December 2020- (Avg High:5.7/Avg Low: −0.9)---&gt;Daily Avg: 2.4
* January 2020- (Avg High:2.0/Avg Low: −4.2)---&gt;Daily Avg: −1.1
* February 2020- (Avg High:1.1/Avg Low: −6.4)---&gt;Daily Avg: −2.65

The above suggests that if climate data for 2021-2050 would match these averages or exceed them, areas like Louisbourg, NS could be considered to have an oceanic climate rather than a continental climate since it would meet the Köppen climate classification using the −3 isotherm. This would make sense given that most of the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia is predicted to transition to a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) for 2071-2100 climate normals.

<doc id="233102" wikidata="Q1073476" url="?curid=233102" title="Northern Expedition">
<text>The Northern Expedition was a military campaign launched by the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Kuomintang (KMT) against the Beiyang government and other regional warlords in 1926. The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China, which had become fragmented in the aftermath of the 1911 Revolution. The expedition was led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and was divided into two phases. The first phase ended in a 1927 political split between two factions of the KMT: the right-leaning Nanjing faction, led by Chiang, and the left-leaning faction in Wuhan, led by Wang Jingwei. The split was partially motivated by Chiang&#x27;s Shanghai Massacre of Communists within the KMT, which marked the end of the First United Front. In an effort to mend this schism, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as the commander of the NRA in August 1927, and went into exile in Japan.

The second phase of the Expedition began in January 1928, when Chiang resumed command. By April 1928, the nationalist forces had advanced to the Yellow River. With the assistance of allied warlords, including Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, nationalist forces secured a series of decisive victories against the Beiyang Army. As they approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin, leader of the Manchuria-based Fengtian clique, was forced to flee, and was assassinated shortly thereafter by the Japanese. His son, Zhang Xueliang, took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique, and in December 1928, announced that Manchuria would accept the authority of the nationalist government in Nanjing. With the final piece of China under KMT control, the Northern Expedition concluded successfully and China was reunified, heralding the start of the Nanjing decade.

== Prelude ==
In the 1920s, the Beiyang government based in Beijing was internationally recognised as the legitimate Chinese government. Much of the country, however, was not under its control, being ruled by a patchwork of warlords. The Kuomintang (KMT), based in Guangzhou (Canton), aspired to be the party of national liberation. Since the conclusion of the Constitutional Protection Movement in 1922, the KMT had been bolstering its ranks to prepare for an expedition against the northern warlords in Beijing, with the goal of reunifying China. This preparation involved improving both the political and military strength of the KMT. Before his death in March 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China and co-founder of the KMT, was supportive of Sino-Soviet co-operation, which had involved forming the First United Front with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The military arm of the KMT was the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). Chiang Kai-shek, who had emerged as Sun&#x27;s protégé as early as 1922, was appointed commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924, and quickly emerged as a contender for the position of Sun&#x27;s successor in the aftermath of his death.

On 30 May 1925, Chinese students in Shanghai gathered at the International Settlement, and held demonstrations in opposition to foreign interference in China. Specifically, with the support of the KMT, they called for the boycott of foreign goods and an end to the Settlement, which was governed by the British and Americans. The Shanghai Municipal Police, largely operated by the British, opened fire on the crowd of demonstrators. This incident sparked outrage throughout China, culminating in the Canton–Hong Kong strike, which began on 18 June, and proved a fertile recruiting ground for the CCP. Concerns about the rising power of the leftist faction, and the effect of the strike on the Guangzhou government&#x27;s ability to raise funds, which was largely dependent on foreign trade, led to increasing tensions within the United Front. Amidst this backdrop, Chiang, who had been vying for the position of KMT leader, began to consolidate power in preparation for an expedition against the northern warlords. On 20 March 1926, he launched a bloodless purge of hardline communists who were opposed to the proposed expedition from the Guangzhou administration and its military, known as the Canton Coup. At the same time, Chiang made conciliatory moves toward the Soviet Union, and attempted to balance the need for Soviet and CCP assistance in the fight against the warlords with his concerns about growing communist influence within the KMT. In the aftermath of the coup, Chiang negotiated a compromise whereby hardline members of the rightist faction, such as Wu Tiecheng, were removed from their posts in compensation for the purged leftists. By doing so, Chiang was able to prove his usefulness to the CCP and their Soviet sponsor, Joseph Stalin. Soviet aid to the KMT government would continue, as would co-operation with the CCP. A fragile coalition between KMT rightists, centrists led by Chiang, KMT leftists, and the CCP managed to hold together, laying the groundwork for the Northern Expedition.

In 1926, there were three major coalitions of warlords across China that were hostile to the KMT government in Guangzhou. The forces of Wu Peifu occupied northern Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces. The coalition of Sun Chuanfang was in control of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces. The most powerful coalition, led by Zhang Zuolin, then head of the Beiyang government and the Fengtian clique, was in control of Manchuria, Shandong, and Zhili. To face the Northern Expedition, Zhang Zuolin eventually assembled the &quot;National Pacification Army&quot; (; NPA), an alliance of the warlords of northern China.

== First phase (July 1926–April 1927) ==
===Against Wu Peifu (July–September 1926)===
Amidst heavy fighting along the border between KMT-held territory and that of the recently allied forces of the Fengtian and Zhili cliques, the nationalist government appointed Chiang Kai-shek commander-in-chief of the NRA on 5 June 1926. Chiang would accept this post in a ceremony on 9 July, which marked the formal start of the Northern Expedition, although military clashes had already been ongoing. The initial strategy for the KMT&#x27;s northern advance against the Zhili warlords, which was largely devised by Soviet advisors Mikhail Borodin and Vasily Blyukher, was to focus on defeating Wu Peifu and appeasing Sun Chuanfang, while ignoring Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian clique. Having switched from a defensive to offensive posture, KMT forces quickly advanced from their base in Guangdong into Wu-controlled Hunan province, capturing Changsha on 11 July. At the time, most of Wu Peifu&#x27;s forces were preoccupied with fighting at Nankou Pass, near Beijing, against the &quot;Guominjun&quot;, a breakaway Zhili faction sympathetic to the KMT. Sun Chuanfang, who the KMT had avoided antagonising, did not intervene as KMT troops advanced further into Wu&#x27;s territory. Whilst the Fengtian clique had offered its support to Wu, he refused their aid, fearing that the northern warlords would undermine his position if he allowed their troops into his territory. At a military conference held in Changsha on 11–12 August, the KMT decided to launch a direct assault on Wu&#x27;s stronghold of Wuchang, bypassing Sun&#x27;s Nanchang. In this manner, they would follow the route taken by the Taiping Rebellion in the 19th century. In an address to his generals at the same conference, Chiang proclaimed: 


With the capture of the Yangtze port of Yuezhou on 22 August, Hunan came under complete KMT control, paving the way for an advance to Wuchang along the route of the Beijing–Guangzhou railway. As Wu Peifu&#x27;s forces retreated northward, they breached several Yangtze dikes, slowing the KMT push. By 28 August, the KMT, led by Li Zongren and his Guangxi NRA Seventh Army, had taken Xianning, about south of Wuchang. Wu Peifu, who had returned south to mount a defence of Wuchang, gathered his forces at Heshengqiao Bridge. On 29 August, he launched a counterattack against KMT forces to the south, compromising his defensive line, and by noon the next day, his forces were in general retreat toward Wuchang. In this short period of time, Wu lost 8,000 troops. At least 5,000 of these were taken prisoner, along with their rifles, providing a boost to KMT forces. By 2 September, the NRA had nearly surrounded Wuchang. Whilst Wu and most of his army fled north to Henan province, his remaining troops in the walled city held out for over a month. His failure in the face of the NRA, however, left his hold on power and reputation broken. What remained of his army would disintegrate in the following months.

===Against Sun Chuanfang (September 1926–February 1927)===
With Wu Peifu&#x27;s forces in retreat, the NRA directed itself toward Sun Chuanfang-controlled Jiangxi province, namely the city of Jiujiang and the provincial capital, Nanchang. Whilst Sun had been offered a non-aggression pact by the Guangzhou government, he was not willing to subordinate his administration to KMT rule. Consequently, whilst the siege in Wuchang was still ongoing, Chiang Kai-shek launched an attack across the Jiangxi border on 4 September. By 19 September, both Jiujiang and Nanchang had come under KMT control, hastened by the defection of Lai Shih-huang, one of Sun&#x27;s generals. Despite these successes, the NRA offensive was forced into retreat as Sun arrived from Nanjing with reinforcements on 21 September. Sun retook most of the territory he had lost, brutally reasserting his authority by killing hundreds of students, teachers, and suspected members of the KMT, whose severed heads he displayed on spikes in public places.

With the Northern Expedition&#x27;s advance halted, Chiang wired the government in Guangzhou, demanding an end to the still ongoing Canton–Hong Kong strike, which continued to hamper his supply chain. Negotiations with the British began on 23 September, with the strike finally called off on 10 October. This eased access to supplies for the NRA, and freed up manpower, in the form of the strikers, for the continued push north. On the same day, Wu Peifu&#x27;s remaining forces at Wuchang surrendered, completing the NRA&#x27;s conquest of Hubei province. As bloody fighting continued in Jiangxi, the civil governor of Zhejiang province, Xia Chao, one of Sun&#x27;s subordinates, defected to the KMT government in Guangzhou. Zhejiang inhabitants had become increasingly dissatisfied with the rule of Sun, who was foreign to the province, and on 16 October, Xia declared its independence. Chiang Kai-shek, a native of Zhejiang, was able to convince Xia to side with the KMT. Following his defection, Xia launched an attack on Sun-controlled Shanghai, but was almost immediately forced to withdraw back to Zhejiang; Sun had detected Xia&#x27;s plans days earlier. Sun&#x27;s forces subsequently marched on Zhejiang, crushing the rebellion by 23 October. Xia was executed, along with hundreds of his troops, while thousands of civilians were massacred at Xia&#x27;s former headquarters.

Alongside the Zhejiang rebellion, the NRA had continued their offensive in Jiangxi. Adding to the pressure on Sun, the Shantou-based NRA First Army, led by He Yingqin, marched across the Guangdong border, and began a new offensive into Fujian province. NRA troops were welcomed by many locals, including the Hakka, who resented foreign control, and gradually began to infiltrate the Fujian countryside. He&#x27;s forces moved up the coast, pushing toward the provincial capital, Fuzhou. By the end of October, Sun&#x27;s forces were again in retreat across Jiangxi and Fujian. In early November, KMT troops moved to capture the Yangtze ports of Jiujiang and Hukou, and by 9 November, retook control of Nanchang. Sun&#x27;s forces abandoned substantial materiel as they retreated, bolstering the poorly-armed NRA, which suffered 20,000 casualties in the final push on Nanchang alone. Concurrently, Sun himself had left for Tianjin with the aim of seeking aid from the powerful Fengtian clique. Shandong warlord Zhang Zongchang and Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin offered assistance, agreeing that it was necessary to contain the NRA, though they demanded payment in return for their help. As the NRA offensive carved its way through Fujian, 60,000 troops from Shandong arrived in Sun-controlled Anhui province on 24 November. These were organised into the &quot;National Pacification Army&quot; (NPA) on 1 December. Zhang Zuolin took the position of commander-in-chief, with Zhang Zongchang and Sun Chuanfang as deputy commanders.

This alliance was hugely unpopular with locals in the regions under Sun&#x27;s control, with Zhang Zhongchang&#x27;s northern troops viewed as invaders. The Zhejiang autonomy movement continued, and a meeting of influential provincial figures, nominally loyal to Sun, was held in Shanghai on 8 December. In Fujian, many of Sun&#x27;s troops had already defected to the NRA, and on 9 December, He Yingqin&#x27;s army entered Fuzhou unopposed. On 11 December, Zhejiang commander Zhou Fengqi announced his defection to the NRA. This started a cascade of defections, leading to Zhejiang&#x27;s secession from Sun&#x27;s &quot;United Provinces&quot;, after which it was given autonomous status by the Guangzhou government. In response, Sun rallied his army on the Zhejiang border, with the NPA protecting his rear, and charged into Zhejiang, retaking most of the province. By 10 January, the majority of the Zhejiang rebel forces had retreated to Quzhou. To relieve the besieged rebels, He Yingqin pushed his Fujian-based forces into Zhejiang, halting Sun&#x27;s advance. The rebel and KMT forces merged under the command of Bai Chongxi, who launched a counteroffensive on 20 January. By 29 January, the offensive had reached Lanxi and Jinhua, where a fierce battle resulted in a catastrophic defeat for Sun&#x27;s forces. Following this victory, the NRA launched a pincer attack on the provincial capital Hangzhou. Many of Sun&#x27;s northern troops, demoralised by defeat, broke ranks and streamed north, looting the towns and villages they passed along the way. With his forces in disarray, Sun&#x27;s commander in the area, Meng Chao-yueh, decided on 17 February to abandon Hangzhou and flee with his 20,000 troops by train to Jiangsu province. By 23 February, Zhejiang was under complete KMT control. In six months, the nationalists had expanded their control to seven provinces, inhabited by a population of about 170 million people. Aided by the defection of numerous warlords and their armies, by this point, the NRA had bolstered its ranks to 700,000.

===Shanghai–Nanjing offensive (February–April 1927)===

Sun Chuanfang retreated to Nanjing in the aftermath of these setbacks. The Fengtian clique responded to Sun&#x27;s plea for help by reinforcing Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, while increasing the number of troops in Henan in support of Wu Peifu. Two major Fengtian formations, the Shandong Army of Zhang Zongchang and the Zhili Army of Chu Yupu, crossed the Yangtze River in February 1927 to help Sun defend Nanjing and Shanghai. Following their victory in Zhejiang, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the launch of an offensive on those two cities. The Hangzhou-based eastern NRA, led by Bai Chongxi and He Yingqin, launched a two-pronged attack in mid-March. Bai&#x27;s forces advanced toward Shanghai, whilst He&#x27;s forces moved toward Changzhou, with the goal of severing Sun&#x27;s lifeline, the Shanghai–Nanjing railway. Meanwhile, Cheng Qian&#x27;s central NRA advanced toward Nanjing through Anhui province, its path opened by the defection of Sun&#x27;s forces there. The remnants of Sun&#x27;s forces, supported by the Shandong Army, were forced to withdraw to Shanghai proper in the face of Bai&#x27;s army. He&#x27;s forces quickly severed the railway link with Shanghai, while Sun was confronted with the defection of his navy, and a communist general strike in Shanghai. Intense fighting took place at Songjiang, just outside the city, but on 22 March, Bai&#x27;s forces marched into Shanghai victorious. The Fengtian support operation had proven to be a &quot;costly operational disaster&quot; for the northern warlords, whose armies had suffered heavy casualties, forcing them to retreat north across the Yangtze. Meanwhile, the strike continued until 24 March, when Bai ordered its end. The general disorder caused by the strike is said to have resulted in the deaths of 322 people, with 2,000 wounded, contributing to KMT feelings of unease with its wayward communist allies.

With Shanghai under their control, the NRA turned its attention to Nanjing. He Yingqin advanced from the south-east, whilst Cheng Qian came from the south-west. Zhang Zongchang ordered his Shandong Army to withdraw from Nanjing on 23 March, leaving the city undefended. Cheng arrived the next day, entering the city with no resistance. Almost immediately after arrival of the NRA, mass anti-foreigner riots broke out in the city, in an event that came to be known as the Nanjing Incident. British and American naval forces were sent to evacuate their respective citizens, resulting in a naval bombardment that left the city burning and at least forty people dead. He&#x27;s forces arrived on 25 March, and on the next day, Cheng and He were finally able to put an end to the violence.

Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s faction accused Lin Boqu of planning the unrest, viewing it as an attempt to turn international opinion against the KMT. Lin, a member of both the CCP and the KMT, had been serving as political commissar of the Sixth Army, part of Cheng Qian&#x27;s forces. Whoever was responsible, the Nanjing Incident represented the culmination of tensions within the First United Front. The nationalist government had moved from Guangzhou to the new city of Wuhan, which was formed from a merger of Wuchang and two other nearby cities. The Wuhan administration gradually drifted away from Chiang, becoming a centre of leftist, Soviet-backed power within the KMT and constraining his authority. Communist-led trade unions staged near-constant demonstrations in Wuhan itself, and across the nominally KMT-controlled territories, establishing parallel structures of administration in areas liberated by the NRA.

In the final success of the first phase of the expedition, the NRA went on to capture the Anhui provincial capital of Hefei and the smaller city of Bengbu. NRA forces that had already been operating north of the Yangtze continued into northern Jiangsu province. Their advance, however, was hampered by the administrative chaos that followed the Nanjing Incident. Tensions between the leftists in Wuhan and rightists in Nanjing would come to a head, bringing the Northern Expedition to a halt. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the Shanghai–Nanjing offensive, the aid of the Fengtian armies prevented Sun Chuanfang&#x27;s army from collapsing completely, and they eventually managed to regroup and strengthen their forces for the next phase of the conflict. Launching a counteroffensive on 3 April, the NPA had been able to force the NRA back more than to the Yangtze by 11 April.

== Anti-communist purge and second phase (April 1927–June 1928) ==
=== Internal conflict among the nationalists (April–August 1927) ===
As part of the First United Front, many members of the Chinese Communist Party had joined the KMT, and they exerted significant influence over its left-wing faction. Mikhail Borodin, the official liaison between the KMT and the Soviet government in Moscow, had spent years cultivating this alliance, while covertly encouraging CCP expansion. This Soviet-backed leftist wing of the KMT came to dominate the nationalist government in Wuhan, which increasingly directed its ire at NRA commander-in-chief Chiang Kai-shek. On 1 April, the Wuhan government, advised by Borodin, issued edicts stripping Chiang of his authority in foreign affairs, financial matters, and communications, and ordered that he leave his command post in Shanghai and go to the front. These orders had no effect, as Wuhan had almost no military authority. The government intended to send a small force to Nanjing with the aim of &quot;disarming&quot; Chiang, but put that plan on hold following Wang Jingwei&#x27;s return from exile in Europe. Wang, who had travelled back to China at the urging of members of the government, was greeted in Shanghai by Chiang, who offered a power-sharing deal. Wang said that he would consider the deal, and boarded a ship for Wuhan on 7 April. He arrived on the 10th, where he was eagerly greeted by the Wuhan leadership. Having heard from Wang about Chiang&#x27;s offer, the government decided to turn its limited forces toward Beijing instead. Chiang, on the other hand, was already preparing for a purge of communists in Shanghai.

Chiang was able to utilize his connections with a secret society of Shanghai known as the Green Gang, and organize its members to kill all labor union members and Communists within the city. Between 12 and 14April, hundreds of communists in Shanghai were arrested and killed on the orders of Chiang in a disturbance that came to be called the &quot;Shanghai massacre&quot;. In the south, Nationalist supporters were massacred by the hands of Communists in retaliation; both events effectively ended the alliance between the nationalists and the Communists and the First United Front. Though, the ensuing White Terror devastated the Communists, and only 10,000 out of 60,000 party members survived. The purge was condemned by Wang Jingwei, now leader of the Wuhan government, formalising the split between the KMT leftists based in Wuhan and the KMT rightists, who subsequently established their own government in Nanjing. The precariousness of the NRA position in Nanjing was clear: at ceremonies held to commemorate the city&#x27;s elevation to capital of China, warlord Zhang Zongchang&#x27;s artillery bombarded the city&#x27;s waterfront from across the Yangtze.

With the Nanjing–Shanghai area under constant threat of attack from the NPA, a series of independent offensives was launched by NRA and NRA-aligned forces in May 1927. Feng Yuxiang and his &quot;Guominjun&quot; moved first, leaving their base in Shaanxi to march on Luoyang, in Henan. On 10 May, the NRA First and Sixth armies crossed the Yangtze into Anhui, and on 16 May, Li Zongren, based in western Anhui, led the Seventh Army toward Hefei. Concurrently, the Wuhan government launched its own campaign in Henan province led by Tang Shengzhi, who was appointed to serve as the Wuhan army&#x27;s commander-in-chief. Aided by the defection of remnants of Wu Peifu&#x27;s forces, Tang advanced to fight the forces of the &quot;Young Marshal&quot; Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s son and political heir, pushing them back to a river at Yancheng.

By 20 May, Li had captured Bengbu, whilst Chiang unleashed a four-pronged attack through Jiangsu, toward the warlord power base in Shandong. He Yingqin led the NRA First Army across the Yangtze at Zhenjiang, and moved to capture Haizhou. On 28 May, Li took Suzhou, while the &quot;Guominjun&quot; took Luoyang, forcing Zhang Zongchang to withdraw his forces to Shandong, and Zhang Xueliang to fall back north of the Yellow River. Following Xueliang&#x27;s retreat, Feng Yuxiang moved east from Luoyang to Zhengzhou. Finally, on 2 June, the NRA captured the vital railway junction of Xuzhou. With both the Longhai and Beijing–Hankou railways under NRA or &quot;Guominjun&quot; control, Feng came into direct contact with the Wuhan and Nanjing factional governments, who both sought his aid. He met with Wang Jingwei and Tang Shengzhi at Zhengzhou on 10–11 June, then travelled to Xuzhou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek on 19 June. On the next day, Feng announced that he would align with the Nanjing faction and purge communists from the areas under his control, crippling the Wuhan government&#x27;s plan to push north, upon which Tang returned to Wuhan with his troops. Whilst Chiang intended to push into Shandong, he was thwarted by the arrival of the Japanese Kwantung Army during the course of June, who were ostensibly deployed to protect Japanese citizens in Qingdao. Around this time, Wu Peifu retreated with his remaining forces into Sichuan, where he announced his retirement. On 5 July, NPA general Chen Yi-yen defected to the NRA, but failed to convince his 10,000 soldiers at Qingdao to do likewise.

At Wuhan, Tang Shengzhi began to mobilise his troops for an attack on the Nanjing government. Aware of this threat, Chiang recalled troops from the Shandong border in an effort to block Tang. In turn, the NPA launched an attack on Chiang in early July, reclaiming much of the territory they had lost. By 24 July, the NPA had retaken Xuzhou. In the face of mounting losses inflicted by the warlords, the Wuhan and Nanjing factions began reconciliation talks. The Wuhan government purged communists from its ranks and expelled Soviet advisors, facilitating a rapprochement between the two factions, but also sparking the communist Nanchang uprising, which weakened its authority. In the meantime, however, the NPA counter-offensive continued, reaching Bengbu on 9 August, and forcing Chiang to withdraw his troops south of the Yangtze. In return for his co-operation, Wang Jingwei demanded that Chiang resign from his post of commander-in-chief, and relinquish all political titles. Accordingly, Chiang resigned from his post on 12 August, though this did not immediately reunify the Wuhan and Nanjing factions.

===Without Chiang Kai-shek (August 1927–January 1928)===
As the two sides attempted to reconcile their political differences, Sun Chuanfang&#x27;s forces continued to bombard Nanjing from across the Yangtze. Sensing the NRA&#x27;s continual disarray, Sun moved to try and recapture Shanghai, contrary to the wishes of NPA leader Zhang Zuolin. On 25 August, NPA landing parties were dispatched to cross the Yangtze at Longtan, near Nanjing. In the early morning of 26 August, thousands of Sun&#x27;s troops crossed the river, rallying at the Longtan station of the Shanghai–Nanjing railway. Li Zongren&#x27;s NRA Seventh Army managed to drive the NPA away from the railway briefly, but thousands more of Sun&#x27;s troops, including White Russian mercenary units, crossed the river the next day and retook the station, cutting off contact between Nanjing and Shanghai. The reeling NRA sent missives to all factions within the revolutionary movement, calling for unity in the face of Sun&#x27;s advancing troops. Accordingly, in an attempt to put pressure on Sun, Feng Yuxiang and his &quot;Guominjun&quot; launched an attack into Shandong on 28 August, while Wuhan sent its troops north, trying to flank Sun, and He Yingqin approached from Shanghai. With its forces encircled, and unable to continue to move troops across the river, the NPA was forced to abandon Longtan railway station on 30 August. In a desperate attempt at resistance, Sun rallied his 40,000 remaining troops and launched a counter-offensive on 31 August, only to be crushed in a hard-fought battle that left more than 10,000 of those troops dead. While Sun was able to escape to Shandong, his surviving troops were forced to surrender to the NRA.
With victory in hand, reconciliation talks restarted on 7 September, and on 15 September, the Wuhan government was dissolved, with a new joint government established in Nanjing, under the leadership of Guangxi clique generals. Wang Jingwei refused to join the new government, as did Tang Shengzi, who became an independent warlord in his own right, controlling Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and parts of Anhui. On the other hand, Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan, theretofore independent, aligned his province with the Nanjing government, adding 100,000 troops to NRA ranks and increasing the pressure on Zhang Zuolin. In the subsequent fighting, neither the Shanxi nor Fengtian forces managed to gain the upper hand. Yan&#x27;s troops successfully withstood a massive siege at Zhuozhou, but went on to suffer a heavy defeat at Baoding on 15 October. The threat from Tang&#x27;s forces, however, prejudiced any further northward advance by the NRA, and so in October, it moved to quash his rebellion. Tang was defeated in early November, and left for exile in Japan shortly afterwards. With Tang dealt with, the push north resumed, reaching Bengbu by 9 November. Continuing their advance, the NRA and Feng Yuxiang&#x27;s &quot;Guominjun&quot; moved toward Xuzhou. The NPA attempted a counter-offensive on 12 December, led by armoured trains, but was quickly forced back by the combined NRA and &quot;Guominjun&quot; forces, which took Xuzhou on 16 December. The NPA retreated once more to Shandong.

Meanwhile, in Guangzhou, a communist uprising broke out on 11 December. The violent rebellion was quickly put down, and on 13 December, Chiang Kai-shek called for the ending of all remaining relations with the Soviet Union. The Nanjing government agreed, and also aired its suspicions over the allegiances of Wang Jingwei, who had been based in Guangzhou after the end of the Wuhan government. Wang left for exile in France on 17 December, paving the way for Chiang&#x27;s return as commander-in-chief. With the military success of Chiang&#x27;s Whampoa troops, the various KMT factions agreed to recognise the legitimacy of Chiang&#x27;s leadership. Consequently, Chiang was officially invited to resume command of the NRA on 1 January 1928.

=== Regrouping and Jinan incident (January–May 1928) ===

With the frigid winter of northern China prohibiting any further advance, Chiang used the months following his reappointment to consolidate his control and restore the integrity of the Nanjing administration. On 18 February, Chiang was granted the title &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expeditionary Forces&quot;, whilst He Yingqin was made NRA chief-of-staff. The NRA was reorganised into four &quot;collective armies&quot;. The First Collective Army was made up largely of the original NRA forces from Guangzhou, now based in the Nanjing–Shanghai area. The Second Collective Army consisted of Feng&#x27;s &quot;Guominjun&quot;, the Third of Yan&#x27;s Shanxi forces, and the Fourth of Li Zongren&#x27;s Guangxi clique army. By this point, the NRA was made up of one million soldiers, most of them part of ex-warlord armies. Preparing for a resumption of the expedition in March, Chiang ordered his foreign ministry to negotiate with the Japanese, in order to try to prevent their further intervention in Shandong.

By 1 April, Feng&#x27;s NRA Second Collective Army (&quot;Guominjun&quot;) and Yan&#x27;s NRA Third Collective Army had started to fight the NPA on the Henan–Shandong border and along the Beijing–Suiyuan railway. The resumption of the Northern Expedition was officially launched by Chiang Kai-shek on 7 April. With the NPA line softened by Feng and Yan&#x27;s attacks, the NRA First Collective Army rushed into Shandong along the Tianjin–Pukou railway, capturing Tengzhou by 16 April. Meanwhile, Feng&#x27;s forces advanced into Shandong from the west, capturing Jiaxiang on the 15th. Sun Chuanfang decided to attempt a two-pronged counter-offensive against the NRA First and Second armies, managing to push the First back to the Longhai railway. His attack against the Second Army failed, and by the 21st, the combined NRA had forced him to withdraw from Jining to the provincial capital Jinan. According to an American account of Sun&#x27;s retreat, the &quot;great majority of the troops in this retreat literally walked the soles off their shoes, and this, combined with the scarcity of food and total lack of shelter left the vast horde without any idea of further resistance&quot;. The Japanese, meanwhile, having heard of Sun&#x27;s defeat, began to move Kwantung Army troops by train from Qingdao to Jinan.

While the NRA Second Collective Army advanced northeast to Jinan along the southern bank of the Yellow River, the First Collective Army diverged east from the Tianjin–Pukou railway at Tai&#x27;an, crossing the Taishan mountains to attack Jinan from the west via the Qingdao–Jinan railway. This strategy was successful, and by 29 April, the NRA had nearly encircled Jinan. The beleaguered NPA retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River, amidst looting and outbreaks of violence. At this point, there were already 3,000 Japanese troops in Jinan, guarding the 2,000 Japanese civilians in the city. On the next day, NRA troops entered Jinan. Chiang Kai-shek arrived on 2 May, and attempted to negotiate a Japanese withdrawal from Jinan, issuing safety guarantees for Japanese civilians to local Kwantung Army commander Hikosuke Fukuda. Fukuda agreed, and his troops prepared to leave that night. Early the next morning, conflict broke out between the Chinese and Japanese troops, starting what came to be called the &quot;Jinan incident&quot;. What began as a minor armed altercation escalated on 8 May into a full-scale Japanese attack on the city. During the course of the incident, the Japanese killed KMT foreign affairs commissioner Cai Gongshi, several diplomats, and about five thousand Chinese civilians. In May 1928, 11 or 7 Japanese were shot to death by a Chinese man in Kobe, Japan in revenge for the Jinan incident and then he committed suicide.

=== Final offensive and capture of Beijing (May–December 1928) ===

Deciding to avoid further confrontation with the Japanese, the NRA First Army continued its march north by going around Jinan to capture Dezhou on 13 May, while the NRA Second Army moved north along the Beijing–Hankou railway. Meanwhile, Yan Xishan&#x27;s NRA Third Army proceeded toward Beijing from its base in Shanxi. The Second and Third armies met at Baoding on the North China Plain. While the Second Army besieged that city, the Third Army went north toward Zhangjiakou, gateway to Beijing. On 17 May, however, the forces of Zhang Zuolin launched a 200,000-man counter-offensive, forcing the First Army back and the Second Army south of Baoding. As fighting grew closer to Beijing, the Japanese sent a communique to both the NRA and Zhang, warning that any fighting in Manchuria would result in a Japanese intervention in that region. Zhang, weary of KMT propaganda that linked him with the Japanese massacre at Jinan, responded that he would &quot;not recognize Japan&#x27;s interest in Manchuria&quot;, compromising his position. With his troops demoralised, the momentum of the NPA counter-offensive fizzled out by 25 May, and the Third Army was able to capture Zhangjiakou on that day, and Nankou Pass on the next. With pressure growing on his vital railway links, Zhang gradually began to withdraw his troops from the North China Plain on 30 May. In the face of the NRA onslaught, and under pressure from the Japanese, Zhang decided to evacuate to Manchuria by train, leaving with his staff on 3 June. Early the next morning, a bomb planted by the Japanese Kwantung Army exploded under the train, killing Zhang in the so-called &quot;Huanggutun incident&quot;. His remaining forces, even further demoralised, crumpled under the pressure of the NRA advance. Sun Chuanfang unleashed the final blow to the NPA when he withdrew his troops from the defensive line and fled to Japanese-controlled Dairen on 4 June. On 6 June, the NRA Third Collective Army marched into Beijing, ending the Beiyang government. The other NRA armies would arrive in the Beijing area over the next few days. Zhang Zongchang subordinate Xu Yuanquan subsequently surrendered Tianjin to the NRA First Collective Army on 11 June.

Zhang Xueliang succeeded Zhang Zuolin as leader of the Fengtian clique, and decided to end the war and to co-operate with the nationalists. The Shandong–Zhili Army led by Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu refused to surrender, and despite the defeats it had suffered still numbered about 60,000–70,000 soldiers, as well as at least three armoured trains manned by White Russian mercenaries under General Konstantin Nechaev. As Zhang Xueliang had sided with the nationalists, Zhang Zongchang declared war on the Fengtian clique. Supported by Japan, the Shandong–Zhili Army moved from its base at Tangshan on 2 August, crossed the Luan River, and invaded Manchuria. After six days of fighting, however, the defiant warlord army was trapped by KMT and Zhang Xueliang-aligned forces; many of Zhang Zongchang&#x27;s troops (including the White Russian mercenaries) defected or deserted, and those who refused to surrender were killed. Chinese Nationalist forces captured an armoured train of Russian mercenaries serving Zhang Zongchang and brutalized the Russian prisoners by piercing their noses with rope and marching them in public through the streets in Shandong in 1928, described as &quot;stout rope pierced through their noses&quot;. Zhang Xueliang officially declared his allegiance to the nationalist government in Nanjing on 29December 1928, marking the formal end of the Northern Expedition, and the reunification of China.

== Aftermath ==
Following the capture of Beijing, Chiang and his administration moved quickly to reorganise the government for peacetime. In July, he and the leaders of the four collective armies met at Beijing to discuss the demobilisation and disarmament of the roughly 2.2 million troops that had come to be part of the NRA. Chiang desired to reduce the size of the army by half, so as to free up government monies for domestic development. The lack of unity in the new administration quickly became apparent, and on 14 July, Feng Yuxiang left Beijing. A general meeting of the KMT was held in Nanjing from 8–14 August. At this meeting, also attended by non-KMT members Feng and Yan Xishan, the primary topic of discussion was that of centralisation. Chiang desired to take the power that had been executed through various provincial entities and concentrate it in the central government, in an effort to curtail the provincialist tendencies of the warlord era. Minister of Finance T. V. Soong called for all revenues to be centralised in the national treasury. In the end, though, it was recognised that real centralisation could only occur if the various commanders, the former warlords, relinquished their financial and military power to the national government. While these principles were nominally agreed to by the KMT membership, their exercise in practice was far from assured.

The new peacetime Nanjing government was launched on 10 October 1928, the seventeenth anniversary of the start of the Xinhai Revolution, with Chiang at its head. The country, however, remained &quot;de facto&quot; divided into five realms controlled by military leaders. The Nanjing faction controlled the area around Nanjing and Shanghai, while the Guangxi clique controlled Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi. Feng Yuxiang&#x27;s &quot;Guominjun&quot; continued to control Shaanxi, Henan, and parts of Shantung and Zhili, while Yan Xishan controlled Shanxi, Beijing, and the area around Tianjin. Zhang Xueliang continued to control Manchuria as a quasi-independent state, and local warlords in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou remained as they were before the Northern Expedition.

Defeated warlord Zhang Zongchang would return to his former territory of Shandong in 1929, where he launched a rebellion against his former subordinate Liu Zhennian, who had defected to the nationalists during the Northern Expedition. While the rebellion was put down swiftly, it demonstrated the Nanjing government&#x27;s shaky hold on China&#x27;s vast territory. As Chiang attempted to cut back the military and centralise the power of the nationalist government in Nanjing, the regional warlords, with their military forces largely intact, began to renounce their allegiance to Chiang and form an alliance against the KMT. This struggle for supremacy broke into armed conflict in the Central Plains War of 1929–30. Although Chiang was ultimately victorious in that war, which ensured his status as the singular leader of all China, regionalism and warlordism would continue, weakening the country and laying the groundwork for the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.

=== In the Soviet Union ===
The Northern Expedition became a point of contention between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the Soviet Union. Stalin encouraged the CCP to co-operate with the KMT on multiple occasions, as he believed the KMT was more capable of completing the Chinese revolution. Trotsky was against collaboration with the KMT, as he believed that it was opposed to the concept of proletarian revolution. The Comintern backed Stalin&#x27;s decision to financially support the KMT. Stalin, who in his China strategy prohibited the arming of workers and peasants, and encouraged co-operation with the bourgeoisie, was considered vulnerable in the aftermath of the failure of the first United Front. This failure crystallised his move away from international revolution and toward &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;. Stalin would never again trust the Chinese Communist Party, which he would later refer to as &quot;margarine communists&quot; who deviated from Marxist orthodoxy in their drive for peasant-based (land reform), rather than worker-based, revolution.

<doc id="233103" wikidata="Q372984" url="?curid=233103" title="Charles Lamb">
<text>Charles Lamb (10 February 1775 – 27 December 1834) was an English essayist, poet, and antiquarian, best known for his &quot;Essays of Elia&quot; and for the children&#x27;s book &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot;, co-authored with his sister, Mary Lamb (1764–1847).

Friends with such literary luminaries as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth and William Hazlitt, Lamb was at the centre of a major literary circle in England. He has been referred to by E. V. Lucas, his principal biographer, as &quot;the most lovable figure in English literature&quot;.

==Youth and schooling==
Lamb was born in London, the son of John Lamb (–1799) and Elizabeth (died 1796), née Field. Lamb had an elder brother, also John, and sister, Mary; four other siblings did not survive infancy. John Lamb (Lamb&#x27;s father) was a lawyer&#x27;s clerk and spent most of his professional life as the assistant to barrister Samuel Salt, who lived in the Inner Temple in the legal district of London; it was there, in Crown Office Row, that Charles Lamb was born and spent his youth. Lamb created a portrait of his father in his &quot;Elia on the Old Benchers&quot; under the name Lovel. Lamb&#x27;s older brother was too much his senior to be a youthful companion to the boy but his sister Mary, being born eleven years before him, was probably his closest playmate. Lamb was also cared for by his paternal aunt Hetty, who seems to have had a particular fondness for him. A number of writings by both Charles and Mary suggest that the conflict between Aunt Hetty and her sister-in-law created a certain degree of tension in the Lamb household. However, Charles speaks fondly of her and her presence in the house seems to have brought a great deal of comfort to him.

Some of Lamb&#x27;s fondest childhood memories were of time spent with Mrs Field, his maternal grandmother, who was for many years a servant to the Plumer family, who owned a large country house called Blakesware, near Widford, Hertfordshire. After the death of Mrs Plumer, Lamb&#x27;s grandmother was in sole charge of the large home and, as William Plumer was often absent, Charles had free rein of the place during his visits. A picture of these visits can be glimpsed in the Elia essay &quot;Blakesmoor in H—shire&quot;.

Little is known about Charles&#x27;s life before he was seven other than that Mary taught him to read at a very early age and he read voraciously. It is believed that he had smallpox during his early years, which forced him into a long period of convalescence. After this period of recovery Lamb began to take lessons from Mrs Reynolds, a woman who lived in the Temple and is believed to have been the former wife of a lawyer. Mrs Reynolds must have been a sympathetic schoolmistress because Lamb maintained a relationship with her throughout his life and she is known to have attended dinner parties held by Mary and Charles in the 1820s. E. V. Lucas suggests that sometime in 1781 Charles left Mrs Reynolds and began to study at the Academy of William Bird.

His time with William Bird did not last long, however, because by October 1782 Lamb was enrolled in Christ&#x27;s Hospital, a charity boarding school chartered by King Edward VI in 1553. A thorough record of Christ&#x27;s Hospital is to be found in several essays by Lamb as well as &quot;The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt&quot; and the &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot; of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, with whom Charles developed a friendship that would last for their entire lives. Despite the school&#x27;s brutality, Lamb got along well there, due in part, perhaps, to the fact that his home was not far distant, thus enabling him, unlike many other boys, to return often to its safety. Years later, in his essay &quot;Christ&#x27;s Hospital Five and Thirty Years Ago&quot;, Lamb described these events, speaking of himself in the third person as &quot;L&quot;.


Christ&#x27;s Hospital was a typical English boarding school and many students later wrote of the terrible violence they suffered there. The upper master (i.e. principal or headteacher) of the school from 1778 to 1799 was Reverend James Boyer, a man renowned for his unpredictable and capricious temper. In one famous story Boyer was said to have knocked one of Leigh Hunt&#x27;s teeth out by throwing a copy of Homer at him from across the room. Lamb seemed to have escaped much of this brutality, in part because of his amiable personality and in part because Samuel Salt, his father&#x27;s employer and Lamb&#x27;s sponsor at the school, was one of the institute&#x27;s governors.

Charles Lamb had a stutter and this &quot;inconquerable impediment&quot; in his speech deprived him of Grecian status at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, thus disqualifying him for a clerical career. While Coleridge and other scholarly boys were able to go on to Cambridge, Lamb left school at fourteen and was forced to find a more prosaic career. For a short time he worked in the office of Joseph Paice, a London merchant, and then, for 23 weeks, until 8 February 1792, held a small post in the Examiner&#x27;s Office of the South Sea House. Its subsequent downfall in a pyramid scheme after Lamb left would be contrasted to the company&#x27;s prosperity in the first Elia essay. On 5 April 1792 he went to work in the Accountant&#x27;s Office for the British East India Company, the death of his father&#x27;s employer having ruined the family&#x27;s fortunes. Charles would continue to work there for 25 years, until his retirement with pension (the &quot;superannuation&quot; he refers to in the title of one essay).

In 1792 while tending to his grandmother, Mary Field, in Hertfordshire, Charles Lamb fell in love with a young woman named Ann Simmons. Although no epistolary record exists of the relationship between the two, Lamb seems to have spent years wooing her. The record of the love exists in several accounts of Lamb&#x27;s writing. &quot;Rosamund Gray&quot; is a story of a young man named Allen Clare who loves Rosamund Gray but their relationship comes to nothing because of her sudden death. Miss Simmons also appears in several Elia essays under the name &quot;Alice M&quot;. The essays &quot;Dream Children&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, and several others, speak of the many years that Lamb spent pursuing his love that ultimately failed. Miss Simmons eventually went on to marry a silversmith and Lamb called the failure of the affair his &quot;great disappointment&quot;.

==Family tragedy==
Both Charles and his sister Mary had a period of mental illness. As he himself confessed in a letter, Charles spent six weeks in a mental facility during 1795:
Mary Lamb&#x27;s illness was more severe than her brother&#x27;s, and it led her to become aggressive on a fatal occasion. On 22 September 1796, while preparing dinner, Mary became angry with her apprentice, roughly shoving the little girl out of her way and pushing her into another room. Her mother, Elizabeth, began admonishing her for this, and Mary had a mental breakdown. She took the kitchen knife she had been holding, unsheathed it, and approached her mother, who was sitting down. Mary, &quot;worn down to a state of extreme nervous misery by attention to needlework by day and to her mother at night&quot;, was seized with acute mania and stabbed her mother in the heart with a table knife. Charles ran into the house soon after the murder and took the knife out of Mary&#x27;s hand.

Later in the evening, Charles found a local place for Mary in a private mental facility called Fisher House, which had been found with the help of a doctor friend of his. While reports were published by the media, Charles wrote a letter to Samuel Taylor Coleridge in connection to the matricide:

Charles took over responsibility for Mary after refusing his brother John&#x27;s suggestion that they have her committed to a public lunatic asylum. Lamb used a large part of his relatively meagre income to keep his beloved sister in the private &quot;madhouse&quot; in Islington. With the help of friends, Lamb succeeded in obtaining his sister&#x27;s release from what would otherwise have been lifelong imprisonment. Although there was no legal status of &quot;insanity&quot; at the time, the jury returned the verdict of &quot;lunacy&quot; which was how she was freed from guilt of willful murder, on the condition that Charles take personal responsibility for her safekeeping.

The 1799 death of John Lamb was something of a relief to Charles because his father had been mentally incapacitated for a number of years since having a stroke. The death of his father also meant that Mary could come to live again with him in Pentonville, and in 1800 they set up a shared home at Mitre Court Buildings in the Temple, where they would live until 1809.

In 1800, Mary&#x27;s illness came back and Charles had to take her back again to the asylum. In those days, Charles sent a letter to Coleridge, in which he admitted he felt melancholic and lonely, adding &quot;I almost wish that Mary were dead.&quot;

Later she would come back, and both he and his sister would enjoy an active and rich social life. Their London quarters became a kind of weekly salon for many of the most outstanding theatrical and literary figures of the day. In 1869, a club, The Lambs, was formed in London to carry on their salon tradition. The actor Henry James Montague founded the club&#x27;s New York counterpart in 1874.

Charles Lamb, having been to school with Samuel Coleridge, counted Coleridge as perhaps his closest, and certainly his oldest, friend. On his deathbed, Coleridge had a mourning ring sent to Lamb and his sister. Fortuitously, Lamb&#x27;s first publication was in 1796, when four sonnets by &quot;Mr Charles Lamb of the India House&quot; appeared in Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Poems on Various Subjects&quot;. In 1797 he contributed additional blank verse to the second edition, and met the Wordsworths, William and Dorothy, on his short summer holiday with Coleridge at Nether Stowey, thereby also striking up a lifelong friendship with William. In London, Lamb became familiar with a group of young writers who favoured political reform, including Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt and William Hone.

Lamb continued to clerk for the East India Company and doubled as a writer in various genres, his tragedy, &quot;John Woodvil&quot;, being published in 1802. His farce, &quot;Mr H&quot;, was performed at Drury Lane in 1807, where it was roundly booed. In the same year, &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; (Charles handled the tragedies; his sister Mary, the comedies) was published, and became a best seller for William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Library&quot;.

On 20 July 1819, at age 44, Lamb, who, because of family commitments, had never married, fell in love with an actress, Fanny Kelly, of Covent Garden, and besides writing her a sonnet he also proposed marriage. She refused him, and he died a bachelor.

His collected essays, under the title &quot;Essays of Elia&quot;, were published in 1823 (&quot;Elia&quot; being the pen name Lamb used as a contributor to &quot;The London Magazine&quot;).

The &quot;Essays of Elia&quot; would be criticised in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (January 1823) by Robert Southey, who thought its author to be irreligious. When Charles read the review, entitled &quot;The Progress of Infidelity&quot;, he was filled with indignation, and wrote a letter to his friend Bernard Barton, where Lamb declared he hated the review, and emphasised that his words &quot;meant no harm to religion&quot;. First, Lamb did not want to retort, since he actually admired Southey; but later he felt the need to write a letter &quot;Elia to Southey&quot;, in which he complained and expressed that the fact that he was a dissenter of the Church, did not make him an irreligious man. The letter would be published in &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, in October 1823:

A further collection called &quot;The Last Essays of Elia&quot; was published in 1833, shortly before Lamb&#x27;s death. Also, in 1834, Samuel Coleridge died. The funeral was confined only to the family of the writer, so Lamb was prevented from attending and only wrote a letter to Rev. James Gilman, Coleridge&#x27;s physician and close friend, expressing his condolences.

On 27 December 1834, Lamb died of a streptococcal infection, erysipelas, contracted from a minor graze on his face sustained after slipping in the street; he was 59. From 1833 until their deaths, Charles and Mary lived at Bay Cottage, Church Street, Edmonton, north of London (now part of the London Borough of Enfield). Lamb is buried in All Saints&#x27; Churchyard, Edmonton. His sister, who was ten years his senior, survived him by more than a dozen years. She is buried beside him.

==Work==

Lamb&#x27;s first publication was the inclusion of four sonnets in Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Poems on Various Subjects&quot;, published in 1796 by Joseph Cottle. The sonnets were significantly influenced by the poems of Burns and the sonnets of William Bowles, a largely forgotten poet of the late 18th century. Lamb&#x27;s poems garnered little attention and are seldom read today. As he himself came to realise, he was a much more talented prose stylist than poet. Indeed, one of the most celebrated poets of the day—William Wordsworth—wrote to John Scott as early as 1815 that Lamb &quot;writes prose exquisitely&quot;—and this was five years before Lamb began &quot;The&quot; &quot;Essays of Elia&quot; for which he is now most famous.

Notwithstanding, Lamb&#x27;s contributions to Coleridge&#x27;s second edition of the &quot;Poems on Various Subjects&quot; showed significant growth as a poet. These poems included &quot;The Tomb of Douglas&quot; and &quot;A Vision of Repentance&quot;. Because of a temporary falling out with Coleridge, Lamb&#x27;s poems were to be excluded in the third edition of the &quot;Poems &quot;though as it turned out a third edition never emerged. Instead, Coleridge&#x27;s next publication was the monumentally influential &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; co-published with Wordsworth. Lamb, on the other hand, published a book entitled &quot;Blank Verse&quot; with Charles Lloyd, the mentally unstable son of the founder of Lloyds Bank. Lamb&#x27;s most famous poem was written at this time and entitled &quot;The Old Familiar Faces&quot;. Like most of Lamb&#x27;s poems, it is unabashedly sentimental, and perhaps for this reason it is still remembered and widely read today, being often included in anthologies of British and Romantic period poetry. Of particular interest to Lambarians is the opening verse of the original version of &quot;The Old Familiar Faces&quot;, which is concerned with Lamb&#x27;s mother, whom Mary Lamb killed. It was a verse that Lamb chose to remove from the edition of his Collected Work published in 1818:

In the final years of the 18th century, Lamb began to work on prose, first in a novella entitled &quot;Rosamund Gray&quot;, which tells the story of a young girl whose character is thought to be based on Ann Simmons, an early love interest. Although the story is not particularly successful as a narrative because of Lamb&#x27;s poor sense of plot, it was well thought of by Lamb&#x27;s contemporaries and led Shelley to observe, &quot;what a lovely thing is &quot;Rosamund Gray&quot;! How much knowledge of the sweetest part of our nature in it!&quot; (Quoted in Barnett, page 50)

In the first years of the 19th century, Lamb began a fruitful literary cooperation with his sister Mary. Together they wrote at least three books for William Godwin&#x27;s Juvenile Library. The most successful of these was &quot;Tales From Shakespeare&quot;, which ran through two editions for Godwin and has been published dozens of times in countless editions ever since. The book contains artful prose summaries of some of Shakespeare&#x27;s most well-loved works. According to Lamb, he worked primarily on Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, while Mary focused mainly on the comedies.

Lamb&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Tragedies of Shakespeare Considered with Reference to their Fitness for Stage Representation”--originally published in the &quot;Reflector&quot; in 1811 with the title &quot;On Garrick, and Acting; and the Plays of Shakspeare, considered with reference to their fitness for Stage Representation”--was prompted in response to his viewing of the David Garrick memorial on the west wall of Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey, and has often been taken as the ultimate Romantic dismissal of the theatre. In the essay, Lamb argues that Shakespeare’s plays should be read rather than performed to protect them from commercial performance and celebrity culture. The essay criticizes contemporary stage practice even as it develops a more complex reflection on the imaginative representation of Shakespearean dramas:

Besides contributing to Shakespeare&#x27;s reception with his and his sister&#x27;s book &quot;Tales From Shakespeare&quot;, Lamb also contributed to the recovery of acquaintance with Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries. Accelerating the increasing interest of the time in the older writers, and building for himself a reputation as an antiquarian, in 1808 Lamb compiled a collection of extracts from the old dramatists, &quot;Specimens of the English Dramatic Poets Who Lived About the Time of Shakespeare&quot;. This also contained critical &quot;characters&quot; of the old writers, which added to the flow of significant literary criticism, primarily of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, from Lamb&#x27;s pen. Immersion in seventeenth-century authors, such as Robert Burton and Sir Thomas Browne, also changed the way Lamb wrote, adding a distinct flavour to his writing style.

Lamb&#x27;s friend the essayist William Hazlitt thus characterised him: &quot;Mr. Lamb ... does not march boldly along with the crowd ... He prefers &quot;bye-ways&quot; to &quot;highways&quot;. When the full tide of human life pours along to some festive show, to some pageant of a day, Elia would stand on one side to look over an old book-stall, or stroll down some deserted pathway in search of a pensive description over a tottering doorway, or some quaint device in architecture, illustrative of embryo art and ancient manners. Mr. Lamb has the very soul of an antiquarian ...&quot;

Although he did not write his first Elia essay until 1820, Lamb&#x27;s gradual perfection of the essay form for which he eventually became famous began as early as 1811 in a series of open letters to Leigh Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Reflector&quot;. The most famous of these early essays is &quot;The Londoner&quot;, in which Lamb famously derides the contemporary fascination with nature and the countryside. In another well-known &quot;Reflector&quot; essay of 1811, he deemed William Hogarth&#x27;s images to be books, filled with &quot;the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of words. Other pictures we look at; his pictures we read.&quot; He would continue to fine-tune his craft, experimenting with different essayistic voices and personae, for the better part of the next quarter century.

==Religious views==
Christianity played an important role in Lamb&#x27;s personal life: although he was not a churchman he &quot;sought consolation in religion,&quot; as shown in letters he wrote to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Bernard Barton in which he describes the New Testament as his &quot;best guide&quot; for life and recalls how he used to read the Psalms for one or two hours without getting tired. Other writings also deal with his Christian beliefs. Like his friend Coleridge, Lamb was sympathetic to Priestleyan Unitarianism and was a Dissenter, and he was described by Coleridge himself as one whose &quot;faith in Jesus ha[d] been preserved&quot; even after the family tragedy. Wordsworth also described him as a firm Christian in the poem &quot;Written After the Death of Charles Lamb&quot;, Alfred Ainger, in his work &quot;Charles Lamb&quot;, writes that Lamb&#x27;s religion had become &quot;an habit&quot;.

Lamb&#x27;s own poems &quot;On The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, &quot;A Vision of Repentance&quot;, &quot;The Young Catechist&quot;, &quot;Composed at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Suffer Little Children, and Forbid Them Not to Come Unto Me&quot;, &quot;Written a Twelvemonth After the Events&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot;, &quot;Sonnet to a Friend&quot; and &quot;David&quot; express his religious faith, while his poem &quot;Living Without God in the World&quot; has been called a &quot;poetic attack&quot; on unbelief, in which Lamb expresses his disgust at atheism, attributing it to pride.

==Legacy==
There has always been a small but enduring following for Lamb&#x27;s works, as the long-running and still-active &quot;Charles Lamb Bulletin&quot; demonstrates. Because of his quirky, even bizarre, style, he has been more of a &quot;cult favourite&quot; than an author with mass popular or scholarly appeal. Anne Fadiman notes regretfully that Lamb is not widely read in modern times: &quot;I do not understand why so few other readers are clamoring for his company... [He] is kept alive largely through the tenuous resuscitations of university English departments.&quot;.

Two of the houses at Christ&#x27;s Hospital (Lamb A and Lamb B) are named in his honour. and he is also honoured by The Latymer School, a grammar school in Edmonton, a suburb of London where he lived for a time: it has six houses, one of which, Lamb, is named after him. A major academic prize awarded each year at Christ&#x27;s Hospital School&#x27;s speech day is &quot;The Lamb Prize for Independent Study&quot;.

Sir Edward Elgar wrote an orchestral work, &quot;Dream Children&quot;, inspired by Lamb&#x27;s essay of that title.

A quotation from Lamb, &quot;Lawyers, I suppose, were children once&quot;,&#x27; serves as the epigraph to Harper Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

The Charles Lamb pub in Islington is named after him.

Henry James Montague, founder of The Lambs Club, named it after the salon of Charles and his sister Mary.

Charles Lamb plays an important role in the plot of Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.&quot;

<text>An autoharp or chord zither is a string instrument belonging to the zither family. It uses a series of bars individually configured to mute all strings other than those needed for the intended chord. The term &quot;autoharp&quot; was once a trademark of the Oscar Schmidt company, but has become a generic designation for all such instruments, regardless of manufacturer.

==History==

Charles F. Zimmermann, a German immigrant in Philadelphia, was awarded a patent in 1882 for a “Harp” fitted with a mechanism that muted strings selectively during play. He called a zither-sized instrument using this mechanism an “autoharp.” Unlike later designs, the instrument shown in the patent was symmetrical, and the damping mechanism engaged with the strings laterally instead of from above. It is not known if Zimmermann ever produced such instruments commercially. Karl August Gütter of Markneukirchen, Germany, built a model that he called a &quot;Volkszither&quot;, which was more clearly the prototype of the autoharp in its current form. He obtained a British patent for it c. 1883–1884. In 1885, after returning from a visit to Germany, Zimmermann began production of instruments with the Gütter design. He labeled them autoharps and included his own name and patent number. As a result, Zimmermann is widely but incorrectly regarded as the inventor of the instrument in its now familiar form.

===Trademark===
A stylized representation of the word &quot;autoharp&quot; was registered as a trademark in 1926. The word itself is currently claimed as a trademark by the U.S. Music Corporation, whose Oscar Schmidt Inc. division manufactures autoharps. The USPTO registration, however, covers only a “Mark Drawing Code (5) Words, Letters, and/or Numbers in Stylized Form” and has expired. In litigation with George Orthey, it was held that Oscar Schmidt could only claim ownership of the graphic device, the word &quot;autoharp&quot; having come into generic use.

==Construction==

The autoharp body is made of wood, and has a generally rectangular shape, with one corner cut off. The soundboard generally features a guitar-like sound-hole, and the top may be either solid wood or of laminated construction. A pin-block of multiple laminated layers of wood occupies the top and slanted edges, and serves as a bed for the tuning pins, which resemble those used in pianos and concert zithers.

On the edge opposite the top pin-block is either a series of metal pins, or a grooved metal plate, which accepts the lower ends of the strings. Directly above the strings, on the lower half of the top, are the chord bars, which are made of plastic, wood, or metal, and support felt or foam pads on the side facing the strings. These bars are mounted on springs, and pressed down with one hand, via buttons mounted to their topside. The buttons are labeled with the name of the chord produced when that bar is pressed against the strings, and the strings strummed. The back of the instrument usually has three wooden, plastic, or rubber &quot;feet&quot;, which support the instrument when it is placed backside down on a table top, for playing in the traditional position.

Strings run parallel to the top, between the mounting plate and the tuning pins, and pass under the chord bar assembly. Modern autoharps most often have 36 strings, with some examples having as many as 47 strings, and rare 48-string models (such as Orthey Autoharps No. 136, tuned to G and D major). They are strung in a semi-chromatic manner which, however, is sometimes modified into either diatonic or fully chromatic scales. Standard models have 12, 15 or 21 chord bars available, providing a selection of major, minor, and dominant seventh chords. These are arranged for historical or systemic reasons. Various special models have also been produced, such as diatonic one-, two-, or three-key models, models with fewer or additional chords, and a reverse-strung model (the 43-string, 28-chord Chromaharp &quot;Caroler&quot;).

===Range and tuning===
The range is determined by the number of strings and their tuning. A typical 36-string chromatic autoharp in standard tuning has a -octave range, from F2 to C6. The instrument is not fully chromatic throughout this range, however, as this would require 44 strings. The exact 36-string tuning is:
 
There are a number of gaps in the lowest octave, which functions primarily to provide bass notes in diatonic contexts; there is also a missing G3 in the tenor octave. The fully chromatic part of the instrument&#x27;s range begins with A3 (the A below middle C).

Diatonically-strung single-key instruments from modern luthiers are known for their lush sound. This is achieved by doubling the strings for individual notes. Since the strings for notes not in the diatonic scale need not appear in the string bed, the resulting extra space is used for the doubled strings, resulting in fewer damped strings. Two- and three-key diatonics compromise the number of doubled strings to gain the ability to play in two or three keys, and to permit tunes containing accidentals, which could not otherwise be rendered on a single-key harp. A three-key harp in the circle of fifths, such as a GDA, is often called a festival or campfire harp, as the instrument can easily accompany fiddles around a campfire or at a festival.

===Chord bars===

The standard, factory chord bar layout for a 15-chord instrument, in two rows, is:

The standard, factory chord bar layout for a 21-chord instrument is in three rows:

A variety of chord bar layouts may be had, both in as-delivered instruments, and after customization.

=== Electric autoharp ===

Until the 1960s, no pickups were available to amplify the autoharp other than rudimentary contact microphones, which frequently had a poor-quality, tinny sound. In the early 1960s, a bar magnetic pickup was designed for the instrument by Harry DeArmond, and manufactured by Rowe Industries. Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours used the instrument on their 1966 single &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. In the 1970s, Oscar Schmidt came out with their own magnetic pickup. &quot;The Evil One&quot;, a 1979 hard rock album by Roky Erickson and the Aliens prominently featured the electric autoharp of Bill Miller which granted &quot;an unearthly edge&quot; to the music.

Shown is a 1930 refinished Oscar Schmidt “Model A”. This harp has two DeArmond magnetic pickups (one under the chord bars), with a d&#x27;Aigle fine-tuning mechanism, and d&#x27;Aigle chord bar assembly, and was used in a 1968 MGM Records/Heritage Records recording by Euphoria.

===Variants===
A synthesized version of the autoharp, the Omnichord, was introduced in 1981 and is now known as the Q-Chord, described as a &quot;digital songcard guitar&quot;.

==Playing technique==
As initially conceived, the autoharp was played in the position of a concert zither, that is, with the instrument set flat on a table (there are three &quot;feet&quot; on the back for this purpose), and the flat-edge of the instrument (below the chord bars) placed to the player&#x27;s right. The left hand worked the chord buttons, and the right hand would strum the strings in the narrow area below the chord bars. Right hand strums were typically done with a plectrum similar to a guitar pick, made of shell, plastic, or compressed felt. A strum would usually activate multiple strings, playing the chord held down by the left hand.

Partly because of this playing mode, the autoharp came to be thought of as a rhythm instrument for playing chordal accompaniment, and even today many still think of the instrument in that way. New techniques have been developed, however, and modern players can play melodies on the instrument: diatonic players, for example, are able to play fiddle tunes using open-chording techniques, &quot;pumping&quot; the damper buttons while picking individual strings. Skilled chromatic players can perform a range of melodies, and even solos including melody, chords, and complex rhythmic accompaniments.

In the mid-20th century performers began experimenting with taking the instrument off the table and playing it in an upright position, held in the lap, with the back of the instrument (having the &quot;feet&quot;) held against the chest. Cecil Null, of the Grand Ole Opry is usually credited as the first to adopt this playing style in public performance, in the 1950s. In this position the left hand still works the chord buttons, but from the &quot;opposite edge&quot; of the instrument, and the right hand still executes the strums, but now plays in the area &quot;above&quot; the chord bars. (See &quot;Joe Butler&quot; illustration, below.) This playing mode makes a wider area of the strings available to the picking hand, increasing the range of tonal possibilities, and it proved very popular. It was soon adopted by other performers, notably by members of the Carter Family.

By the early 1970s some players were experimenting with finger-style techniques, where individual fingers of the right hand would pluck specific strings, rather than simply hold a pick and strum chords. Bryan Bowers became a master of this mode of playing, and developed a complex technique utilizing all five fingers of his right hand. This allows him to play independent bass notes, chords, melody, and counter melodies as a soloist. Bowers was also one of the early pioneers in adding a strap to the instrument and playing it while standing up.

==Notable performers==

Kilby Snow (May 28, 1905 – March 29, 1980) was an American folk musician and virtuoso autoharpist, who won the title of &quot;Autoharp Champion of North Carolina&quot; at the age of 5. He developed the &quot;drag note&quot; playing style, a technique that relied on his left-handedness to produce &quot;slurred&quot; notes; he has been enormously influential among autoharpists, and is regarded by many as the first modern autoharp player.

Maybelle Carter of the original Carter Family brought the instrument to prominence in the late 1940s by using it as a lead instrument when performing with her daughters; the Carter Sisters.

Maybelle Carter&#x27;s granddaughter Carlene Carter frequently plays the autoharp onstage and on her recordings; her song &quot;Me and the Wildwood Rose&quot;, a tribute to her grandmother, makes prominent use of the autoharp.

Several Lovin&#x27; Spoonful songs feature the autoharp playing of John Sebastian, including &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; and &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot;. He also played in the 1979 Randy VanWarmer hit song &quot;Just When I Needed You Most&quot;.

Bryan Bowers developed a complex finger-picking style of playing the autoharp (as opposed to the more common strumming technique) which he initially brought to bluegrass performances with The Dillards in the 1970s, and later to several of his own solo albums.

British singer songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae regularly plays the autoharp and composed the title track from her 2010 album &quot;The Sea&quot; on the autoharp.

Norwegian avant-garde artist Sturle Dagsland frequently performs with an autoharp.

Singer/songwriter Brittain Ashford of the band Prairie Empire is known for using autoharp in her music, including the 2008 release &quot;There, but for You, go I&quot;. She also regularly performs on the autoharp as part of her role in Ghost Quartet, a four-person song cycle composed by Dave Malloy.

French singer/songwriter Pomme performs with an autoharp for songs such as &quot;les oiseaux&quot; &quot;On brulera&quot; &quot;Umbrella&quot; and many more

<doc id="233106" wikidata="Q3437967" url="?curid=233106" title="USS La Salle (AGF-3)">
<text>The second USS &quot;La Salle&quot; (LPD-3/AGF-3) was built as a and entered service with the United States Navy in 1964. &quot;La Salle&quot; was named for the city in Illinois that was in turn named after René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. &quot;La Salle&quot; saw service in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and throughout international waters in the Middle East and Europe. The vessel served as a command ship for Joint Task Force Middle East and as flagship for the Sixth Fleet. In 2005 the ship was decommissioned and sunk as a target ship off the Atlantic coast of the United States in 2007.

==Construction and career==
Her keel was laid down by New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, on 2 April 1962. She was launched on 3 August 1963 sponsored by Mrs. Victor M. Longstreet, and commissioned on 22 February 1964.

===Amphibious transport, 1964–1968===
After shakedown and training in the Caribbean Sea and off Norfolk, Virginia, the amphibious transport dock departed Norfolk on 9 October to participate in &quot;Operation Steel Pike I&quot;, a complex training exercise involving over 80 ships and United States and Spanish troops. It closed the coast of Spain off Huelva on 26 October, and embarked Under Secretary of the Navy Paul B. Fay, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Horacio Rivero, Commandant of the Marine Corps General Wallace M. Greene, and Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Congressman Mendel Rivers to watch the landing operations.

The exercise completed on 4 November, &quot;La Salle&quot; joined the 6th Fleet at Naples, Italy, for amphibious operations and joint NATO training. It returned to Norfolk on 13 March 1965.

With then-Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., Commander Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet embarked, &quot;La Salle&quot; sailed on 1 May for the Dominican Republic during the revolution where she served as command and control for the operation, returning to Norfolk on 1 June. Three weeks later it joined the Caribbean Amphibious Ready Squadron, returning to home port on 21 September to begin training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean.

Through the first half of 1966, &quot;La Salle&quot; continued operating off the east coast. July and September were spent in Norfolk for upkeep and modifications, with further exercises following. On 3 November, she recovered a Gemini 2-MOL test space capsule near Ascension Island. This was the Gemini 2 space capsule&#x27;s second flight. This was returned to Florida&#x27;s Cape Kennedy, and the rest of the year spent on local operations in the Atlantic. &quot;La Salle&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 9 January 1967 for repairs and remained there until 20 March. The remainder of 1967 and the first three quarters of 1968 were spent conducting various exercises and port visits which ranged along the entire Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts and into the Caribbean as well. On 2 November she put into Norfolk to prepare for an extended deployment with the Sixth Fleet. Departing 13 November, she steamed first to Morehead City, North Carolina, and then began her voyage to the Mediterranean Sea.

===Command ship, 1972–2005===


&quot;La Salle&quot; was converted to a &quot;miscellaneous command ship&quot; and given the hull classification symbol AGF-3 after an overhaul in 1972. After re-fitting in 1972 she was sent to homeport in Bahrain and serve in a mainly surveillance capacity, with as many as 60 NSA personnel assigned to the ship, at a time when one of America&#x27;s main allies in the Middle East, the Shah of Iran, controlled the Persian Gulf. To accommodate all the extra electronic equipment, the &quot;La Salle&quot; was painted white to reflect the heat of its operating environment. Admiral William J. Crowe, who later became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Ronald Reagan, was named Commander Middle East Force and assigned to &quot;La Salle&quot; to serve in this sensitive role. In this time before the Gulf War, piracy off the east coast of Africa and the re-activation of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, only &quot;La Salle&quot; along with two U.S. Navy destroyers dispatched from the U.S. east coast on a six-month rotating basis were routinely on patrol in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and the general Indian Ocean regions. &quot;La Salle&quot; was considered by the Navy to be isolated duty and anything but a plum assignment by its crew. To symbolize its relatively minor status as a fighting ship at this time, &quot;La Salle&quot;″s nickname, emblazoned on T-shirts sold in the ship&#x27;s store and wryly smiled about by those many of the ship&#x27;s crew who wore them, unofficially became &quot;The Great White Whale&quot;. By the time of Gulf War the ship had become known, more appropriately to its future operational roles, by its new nickname &quot;The Great White Ghost of the Arabian Coast&quot;.

In 1979, &quot;La Salle&quot; assisted in the evacuation of 260 American and foreign national civilians from the Iranian seaport of Bandar Abbas, and subsequently became the focal point of U.S. activity in the Persian Gulf at the outset of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. The ship returned to the United States in late 1980 for the first time in almost nine years.

After undergoing an extensive overhaul in Philadelphia, &quot;La Salle&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf and resumed her role as the flagship for Commander, Middle East Forces (COMMIDEASTFOR) in June 1983, relieving . In 1984, the ship conducted minesweeping operations in the Red Sea in response to attempts to disrupt shipping lanes for which it was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation, and in 1986, conducted contingency operations in the Gulf of Aden during Yemen&#x27;s civil war.

After the Iraqi missile attack on the frigate in May 1987, &quot;La Salle&quot; provided the primary firefighting rescue assistance to the ship. Later that year &quot;La Salle&quot; served as the staging ship for the seizure of the &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; minelaying vessel on 21 September, including receiving the detained crew members for later repatriation, and the mines from the Iran Ajr for intelligence exploitation. She was the flagship of Rear Admiral Harold Bernsen during this engagement, and among other duties hosted &quot;members of a Pentagon news media pool&quot;.

In June 1988, after spending months in Japan for a major overhaul on the engines, &quot;La Salle&quot; was heading back to the Persian Gulf. On 3 July 1988 the cruiser shot down an Airbus passenger aircraft, Iran Air Flight 655, while &quot;La Salle&quot; was in Subic Bay, Philippines for repairs. It became urgent for the ship to return to Bahrain, and be positioned off the coast of Saudi Arabia. &quot;La Salle&quot; passed &quot;Vincennes&quot; in the Strait of Hormuz, soon after the incident. On 21 July 1988, &quot;La Salle&quot; officially assumed Commander of Middle East Forces and three generals and an admiral were assigned to it. An Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was awarded to the crew members.

During Operation Desert Shield, the ship assumed the responsibility of commanding and coordinating the multinational Maritime Intercept Force. Returning to a conventional gray paint scheme, &quot;La Salle&quot; assumed responsibilities as the flagship for Commander, Sixth Fleet on 8 November 1994. Homeported in Gaeta, Italy, &quot;La Salle&quot; was fully engaged in operations throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas in its role of supporting Commander, U.S. 6th Fleet and Strike Force and Logistics South.

Following the September 11 attacks, &quot;La Salle&quot; commenced her role in the war on terrorism, serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

One of the ship&#x27;s last major assignments was supporting NATO-led efforts to control the international waters off Greece during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. On 25 February 2005, she was relieved by as the U.S. Sixth Fleet command ship.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
&quot;La Salle&quot; was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia on 27 May 2005, with Captain (later Vice Admiral) Herman Shelanski as its last commanding officer and former &quot;La Salle&quot; commanding officer, Rear Admiral Mark Milliken, as the decommissioning ceremony guest speaker. It was sunk as a target by the United States Navy on 11 April 2007 during a scheduled fleet exercise off the Atlantic coast.

<text>Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (23 October 1773 – 26 January 1850) was a Scottish judge and literary critic.

==Life==

He was born at 7 Charles Street near Potterow in south Edinburgh, the son of George Jeffrey, a clerk in the Court of Session (first clerk to Robert Sinclair, advocate).

After attending the Royal High School for six years, he studied at the University of Glasgow from 1787 to May 1789, and at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, from September 1791 to June 1792. He had begun the study of law at Edinburgh before going to Oxford, and returned to it afterwards. He became a member of the Speculative Society, where he measured himself in debate with Sir Walter Scott, Lord Brougham, Francis Horner, the Marquess of Lansdowne, Lord Kinnaird and others. He was admitted to the Scottish bar in December 1794, but, having abandoned the Tory principles in which he had been educated, he found that his Whig politics hampered his legal prospects.

After his lack of success at the bar he went to London in 1798 to try his hand at journalism, but without success; he also failed in his attempts to obtain a salaried position. His marriage to Catherine Wilson in 1801 made the question of a settled income even more pressing. A project for a new review, brought up by Sydney Smith in Jeffrey&#x27;s flat (on Buccleuch Place) in the presence of Henry Brougham (afterwards Lord Brougham), Francis Horner and others, resulted in the appearance on 10 October 1802 of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;.

At the outset the &quot;Review&quot; did not have an editor. The first three numbers were effectively edited by Sydney Smith. When he left for England the work devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, by an arrangement with Archibald Constable, the publisher, was eventually appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most of those involved were Whigs; but, although the general bias of the &quot;Review&quot; was towards social and political reforms, it was at first so little of a party organ that it numbered Sir Walter Scott among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis was given to its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of an article by Jeffrey himself on the work of &quot;Don Pedro Cevallos on the French Usurpation of Spain&quot;. This article expressed despair of the success of the British arms in Spain, and Scott at once withdrew his subscription, the &quot;Quarterly&quot; was soon afterwards started in opposition. According to Lord Cockburn the effect of the first number of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; was &quot;electrical.&quot; The English reviews were at that time practically publishers&#x27; organs, with articles by hack writers instructed to obey the publishers&#x27; interests. The &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, on the other hand, enlisted a brilliant and independent staff of contributors, guided by the editor, not the publisher. They received sixteen guineas a sheet (sixteen printed pages), increased subsequently to twenty-five guineas in many cases, instead of the two guineas earned by London reviewers. The review was not limited to literary criticism and became the accredited organ of moderate Whig public opinion. The particular work which was the basis of an article was in many cases merely the occasion for the exposition of the author&#x27;s views on politics, social subjects, ethics or literature. These general principles and the novelty of the method ensured the success of the undertaking even after the original circle of exceptionally able men who founded it had been dispersed. It had a circulation of 12,000. Jeffrey&#x27;s editorship lasted about twenty-six years, ceasing with the ninety-eighth number, published in June 1829, when he resigned in favour of Macvey Napier.

Jeffrey&#x27;s own contributions numbered two hundred, all except six written before his resignation. He wrote quickly, at odd moments of leisure and with little special preparation. Great fluency and ease of diction, considerable warmth of imagination and moral sentiment, and a sharp eye for any oddity of style or violation of the accepted canons of good taste, made his criticisms pungent and effective. But the essential narrowness and timidity of his general outlook prevented him from detecting and estimating latent forces, either in politics or in matters strictly intellectual and moral; and this lack of understanding and sympathy accounts for his distrust and dislike of the passion and fancy of Shelley and Keats, and for his praise of the half-hearted and elegant romanticism of Samuel Rogers and Thomas Campbell.

A criticism in the sixteenth number of the &quot;Review&quot; on the morality of Thomas Moore&#x27;s poems led in 1806 to a duel between the two authors at Chalk Farm. The proceedings were stopped by the police, and Jeffrey&#x27;s pistol was found to contain no bullet. The affair led to a warm friendship, and Moore contributed to the Review, while Jeffrey made ample amends in a later article on &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; (1817).

Jeffrey&#x27;s wife died in 1805, and in 1810 he became acquainted with Charlotte, daughter of Charles Wilkes of New York, and great-niece of John Wilkes. When she returned to the United States, Jeffrey followed her, and they were married in 1813. Before returning to Scotland, they visited several of the chief American cities, and his experience strengthened Jeffrey in the conciliatory policy he had advocated towards the States.

Notwithstanding the increasing success of the &quot;Review&quot;, Jeffrey continued to look to the bar as the chief field of his ambition. His literary reputation helped his professional advancement. His practice extended rapidly in the civil and criminal courts, and he regularly appeared before the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. As an advocate his sharpness and rapidity of insight gave him a formidable advantage in detecting the weaknesses of a witness and the vulnerable points of his opponent&#x27;s case, while he grouped his own arguments with an admirable eye to effect, especially excelling in eloquent closing appeals to a jury. Jeffrey was twice, in 1820 and 1822, elected Rector of the University of Glasgow. In 1829 he was chosen dean of the Faculty of Advocates. On the return of the Whigs to power in 1830 he became Lord Advocate, and entered parliament at a by-election in January 1831 as member for the Perth burghs. The election was overturned on petition, and in March he was returned at a by-election for Malton, a borough in the interest of Lord Fitzwilliam. He was re-elected in Malton at the general election in May 1831, but was also returned for the Perth burghs and chose to sit for the latter. After the passing of the Scottish Reform Bill, which he introduced in parliament, he was returned for Edinburgh in December 1832. At this time he was living at 24 Moray Place in the west end of Edinburgh.

 His parliamentary career, which, though not brilliantly successful, had won him high general esteem, was terminated by his elevation to the judicial bench as Lord Jeffrey in May 1834. In 1842 he was moved to the first division of the Court of Session. On the disruption of the Scottish Church he took the side of the seceders, giving a judicial opinion in their favour, afterwards reversed by the House of Lords.

He died at Edinburgh and was buried in the &quot;Lords Row&quot; near the western wall in Dean Cemetery on the west side of the city.

Some of his contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; appeared in four volumes in 1844 and 1845. This selection includes the essay on &quot;Beauty&quot; contributed to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. &quot;The Life of Lord Jeffrey, with a Selection from his Correspondence&quot;, by Lord Cockburn, appeared in 1852 in 2 vols. See also the &quot;Selected Correspondence of Macvey Napier&quot; (1877); the sketch of Jeffrey in Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, vol. ii. (1881); and an essay by Lewis E Gates in &quot;Three Studies in Literature&quot; (New York, 1899).

==Memorials==

Jeffrey Street (a planned street of 1868) in Edinburgh is named in his memory.

A bust by Sir John Steell stands on the east wall of Parliament Hall, behind St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh.

==In Fiction==
The character Beau Nardi in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825, was based on Francis Jeffrey.

==Family==

Francis Jeffrey&#x27;s first wife, Catherine Wilson, died 8 August 1805, aged only 28, and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, with their infant child George (d.1802). His brother, John Jeffrey (1775-1848) is also buried there.

His sister, Marian, married Dr Thomas Brown of Lanfine and Waterhaughs FRSE in 1800.

<text>The [[Siddur]] (prayerbook) of [[Saadia Gaon]] is the earliest surviving attempt to transcribe the weekly ritual of Jewish prayers for weekdays, Sabbaths, and festivals (apart from the prayer book of Amram ben Sheshna, of which there is no authoritative text). The text also contains liturgical poetry by Saadia, as well as Judeo-Arabic commentary. There is no known extant manuscript of the entire text, though there is a near complete manuscript in Oxford. Fragments have also been found in the Cairo Geniza. The prayerbook apparently served as a basis for later efforts to codify the Jewish prayer ritual and set it down in writing and was imitated by later authors.

An edition based on these manuscripts has been published by Davidson, Assaf and Yoel in Jerusalem in 1941. The Arabic portions are accompanied by translations into Hebrew in facing columns.

According to David Bar-Hayim, the &quot;Birkat Hamazon&quot; in the siddur of Saadia Gaon is the shortest known fixed Jewish grace after meals, today.

<doc id="233114" wikidata="Q1677782" url="?curid=233114" title="Jacques Dubois">
<text>Jacques Dubois (Latinised as Jacobus Sylvius; 1478 – 14 January 1555) was a French anatomist. Dubois was the first to describe venous valves, although their function was later discovered by William Harvey. He was the brother of Franciscus Sylvius Ambianus (François Dubois; c. 1483 – 1536), professor of humanities at the Collège de Tournai, Paris.

== First years ==
The origins of this anatomist are vague. He was probably born in 1478 in Loeuilly, a small town near Amiens, the seventh in a family of fifteen. His father had been a weaver. At a young age he studied Ancient Greek with Hermonymus of Sparta and Janus Lascaris, Hebrew with François Vatable, and mathematics with Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples, and gradually became a leading figure in French humanism, where he was famous for his excellent knowledge of these disciplines.

==Early grammar of French==
Dubois was the author of the first grammar of the French language to be published in France. The title of this work was &quot;In linguam gallicam isagωge, una cum eiusdem Grammatica latino-gallica, ex hebræis, græcis et latinis authoribus&quot; [&quot;Introduction to the French language, with a Latin-French grammar of the same, based on Hebrew, Greek and Latin authors&quot;], published in Paris in early 1531, less than a year after the very first French grammar, by John Palsgrave, was published in London.

==From philosophy to medicine==
Dubois was known for his hard work, and eloquence. He studied languages and mathematics at the University of Paris; but feeling that the rewards were inadequate, Dubois abandoned scholarship for medicine. He acquired his anatomical knowledge thanks to Jean Fagault, a famous physician of Paris and also dean of the Faculty of Medicine. While studying under Fagault, Dubois began his career as a professor with a course explaining the work of Hippocrates and Galen. These lessons concerned anatomy and were taught at the (in Tréguier). The success of his lectures turned out to be so remarkable that the faculty of the University of Paris protested that he had not yet obtained a college degree. For this reason Sylvius went to the University of Montpellier, where he enrolled in November 1529. He received his M.B. in 1529 and his M.D. from Montpellier in 1530.

Once he obtained his degree he returned to Paris, but he was again blocked by the Faculty, which decreed that the anatomist should have obtained an M.B. from the University of Paris before returning to his lessons. On 28 June 1531 Sylvius incorporated an M.B. at Paris and was able to resume its course in anatomy. In 1550, when Vidus Vidius departed for Italy, he was appointed to succeed him as Professor of Surgery in charge of the new Collège Royal in Paris. This appointment was granted by Henry II of Valois.

Sylvius was an admirer of Galen, and interpreted the anatomical and physiological writings of that author in preference to giving demonstrations from the subject. He died on 14 January 1555 in Paris.

==Sylvius as a teacher==
Sylvius was not only an eloquent professor, but also a demonstration teacher. He was the first professor to teach anatomy of a human corpse, in France.

His biggest intellectual flaw was his blind reverence for the ancient authors. He treated the writings of Galen as if they were wholly sacred, he would believe that if a corpse showed structures different from those described by Galen, the error was not in the texts, but in the corpse, or the structure of the human body that had changed over the centuries. In one of his works, &quot;Ordo et Ratio Ordinis Legendis Hippocratis et Galeni Libris&quot;, Sylvius says that the anatomy of Galen was infallible, that his treatise &quot;De Usu Partium&quot; was divine and that further progress in anatomy would have been impossible.

Andreas Vesalius, who was his (frustrated) pupil, states that his manner of teaching was calculated neither to advance the science nor to rectify the mistakes of his predecessors. A human body was never seen in Dubois&#x27; anatomical theatre. The carcasses of dogs and other animals were the materials from which he taught. It was so difficult to obtain human bones, that Vesalius and his fellow-students had to collect them themselves from the Cimetière des Innocents and other cemeteries. Without these, they must have committed numerous errors in acquiring the first principles.

Though Jean Riolan (1577–1657) contradicted these comments and accused Vesalius of ingratitude, it is certain that the frustrations that Vesalius experienced were the basis for which he later traveled to Padua and became a famous anatomist himself. Only in Italy were the opportunities of inspecting the human body frequent enough as to facilitate the study of the science. Charles Estienne also attacked his old teacher and assured that Sylvius was greedy. Some other pupils of Sylvius defended his teaching and work, specially Louis Vasse and Michel de Villeneuve, the latter being considered by Johann Winter von Andernach (colleague and friend of Sylvius) the best galenist of Paris and second anatomist after Vesalius. Louis Vassé denounced the attacks of Vesalius and Estienne, and affirmed they had learnt all they knew by Sylvius&#x27; lessons. Vasse explains the nature of Sylvius&#x27; influence over his unruly audience this way:

&quot;This depended not so much on his splendid use of the Latin tongue as upon the exceptional clarity of his thought. He was, moreover, never tired of teaching and so taught that none of his students ever tired of learning. He had an astonishing power of enabling them to grasp and see quite clearly that which a moment before had seemed impenetrable and terribly involved.&quot;

This period was a time of fierce debate between Galenists and the new body of thought on anatomy. The conservative Riolan attacked William Harvey with equal fervour.

==Contributions to anatomy==
Sylvius made a valuable service by giving a name to the muscles, which until then had simply been referred to by numbers. These numbers were arbitrarily assigned by different authors. He was the first anatomist to publish descriptions of satisfactory pterygoid process and the sphenoid bone and clinoid bone tear. He gave a good description of the sphenoid sinus in an adult, but denied its existence in children. Sylvius also wrote about the vertebrae, but described incorrectly the sternum. Although the cerebral aqueduct (Aqueduct of Sylvius) and Sylvian (lateral) sulcus of the brain have been said to be his contributions to anatomy, the aqueduct was described by Galen nearly 1300 years before, albeit the name aqueduct in this context was first mentioned by another Sylvius (Franciscus Sylvius, 1614–1672), who apparently also described the sulcus which bears his name.

<text>The Arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis) is a widespread leaf warbler in birch or mixed birch forest near water throughout its breeding range in Fennoscandia and the northern Palearctic. It has established a foothold in North America, breeding in Alaska. This warbler is strongly migratory; the entire population winters in southeast Asia. It therefore has one of the longest migrations of any Old World insectivorous bird.

It traditionally included populations that breed in Kamchatka, the Kuril Islands and Japan, but genetic and vocal evidence strongly suggested these should be treated as separate species, and are all now considered distinct with the Kamchatka leaf warbler in Kamchatka, Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands, and the Japanese leaf warbler in Japan (except Hokkaido).

The nest is on the ground in a low shrub. Like most Old World warblers, this small passerine is insectivorous.

This is a typical leaf warbler in appearance, greyish-green above and off-white below. Its single wing bar distinguishes it from most similar species except the greenish warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides&quot;. It is larger than that species and has a heavier, dagger-like bill, with a dark tip to the lower mandible. Its song is a fast trill.

This species occurs as an autumn vagrant in western Europe and is annual on Great Britain. There were 225 confirmed arctic warbler sightings in Britain between 1958 and 2001.

The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;borealis&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;northern&quot;.

<text>Sir Spencer Walpole KCB, FBA (6 February 1839 – 7 July 1907) was an English historian and civil servant.

==Background==
He came of the younger branch of the &quot;de facto&quot; first prime minister, Robert Walpole who revived the Whig Party, being a patrilineal descendant of one of his brothers, the 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton. His father Spencer Horatio Walpole (1807–1898) was three times Home Secretary under the 14th Earl of Derby. Through his mother he was a grandson of Spencer Perceval, the Tory prime minister. The only mainstream political parties in his lifetime which were at that time taking shape as the Liberal and Conservative parties were therefore closely connected to him at birth, and each party icon formed one half of his name.

==Career==
Spencer Walpole was educated at Eton, and from 1858 to 1867 was a clerk in the War Office, then becoming an inspector of fisheries. In 1867 he married Marion Jane Murray; they had one son and one daughter. In 1882 he was made lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Man, and from 1893 to 1899 he was secretary to the Post Office. In 1898 he was knighted.

A most efficient public servant and in private life well-conversed, Walpole became a successfully published historian. His family connections gave him a natural affinity for the study of public affairs, and their mingling of Whig and Tory policies of past and present contributed to a deliberately reasoned, judicious and balanced view of English political figures – he inclined, however, to the Whig or moderate Liberal side, including in his writing. His principal work, the &quot;History of England from 1815&quot; (1878–1886), in six volumes, was carried down to 1858, and was continued in his &quot;History of Twenty-Five Years&quot; (4 vol. 1904).

Among his other publications come his lives of Spencer Perceval (1894) and Lord John Russell (1889), and a volume of valuable &quot;Studies in Biography&quot; (1906).

His name is commemorated in Walpole Park in Ealing, formerly the grounds of his family home Pitzhanger Manor, both of which were purchased by Ealing Council in 1899.

<doc id="233123" wikidata="Q460229" url="?curid=233123" title="Greenish warbler">
<text>The greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) is a widespread leaf warbler with a breeding range in northeastern Europe, and temperate to subtropical continental Asia. This warbler is strongly migratory and winters in India. It is not uncommon as a spring or early autumn vagrant in Western Europe and is annually seen in Great Britain. In Central Europe large numbers of vagrant birds are encountered in some years; some of these may stay to breed, as a handful of pairs does each year in Germany.

Like all leaf warblers, it was formerly placed in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage, but now belongs to the new leaf-warbler family Phylloscopidae. The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;trochiloides&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;trokhalos&quot;, &quot;bowed&quot;, and &quot;-oides&quot; &quot;resembling&quot;, from the similarity to the willow warbler, &quot;P. trochilus&quot;. The English name of this species provides a perfect argument in favour of the capitalisation of species names (i.e. treating them as proper nouns), a convention which is generally applied in scientific literature. The decapitalised &quot;greenish warbler&quot; is equally descriptive of many bird species across multiple families, whereas a capitalised &quot;Greenish Warbler&quot; shows unambiguously that &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides&quot; is under discussion.

==Description and ecology==
This is a typical leaf warbler in appearance, grayish-green above and off-white below. The single wing bar found in the southern and western populations distinguishes them from most similar species (except Arctic warbler &quot;P. borealis&quot;). It is slightly smaller than that species and has a thinner bill, without a dark tip to the lower mandible. A latitude-based analysis of wintering birds indicated that more northerly &quot;P. trochiloides&quot; are smaller, i.e. this species does not seem to follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule.

Its song is a high jerky trill, in some populations containing a sequence of down- and more rarely up slurred notes.

It breeds in lowland deciduous or mixed forest; non-breeding birds in the warmer parts of its range may move to montane habitat in summer. Individuals from southeast of the Himalayas are for example quite often seen in Bhutan during the hot months, typically in humid Bhutan Fir (&quot;Abies densa&quot;) forest up to about 3,800 meters ASL or more, but they do not breed there and return again to the adjacent subtropical lowlands in winter.

The nest is on the ground in low shrub. Like its relatives, this small passerine is insectivorous.

===Subspecies and evolution===

It has a number of subspecies, of which &quot;P. t . viridianus&quot; is the most familiar in Europe. As it seems, it is a ring species, with populations diverging east- and westwards of the Tibetan Plateau, later meeting on the northern side. Their relationships are therefore fairly confusing:

*Eastern group: greenish warblers
** &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides trochiloides&quot;: greenish warbler
***Southern rim of the Himalaya eastwards from Nepal into W China.
***Dusky greyish green above, often traces of second wing bar.
** &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides obscuratus&quot;: dull-green warbler
***Intermediate between &quot;trochiloides&quot; and two-barred warbler.
***Gansu and surroundings, China.
** &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides ludlowi&quot;
*Western group: green warblers
** &quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus&quot;: western greenish warbler
***Breeds Western Siberia to north-east Europe; at east of range south to NW India.
***Dull green above, with yellowish supercilium, throat, breast and faint wing bar.

The groups&#x27; origin lies probably in the Himalayan region, where &quot;trochiloides&quot; is found. This taxon is close to the parapatric &quot;obscuratus&quot;, and to &quot;plumbeitarsus&quot; which is geographically separated from &quot;obscuratus&quot;; they all can (and in the case of the former two do naturally) hybridize. &quot;P. t. plumbeitarsus&quot; is often split as distinct species, as it does not hybridize with &quot;viridianus&quot; in the narrow zone in the western Sayan Mountains where their ranges overlap.

But phylogenetically, the western taxa are even more distinct. However, there is some gene flow between &quot;trochiloides&quot; and &quot;viridianus&quot; also, with their hybrids being especially common in Baltistan; which are now considered as a distinct subspecies &quot;ludlowi&quot;. The green warbler &quot;P. nitidus&quot;, now considered as a distinct species, is a mountain isolate that diverged from ancestral &quot;viridianus&quot;.

Song structure differs mainly between greenish warbler and two-barred warbler, which was formerly considered conspecific. The former has a fairly uniform, long, and warbling song. Around the Himalayas, song structure is similar, but songs are generally shorter. Two-barred warbler, on the other hand, has a long song that can be clearly divided into a warbling part, followed by a series of up- and downslurred notes. The songs of &quot;obscuratus&quot; and &quot;ludlowi&quot;, are short, but contain the downslur elements too; in the latter, they uniquely appear at the start of the song.

<text>The pater familias, also written as paterfamilias (: &quot;patres familias&quot;), was the head of a Roman family. The &quot;pater familias&quot; was the oldest living male in a household, and could legally exercise autocratic authority over his extended family. The term is Latin for &quot;father of the family&quot; or the &quot;owner of the family estate&quot;. The form is archaic in Latin, preserving the old genitive ending in (see Latin declension), whereas in classical Latin the normal first declension genitive singular ending was . The &quot;pater familias&quot; always had to be a Roman citizen.

Roman law and tradition (&quot;mos majorum&quot;) established the power of the &quot;pater familias&quot; within the community of his own extended &quot;familia&quot;. In Roman family law, the term &quot;Patria potestas&quot; (Latin: “power of a father”) refers to this concept. He held legal privilege over the property of the &quot;familia&quot;, and varying levels of authority over his dependents: these included his wife and children, certain other relatives through blood or adoption, clients, freedmen and slaves. The same &quot;mos majorum&quot; moderated his authority and determined his responsibilities to his own &quot;familia&quot; and to the broader community. He had a duty to father and raise healthy children as future citizens of Rome, to maintain the moral propriety and well-being of his household, to honour his clan and ancestral gods and to dutifully participate—and if possible, serve—in Rome&#x27;s political, religious and social life. In effect, the &quot;pater familias&quot; was expected to be a good citizen. In theory at least, he held powers of life and death over every member of his extended &quot;familia&quot; through ancient right. In practice, the extreme form of this right was seldom exercised. It was eventually limited by law. 

In the Roman tradition, the term has appeared mostly in legal texts, and to a lesser extent, in literary texts. In both types of discourses, the term has been most commonly used to refer to the “estate owner,” a title considered conceptually separate from his familial relations.

==Roman &quot;familia&quot;==
The Roman household was conceived of as an economic and juridical unit or estate: &quot;familia&quot; originally meant the group of the &quot;famuli&quot; (the &quot;servi&quot;, the slaves of a rural estate) living under the same roof. That meaning later expanded to indicate the &quot;familia&quot; as the basic Roman social unit, which might include the &quot;domus&quot; (house or home) but was legally distinct from it: a &quot;familia&quot; might own one or several homes. All members and properties of a &quot;familia&quot; were subject to the authority of a &quot;pater familias&quot;: his legal, social and religious position defined &quot;familia&quot; as a microcosm of the Roman state. In Roman law, the &quot;potestas&quot; of the &quot;pater familias&quot; was official but distinct from that of magistrates.

Only a Roman citizen held the status of &quot;pater familias&quot;, and there could be only one holder of that office within a household. He was responsible for its well-being, reputation and legal and moral propriety. The entire &quot;familia&quot; was expected to adhere to the core principles and laws of the Twelve Tables, which the &quot;pater familias&quot; had a duty to exemplify, enjoin and, if necessary, enforce, so within the &quot;familia&quot; Republican law and tradition (&quot;mos majorum&quot;) allowed him powers of life and death (&quot;vitae necisque potestas&quot;). He was also obliged to observe the constraints imposed by Roman custom and law on all &quot;potestas&quot;. His decisions should be obtained through counsel, consultation and consent within the &quot;familia&quot;, which were decisions by committee (&quot;consilium&quot;). The family &quot;consilia&quot; probably involved the most senior members of his own household, especially his wife, and, if necessary, his peers and seniors within his extended clan (&quot;gens&quot;).

Augustus&#x27;s legislation on the morality of marriage co-opted the traditional &quot;potestas&quot; of the &quot;pater familias&quot;. Augustus was not only Rome&#x27;s &quot;princeps&quot; but also its father (&quot;pater patriae&quot;). As such, he was responsible for the entire Roman &quot;familia&quot;. Rome&#x27;s survival required that citizens produce children. That could not be left to individual conscience. The falling birth rate was considered a marker of degeneracy and self-indulgence, particularly among the elite, who were supposed to set an example. &quot;Lex Julia maritandis ordinibus&quot; compelled marriage upon men and women within specified age ranges and remarriage on the divorced and bereaved within certain time limits. The &quot;Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis&quot; severely penalised adulterous wives and any husbands who tolerated such behaviour. The &quot;Lex Papia Poppaea&quot; extended and modified the laws in relation to intermarriage between social classes and inheritance. Compliance was rewarded and exceptional public duty brought exemption, but dictatorial compulsion was deeply unpopular and quite impractical. The laws were later softened in theory and practise, but the imperial &quot;quaestio perpetua&quot; remained. Its public magistrates now legally over-rode the traditional rights of the family &quot;concilium&quot; and &quot;pater familias&quot;. The principate shows a clear trend towards the erosion of individual &quot;patria potestas&quot; and the increasing intrusion of the state into the juridical and executive independence of the &quot;familia&quot; under its &quot;pater&quot;.

==As priest of &quot;familia&quot;, &quot;gens&quot; and &quot;genius&quot;==

The domestic responsibilities of the &quot;pater familias&quot; included his priestly duties (&quot;sacra familiae&quot;) to his &quot;household gods&quot; (the Lares and Penates) and the ancestral gods of his own &quot;gens&quot;. The latter were represented by the di parentes as ancestral shades of the departed, and by the genius cult. &quot;Genius&quot; has been interpreted as the essential, heritable spirit (or divine essence, or soul) and generative power that suffused the &quot;gens&quot; and each of its members. As the singular, lawful head of a family derived from a gens, the &quot;pater familias&quot; embodied and expressed its &quot;genius&quot; through his pious fulfillment of ancestral obligations. The &quot;pater familias&quot; was therefore owed a reciprocal duty of &quot;genius&quot; cult by his entire &quot;familia&quot;. He in his turn conferred &quot;genius&quot; and the duty of &quot;sacra familiae&quot; to his children—whether by blood or by adoption.

Roman religious law defined the religious rites of &quot;familia&quot; as &quot;sacra privata&quot; (funded by the &quot;familia&quot; rather than the state) and &quot;unofficial&quot; (not a rite of state office or magistracy, though the state &quot;pontifices&quot; and &quot;censor&quot; might intervene if the observation of sacra privata was lax or improper). The responsibility for funding and executing &quot;sacra privata&quot; therefore fell to the head of the household and no other. As well as observance of common rites and festivals (including those marked by domestic rites), each family had its own unique internal religious calendar—marking the formal acceptance of infant children, coming of age, marriages, deaths and burials. In rural estates, the entire &quot;familia&quot; would gather to offer sacrifice(s) to the gods for the protection and fertility of fields and livestock. All such festivals and offerings were presided over by the &quot;pater familias&quot;.

==Wife==

The legal &quot;potestas&quot; of the &quot;pater familias&quot; over his wife depended on the form of marriage between them. In the Early Republic, a wife was &quot;handed over&quot; from the legal control of her father to the legal control of (the father of) her husband in the form of marriage &quot;cum manu&quot; (Latin &quot;cum manu&quot; means &quot;with hand&quot;). If the man divorced his wife, he or his father had to give the dowry and the wife back to the &quot;pater familias&quot; of the wife&#x27;s former family. By the Late Republic, &quot;manus&quot; marriage had become rare, and a woman legally remained part of her birth family, under the hand of their &quot;pater familias&quot;.

Women emancipated from the &quot;potestas&quot; of a &quot;pater familias&quot; were independent by law (&quot;sui iuris&quot;) but had a male guardian appointed to them. A woman &quot;sui iuris&quot; had the right to take legal action on her own behalf but not to administer legal matters for others.

==Children==
The laws of the Twelve Tables required the &quot;pater familias&quot; to ensure that &quot;obviously deformed&quot; infants were put to death. The survival of congenitally disabled adults, conspicuously evidenced among the elite by the partially-lame Emperor Claudius, demonstrates that personal choice was exercised in the matter.

The &quot;pater familias&quot; had the power to sell his children into slavery; Roman law provided, however, that if a child had been sold as a slave three times, he was no longer subject to &quot;patria potestas&quot;. The &quot;pater familias&quot; had the power to approve or reject marriages of his sons and daughters; however, an edict of Emperor Augustus provided that the &quot;pater familias&quot; could not withhold that permission lightly.

The &quot;filii familias&quot; (children of the family) could include the biological and adopted children of the &quot;pater familias&quot; and his siblings.

Because of their extended rights (their &quot;longa manus&quot;, literally &quot;long hand&quot;), the &quot;patres familias&quot; also had a series of extra duties: duties towards the &quot;filii&quot; and the slaves, but some of the duties were recognized not by the original &quot;ius civile&quot; but only by the &quot;ius gentium&quot;, specially directed to foreigners, or by the &quot;ius honorarium&quot;, the law of the &quot;Magistratus&quot;, especially the &quot;Praetor&quot;, which would emerge only in a latter period of Roman law.

Adult &quot;filii&quot; remained under the authority of their &quot;pater&quot; and could not themselves acquire the rights of a &quot;pater familias&quot; while he lived. Legally, any property acquired by individual family members (sons, daughters or slaves) was acquired for the family estate: the &quot;pater familias&quot; held sole rights to its disposal and sole responsibility for the consequences, including personal forfeiture of rights and property through debt. Those who lived in their own households at the time of the death of the &quot;pater&quot; succeeded to the status of &quot;pater familias&quot; over their respective households (&quot;pater familias sui iuris&quot;) even if they were only in their teens. Children &quot;emancipated&quot; by a pater familias were effectively disinherited. If a &quot;pater familias&quot; died intestate, his children were entitled to an equal share of his estate. If a will was left, children could contest the estate.

Over time, the absolute authority of the &quot;pater familias&quot; weakened, and rights that theoretically existed were no longer enforced or insisted upon. The power over life and death was abolished, the right of punishment was moderated and the sale of children was restricted to cases of extreme necessity. Under Emperor Hadrian, a father who killed his son was stripped of both his citizenship and all its attendant rights, had his property confiscated and was permanently exiled.

== Slavery ==

=== Roman context ===
The original classical Roman definition of &quot;familia&quot; referred to “a body of slaves,” and did not refer to wives and children. The classical legal concept of &quot;pater familias&quot; as “head of household” derived from this early conception of &quot;familia&quot; and, thus, from the legal relationship between slaveowners and their enslaved laborers rather than that between fathers and children. Since the early classical period, Roman writers and jurists have interpreted ancient writers’ invocation of &quot;pater familias&quot; as the basis of the concept of “head of household”—over the alternative Latin word for slaveowner, &quot;dominus&quot;—as a purposeful choice, intended to mitigate the harsh connotations that the act of slaveholding conferred onto heads of households and expanding the applicability of the term to non-enslaved members of the household. As a semantic term, &quot;pater familias&quot; thus connoted heads of household who were thought to combine the affective tenderness of a father with the stern coercion of a slaveowner in ordering their households.

As Roman jurists began to articulate the legal conception of &quot;pater familias&quot; from the early classical period onwards, the minimum qualification for assuming the status of &quot;pater familias&quot; came to be understood as one’s capacity to own property. However, in Roman law, this was considered a distinct dimension of the &quot;pater familias&quot;’ authority from their capacity to hold dominion over enslaved persons. While both enslaved people and the estate itself were considered part of the &quot;familia&quot; unit over which &quot;pater familias&quot; held authority, they were recognized as distinct from family members (wives, children, and grandchildren). Despite these distinctions, what all members of the household shared was their subjecthood to the authority, or &quot;potestas&quot;, of the &quot;pater familias&quot;. By the second century, A.D., the distinction between family members and enslaved persons residing in the same household had lessened, even as the &quot;patria potestas&quot; also weakened over time.

&quot;Patres familias&quot; wielded complete and separate authority over members of their households, including their enslaved laborers. In cases of adjudicating legal transgressions committed by enslaved persons, &quot;patres familias&quot; exhibited equivalent jurisdiction as that of local civil magistrates, including the ability to absolve the enslaved of any wrongdoing, trying them by jury, or sentencing them to capital punishments.

While some Roman &quot;patres familias&quot; permitted enslaved individuals in their households to establish quasi-marital unions (known as &quot;contubernia&quot;) as a means of forming communal bonds among the enslaved, these unions were only recognized within the household and carried no legal bearing outside of the household. The children that resulted from these unions were themselves enslaved and considered the legal property of their mother’s owner.

Roman legal sources often recognized enslaved people as part of the &quot;instrumenta&quot; (roughly translated as “equipment”) of the household to highlight the service they provided the &quot;pater familias&quot;. This definition included both enslaved people working in field settings and those living in the domestic household and working in direct service of the &quot;pater familias.&quot;

Roman women &quot;sui iuris&quot; (“of their own power,” and not under the authority of any &quot;pater familias&quot;) possessed the legal right to own enslaved people as &quot;instrumenta&quot;, though jurists decided on a case-by-case basis whether to extend the status of &quot;pater familias&quot; to them in their capacity as slaveowners. In general, however, the status of &quot;pater familias&quot; could not be fully extended to women &quot;sui iuris&quot; because Roman law recognized the authority that &quot;pater familias&quot; wielded over members of the immediate family as strictly gendered, i.e., male. Nonetheless, historians and legal scholars have often overlooked this exception to the rule that allowed some women &quot;sui iuris&quot; (usually wealthy and of the upper socioeconomic stratum of society) to attain legal recognition as &quot;pater familias&quot; through their ownership of enslaved persons.

=== Historical applications ===
Outside of the Roman context, various slavery regimes in world history have adopted the concept of &quot;pater familias&quot; to structure the legal, cultural, and social relationships between slaveowners and enslaved people. The law code of fifteenth-century Valencian society, for example, adopted the classical Roman conception of &quot;familia&quot; to recognize servant laborers and enslaved persons as members of the domestic household, roughly equal in status to family members given their subjecthood to the authority of the &quot;pater familias&quot;. As a consequence of this, &quot;patres familias&quot; maintained honor and status within their communities by fulfilling both the material and spiritual needs of all members of the household, including enslaved persons. This included providing for the food, clothing, shelter, education, and baptism of enslaved persons. When they reneged on these obligations, the law code considered them to forfeit their right to ownership of their enslaved, leading in some cases to disputes between paternal heads of household over the status of enslaved persons whom they each claimed to have “raised.”

In the context of plantation slavery in the antebellum U.S. South, slaveowning planters developed a rhetorical defense of slavery as a benevolent, paternalistic institution based on the ancient Roman model of the &quot;pater familias&quot;. Some planters employed the concept as a legal protectionary measure, instructing renters to whom they “hired out” their enslaved laborers to “treat” them “as good &quot;pater familias&quot;,” in an effort to stymie abusive practices. Others used the concept to rationalize planter rule, claiming themselves sovereigns of their households who provided for all constituent members, and demanding their loyalty and labor in return. Drawing on the Roman precedent in this way, these planters claimed that their enslaved laborers were their “dependents,” who ultimately benefitted from the paternalistic ordering of the household. Southern newspapers and print media repeatedly promoted this idea in order to square the intrinsic brutality that defined the institution of slavery with the democratic ideals the nation was supposedly founded on, often developing this paternalistic ideology to irrational heights and ignoring the contradictions that it masked. This paternalistic ideology persisted after the legal abolition of slavery, as white employers and political leaders in the South attempted to maintain a hierarchical socioeconomic class status over formerly enslaved persons, as well as women and poor laborers, whom they viewed as “dependents,” thereby expanding the Roman household model of &quot;pater familias&quot; to the level of broader society.

The patriarchal mode of slavery that Southern U.S. and Caribbean slaveowners attempted to establish often clashed with the familial structures enslaved people themselves constructed. Some of these family structures had roots in West African societies. The Akan society of the Gold Coast, for example, was largely matrilineal and composed of individual “clans or lineages,” descended from a single mother. Mandé society, while more often organized along patrilineal lines, exhibited some matrilineal lines and generally reserved powerful positions of political and household authority for women. In Igbo society, women were “most celebrated” for their roles as mothers and wives, but also participated in independent market activity and in communal defense. As a sizable proportion of enslaved people transported to the New World in the trans-Atlantic trade originated from Akan, Mandé, and Igbo societies, some historians have noted a connection between the matrilineal elements of these West African cultures and the centrality of women and mothers in enslaved peoples’ family units. These alternative modes of structuring household and family life among enslaved people threatened some planters’ intentions to serve as the solely acknowledged &quot;pater familias&quot; of their households.

<text>The green warbler (Phylloscopus nitidus), also known as green willow warbler or green leaf warbler, is a leaf warbler found in the Caucasus Mountains in southeastern Europe.

Like all leaf warblers, it was formerly placed in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage, but now belongs to the new leaf-warbler family Phylloscopidae. The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;nitidus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;shining&quot;.

It is most closely related to the greenish warbler but is brighter in colour, and the underside is much more yellow. It has one strong and one faint wing bar, especially in young birds.

<text>Henry Reeve (9 September 1813 – 21 October 1895) was an English man of letters and judicial official.

==Biography==
He was the younger son of Henry Reeve, a Whig physician and writer from Norwich, and was born at Norwich. He was educated at the Norwich School under Edward Valpy. During his holidays he saw a good deal of the young John Stuart Mill. In 1829 he studied at Geneva and mixed in Genevese society, then very brilliant, and including the Sismondis, François Huber, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, Alphonse de Candolle, Pellegrino Rossi, Sigismund Krasinski (his most intimate friend), and Adam Mickiewicz, whose &quot;Faris&quot; he translated. During a visit to London in 1831 he was introduced to Thackeray and Thomas Carlyle, while through the Austins he made the acquaintance of other literary figures. Next year, in Paris, he met Victor Hugo, Victor Cousin, and Sir Walter Scott. He travelled in Italy, sat under Schelling at Munich and under Ludwig Tieck at Dresden, became in 1835-36 a member of Madame de Circourt&#x27;s salon, and numbered among his friends Alphonse de Lamartine, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, Alfred de Vigny, Adolphe Thiers, François Guizot, Charles Forbes René de Montalembert, and Alexis de Tocqueville, of whose books, &quot;Démocratie en Amérique&quot; and the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, he made standard translations into English.

In 1837 he was made clerk of appeal and then registrar to the judicial committee of the Privy Council.. From 1840 to 1855 he wrote for &quot;The Times&quot;, his close touch with men like Guizot, Christian Bunsen, Lord Clarendon, and his own chief at the Privy Council Office, Charles Greville, enabling him to write with authority on foreign policy during the critical period from 1848 to the end of the Crimean War. Upon the promotion of Sir George Cornewall Lewis to the Cabinet early in 1855 Reeve was asked by Longman to edit the April number of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, to which his father had been one of the earliest contributors, and in the following July he became the editor. His friendship with the Orleanist leaders in France survived all vicissitudes, but he was appealed to for guidance by successive French ambassadors, and was more than once the medium of private negotiations between the English and French governments.

In April 1863, he published perhaps the most important of his contributions—a searching review of Kinglake&#x27;s &quot;Crimea&quot;; and in 1872 he brought out a selection of his &quot;Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh&quot; articles on eminent Frenchmen, entitled &quot;Royal and Republican France&quot;. Three years later appeared the first of three instalments (1875, 1885 and 1887) of his edition of the famous &quot;Memoirs&quot; which Charles Greville had placed in his hands a few hours before his death in 1865. In 1878 Reeve published a popular biography &quot;Petrarch&quot;. A purist in point of form and style, of the school of Thomas Macaulay and Henry Hart Milman, Reeve outlived his literary generation, and became one of the most reactionary of old Whigs. Yet he continued to edit and maintain the reputation of the Edinburgh until his death at his seat of Foxholes, in Christchurch, Hampshire on 21 October 1895. He had been elected a member of &quot;The Club&quot; in 1861, and served as its treasurer from 1867 to 1893. He was made a D.C.L. by the University of Oxford in 1869, a C.B. in 1871, and a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1865. A striking panegyric was pronounced upon him by his lifelong friend, the duc d&#x27;Aumale, before the Académie des Sciences on 16 November 1895.

His &quot;Memoirs and Letters&quot; (2 vols., with portrait) were edited by J. K. Laughton, in 1898.

In a March 1937 issue of &quot;The Times&quot;, there was an appeal for Henry Reeve&#x27;s diary.

<text>A color breed refers to groupings of horses whose registration is based primarily on their coat color, regardless of the horse&#x27;s actual breed or breed type. 

Some color breeds only register horses with a desired coat color if they also meet specific pedigree criteria, others register animals based solely on color, regardless of parentage. A few pedigree-based color breeds, notably the American Paint Horse and the Appaloosa, confronted with the reality of many animals born without the proper color even though they are from two registered parents, have modified their rules to allow registration of animals with the proper pedigree even if they do not possess the proper color. On the other hand, with the prevalence of DNA testing for parentage, many horses once forced into color breed status due to being born the &quot;wrong&quot; color and thus deemed undesirable or of questionable parentage by many regular breed registries with cropout rules can now be accepted for registration. 

For example, some mainstream breeds, such as American Quarter Horses, Tennessee Walking Horses and American Saddlebreds include individuals of the palomino color or pinto patterns, as well as a wide variety of other colors. However, a color breed registry, such as the Palomino Horse Breeders Association or the Pinto Horse Association of America, accepts only horses of each particular color or color pattern —regardless of their particular breeds. White horses had their own color registry that included cremello horses, but not grays.

Many horses eligible for registration with their own breed registry and of a particular color to allow color breed registration are often &quot;double registered&quot; with both organizations, often increasing their sale value by doing so. With stallions, double registration may also increase their breeding value by widening the set of interested mare owners.

==Alternative meaning ==
There are some breeds, such as the Norwegian Fjord Horse, Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, Friesian and Haflinger, which have distinct physical characteristics and recorded pedigrees but also typically have distinctive or colorful coats. These might be considered a &quot;color breed&quot; by some, but they are pedigree-based breeds. For example, Appaloosas are usually spotted, but a solid-colored offspring of registered parents can still be a registered Appaloosa. Likewise, a solid-colored American Paint Horse that has registered parents may also be registered.

On the other hand, while Friesian breeders have deliberately bred to exclude chestnut horses, and will only register black animals, these black animals also must be Friesian by pedigree and no other bloodlines are allowed into the registry. The same is true of Norwegian Fjord Horses, which are all a variation of dun.

==Color breeding==
Some horse breeds exclude certain colors that are considered signs of a crossbred animal. For example, other than the Sabino pattern and some recently discovered dominant white alleles in horses with DNA-verified parentage, the Arabian horse registry excludes all spotted horses. The Finnhorse was also bred for decades to exclude all colors but chestnut, and specifically to remove such &quot;fancy&quot; colors as roans, grays and spotted (sabino), which were seen as indicators of foreign blood, though that policy has now changed, as for some particular colors, this might hold true - for example, all present gray Finnhorses can be traced back to a certain gray mare of dubious pedigree. 

Due to DNA verification of parentage, today many mainstream breed registries that once excluded certain coat colors will now accept them as long as the animal can be proved pureblooded. Many colors are specifically bred for.

<text>Henry Knox (July 25, 1750 – October 25, 1806) was an American military officer, politician, bookseller, and a Founding Father of the United States. Born in Boston, Knox became a senior general of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, serving as chief of artillery in most of George Washington&#x27;s campaigns. Following the American Revolution, he oversaw the War Department under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1789. Washington, at the start of his first administration, appointed Knox the nation&#x27;s first Secretary of War, a position he held from 1789 to 1794. He is well known today as the namesake of Fort Knox in Kentucky, the repository of a large portion of the nation&#x27;s gold reserves.

Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Knox owned and operated a bookstore in the city, cultivating an interest in military history and joining a local artillery company. Knox was also on the scene of the 1770 Boston Massacre. Though barely 25 when the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, he engineered the transport of captured artillery from New York&#x27;s Fort Ticonderoga, which proved decisive in driving the British out of Boston in early 1776. Knox quickly rose to become the chief artillery officer of the Continental Army. In this role, he accompanied Washington on most of his campaigns and was engaged in many major actions of the war. He established training centers for artillerymen and manufacturing facilities for weaponry that were valuable assets in winning the war for independence. Knox saw himself as the embodiment of revolutionary republican ideals. In early 1783, as the war drew to a close, he initiated the concept of the Society of the Cincinnati, authoring its founding document and establishing the organization as a fraternal, hereditary society of veteran officers that survives to this day.

In 1785, the Congress of the Confederation appointed Knox as Secretary of War, where he dealt primarily with Indian affairs. Following the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789, he became President Washington&#x27;s Secretary of War. In this role he oversaw the development of coastal fortifications, worked to improve the preparedness of local militia, and directed the nation&#x27;s military operations in the Northwest Indian War. He was formally responsible for the nation&#x27;s relationship with the Indian population in the territories it claimed, articulating a policy that established federal government supremacy over the states in relation to Indian nations and called for treating Indian nations as sovereign. Knox&#x27;s idealistic views on the subject were frustrated by ongoing illegal settlements and fraudulent land transfers of Indian lands. He retired to Thomaston, District of Maine, in 1795, where he oversaw the rise of a business empire built on borrowed money. He died in 1806, leaving an estate that was bankrupt.

==Early life and marriage==
Henry Knox&#x27;s parents, William and Mary (née Campbell), were Ulster Scots immigrants who emigrated from Derry to Boston in 1729. His father was a shipbuilder who, due to financial reverses, left the family for Sint Eustatius in the West Indies where he died in 1762 of unknown causes.

Henry was admitted to the Boston Latin School, where he studied Greek, Latin, arithmetic, and European history. Since he was the oldest son still at home when his father died, he left school at the age of 9 and became a clerk in a bookstore to support his mother. The shop&#x27;s owner, Nicholas Bowes, became a surrogate father figure for the boy, allowing him to browse the store&#x27;s shelves and take home any volume that he wanted to read. The inquisitive future war hero, when he was not running errands, taught himself French, learned some philosophy and advanced mathematics, and devoured tales of ancient warriors and famous battles. He immersed himself in literature from a tender age. However, Knox was also involved in Boston&#x27;s street gangs, becoming one of the toughest fighters in his neighborhood. Impressed by a military demonstration, at 18, he joined a local artillery company called The Train.


On March 5, 1770, Knox was a witness to the Boston Massacre. According to his affidavit, he attempted to defuse the situation, trying to convince the British soldiers to return to their quarters. He also testified at the trials of the soldiers, in which all but two were acquitted. In 1771 he opened his own bookshop, the London Book Store, in Boston &quot;opposite William&#x27;s Court in Cornhill.&quot; The store was, in the words of a contemporary, a &quot;great resort for the British officers and Tory ladies, who were the &quot;ton&quot; at that period.&quot; Boasting an impressive selection of excellent English products and managed by a friendly proprietor, it quickly became a popular destination for the aristocrats of Boston. As a bookseller, Knox built strong business ties with British suppliers (like Thomas Longman) and developed relationships with his customers, but he retained his childhood aspirations. Largely self-educated, he stocked books on military science, and also questioned soldiers who frequented his shop in military matters. The genial giant initially enjoyed reasonable pecuniary success, but his profits slumped after the Boston Port Bill and subsequent citywide boycott of British goods. In 1772 he cofounded the Boston Grenadier Corps as an offshoot of The Train, and served as its second in command. Shortly before his 23rd birthday Knox accidentally discharged a gun, shooting two fingers off his left hand. He managed to bind the wound up and reach a doctor, who sewed the wound up.

Knox supported the Sons of Liberty, an organization of agitators against what they considered tyrannical policies by the British Parliament. It is unknown if he participated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party, but he did serve on guard duty before the incident to make sure no tea was unloaded from the &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, one of the ships involved. The next year he refused a consignment of tea sent to him by James Rivington, a Loyalist in New York.

At 24 years old, Henry married the well-educated Lucy Flucker (1756–1824), the 18 year-old daughter of wealthy Boston Loyalists, on June 16, 1774, despite opposition from her father, who had differing political views. Lucy was an avid reader and the couple met in 1773 at Henry&#x27;s bookshop. Her brother served in the British Army, and her family attempted to lure Knox to service there. Lucy&#x27;s Tory parents disowned her when she married Henry. Despite long separations due to his military service, the couple were devoted to one another for the rest of his life, and carried on an extensive correspondence. After the couple fled Boston in 1775, she remained essentially homeless until the British evacuated the city in March 1776. Even afterward, she often traveled to visit Knox in the field. Lucy never saw her estranged parents again after they left, never to return, with the British during their withdrawal from Boston after the Continental Army fortified Dorchester Heights, a success that hinged upon Knox&#x27;s Ticonderoga expedition. The couple had 13 children but only 3 survived to adulthood.

==Military career==

===Siege of Boston===
When the war broke out with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, Knox and Lucy snuck out of Boston, and Knox joined the militia army besieging the city. His abandoned bookshop was looted and all of its stock destroyed or stolen. He served under General Artemas Ward, putting his acquired engineering skills to use developing fortifications around the city. He directed rebel cannon fire at the Battle of Bunker Hill. When General George Washington arrived in July 1775 to take command of the army, he was impressed by the work Knox had done. The two also immediately developed a liking for one another, and Knox began to interact regularly with Washington and the other generals of the developing Continental Army. Knox did not have a commission in the army, but John Adams in particular worked in the Second Continental Congress to acquire for him a commission as colonel of the army&#x27;s artillery regiment. Knox bolstered his own case by writing to Adams that Richard Gridley, the older leader of the artillery under Ward, was disliked by his men and in poor health.
As the siege wore on, the idea arose that cannon recently captured at the fall of forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point in upstate New York could have a decisive impact on its outcome. Knox is generally credited with suggesting the prospect to Washington, who thereupon put him in charge of an expedition to retrieve them even though Knox&#x27;s commission had not yet arrived. Reaching Ticonderoga on December 5, Knox commenced what came to be known as the noble train of artillery, hauling by horse-drawn and ox-drawn sled 60 tons of cannon and other armaments across some of ice-covered rivers and snow-draped Berkshire Mountains to the Boston siege camps.

The region was lightly populated and Knox had to overcome difficulties hiring personnel and draft animals. On several occasions cannon crashed through the ice on river crossings, but the detail&#x27;s men were always able to recover them. In the end, what Knox had expected to take just two weeks actually took more than six, and he was finally able to report the arrival of the weapons train to Washington on January 27, 1776. Called by historian Victor Brooks &quot;one of the most stupendous feats of logistics&quot; of the entire war, Knox&#x27;s effort is commemorated by a series of plaques marking the Henry Knox Trail in New York and Massachusetts.

Upon the cannon&#x27;s arrival in Cambridge they were immediately deployed to fortify the Dorchester Heights recently taken by Washington. So commanding was the new battery over Boston harbor the British withdrew their fleet to Halifax. With the siege ended, Knox undertook the improvement of defenses in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York City in anticipation of a possible British assault. In New York he became friends with Alexander Hamilton, commander of the local artillery. He also established a close friendship with Massachusetts general Benjamin Lincoln.

===New York and New Jersey campaign===
Knox was with Washington&#x27;s army during the New York and New Jersey campaign, including most of the major engagements resulting in the loss of New York City. He narrowly escaped capture following the British invasion of Manhattan, only making it back to the main Continental Army lines through the offices of Aaron Burr. He was in charge of logistics in the critical crossing of the Delaware River that preceded the December 26, 1776 Battle of Trenton. Though hampered by ice and cold, with John Glover&#x27;s Marbleheaders (14th Continental Regiment) manning the boats, he got the attack force of men, horses and artillery across the river without loss. Following the battle he returned the same force, along with hundreds of prisoners, captured supplies and all the boats back across the river by the afternoon of December 26. Knox was promoted to brigadier general for this accomplishment, and given command of an artillery corps expanded to five regiments. The army again crossed the river a few days later after the decision to make a stand at Trenton. Knox was with the army at the January 2, 1777 at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, and again the next day at the Battle of Princeton.
In 1777, while the army was in winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, Knox returned to Massachusetts to improve the Army&#x27;s artillery manufacturing capability. He raised an additional battalion of artillerymen and established an armory at Springfield, Massachusetts before returning to the main army in the spring. That armory, and a second at Yorktown, Pennsylvania established by one of his subordinates, remained valuable sources of war material for the rest of the war.

===Philadelphia campaign===
Knox returned to the main army for the 1777 campaign. In June he learned that Congress had appointed Philippe Charles Tronson du Coudray, a French soldier of fortune, to command the artillery. Du Coudray&#x27;s appointment upset not only Knox, who immediately threatened his resignation to Congress, but also John Sullivan and Nathanael Greene, who also protested the politically motivated appointment. George Washington also wrote Congress on behalf of Knox on May 31, 1777. Du Coudray was subsequently reassigned to the post of inspector general, and died in a fall from his horse while crossing the Schuylkill River in September 1777.

Knox was present at Brandywine, the first major battle of the Philadelphia campaign, and at Germantown. At Germantown he made the critical suggestion, approved by Washington, to capture rather than bypass the Chew House, a stone mansion that the British had occupied as a strong defensive position. This turned out to significantly delay the army&#x27;s advance and gave the British an opportunity to reform their lines. Knox afterward wrote to Lucy, &quot;To [morning fog and] the enemy&#x27;s taking possession of some stone buildings in Germantown, is to be ascribed the loss of the victory.&quot; Knox was also present at the Battle of Monmouth in July 1778, where Washington commended him for the artillery&#x27;s performance. The army saw no further action that year, but privateers that Knox and fellow Massachusetts native Henry Jackson invested in were not as successful as they hoped; many of them were captured by the British.

===Artillery training school and Yorktown===
Knox and the artillery established a winter cantonment at Pluckemin (a hamlet of Bedminster, New Jersey). There Knox established the Continental Army&#x27;s first school for artillery and officer training. This facility was the precursor to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While there, through the summer of 1779, General Knox spent most of his time training more than 1,000 soldiers in conditions of low morale and scarce supplies. Conditions were exceptionally harsh in the winter of 1779–80, and Washington&#x27;s army was again largely inactive in 1780 while the main action in the war moved south.

In late September 1780, Knox was a member of the court martial that convicted Major John André, the British officer whose arrest exposed the treachery of Benedict Arnold. (Knox had briefly shared accommodations with André while en route to Ticonderoga in 1775, when André was traveling south on parole after being captured near Montreal.) During these years of relative inaction Knox made several trips to the northern states as Washington&#x27;s representative to increase the flow of men and supplies to the army. In 1781, Knox accompanied Washington&#x27;s army south and participated in the decisive siege of Yorktown. He was personally active in the field, directing the placement and aiming of the artillery. The Marquis de Chastellux, with whom Knox established a good friendship, wrote of Knox, &quot;We cannot sufficiently admire the intelligence and activity with which he collected from different places and transported to the batteries more than thirty pieces ...&quot;, and &quot;one-half has been said in commending his military genius. Washington specifically called out both Knox and the French artillery chief for their roles in the siege, and recommended to Congress that Knox be promoted.

===Demobilization===
Knox was promoted to major general on March 22, 1782; he became the army&#x27;s youngest major general. He and Congressman Gouverneur Morris were assigned to negotiate prisoner exchanges with the British. These negotiations failed because the sides could not agree on processes and terms for matching various classes of captives. He joined the main army at Newburgh, New York, and inspected the facilities at West Point, considered a crucial defensive position. After enumerating its defects and needs, Washington appointed him its commander in August 1782. The next month he was devastated by the death of his nine-month-old son, and fell into a depression. He soldiered on, however, becoming involved in negotiations with the Confederation Congress and Secretary of War Benjamin Lincoln over the issue of pensions and overdue compensation for the military. Knox wrote a memorial, signed by a number of high-profile officers, suggesting that Congress pay all back pay immediately and offer a lump-sum pension rather than providing half-pay for life. The unwillingness of Congress to deal with the issue prompted Knox to write a warning letter, in which he wrote &quot;I consider the reputation of the American army as one of the most immaculate things on earth, and that we should even suffer wrongs and injuries to the utmost verge of toleration rather than sully it in the least degree. But there is a point beyond which there is no sufferance. I pray we will sincerely not pass it.&quot; When rumors of mutiny in the higher rank circulated in March 1783, Washington held a meeting in which he made an impassioned plea for restraint. In the meeting, Knox introduced motions reaffirming the officers&#x27; attachment to Washington and Congress, helping to defuse the crisis. Because of the unresolved issues, however, Knox and others became vigorous proponents of a stronger national government, something which leading political leaders (including Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams) opposed at the time.

With the arrival of news of a preliminary peace in April 1783 Congress began to order the demobilization of the Continental Army, and Washington gave Knox day-to-day command of what remained of the army. During this time Knox organized The Society of the Cincinnati, a fraternal, hereditary society of Revolutionary War officers that survives to this day. He authored the society&#x27;s founding document, the Institution, in April 1783 and served as its first Secretary General. Knox also served as The Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati&#x27;s first Vice President. The hereditary nature of the society&#x27;s membership initially raised some eyebrows, but it was generally well received. He also drafted plans for the establishment of a peacetime army, many of whose provisions were eventually implemented. These plans included two military academies (one naval and one army, the latter occupying the critical base at West Point), and bodies of troops to maintain the nation&#x27;s borders.

When the British withdrew the last of their troops from New York on November 21, 1783, Knox was at the head of the American forces that took over. He stood next to Washington during the latter&#x27;s farewell address on December 4 at Fraunces Tavern. After Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief on December 23, Knox became the senior officer of the army.

The post of Secretary at War became available when Benjamin Lincoln resigned in November 1783, and Lincoln had recommended Knox to follow him. Although the Confederation Congress had been aware of Lincoln&#x27;s intent to resign when the formal peace arrived, it had not named a successor. Knox had been considered for the job when it was given to Lincoln in 1781, and expressed his interest in succeeding Lincoln. However, in the absence of a guiding hand in the War Department, Congress attempted to implement an idea for a standing militia force as a peacetime army. Knox resigned his army commission in early 1784, &quot;well satisfied to be excluded from any responsibility in arrangements which it is impossible to execute&quot;, and Congress&#x27; idea failed.

Knox returned to Massachusetts, where the family established a home in Dorchester. Knox worked to reassemble a large parcel of land in Maine (parts of what are sometimes called the Waldo Patent and the Bingham Purchase) that had been confiscated from his Loyalist in-laws. He was able to assemble a vast multi-million acre real estate empire in Maine, including almost all of the old Flucker holdings, in part by getting appointed the state&#x27;s official for disposing of seized lands, and then rigging the sale of his in-laws&#x27; lands to a straw buyer acting on his behalf. He was also appointed to a state commission responsible for negotiating treaty provisions with the Penobscot Indians of central Maine. This commission also became involved in investigating issues surrounding the eastern border with Nova Scotia (now New Brunswick), a matter that would not be resolved until the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty.

==Secretary of War==
Congress finally appointed Knox the nation&#x27;s second United States Secretary at War on March 8, 1785, after considering a number of other candidates. Always a large, imposing man at tall, Knox is reported to have gained significant weight later in life and been of &quot;immense girth,&quot; weighing nearly by the 1780s. The army was by then a fraction of its former size, and the new nation&#x27;s westward expansion was exacerbating frontier conflicts with Indian tribes. The War Department Knox took over had two civilian employees and a single small regiment. Congress in 1785 authorized the establishment of a 700-man army. Knox was only able to recruit six of the authorized ten companies, which were stationed on the western frontier.

Some members of the Confederation Congress opposed the establishment of a peacetime army, and also opposed the establishment of a military academy (one of Knox&#x27;s key proposals) on the basis that it would establish a superior military class capable of dominating society. Knox first proposed an army mainly composed of state militia, specifically seeking to change attitudes in Congress about a democratically managed military. Although the plan was initially rejected, many of its details were eventually adopted in the formation and administration of the United States Army. The need for an enhanced military role took on some urgency in 1786 when Shays&#x27; Rebellion broke out in Massachusetts, threatening the Springfield Armory. Knox personally went to Springfield to see to its defense. Although Benjamin Lincoln raised a militia force and put down the rebellion, it highlighted the weakness of both the military and defects in the Articles of Confederation that hampered Congressional ability to act on the matter. In the rebellion&#x27;s aftermath Congress called the Constitutional Convention, in which the United States Constitution was drafted. Knox in early 1787 sent Washington a proposal for a government that bears significant resemblance to what was eventually adopted. When Washington asked Knox if he should attend the convention, Knox urged him to do so: &quot;It would be circumstance highly honorable to your fame, in the judgment of the present and future ages, and double entitle you to the glorious epithet — Father of Your Country.&quot; This is probably the first time an important early American figure had characterized Washington as the &quot;Father of His Country&quot;. Knox actively promoted the adoption of the new constitution, engaging correspondents in many colonies on the subject, but especially concentrating on achieving its adoption by Massachusetts, where its support was seen as weak. After its adoption he was considered by some to be a viable candidate for vice president, but he preferred to remain in the war office, and the office went to John Adams. With the adoption of the new Constitution and the establishment of the War Department, Knox&#x27;s title changed to Secretary of War.

As part of his new duties, Knox was responsible for implementation of the Militia Act of 1792. This included his evaluation of the arms and readiness of the militia finding that only 20% of the 450,000 members of the militia were capable of arming themselves at their own expense for militia service as required by the act. To resolve this arms shortage, Knox recommended to Congress that the federal government increase the purchase of imported weapons, ban the export of domestically produced weapons and establish facilities for the domestic production and stockpiling of weapons. These facilities included the existing Springfield Armory and another at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. In 1792 Congress, acting on a detailed proposal from Knox, created the short-lived Legion of the United States.

When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1793, American merchant shipping began to be affected after Washington formally declared neutrality in the conflict. Both France and Britain began seizing American shipping that was trading with the enemy nation. Most of the Continental Navy&#x27;s few ships were sold off at the end of the Revolutionary War, leaving the nation&#x27;s merchant fleet without any defenses against piracy or seizure on the high seas. Knox urged and presided over the creation of a regular United States Navy and the establishment of a series of coastal fortifications.

===Native American diplomacy and war===

Knox was responsible for managing the nation&#x27;s relations with the Native Americans resident in lands it claimed, following a 1789 act of U.S. Congress. Knox, in several documents drafted for Washington and Congress, articulated the nation&#x27;s early Native American policy. He stated that Indian nations were sovereign and possessed the land they occupied, and that the federal government (and not the states) should therefore be responsible for dealings with them. These policies were implemented in part by the passage of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which forbade the sale of Native American lands except in connection with a treaty with the federal government. Knox wrote, &quot;The Indians, being the prior occupants, possess the right to the soil. It cannot be taken from them except by their consent, or by rights of conquest in case of a just war. To dispossess them on any other principle would be a great violation of the fundamental laws of nature.&quot; Historian Robert Miller claims that statements like these seem to support indigenous rights to land, but were ignored in the practice of the Doctrine of Discovery, which came to govern the taking of Native lands.

American Indian wars, including the Cherokee–American wars and the Northwest Indian War, would occupy much of his tenure. During the years of the Confederation, there had been insufficient Congressional support for any significant action against the Nations on the western frontier. The British supported the northwestern tribes from frontier bases that they continued to occupy after the Revolutionary War ended (in violation of the Treaty of Paris), and the Cherokee and Creek continued to contest illegal encroachment of colonial settlers on their lands. In June 1790, Knox wrote to General Josiah Harmar that diplomacy with the Northwestern Confederacy was no longer an option, and that it instead needed to be subjugated by military force in order to &quot;produce in the Indians a proper disposition for peace&quot;. In October 1790 Knox organized a campaign led by General Josiah Harmar into the Northwest Territory in retaliation for Native American raids against colonial settlers in that territory and that of present-day Kentucky. That campaign failed. A second campaign was organized by Knox, financed by William Duer, and to be led by territorial Governor Arthur St. Clair. Knox and Duer failed to provide enough supplies for the Army, which led to the American Army&#x27;s greatest defeat in history. These campaigns failed to pacify the Native Americans, and Knox was widely blamed for the failure to protect the frontier.

Seeking to close the issue before he left office, he organized an expedition led by Anthony Wayne that brought the conflict to a meaningful end with the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. Wayne&#x27;s &quot;troops had burned &#x27;immense fields of corn&#x27; for a stretch of about fifty miles along the river&quot;, in a move that affected civilian non-combatants. The result of American military action in the Northwest led to the Treaty of Greenville, which forced the defeated Native Americans to cede lands in the Ohio area. The bloody campaigns that Secretary Knox oversaw in some cases involved armies many times larger than later battles in the 1870s.

The Native American nations were reluctant to leave their hunting grounds but Knox thought he could make a deal with the southern tribes headed by Alexander McGillivray. He would promise the U.S. Army would protect them from land-hungry squatters. Washington and Knox generally felt the use of force would be too costly to Americans and a violation of republican ideals. Knox proposed furnishing the Natives with livestock, farming implements, and missionaries, in order to make them pacific farmers. Knox signed the Treaty of New York (1790) on behalf of the nation, ending conflict with some, but not all, Cherokee tribal units. Of the dying off of the native populations in the nation&#x27;s most heavily populated areas, Knox wrote, &quot;A future historian may mark the causes of this destruction of the human race in sable colors.&quot; Knox said how the American government and settlers were treating the Indian tribes so harmfully that &quot;our modes...have been more destructive to the Indian natives than the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico and Peru&quot;. He went on to cite the fact that where there was white settlement, there was &quot;the utter extirpation&quot; of natives, or almost none left alive. Regardless of whether the Americans wanted to obtain Native American lands by purchase, conquest or other means, &quot;there would be no lasting peace while land remained the object of American Indian policy&quot;, which continued after Knox left office. Washington&#x27;s policies, as carried out by Secretary Knox, set the stage for the rise of Tecumseh two decades later. Many thousands of Native Americans refused to accept treaties, claiming that they had not approved them and that their only purpose was to remove them from their lands. They specifically cited the Treaty of Greenville, and reoccupied ancestral lands, beginning renewed resistance in the Northwest that was finally crushed in the War of 1812.

On January 2, 1795, Knox was forced to leave the government after rumors that he had profited from contracts for the construction of U.S. frigates which had been commissioned under the Naval Act of 1794 in order to combat Barbary pirates. He returned to his home in Thomaston, District of Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, to devote himself to caring for his growing family. He was succeeded in the post of Secretary of War by Timothy Pickering.

==Business ventures and land speculation==
Knox settled in Thomaston and built a magnificent three-story mansion surrounded by outbuildings called Montpelier, the whole of &quot;a beauty, symmetry and magnificence&quot; said to be unequaled in the Commonwealth. He spent the rest of his life engaged in cattle farming, ship building, brick making and real estate speculation. Connections formed during the war years served Knox well, as he invested widely in frontier real estate, from the Ohio valley to Maine (although his largest holdings by far were those in Maine). Although he claimed to treat settlers on his Maine lands fairly, he used intermediaries to evict those who did not pay their rents or squatted on the land. These tactics upset those settlers to the point where they once threatened to burn Montpelier down.

One of the people Knox took land from was Joseph Plumb Martin, a soldier who settled in Maine and wrote a memoir of his war experiences. Knox briefly represented Thomaston in the Massachusetts General Court, but he eventually became so unpopular that he lost the seat to a local blacksmith.

Many incidents in Knox&#x27;s career attest to his character, both good and bad. As one example, when he and Lucy were forced to leave Boston in 1775, his home was used to house British officers who looted his bookstore. In spite of personal financial hardships, he managed to make the last payment of £1,000 to Longman Printers in London to cover the price of a shipment of books that he never received. In Maine, however, he would be remembered as a grasping tyrant and was forever immortalized in Nathanial Hawthorne&#x27;s 1851 novel &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;, for which he served as the model for Col. Pyncheon.

Knox was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.

As well as building a landed estate, Knox attempted to enlarge his fortune through industrial craft enterprises. He had interests in lumbering, ship building, stock raising and brick manufacturing. Unfortunately for him, these businesses failed (due in part to a lack of focused investment), and Knox built up significant debts. Knox was forced to sell large tracts of land in Maine to satisfy some of his creditors. The purchaser of his Maine lands was a Pennsylvania banker named William Bingham, leading those tracts to become known locally as the Bingham Purchase.

==Death==
Knox died at his home on October 25, 1806, at the age of 56, three days after swallowing a chicken bone which lodged in his throat and caused a fatal infection. He was buried on his estate in Thomaston with full military honors.

Lucy Flucker died in 1824, having sold off more portions of the family properties to pay the creditors of Knox&#x27;s insolvent estate. The couple had three children that survived to adulthood. Their son, Henry Jackson Knox, became known as a wastrel for his drinking and scandalous behavior. Before his death in 1832, Henry Jackson Knox became &quot;impressed with a deep sense of his own unworthiness&quot;, requesting in penance that his remains not be interred with his honored relatives but deposited in a common burial ground &quot;with no stone to tell where.&quot; Their daughter Lucy Flucker Knox Thatcher had a son, Henry Thatcher, who would serve as an admiral in the Civil War.

Montpelier remained in the family until it was demolished in 1871, to make way for the Brunswick-Rockland railroad line. The only surviving structure is an outbuilding that was deeded to the Thomaston Historical Society upon its founding in 1972. The current Montpelier Museum is a 20th-century reconstruction not far from the site of the original.

==Honors==
Towns and cities in Maine, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, and Tennessee are named &quot;Knox&quot; or &quot;Knoxville&quot; in his honor. There are counties named for Knox in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. The house he used as a headquarters in New Windsor, New York, during the Revolution has been preserved as Knox&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site; it is a listed National Historic Landmark. Knox Township, Illinois, is named after Knox, as is Knox Place in the Bronx, New York.

Knox has been honored by the U.S. Postal Service with an 8¢ Great Americans series postage stamp, issued on July 25, 1985, in Thomaston, Maine.

Knox was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1791.

Two forts, Fort Knox in Kentucky and Fort Knox (Maine) were named after him. Knox Hall at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, home of the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, is named in his honor, as is an annual award recognizing the performance of U.S. artillery batteries. The &quot;Major General Nathanael Greene&quot;–class large coastal tug USAV &quot;Major General Henry Knox&quot; (LT-802) is named in honor of Knox. His papers have been preserved at the Massachusetts Historical Society, and his personal library resides in the Boston Athenaeum in proximity to that of his friend, George Washington.

<text>&#x27; (, &quot;spoken singing&quot;) and &#x27; (, &quot;spoken voice&quot;), more commonly known as speak-singing in English, are expressionist musical vocal techniques between singing and speaking. Though sometimes used interchangeably, is directly related to the operatic recitative manner of singing (in which pitches are sung, but the articulation is rapid and loose like speech), whereas is closer to speech itself (because it does not emphasise any particular pitches).

 is more closely aligned with the long-used musical techniques of recitative or than is . Where the term is employed in this way, it is usually in the context of the late Romantic German operas or &quot;music dramas&quot; that were composed by Richard Wagner and others in the 19th century. Thus, is often merely a German alternative to &#x27;recitative&#x27;.

The earliest compositional use of the technique was in the first version of Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s 1897 melodrama &quot;Königskinder&quot; (in the 1910 version it was replaced by conventional singing), where it may have been intended to imitate a style already in use by singers of lieder and popular song, but it is more closely associated with the composers of the Second Viennese School. Arnold Schoenberg asks for the technique in a number of pieces: the part of the Speaker in &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; (1911) is written in his notation for , but it was &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (1912) where he used it throughout and left a note attempting to explain the technique. Alban Berg adopted the technique and asked for it in parts of his operas &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;.

=== History ===

In the foreword to &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (1912), Schoenberg explains how his should be achieved. He explains that the indicated rhythms should be adhered to, but that whereas in ordinary singing a constant pitch is maintained through a note, here the singer &quot;immediately abandons it by falling or rising. The goal is certainly not at all a realistic, natural speech. On the contrary, the difference between ordinary speech and speech that collaborates in a musical form must be made plain. But it should not call singing to mind, either.&quot;

For the first performances of &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, Schoenberg was able to work directly with the vocalist and obtain exactly the result he desired, but later performances were problematic. Schoenberg had written many subsequent letters attempting to clarify, but he was unable to leave a definitive explanation and there has been much disagreement as to what was actually intended. Pierre Boulez wrote, &quot;the question arises whether it is actually possible to speak according to a notation devised for singing. This was the real problem at the root of all the controversies. Schoenberg&#x27;s own remarks on the subject are not in fact clear.&quot;

Schoenberg later used a notation without a traditional clef in the &quot;Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte&quot; (1942), &quot;A Survivor from Warsaw&quot; (1947) and his unfinished opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, which eliminated any reference to a specific pitch, but retained the relative slides and articulations.

=== Notation ===

In Schoenberg&#x27;s musical notation, is usually indicated by small crosses through the stems of the notes, or with the notehead itself being a small cross.

Schoenberg&#x27;s later notation (first used in his &quot;Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte&quot;, 1942) replaced the 5-line staff with a single line having no clef. The note stems no longer bear the &#x27;x&#x27;, as it is now clear that no specific pitch is intended, and instead relative pitches are specified by placing the notes above or below the single line (sometimes on ledger lines). 

Berg notates several degrees of , e. g. in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, using single-line staff for rhythmic speaking, five-line staves with &#x27;x&#x27; through the note stem, and a single stroke through the stem for close-to-singing .

In modern usage, it is most common to indicate by using an &#x27;x&#x27; in place of a conventional notehead.

==Use in pop and rock music==
-style talk-singing has appeared in contemporary pop, rock, punk, and alternative music since the 1960s. The vocal style is also prominent in the British post-punk scene of the 2020s, with several groups featuring a vocalist that uses the talk-sing method.

<text>The sclera, also known as the white of the eye or, in older literature, as the tunica albuginea oculi, is the opaque, fibrous, protective outer layer of the eye containing mainly collagen and some crucial elastic fiber. 

In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. People with dark skin can have naturally darkened sclerae, the result of melanin pigmentation.

In humans, and some other vertebrates, the whole sclera is white or pale, contrasting with the coloured iris. The cooperative eye hypothesis suggests that the pale sclera evolved as a method of nonverbal communication that makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking. Other mammals with white or pale sclera include chimpanzees, many orangutans, some gorillas, and bonobos.

==Structure==

The sclera forms the posterior five-sixths of the connective tissue coat of the human eyeball. It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the eyeball, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc, the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate (lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers (fasciculi) pass. The thickness of the sclera varies from 1 mm at the posterior pole to 0.3 mm just behind the insertions of the four rectus muscles. The sclera&#x27;s blood vessels are mainly on the surface. Along with the vessels of the conjunctiva (which is a thin layer covering the sclera), those in the episclera render the inflamed eye bright red.

In many vertebrates, the sclera is reinforced with plates of cartilage or bone, together forming a circular structure called the sclerotic ring. In primitive fish, this ring consists of four plates, but the number is lower in many living ray-finned fishes, and much higher in lobe-finned fishes, crocodilians, various reptiles, and birds. The ring has disappeared in many groups, including living amphibians, some reptiles and fish, and all mammals.

The eyes of all non-human primates have been thought to be dark with small, barely visible sclera, but recent research has suggested that white sclera are not uncommon in chimpanzees, and are also present in other mammals.

===Histology===
Histologically speaking, it is characterized as dense connective tissue made primarily of type 1 collagen fibers. The collagen of the sclera is continuous with the cornea. From outer to innermost, the four layers of the sclera are:
* episclera
* stroma
* lamina fusca
* endothelium

The sclera is opaque due to the irregularity of the Type I collagen fibers, as opposed to the near-uniform thickness and parallel arrangement of the corneal collagen. Moreover, the cornea bears more mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate that has among its repeating units a nitrogenous sugar, hexosamine) to embed the fibrils.

The cornea, unlike the sclera, has six layers. The middle (third in number; provided the first layer being the anterior and outermost and the sixth layer being the posterior and the inner most), thickest layer is also called the stroma. The sclera, like the cornea, contains a basal endothelium, above which there is the lamina fusca, containing a high count of pigment cells.

Sometimes, very small gray-blue spots can appear on the sclera, a harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis.

==Function==
Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. This is not just due to the white color of the human sclera, which many other species share, but also to the fact that the human iris is relatively small and comprises a significantly smaller portion of the exposed eye surface compared to other animals. It is theorized that this adaptation evolved because of humans’ social nature as the eye became a useful communication tool in addition to a sensory organ. It is believed that the exposed sclera of the human eye makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking, increasing the efficacy of this particular form of nonverbal communication, called cooperative eye hypothesis. Animal researchers have also found that, in the course of their domestication, dogs have also developed the ability to pick up visual cues from the eyes of humans. Dogs do not seem to use this form of communication with one another and only look for visual information from the eyes of humans.

Another hypothesis states that the distinctiveness of the human&#x27;s sclera is due to genetic drift and sexual selection. A visibly white sclera is perceived as a sign of good health and youthfullness, this could have been a criterion of selection when looking for a mate. In this case, humans&#x27; ability to communicate with their eyes (glancing, cluing at others) would only be a consequence of a very visible sclera.
===Trauma===
The bony area that makes up the human eye socket provides exceptional protection to the sclera. However, if the sclera is ruptured by a blunt force or is penetrated by a sharp object, the recovery of full former vision is usually rare. If pressure is applied slowly, the eye is actually very elastic. However, most ruptures involve objects moving at some velocity. The cushion of orbital fat protects the sclera from head-on blunt forces, but damage from oblique forces striking the eye from the side is not prevented by this cushion. Hemorrhaging and a dramatic drop in intraocular pressure are common, along with a reduction in visual perception to only broad hand movements and the presence or absence of light. However, a low-velocity injury which does not puncture and penetrate the sclera requires only superficial treatment and the removal of the object. Sufficiently small objects which become embedded and which are subsequently left untreated may eventually become surrounded by a benign cyst, causing no other damage or discomfort.

===Thermal trauma===
The sclera is rarely damaged by brief exposure to heat: the eyelids provide exceptional protection, and the fact that the sclera is covered in layers of moist tissue means that these tissues are able to cause much of the offending heat to become dissipated as steam before the sclera itself is damaged. Even relatively low-temperature molten metals when splashed against an open eye have been shown to cause very little damage to the sclera, even while creating detailed casts of the surrounding eyelashes. Prolonged exposure, however—on the order of 30 seconds—at temperatures above will begin to cause scarring, and above will cause extreme changes in the sclera and surrounding tissue. Such long exposures even in industrial settings are virtually nonexistent.

===Chemical injury===
The sclera is highly resistant to injury from brief exposure to toxic chemicals. The reflexive production of tears at the onset of chemical exposure tends to quickly wash away such irritants, preventing further harm. Acids with a pH below 2.5 are the source of greatest acidic burn risk, with sulfuric acid, the kind present in car batteries and therefore commonly available, being among the most dangerous in this regard. However, acid burns, even severe ones, seldom result in loss of the eye.

Alkali burns, on the other hand, such as those resulting from exposure to ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride or other chemicals with a pH above 11.5, will cause cellular tissue in the sclera to saponify and should be considered medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment.

==Abnormal coloring==

Redness of the sclera is typically caused by eye irritation causing blood vessels to expand, such as in conjunctivitis (&quot;pink eye&quot;). Episcleritis is a generally benign condition of the episclera causing eye redness. Scleritis is a serious inflammatory disease of the sclera causing redness of the sclera often progressing to purple.

Yellowing or a light green color of the sclera is a visual symptom of jaundice.

In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta, the sclera may appear to have a blue tint, more pronounced than the slight blue tint seen in children. The blue tint is caused by the showing of the underlying uveal tract (choroid and retinal pigment epithelium).

In those with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the sclera may be tinted blue due to the lack of proper connective tissue. 

In very rare but severe cases of kidney failure and liver failure, the sclera may turn black.

<text>Oregon State University (OSU) is a public land-grant research university in Corvallis, Oregon, United States. OSU offers more than 200 undergraduate-degree programs along with a variety of graduate and doctoral degrees through all 11 colleges. It has the seventh-largest engineering college in the nation (2023). Undergraduate enrollment for all colleges combined averages over 32,000 while an additional 5,000 students are engaged in post-graduate coursework through the university. 

In 2023, over 37,000 students were enrolled at OSU, making it the largest university in the state. Out-of-state students typically make up over one-quarter of the student body. Since its founding, over 272,000 students have graduated from OSU. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Initially chartered as a land-grant university, OSU became one of the four inaugural members of the sea grant program in 1971. Memberships in the Space Grant and Sun Grant research consortias were awarded in 1991 and 2003, making it one of only three schools in the nation to be designated a land, sun, sea and space grant university. OSU received a record high $449.9 million in research funding for the 2022 fiscal year and has ranked as the state&#x27;s top earner in research funding for over 50 years. OSU is also one of the top five doctoral university destinations in the nation for Fulbright Scholars (2022–2023).

== History ==
=== The 1800s ===

The university&#x27;s roots date to 1856, when it was founded as a primary and preparatory community school known as Corvallis Academy. The school&#x27;s first administrator and teacher was John Wesley Johnson, a famous figure in Oregon higher education. Johnson received his secondary education in Corvallis and his undergraduate from Pacific University before working at the new academy. He later attended Yale University and became an instrumental figure in the development and administration of several other early Oregon colleges. Within a decade of its inception, college-level coursework was added to the academy&#x27;s curriculum, making it the first public college in the region and a magnet for Oregon&#x27;s young adults seeking a profession. The university adopted eight name variations during the 1800s and three more in the 1900s. As with many land-grant colleges, name changes were common around the start of the 20th century and helped schools align with the period&#x27;s largest available federal grants in agricultural research.


Corvallis area Freemasons played a leading role in developing the early school. Several of the university&#x27;s largest buildings are named after these early founders. The school offered its first college-level curriculum in 1865, under the administration of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and the school&#x27;s first president, William A. Finley.

On August 22, 1868, the official articles of incorporation were filed for Oregon State University, known then as Corvallis College. Two months later, on October 27, 1868, OSU was chartered as the state&#x27;s first public college. To help ensure the state&#x27;s sole public college would be well funded, the Oregon Legislative Assembly designated it Oregon&#x27;s Land-grant university and the &quot;agricultural college of the state of Oregon&quot;. Acceptance of this grant required the college to comply with the requirements set forth in the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. The school was then authorized to grant Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts degrees. The first graduating class was in 1870, with Bachelor of Arts degrees. In 1872, the name of the school was changed to Corvallis State Agricultural College. As the school&#x27;s name changed so did its mission. Coursework in the sciences and technology became the most popular majors starting in 1900.

===The 1900s===
In 1914, the Oregon State Board of Higher Education, known then as the State Board of Higher Curricula, began assigning specific colleges to Oregon State University and the University of Oregon in an effort to eliminate duplication. &quot;...the board confined studies in engineering and commerce to the Corvallis campus and major work in the liberal arts and related subjects to the University of Oregon in Eugene. This was the first in a series of actions to make the curricula of the two schools separate and distinct.&quot;

In 1927, the school&#x27;s name was officially changed from Oregon Agricultural College to Oregon State Agricultural College (OSAC).

In 1929, the legislative assembly passed the Oregon Unification Bill, which placed Oregon&#x27;s public colleges under greater oversight of the newly renamed Oregon State Board of Higher Education. A doctorate in education was first offered in the early 1930s, with the conferral of four Doctor of Philosophy degrees in 1935. That year also saw the creation of the first summer session. The growing diversity in degrees offered by the college led leaders to adopt the name &quot;Oregon State College&quot; in 1937.

The name Oregon State University was adopted on March 6, 1961, by a legislative act signed into law by Governor Mark Hatfield.

==Campuses and educational outlets==
=== Main campus (Corvallis) ===

The , tree-lined main campus serves as an internationally recognized arboretum and the centerpiece of Corvallis, Oregon. The campus is 83 miles south of Portland, near the middle of the state&#x27;s Willamette Valley. Much of the main campus was designed by landscape architect John Charles Olmsted in 1906. In 2008, Olmsted&#x27;s early campus design was designated by the National Register of Historic Places as the Oregon State University Historic District. It is the only college or university campus in Oregon to hold a historic district designation. The Memorial Union was designed by OSU alum and renowned Oregon architect, Lee Arden Thomas. It has been recognized as &quot;one of the finest examples of neoclassical architecture in Oregon.&quot;

=== OSU-Cascades (Bend)===
In 2016 OSU completed the construction of a 10-acre branch campus in Bend. This campus is called OSU-Cascades and offers students living in Oregon&#x27;s central region an opportunity to attend select classes closer to their homes.

As of 2023, the branch campus stretches across 30 acres in southwest Bend, with options to grow into 90 more acres of OSU-owned land nearby. The latest goal is to attract around 5,000 students per year within the next decade. As of 2023, enrollment was around 1,400 students.

===Ecampus (online)===
Oregon State offers more than 80 degree and certificate programs made up from a selection of over 1,500 online courses in more than 110 subjects. US News &amp; World Report ranks OSU&#x27;s online Ecampus fourth nationally (2024). The Ecampus has held a top-10-ranking since 2015. In 2021 College Choice ranked the Ecampus college of liberal arts program the best in the nation. The same faculty teaching on campus also teach many of their programs and courses online through the Oregon State University Ecampus website. Students who pursue an online education at Oregon State earn the same diploma and transcript as on-campus students.

===OSU Portland Center (offices, classrooms and meeting spaces)===
In 2017, Oregon State University&#x27;s Portland headquarters were relocated to the newly renovated Meier &amp; Frank building. The historic building features modern offices, classrooms and meeting spaces; which fill the entire second floor of what is now known as the Portland Building. Located next to downtown Portland&#x27;s Pioneer Square, the OSU Portland Center accommodates offices for the OSU Extension Service, the OSU Foundation, the OSU Alumni Association, and the OSU Athletics Department. The downtown building provides the university with a more central location, in the state&#x27;s largest city, to maintain a base of operations. Aside from offices, the second floor also provides classroom space for teaching, research and meeting space for outreach engagement - similar to the work at OSU&#x27;s other campuses in Corvallis and Bend. Executives and university scientists working on major initiatives, such as the Marine Studies Initiative, use the space for lectures and international conferences.
The OSU Portland Center is also an important part of the OSU Advantage partnership. The partnership brings members of private industry, from throughout the world, to Portland to discuss proposed commercialization initiatives.

===Hatfield Marine Science Center (Newport)===

Recognized as one of the top marine laboratories in the nation, OSU&#x27;s Hatfield Marine Science Center has been a fixture in Newport, Oregon for over 50 years. The campus serves as an oceanographic research base for six state and federal agencies and also a resource for K-12 educators and the public. OSU&#x27;s agriculture, oceanography and marine science students have an opportunity to serve as summer interns at the Newport campus, while post-graduate students participate in a wide array of research programs year-around.

A $16.5 million project to build a 34,000-square-foot dormitory for OSU&#x27;s post-graduate students, staff and visiting professionals was approved in 2023. The complex will include 70+ studio-style apartments and a small number of two-bedroom apartments near the Newport campus.

===Funding===
Together with university leaders, the Oregon State University Foundation publicly launched Oregon State&#x27;s first comprehensive fundraising campaign, The Campaign for OSU, on October 26, 2007, with a goal of $625 million. Donors exceeded the goal in October 2010 nearly a year ahead of schedule, resulting in a goal increase to $850 million. In March 2012, the goal was raised to $1 billion. At OSU&#x27;s annual State of the University address in Portland on January 31, 2014, President Edward J. Ray announced that campaign contributions had passed $1 billion, making OSU one of 35 public universities to cross the billion-dollar fundraising mark and one of only two organizations in the Pacific Northwest to reach that milestone. The Campaign for OSU concluded on December 31, 2014, with more than $1.1 billion from 106,000 donors.

The Oregon State University Foundation is a nonprofit organization chartered to raise and administer private funds in support of the university&#x27;s education, research and outreach, governed by a volunteer board of trustees. It holds net assets exceeding $1 billion and manages most of the university&#x27;s composite endowment, valued at more than $827 million. 

In October 2022, the Foundation publicly launched Believe It: The Campaign for OSU, the university’s second comprehensive fundraising and engagement campaign, with a $1.75 billion goal for student and faculty support, facilities and equipment and strategic initiatives. Donors have stepped forward with over $1 billion in gifts since the campaign began in 2017.

===International partnerships===

Oregon State has varied and numerous partnership agreements with international institutions, including James Cook University in Australia, the University of Forestry in Bulgaria, Lincoln University in New Zealand and India&#x27;s Gokula Education Foundation.

===Undergraduate admissions===
Undergraduate admission to Oregon State is rated &quot;selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. OSU is the largest university in the state and set a new record for enrollment in 2023. Close to 37,000 students attended the university during the year - the most for any Oregon university on record. 

For fall 2015, OSU received 14,058 freshman applications; 11,016 were admitted (78.4%) and 3,593 enrolled. Fall of 2022 brought in the largest freshman class the university had seen, with 7,146 new students. The average high school grade point average (GPA) of the enrolled freshmen was 3.58, while the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 480-610 for critical reading, 490-630 for math, and 470-590 for writing. The middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 21–28.

===Teaching===
OSU has more majors, minors and special programs than any other university or college in Oregon.

===Research===
Research has played a central role in the university&#x27;s overall operations for much of its history. Most of OSU&#x27;s research continues at the Corvallis campus, but an increasing number of endeavors are underway at locations throughout the state and abroad. Research facilities beyond the campus include the John L. Fryer Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory in Corvallis, the Seafood Laboratory in Astoria and the Food Innovation Laboratory in Portland.

The 2005 Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education recognized OSU as a &quot;comprehensive doctoral with medical/veterinary&quot; university. It is one of three such universities in the Pacific Northwest to be classified in this category. In 2006, Carnegie also recognized OSU as having &quot;very high research activity&quot;, making it the only university in Oregon to attain these combined classifications.

OSU was one of the early members of the federal Space Grant program. Designated in 1991, the additional grant program made Oregon State one of only 13 schools in the United States at that time to serve as a combined Land Grant, Sea Grant and Space Grant university.
The university&#x27;s College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) operates several laboratories, including the Hatfield Marine Science Center and multiple oceanographic research vessels based in Newport. CEOAS is co-leading the largest ocean science project in U.S. history. The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) features a fleet of undersea gliders at six sites in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with multiple observation platforms. CEOAS is also leading the design and construction of the next class of ocean-faring research vessels for the National Science Foundation, which will be the largest grant or contract ever received by any Oregon university. The first of three planned research vessels, the Taani, was launched in May 2023 and will be stationed in Newport, Oregon. 

OSU also manages nearly of forest land, including the McDonald-Dunn Research Forest.

In 1967 the Radiation Center was constructed at the edge of campus, housing a 1.1 MW TRIGA Mark II Research Reactor. The reactor is equipped to utilize high-assay, low-enriched (HALEU) uranium zirconium hydride fuel. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s 2008 rankings placed OSU eighth in the nation in graduate nuclear engineering. In the early 2000s, researchers at the campus reactor developed the first working prototype Small Modular Reactor (SMR) to power large commercial operations, buildings, and large industrial facilities. More recently, Oregon State University has partnered with a leading manufacturer of SMRs, NuScale (a company started in part by OSU Faculty), to provide continued research and development for commercial applications.
The university&#x27;s College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) operates several laboratories, including the Hatfield Marine Science Center and multiple oceanographic research vessels based in Newport. In 2001, OSU&#x27;s Wave Research Laboratory was designated by the National Science Foundation as a site for tsunami research under the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation. The O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory is on the edge of the campus and is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most sophisticated laboratories for education, research and testing in coastal, ocean and related areas.

Oregon State University operates two off-shore research test facilities near Newport, Oregon for commercial wave energy technology companies to stress test prototypes. The North and South PacWave Energy Test Facilities are located several miles off the coast of Newport and serviced by the university&#x27;s Hatfield Marine Science Center. The South PacWave Test Facility is an open ocean test site consisting of four berths, which occupy two square nautical miles of ocean with a cable route to shore of approximately 12 miles in length. The North PacWave Test Facility offers a site in state waters with streamlined permitting (the expected time to permit is under one year). The site is shallower than PacWave South and closer to port.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences funds two research centers at OSU. The Environmental Health Sciences Center has been funded since 1969 and the Superfund Research Center has been funded since 2009.

OSU administers the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a United States Forest Service facility dedicated to forestry and ecology research. The Andrews Forest is a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve.

OSU&#x27;s Open Source Lab is a nonprofit founded in 2003 and funded in part by corporate sponsors that include Facebook, Google, and IBM. The organization&#x27;s goal is to advance open source technology by hiring and training students in software development and operations for large-scale coding projects. The lab hosts a number of projects, including contracted work for the Linux Foundation.

===Military===
Oregon State University is one of the few universities to have ROTC detachments for each branch of the US Military. Oregon State University Army ROTC is a distinguished program and has been taught regularly since 1873. The so-called Beaver Battalion is known as the West Point of the West for producing more commissioned officers than any other non-military school during World War II. It is located in McAlexander Fieldhouse, named after General Ulysses G. McAlexander, the former commander of Army ROTC.

After the Second World War ended in 1945, a Department of Naval Science was added at Oregon State. Providing officer training for both the US Navy and the US Marine Corps, it became one of the largest in the nation and has earned the unofficial title &quot;Naval Academy of the Northwest.&quot; On July 1, 1949, the US Army Air Corps training branch became a separate officer training unit later known as Aerospace Science. The Oregon State Air Force ROTC draws more freshmen scholarships than any other AFROTC unit in the nation and has had over 1,000 officers commissioned. In 1977, two graduates of the OSU AFROTC became the first women pilots in the Air Force. The Army and Air Force ROTC programs at the university share the McAlexander Fieldhouse.

===Libraries===

In 1999, OSU finished a $40 million remodeling of the campus library. Known as the Valley Library, the remodeled building was selected by &quot;The Library Journal&quot; as its 1999 Library of the Year, the first academic library so named.

===Rankings and recognition===
In 2023, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked Oregon State University in the top 1.4 percent out of 20,531 degree-granting institutions of higher education worldwide. The CWUR is known for relying heavily on outcome-based data to compile their rankings.

In 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked OSU tied for 139th nationally, tied for 71st top public and tied for 58th &quot;most innovative&quot; university in the U.S., and tied for 277th best globally.

In its 2021 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects, the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)&quot; ranked Oregon State University&#x27;s oceanography program 5th in the world, its agricultural sciences program in the top 50 worldwide, and its earth sciences, ecology and water resources program among the top 100 worldwide.

Agriculture and forestry at Oregon State University rank 26th in the world (11th in the U.S.), according to &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; in 2021.

In 2012, ECONorthwest conducted an economic impact analysis that found that each year OSU has a $2.06 billion economic footprint. $1.93 billion of this total was in the state of Oregon.



== Student life ==

Corvallis is Oregon&#x27;s 9th-largest city. It is a relatively small community and many of the local events have a strong connection to the university. OSU has over 400 active student organizations and groups. The campus is only a few hours&#x27; driving distance from any number of outdoor recreation opportunities. Several federal and state natural forests and parks are popular student destinations. These include the Cascade Range, a rugged coastline, several large forests, the high desert and numerous rivers and lakes. Portland, Oregon&#x27;s largest city, is north of campus.

From 1930 to 1968, OSU was home to the Gamma chapter of Phrateres, a philanthropic-social organization for female college students. Gamma was the third chapter of the organization, which eventually had over 20 chapters in Canada and the U.S.

Most older OSU students live off campus, but on-campus housing is available and required for most incoming freshmen. There are 16 residence halls on campus. 

The LaSells Stewart Center is the conference and performing arts center for the campus. Many famous speakers have graced the stage of the campus&#x27;s main auditorium, Austin Auditorium, while the Corvallis-OSU Symphony plays there frequently. The OSU Office of Conferences and Special Events is in the auditorium.

The PRAx (Patricia Valian Reser Center for the Creative Arts) is a 49,000 square foot arts center at Oregon State University. It features the nearly 500 seat Lynne Hallstrom Detrick Concert Hall, 200 seat Edward J. Ray Theater, The 3,000-square-foot Kate and John Stirek Art Gallery, Dixie Luana Wooton Kenney Garden, Thomas W. Toomey Lobby and Celia Strickland Austin &amp; Ken Austin III | Loni Austin Parrish &amp; Scott N. Parrish Arts Plaza.

The university is home to Orange Media Network, the university&#x27;s student media department. Orange Media Network encompasses the award-winning &quot;The Daily Barometer&quot; student newspaper, KBVR 88.7 FM, KBVR-TV, Prism Art and Literary Journal, lifestyle magazine Beaver&#x27;s Digest, and fashion magazine DAMchic.

===Student government===
The Associated Students of Oregon State University (ASOSU) is the officially recognized student government at Oregon State University and represents all students in campus affairs and at community, state and federal levels regarding issues that directly influence the quality of and access to, post-secondary education.

===Diversity===

Like most American universities and colleges, OSU actively works to diversify its faculty and staff. In 1993, OSU reported having difficulties retaining and hiring minority faculty members. Only 150 out of 2,284 faculty members were Black, Native American, Asian, or Hispanic. In response, the school president and vice president introduced a hiring initiative to promote and enhance diversity. The initiative &quot;recognizes the compelling need to build a welcoming and inclusive university community and the direct relationship between excellence and diversity&quot;.

Oregon State University has several cultural centers aimed at promoting diversity and supporting students of color, including the Lonnie B. Harris Black Cultural Center, Native American Longhouse, Asian &amp; Pacific Cultural Center and the Centro Cultural César Chávez. It also has a Pride Center for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.

In the fall of 2022, 30 percent of Oregon State University&#x27;s total enrollment was composed of students of color.

==Athletics==

In a 2008 national ranking of academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance, Oregon State was selected as one of America&#x27;s &quot;premier&quot; universities. The ranking, performed by &quot;STACK&quot; magazine, placed Oregon State 29th in the nation&#x27;s &quot;Elite 50&quot; universities.

The history of Oregon State athletics dates back to 1893 when &quot;Jimmie the Coyote&quot; was recognized as the first official mascot. In 1910, the official mascot was replaced by the beaver and remains the school&#x27;s mascot to this day. In 1915, the university&#x27;s varsity athletic teams were invited to join the Pacific Coast (Athletic) Conference as one of four charter members.

Reser Stadium now serves as the home field for the school&#x27;s football team. The school mascot is Benny the Beaver and first appeared on the football sidelines in 1952. The next year Oregon State added a football stadium to its campus, known then as Parker Stadium. Fundraisers in 2006 and 2007 helped expand Reser Stadium from 35,000 seats to 46,200. A time lapse video recording of the expansion is viewable on the internet. 1962 saw OSU&#x27;s (and the west coast&#x27;s) first Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Terry Baker. The University of Oregon is the university&#x27;s in-state rival for athletics. The annual Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry football game is one of the longest-running rivalries in all of college football.

The university&#x27;s home golf course, Trysting Tree&#x27;s, features championship-worthy golf and practice facilities. The name of the course can be traced back to a locally famous tree near Community Hall on campus where student couples would meet to make dates. Basketball is held in Gill Coliseum and named after former Beavers coach Slats Gill. The Coliseum is also home to the university&#x27;s Collegiate wrestling team. Baseball is played in Goss Stadium at Coleman Field. The OSU baseball team, won back-to-back NCAA Division I Baseball Championships in 2006 and 2007 and added a third win in 2018. Softball is held in the OSU Softball Complex. Opened in April 2001, the $1.5 million OSU Softball Complex seats 750. Oregon State hosted a Regional and Super Regional tournament in the 2006 NCAA tournament, winning both and moving on to the Women&#x27;s College World Series.

Oregon State has a total of four NCAA championships. In addition to the three baseball titles (2006, 2007 and 2018), the Beavers won the 1961 NCAA Men&#x27;s Cross Country Championship. In 1975, the men&#x27;s rowing Varsity-4 with coxswain team won the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Collegiate Rowing Championships in Syracuse, New York, establishing a course record which stood for 15 years. The Oregon State racquetball team has won 10 consecutive USA racquetball intercollegiate championships, beginning in 2008.

The 2018 Oregon State baseball team won the NCAA Division I Championship defeating the Arkansas Razorbacks in three games making it their third title ever in the sport of baseball managed by the same manager from the previous two titles Pat Casey.

<doc id="233159" wikidata="Q55052141" url="?curid=233159" title="François Huber">
<text>François Huber (2 July 175022 December 1831), also known as Francis in English publications and Franz in German publications, was a Swiss entomologist who specialized in honey bees. His pioneering work was recognized all across Europe and based on thorough observation with the help of several assistants due to his blindness.

==Life==
===Early life===
François Huber was born in Geneva on 2 July 1750 in a well respected and well-off family of merchants and bankers with important ties to Geneva, Lyon and Paris. The Huber family had members in the highest institutions in the local community and was linked to other prominent local families. The family made significant contributions to the scientific and theological literature. His great-aunt, Marie Huber, was known as a voluminous writer on religious and theological subjects, and as the translator and epitomizer of The Spectator (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753). His father Jean Huber (1721–1786) was a prominent member of the coterie at Ferney. He was a well known artist who left several portraits of Voltaire, who was a close friend. He was also interested in falcons and his observations led to him publishing on the subject.
From his early childhood, Francois was instructed in the field of literature as well as natural history, a passion he shared with his father. He attended the Collège de Saussure but his health soon deteriorated. His sight started failing at the age of fifteen. His father requested the assistance of Théodore Tronchin to treat him. He sent the young Huber to the village of Stains near Paris to recover. There, he lived the simple existence of a peasant away from the pressure of the high society. The treatment was very successful for his health and he had fond recollection of the simple life there and of the hospitality throughout his life.

However, his eyesight was considered incurable by the oculist Venzel and he was facing total blindness. He had however already met Marie Aimée Lullin, the daughter of the syndics of the Swiss Republic. They had both been companions during dances and had grown up together. Her father refused to consent to their union because of his blindness as he did not want his fortune to end in the hands of a blind man when his daughter inherited. However, Marie refused to abandon François and decided to wait until she was twenty-five, when she would be legally able to make that decision on her own. He could still see light and interacted with others as if he could see. He later lost his sight completely but throughout his life he would say: &quot;I have seen, I have seen with my own eyes&quot; when recalling his youth and when others described things to him.

===Marriage===
Marie resisted the pressures from her father to not marry this disabled man. She had, however, to wait to attain her majority, 25 years old at the time, in order to marry François. She walked down to the altar with François on 28 April 1776 with her maternal uncle, M. Rilliet Fatio, and married François Huber. She was 25 years and 23 days old. At her side was a close friend and confidant, Louise Eléonore Brière de Candolle, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle&#x27;s mother. Marie later shared this story of her marriage to the young scientist, and in later life, she would honor him and recount his life after his passing.

Marie became his reader, his secretary, and his observer, and she was very attentive in order to prevent any embarrassments in public that could have occurred from his disability. This strong loving relationship was noticed by many, including Voltaire who mentioned it in his correspondence, and it was inspiration for Germaine de Staël when she described the Belmont family in her novel Delphine.

===Early research===

He became interested in honey bees after being read the works of René de Réaumur and Charles Bonnet. He also had a conversation with the latter who was also based in Geneva. His curiosity was focused on the history of these insects. His initial desire was to verify some facts and then fill in missing information. Since he was now blind, he had to rely on the help of others. This included his wife but also his servant François Burnens, who was fully devoted to his master. François Burnens (1760–1837) was the son of peasants from Oulens-sous-Échallens from the Canton of Vaud who arrived in 1780. Huber taught him how to observe and directed him through questioning. He leveraged his memories of his youth and the testimonials of his wife and friends.

Through his &quot;observation&quot;, he discovered that the queen bee did not mate in the hive but in the air and detailed how the timing of this event was essential. He also confirmed the discovery by Schirach that bees are able to convert eggs into queens by the use of food (royal jelly) and that worker bees can also lay eggs. He described the battles between queens, the killing of drones at the end of the summer and what happens when a queen is replaced by a newly introduced queen. He also proved that bees used their antennae to communicate. He looked at the dimensions of the cells and how they influence the shape of the insects, the way the larvae spins silk to make its cocoons. He showed that queens are oviparitous. He looked at the ways swarms formed and was the first to provide an accurate biological history of bee colonies.

These observations were made using a new type of hive in which each comb had glass sides, which Huber developed; these hives were the ancestors of our modern observation hives. Until then, hives had been circular and made of straw. These new hives opened as books with each frame visible to view. These allowed the team to observe the bees and follow them around. These discoveries would not have been possible without the skills and bravery of François Burnens, who was fully committed to discovering the truth. It is said that he would face the attacks of an entire hive just to learn a fact.

===First publication===

The results of these observations were the publication of (&#x27;New observations on bees&#x27;) in Geneva in 1792. The 800-page volume was made of the letters that François had sent to Charles Bonnet, who happened to be his uncle. It was translated into English in 1806, and into German. It was very well received by the scientific community not just because of the discoveries but also because he had overcome such a disability. He was also welcomed by most of the academies of Europe, especially the French Academy of Sciences. It influenced other scientists, including the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin, who owned a copy and made a commentary of the book in his famous On the Origin of Species. He also mentions Pierre Huber.

The poet Jacques Delille in his &quot;Chant VII, Règne Animal&quot; celebrated Huber&#x27;s blindness and discovery:
===Further research===

He started studying wax and its production. It had been speculated without sufficient proof that it came from the honey. He had already explained the origin of propolis and was able to determine through observation with Burnens that wax came out from between the rings of the abdomen as laminated sheets. These initial findings were published in (&#x27;First memoir on the origin of wax&#x27;) in 1804.

Burnens left in 1795 to go back to his village. There he got married and became a farmer along with becoming a local judge. Marie-Aimée assisted Huber but he also started training his son, Pierre Huber. He started his apprenticeship with his father as an observer. He would go on to publish his own books, not on bees but on ants. With this new assistant by his side, he was able to continue his research and in 1814, published a second edition edited in part by his son. Further findings on wax were published in his second edition. Huber was also helped by Christine Jurine, who dissected bees for him and discovered the ovaries of the working bees.

He studied the damage caused by the &quot;Sphinx atropos&quot; in hives and looked into the question of smell and its importance in the hive. He also studied the respiratory system of bees. He was able to prove that bees consume oxygen like other animals. This begged the question of how they survived with such a large population in enclosed hives with only a small entrance for fresh air. He was able to prove for the first time that bees used their wings to circulate the air, creating adequate ventilation. In order to analyse the air, he worked with Jean Senebier, another Geneva scientist who was researching this question with regards to vegetables. The two became friends and they published the (&#x27;Memoirs on the Influence of Air and of Various Gaseous Substances on the Germination of Different Seeds&#x27;) in which they demonstrated the need for oxygen in germination.

===Last years===
Francois Huber spent his last years in Lausanne being cared for by his daughter, Marie Anne de Molin. He continued some of his research and remained curious. He was interested in the discovery of sting-less bees near Tampico in Mexico by Captain Hall. He was given some samples by Professor Prevost and later a full colony. He was said to have kept his mental capacity to the end. Those who were close to him said he was loving and beloved to the end. On 20 December, he wrote to a friend:
He died two days later on 22 December 1831 in the arms of his daughter.

==Legacy==
* Augustin de Candolle who was a close family friend and one of the first biographer, gave François Huber&#x27;s name to a genus of Brazilian trees &quot;Huberia&quot;, including &quot;Huberia laurina&quot;. It is a shrub with light green fruits that grows on rocky summits with soil-filled crevices and small areas of white sand at an elevation of .
* A book was published in Paris in 1829 titled &quot;Fragments d&#x27;Hubert sur les abeilles&quot; with an introduction by Dr. Mayranx. It is unclear if François Huber or Pierre Huber were involved in this publication but the last name is misspelled throughout.
* A novel by Sara George &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Pupil&quot; was published in 2002 inspired by the team of Huber and Burnens. It is written as the fictional journal of François Burnens from his arrival at the Huber household at the age of 19 years old in 1784 to his departure 10 years later in 1794. Her novel is based on the writings of Huber but also those of Augustin de Candolle. A French version was published in 2018 in Geneva by Slatkine.

François Huber has been largely forgotten not only in the Geneva local history but also in the beekeeping community in spite of his discoveries having been unchallenged for over two centuries.

<text>Victor G. Szebehely (August 21, 1921 – September 13, 1997) was a key figure in the development and success of the Apollo program.

In 1956, a dimensionless number used in time-dependent unsteady flows was named &quot;Szebehely&#x27;s number,&quot; (In the September and October 1977 issues of the journal Celestial Mechanics, volume 16, an equation used to determine the gravitational potential of the Earth, planets, satellites, and galaxies was named &quot;Szebehely&#x27;s equation&quot;).

He worked with General Electric, Yale University, the Royal Netherlands Navy, the United States Air Force, NASA, and the University of Texas at Austin. One of his areas of research was orbital debris and planetary defense against meteor impacts

His first book, &quot;The Theory of Orbits&quot;, is an important work in orbital mechanics, being the definitive text on the restricted three-body problem as applicable to an Earth-Moon spacecraft system such as Apollo. 

He was knighted by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in 1957.

== History ==
Szebehely was born in Budapest, Hungary. His father was an engineer and he started to study in that field, but switched later to physics. In 1944 he graduated as an engineer from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Because of the threatening communist take over he went to the United States in 1947 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. 

Szebehely authored &quot;Hydrodynamics of Slamming Ships&quot; as David Taylor Model Basin Report 823 in 1952 and co-authored &quot;Ship Slamming in Head Seas&quot; as DTMB Report 913 in 1955.

He was the author of several books.

In 1978 he received the very first Dirk Brouwer Award from the Dynamical Astronomy Division of the American Astronomical Society.

He died in Austin, Texas at age 76.

<text>Jean Senebier (25 May 1742 – 22 July 1809) was a Genevan Calvinist pastor and naturalist. He was chief librarian of the Republic of Geneva. A pioneer in the field of photosynthesis research, he provided extensive evidence that plants consume carbon dioxide and produced oxygen. He also showed a link between the amount of carbon dioxide available and the amount of oxygen produced and determined that photosynthesis took place at the parenchyma, the green fleshy part of the leaf.

== Biography ==
Senebier was born in Geneva, the son of a wealthy merchant. He wrote extensively on plant physiology and was one of the major early pioneers of photosynthesis research. Senebier also published on the experimental method, first in 1775, and then in an expanded work, in 1802. His precise definition of the experimental method anticipated the work of noted French physiologist Claude Bernard fifty years later. Senebier also served as chief librarian of the Republic of Geneva.

Senebier was greatly influenced by Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet. Senebier was also influenced by the Italian animal physiologist and experimental biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani, several of whose works Senebier translated from Italian into French. Spallanzani&#x27;s chemical research on bodily functions of animals helped lead Senebier towards studying plant chemistry. Although Senebier&#x27;s first research on plants was a large study on effects of light, he is remembered mainly for the extensive evidence he provided that carbon dioxide (&quot;fixed air&quot; or &quot;carbonic acid,&quot; in the terminology of his day) is consumed by plants in the production of oxygen (&quot;dephlogisticated air&quot;), in the physiological process that later became known as photosynthesis. Senebier also found that the amount of oxygen produced is roughly proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide available to the plant. Further, he determined that the green fleshy parts of leaves (the parenchyma) are the sites where carbon dioxide is transformed into oxygen. Senebier also correctly concluded that plants use the carbon in carbon dioxide as a nutriment. Senebier did some of his research jointly with fellow Swiss naturalist François Huber.

Senebier arrived at his best known achievement, his demonstration that plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, based entirely on the Phlogiston theory of chemistry, and only in his later works did he reformulate his conclusions in terms of the more modern, oxygen chemistry developed by Antoine Lavoisier and colleagues. This discovery by Senebier regarding gases ranks as one of the last of the important early discoveries in the unraveling of the fundamental chemical processes of photosynthesis. Marcello Malpighi and Nehemiah Grew, working independently in the late seventeenth century, and Stephen Hales in the early eighteenth century, had provided evidence that the atmosphere was important to plants, but further progress in understanding the role of gases in plant physiology awaited discoveries made between 1750 and 1780. In 1754, Charles Bonnet reported that leaves that were plunged in aerated water produced bubbles of gas, but he did not identify the gas. Then, in 1775, English chemist Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen (which he named &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot;), and, just a few years later, in 1779, Dutch physician and researcher Jan Ingenhousz demonstrated that the bubbles of gas observed by Bonnet on submerged leaves consisted of this same gas. Ingenhousz also published the first convincing evidence that leaves produce this gas only in sunlight.

Senebier was a close friend of noted Genevan geologist and meteorologist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure and was instrumental in the education of Horace-Bénédict&#x27;s son Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure. Senebier trained the young man in Lavoisier&#x27;s system of chemistry, which Nicolas-Théodore later applied in important plant-nutrition studies of his own. The younger Saussure would eventually discover the role of water in photosynthesis, thus completing the early chemical research on this subject.

In April 1809, Senebier became a Correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The standard botanical author abbreviation Seneb. is applied to species Senebier described.

<text>Recalcitrant seeds are seeds that do not survive drying and freezing during &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation. By and large, these seeds cannot resist the effects of drying or temperatures less than 10 °C (50 °F); thus, they cannot be stored for long periods like orthodox seeds because they can lose their viability. Plants that produce recalcitrant seeds include avocado, mango, mangosteen, lychee, cocoa, rubber tree, some horticultural trees, aquatic plants such as &quot;Nymphaea caerulea&quot;&quot;,&quot; and several plants used in traditional medicine, such as species of &quot;Virola&quot; and &quot;Pentaclethra&quot;. Generally speaking, most tropical pioneer species have orthodox seeds but many climax species have recalcitrant or intermediate seeds.

== Mechanisms of damage ==

The two main mechanisms causing damage to recalcitrant seeds are desiccation effects on the intracellular structures and metabolic damage from the formation of toxic chemicals such as free radicals. An example of the first type of damage would be found in some recalcitrant nontropical hardwood seeds, specifically the acorns of recalcitrant oaks, which can be stored in a non-frozen state for up to two years provided that precautions are taken against drying. These seeds show deterioration of cell membrane lipids and proteins after as few as 3–4 days of drying. Other recalcitrant seeds, such as those of the sweet chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;), show oxidative damage resulting from uncontrolled metabolism occurring during the drying process.

== Storage ==
Preservation of recalcitrant seeds remains experimental. Some approaches include:
* Removal of the embryo inside for cryopreservation (liquid nitrogen).
* Cryopreservation of the whole seed in an anti-freezing solution.

Intermediate seeds are between orthodox and recalcitrant seeds in their survivability. They are initially identified by their inability to survive conventional dry-freezing storage while being able to survive cryopreservation as a whole. The storage guideline is to put them in refrigeration at 45–65% RH, for a maximum of five years.

<text>Julius von Sachs (; 2 October 1832 – 29 May 1897) was a German botanist from Breslau, Prussian Silesia. He is considered the founder of experimental plant physiology and co-founder of modern water culture. Julius von Sachs and Wilhelm Knop are monumental figures in the history of botany by first demonstrating the importance of water culture for the study of plant nutrition and modern plant physiology in the 19th century.

==Early life==
Sachs was born at Breslau on 2 October 1832. His father, Graveur Sachs, was an engraver by trade, and father taught son delineation and accuracy of line and color. From earliest boyhood Julius was fascinated with plants, making collections of them on many field excursions with his father. He gave much of his time between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to drawing and painting the flowers, fungi, and other specimens which he collected. At the Gymnasium from 1845 to 1850 he was most interested in the natural sciences, collecting skulls, writing a monograph on the crayfish. His natural science teacher, one Krober, showed a singular lack of foresight when he solemnly warned young Sachs against devoting himself to the natural sciences.

When he was sixteen years old, his father died, and in the next year both his mother and a brother died of cholera. Suddenly without financial support, he was fortunate to be taken into the family of Jan Evangelista Purkyně who had accepted a professorship at the University of Prague. Sachs was admitted to the university in 1851.

Sachs famously labored long hours in the laboratory for Purkyně, and then long hours for himself each day after his work in the laboratory was finished. After the lab, he could devote himself entirely to establishing how plants grow.

==Career==
In 1856 Sachs graduated as doctor of philosophy, and then adopted a botanical career, establishing himself as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; for plant physiology. In 1859 he was appointed physiological assistant to the Agricultural Academy of Tharandt (now part of the Technical University of Dresden) at Julius Adolph Stöckhardt; and in 1862 he was called to be director of the Polytechnic at Chemnitz, but was almost immediately transferred to the Agricultural Academy at Poppelsdorf (now part of the University of Bonn), where he remained until 1867, when he was nominated professor of botany in the University of Freiburg.

In 1868 he accepted the chair of botany in the University of Würzburg, which he continued to occupy (in spite of calls from more prestigious German universities) until his death.

Sachs achieved distinction as an investigator, a writer and a teacher; his name will ever be especially associated with the great development of plant physiology which marked the latter half of the 19th century, though there is scarcely a branch of botany to which he did not materially contribute. His earlier papers, scattered through the volumes of botanical journals and of the publications of learned societies (a collected edition was published in 1892–93), are of great and varied interest. Prominent among them is the series of &quot;Keimungsgeschichten,&quot; which laid the foundation of our knowledge of microchemical methods, as also of the morphological and physiological details of germination.
Then there is his resuscitation of the method of &quot;water-culture,&quot; and the application of it to the investigation of the problems of nutrition.

Most important are his experiments, developing the concept of photosynthesis, that the starch-grains, found in leaf chloroplasts, depend on sunlight. A leaf that has been in sunlight, then bleached white and stained with iodine turns black, proving its starch content, whereas a leaf from the same plant that has been out of the sun will remain white. A demonstration of this experiment is shown in the second episode of BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Botany: A Blooming History&quot; presented by Timothy Walker.

Sachs&#x27;s later papers were almost exclusively published in the three volumes of the &quot;Arbeiten des botanischen Instituts in Würzburg&quot; (1871–88). Among these are his investigation of the periodicity of growth in length, in connection with which he devised the self-registering auxanometer, by which he established the retarding influence of the highly refrangible rays of the spectrum on the rate of growth; his research on heliotropism and geotropism, in which he introduced the clinostat; his work on the structure and the arrangement of cells in growing-points; the elaborate experimental evidence upon which he based his &quot;imbibition-theory&quot; of the transpiration-current; his exhaustive study of the assimilatory activity of the green leaf; and other papers of interest.

Sachs&#x27; first published volume was the &quot;Handbuch der Experimentalphysiologie des Pflanzen&quot; (1865; French edition, 1868), which gives an admirable account of the state of knowledge in certain departments of the subject, and includes a great deal of original information. This was followed in 1868 by the first edition of his famous &quot;Lehrbuch der Botanik&quot;. It is a comprehensive work, giving a summary of the botanical science of the period, enriched with the results of many original investigations. The third edition was translated into French by Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem in 1873, and into English by Alfred Bennett in 1875, and published by Oxford University Press. The fourth and last German edition was published in 1874, and also issued by Oxford in 1882.

The &quot;Lehrbuch&quot; was eventually superseded by the &quot;Vorlesungen uber Pflanzenphysiologie&quot; (1st edition, 1882; 2nd edition, 1887; Eng. ed., Oxford, 1887), a work more limited in scope, but covering more ground than its title would imply; it has not gained the general recognition accorded to the &quot;Lehrbuch&quot;. Finally, there is the &quot;Geschichte der Botanik&quot; (1875); an account of the development of the various branches of botanical science from the middle of the 16th century up to 1860, of which an English edition was published in 1890 by the Oxford Press.

A full account of Sachs&#x27; life and work was given by Professor Goebel, formerly his assistant, in &quot;Flora&quot; (1897), of which an English translation appeared in &quot;Science Progress&quot; for 1898. There is also an obituary notice of him in the &quot;Proc. Roy. Soc.&quot; vol. lxii.

In 1885 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Evolution==

Sachs has been described as a &quot;post-Darwinian botanist&quot; who &quot;integrated the evolutionary theory into his morphological writings.&quot; He was originally supportive of Darwinism but in his late career became bitterly opposed to it, instead preferring non-Darwinian evolution.

==Influence==
Many pupils of Sachs like Julius Oscar Brefeld, Francis Darwin, Karl Ritter von Goebel, Georg Albrecht Klebs, Spiridon Miliarakis, Hermann Müller-Thurgau, Fritz Noll, Wilhelm Pfeffer, Karl Prantl, Christian Ernst Stahl, Hugo de Vries and Harry Marshall Ward became later famous botanists.

His scientific statements also influenced Dennis Robert Hoagland and Daniel Israel Arnon, who followed one of Sachs&#x27; principles in developing nutrient solutions, by quoting him as follows: &quot;I mention the quantities (of chemicals) I am accustomed to use generally in water cultures, with the remark, however, that a somewhat wide margin may be permitted with respect to the quantities of the individual salts and the concentration of the whole solution – it does not matter if a little more or less of the one or the other salt is taken – if only the nutritive mixture is kept within certain limits as to quality and quantity, which are established by experience.&quot; This so-called &quot;Sachs&#x27; quantity and quality principle&quot; and &quot;Knop&#x27;s four-salt mixture&quot; contributed significantly to the development of the famous Hoagland solution.

The standard botanical author abbreviation Sachs is applied to species he described.

In 1866, botanist Griseb. published &quot;Sachsia&quot;, which is a genus of West Indian and Floridian plants in the elecampane tribe.
Then in 1895, botanist Paul Lindner published &quot;Sachsia&quot;, which is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum and Saccharomycetales order. Both were named in honour of Julius von Sachs.

<text>Henry Hart Milman (10 February 1791 – 24 September 1868) was an English historian and ecclesiastic.

==Life==
He was born in London, the third son of Sir Francis Milman, 1st Baronet, physician to King George III (see Milman Baronets). Educated at Eton and at Brasenose College, Oxford, his university career was brilliant. He won the Newdigate prize with a poem on the &quot;Apollo Belvidere&quot; in 1812, was elected a fellow of Brasenose in 1814, and in 1816 won the English essay prize with his &quot;Comparative Estimate of Sculpture and Painting&quot;. In 1816 he was ordained, and two years later became parish priest of St Mary&#x27;s, Reading.

In 1821 Milman was elected professor of poetry at Oxford; and in 1827 he delivered the Bampton lectures on &quot;The character and conduct of the Apostles considered as an evidence of Christianity&quot;. In 1835, Sir Robert Peel made him Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and Canon of Westminster, and in 1849 he became Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864.
Milman was buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where his grave was marked by an elaborate tomb. When the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire was created, the original tomb was replaced by a slab in the floor.

==Works==
Milman made his appearance as a dramatist with his tragedy &quot;Fazio&quot; (produced on the stage under the title of &quot;The Italian Wife&quot;). He also wrote &quot;Samor, the Lord of The Bright City&quot;, the subject of which was taken from British legend, the &quot;bright city&quot; being Gloucester. In subsequent poetical works he was more successful, notably the &quot;Fall of Jerusalem&quot; (1820) and &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot; (1822, based on the life of Saint Margaret the Virgin), which was used as the basis for a &quot;sacred musical drama&quot; by Arthur Sullivan. The influence of Byron is seen in his &quot;Belshazzar&quot; (1822). Another tragedy, &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot;, followed in 1826. Milman also wrote &quot;When our-heads are bowed with woe,&quot; and other hymns; a version of the Sanskrit episode of &quot;Nala and Damayanti&quot;; and translations of the &quot;Agamemnon&quot; of Aeschylus and the &quot;Bacchae&quot; of Euripides. His poetical works were published in three volumes in 1839.

Turning to another field, Milman published in 1829 his &quot;History of the Jews&quot;, which is memorable as the first by an English clergyman which treated the Jews as an Oriental tribe, recognized sheikhs and amirs in the Old Testament, sifted and classified documentary evidence, and evaded or minimized the miraculous. In consequence, the author was attacked and his preferment was delayed. His &quot;History of Christianity to the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman Empire&quot; (1840) had been completely ignored; but the continuation of his major work, the &quot;History of Latin Christianity&quot; (1855), which has passed through many editions, was well received. In 1838 he had edited Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, and in the following year published his &quot;Life of Gibbon&quot;.

Milman was also responsible for an edition of Horace, and when he died he had almost finished a history of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which was completed and published by his son, A. Milman (London, 1868), who also collected and published in 1879 a volume of his essays and articles.

Milman wrote the hymn, &quot;Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!&quot;, often sung on Palm Sunday.

==Family==
By his wife, Mary Ann Cockell, a daughter of Lieut.-General William Cockell, Milman had four sons and two daughters. Among the sons were William Milman (1824–1908), Arthur Milman, who wrote a biography about his father, and Sir Archibald Milman (1834–1902), Clerk of the House of Commons. His nephew, Robert Milman (1816–1876), was Bishop of Calcutta from 1867 until his death, and was the author of a &quot;Life of Torquato Tasso&quot; (1850).

<doc id="233193" wikidata="Q3851558" url="?curid=233193" title="Master-General of the Ordnance">
<text>The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position from 1415 to 2013 (except 1855–1895 and 1939–1958) with some changes to the name, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military. In March 2013 the holder was titled as &quot;Director Land Capability and Transformation&quot;, but still sat on the Army Board as Master-General of the Ordnance; in September 2013 the post was eliminated.

==History==
The Office of Armoury split away from the Privy Wardrobe of the Tower (of London) in the early 15th century. The Master of the Ordnance came into being in 1415 with the appointment of Nicholas Merbury by Henry V. The Office of Ordnance was created by Henry VIII in 1544 and became the Board of Ordnance in 1597. Its head was the Master-General of the Ordnance; his subordinates included the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance and the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Before the establishment of a standing army or navy, the Ordnance Office was the only permanent military department in England. In 1764 it established the British standard ordnance weights and measurements for the artillery, one of the earliest standards in the world.

The position of Master-General was frequently a cabinet-level one, especially in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when it was normally a political appointment. In 1855 the post was discontinued and certain of the ceremonial aspects of the post were subsequently vested in the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. In 1904, the post was re-established, and until 1938 the Master-General of the Ordnance was the Fourth Military Member of the Army Board.

In 1913, the control of military aviation was separated from the responsibilities of the Master-General of the Ordnance. A new Department of Military Aeronautics was established and Brigadier-General Henderson was appointed the first director.

In March 2013, the holder was titled as &quot;Director Land Capability and Transformation&quot; but still sat on the army board as Master-General of the Ordnance. In September 2013, the post was abolished.

<doc id="233195" wikidata="Q978234" url="?curid=233195" title="Air compressor">
<text>An air compressor is a machine that takes ambient air from the surroundings and discharges it at a higher pressure. It is an application of a gas compressor and a pneumatic device that converts mechanical power (from an electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine, etc.) into potential energy stored in compressed air, which has many uses. A common application is to compress air into a storage tank, for immediate or later use. When the delivery pressure reaches its set upper limit, the compressor is shut off, or the excess air is released through an overpressure valve. The compressed air is stored in the tank until it is needed. The pressure energy provided by the compressed air can be used for a variety of applications such as pneumatic tools as it is released. When tank pressure reaches its lower limit, the air compressor turns on again and re-pressurizes the tank.
A compressor is different from a pump because it works on a gas, while pumps work on a liquid.

==Classification==
===Power source===
*Internal combustion engine: Petrol, petrol without oil, diesel
*Electric: AC, DC

===Drive type===
*Direct drive
*Belt drive

Compressors may be classified according to the pressure delivered:
* Low-pressure air compressors, which have a discharge pressure of or less
* Medium-pressure compressors which have a discharge pressure of 
* High-pressure air compressors, which have a discharge pressure above 

There are numerous methods of air compression, divided into either positive-displacement or roto-dynamic types.
* Single-stage reciprocating compressor
* Multi-stage reciprocating compressor
* Single stage rotary-screw compressor
* Two-stage rotary screw compressor
* Rotary vane pump
* Scroll compressor
* Centrifugal (roto-dynamic or turbo) compressor
* Axial compressor, often used in jet engines.

* Another way of classification, is by lubrication type: oil lubricated and oil-free. The oil-less (or oil-free) system has more technical development such as they do not require oil for lubrication. oil-less air compressors are also lighter and more portable than oil-lubricated models but require more maintenance. On other side Oil-lubricated air compressors are the more traditional type of air compressor. They require oil to lubricate the motor which helps prolong the compressor&#x27;s life. One of the benefits of oil-lubricated compressors is that they tend to be more durable and require less maintenance than oil-free compressors.

===Positive displacement compressors===

Positive-displacement compressors work by forcing air through a chamber whose volume is decreased to compress the air. Once the pressure is greater than the pressure outside the discharge valve, a port or valve opens and air is discharged into the outlet system from the compression chamber. Common types of positive displacement compressors are
* Piston-type air compressors, which compress air by pumping it through cylinders by reciprocating pistons. They use one-way valves to admit air into the cylinder on the induction stroke and prevent it from leaving by the same route, and out of the cylinder through the exhaust valve to the high pressure side on the compression stroke, again using a non-return valve to prevent it leaking back on the next induction stroke. Piston compressors can be single or multi-stage, and may also have one or more sets of cylinders in parallel (at the same pressure). Multi-stage compressors provide greater efficiency than their single-stage counterparts for high compression ratios, and generally use interstage cooling to improve efficiency.

The capacities for both single-stage and two-stage compressors are generally specified in Standard Cubic feet per Minute (SCFM) or litres per minute and pounds per square Inch (PSI) or bar. To a lesser extent, some compressors are rated in actual cubic feet per minute (ACFM). Still others are rated in cubic feet per minute (CFM). Using CFM alone to rate a compressor is ambiguous because it represents a flow rate without a pressure reference. i.e. 20 CFM &quot;at 60 PSI.&quot; 

Single stage compressors usually fall into the fractional through 5 horsepower range. Two-stage compressors normally fall into the 5 through 30 horsepower range.

* Rotary screw compressors provide positive-displacement compression by matching two helical screws that, when turned, guide air into a chamber, whose volume is decreased as the screws turn. Rotary screw compressors can be single-stage or two-stage.
* Vane compressors: use a slotted rotor with varied blade placement to guide air into a chamber and compress the volume. This type of compressor delivers a fixed volume of air at high pressures.

=== Roto-dynamic or turbo compressors ===
Roto-dynamic air compressors include centrifugal compressors where Rotating vanes impart kinetic energy to a gas and stationary passages convert velocity into a rise in pressure, and axial compressors, where rotor blades impart the kinetic energy and stator blades convert it to a rise in pressure.

== Cooling ==
Due to adiabatic heating, air compressors require some method of disposing of waste heat. Generally this is some form of air- or water-cooling, although some (particularly rotary type) compressors may be cooled by oil (that is then in turn air- or water-cooled). The atmospheric changes are also considered during cooling of compressors. The type of cooling is determined by considering the factors such as inlet temperature, ambient temperature, power of the compressor and area of application. There is no single type of compressor that could be used for any application.

== Applications ==
Air compressors have many uses, such as supplying clean high-pressure air to fill gas cylinders, supplying clean moderate-pressure air to a submerged surface supplied air diver, supplying moderate-pressure clean air for driving some office and school building pneumatic HVAC control system valves, supplying a large amount of moderate-pressure air to power pneumatic tools, such as jackhammers, filling high pressure air tanks (HPA, air tank), for filling tires, and to produce large volumes of moderate-pressure air for large-scale industrial processes (such as oxidation for petroleum coking or cement plant bag house purge systems).

Air compressors are also widely used in oil and gas, mining and drilling applications as the flushing medium, aerating muds in underbalanced drilling and in air pigging of pipelines.

Most air compressors either are reciprocating piston type, rotary vane or rotary screw. Centrifugal compressors are common in very large applications, while rotary screw, scroll, and reciprocating air compressors are favored for small and medium-sized applications.

== Power source ==
Air compressors are designed to utilize a variety of power sources. While direct drive gasoline or diesel-engines and electric motors are among the most popular, air compressors that utilize vehicle engines, power-take-off, or hydraulic ports are also commonly used in mobile applications.

The power of a compressor is measured in HP (horsepower) and CFM (cubic feet per minute of intake air).
The volume of the pressure vessel and the stored pressure indicate the volume of compressed air (in reserve) available.

Gasoline and diesel-powered compressors are widely used in remote areas with problematic access to electricity. They are noisy and require ventilation for exhaust gases, particularly if the compressed air is to be used for a breathing air supply. Electric-powered compressors are widely used in production, workshops and garages with permanent access to electricity. Common workshop/garage compressors are 110-120 Volt or 230-240 Volt. Compressor tank shapes are: &quot;pancake&quot;, &quot;twin tank&quot;, &quot;horizontal&quot;, and &quot;vertical&quot;. Depending on a size and purpose compressors can be stationary or portable.

== Maintenance ==

To ensure all compressor types run efficiently with no leaks, it is necessary to perform routine maintenance. The cost of maintenance only accounts for 8% of the life cycle cost of owning an air compressor. 

==Air compressor isentropic efficiency==
According to CAGI air compressor performance verification data sheets, the higher the isentropic efficiency is, the better the energy saving is. The better air compressor isentropic efficiency has reached 95%.
Approximately 70~80% of the air compressor&#x27;s total lifetime cost is energy consumption, so using the high-efficiency air compressor is one of the energy-saving methods.

<text>USS &quot;Trenton&quot; (LPD-14) was an , the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the capital of New Jersey. In 2007, it was sold to the Indian Navy and renamed .

==History==

===Building process===

Her keel was laid down at Seattle, Washington, on 8 August 1966 by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company. She was launched on 3 August 1968 sponsored by Mrs. Richard J. Hughes, and commissioned on 6 March 1971.

===Initial operations===

&quot;Trenton&quot; got under way on 9 April for the East Coast and reached her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, on 12 May. The amphibious transport dock remained in port until 1 June when she departed Hampton Roads for shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. However, on 28 June, her shakedown cruise was interrupted when a steam valve in her number two engine room ruptured, killing four sailors instantly and severely injuring six others. The injured men were evacuated first to Guantánamo Bay and thence to the burn ward of the United States Army Hospital at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. There, two of the six subsequently died as a result of their injuries.

&quot;Trenton&quot; returned to Guantánamo Bay for interim repairs and then made her way back to Norfolk on one engine, arriving on 6 July. After repairs at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, she completed shakedown training off the Virginia Capes and in the Guantánamo Bay operating area. On 9 November, the ship returned to Norfolk and remained there through the end of 1971.

===1972–1973===

On 17 January 1972, &quot;Trenton&quot; rounded Cape Charles and headed north to participate in the military exercise Exercise &quot;Snowy Beach.&quot; She arrived off Reid State Park, Maine, three days later and participated in the cold weather amphibious exercise until 23 January when she headed home. On 4 February, she stood out of Hampton Roads bound for the Gulf of Mexico in company with . The two ships reached New Orleans, Louisiana, on 9 February and, for the next six days, served as &quot;hotel&quot; ships for ROTC and military participants in Mardi Gras.

&quot;Trenton&quot; returned to Norfolk on 20 February and resumed her East Coast-West Indies routine. Following amphibious training at Onslow Beach, North Carolina, and sea trials near Norfolk, she visited the Caribbean Sea in April with other units of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 4. She then devoted the rest of the early summer to exercises and training at Onslow Beach and at Norfolk before preparing for her first Mediterranean deployment.

The ship departed Norfolk on 28 July, embarked Marines at Morehead City, North Carolina, on 29 July, and headed across the Atlantic on 30 July. She reached Rota, Spain, on 10 August and, with the other units of PhibRon 4, was incorporated into the United States Sixth Fleet as Task Force (TF) 61. She spent the remainder of the year and most of the first month of 1973 in the Mediterranean Sea. During that six-month period, &quot;Trenton&quot; participated in six amphibious landing exercises (Phiblexes), most of which were conducted in cooperation with the military services of foreign nations. In September, she conducted a landing exercise at Timbakion, Crete, with units of the Italian Navy. Greek and Italian ships joined her later that month for Phiblex 3–73 conducted at Alexandroupolis, Greece. In mid-October, troops of the French Foreign Legion provided the opposition for a landing exercise at Corsica. &quot;Trenton&quot; visited Izmir, Turkey, in mid-September and, in mid-December, concluded her exercise schedule at Porto Scuda, Sardinia, with Phiblex 6–73. On 16 January 1973, she headed home; and, ten days later, she entered the Naval Amphibious Base at Little Creek, Virginia.

On 1 March, &quot;Trenton&quot; shifted to the administrative command of PhibRon 10. On the 27th, she embarked Marines at Morehead City and headed for Onslow Beach, where she participated in Exercise &quot;Exotic Dancer VI.&quot; On 7 April, the warship headed south to Vieques Island, near Puerto Rico. From 10 to 14 April, &quot;Trenton&quot; joined other Navy ships in Exercise &quot;Escort Tiger XIV,&quot; which consisted of training for disaster assistance to the island countries of the Caribbean. During this Caribbean cruise, she visited Maracaibo, Venezuela, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands before embarking the Marines at Vieques on 3 May. After a port visit at Ponce, Puerto Rico, &quot;Trenton&quot; carried her Marines to Guantánamo Bay for a four-day exercise. On 14 May, she departed the Caribbean and, after disembarking the Marines on 17 May, reached Norfolk on 18 May.

On 11 June, &quot;Trenton&quot; steamed out of Hampton Roads for northern Europe. She reached Kiel, Germany, on 22 June, and, for the next week, participated in the annual &quot;Kiel Week&quot; naval celebration. Early in July, she visited Portsmouth, England, and, at mid-month, put into Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The amphibious transport dock departed Europe at Rotterdam on 21 July and headed back to the United States.

&quot;Trenton&quot; spent the remainder of the summer conducting drills in the Virginia Capes Operating Area and in preparation for her second Caribbean deployment of the year. On 1 October, she shifted from PhibRon 10 to PhibRon 8. On the last day of that month, she embarked Marines at Morehead City and headed south. For the remainder of the year, she cruised the Caribbean, visiting ports in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and in the Netherlands Antilles as well as conducting amphibious exercises at Vieques Island. The amphibious transport dock returned to Norfolk on 14 December.

===1974–1975===

During the first four months of 1974, &quot;Trenton&quot; conducted operations out of Little Creek and Norfolk and prepared for duty in the Mediterranean. On 10 May, she embarked Marines at Morehead City and put to sea. Ten days later, she reached Rota, Spain, and joined the Sixth Fleet. For the next six months&#x27; she cruised the Mediterranean, visiting ports and conducting exercises. In July, &quot;Trenton&quot; participated in the evacuation of 286 refugees from strife-torn Cyprus to Beirut, Lebanon. While with the Sixth Fleet, she participated in four amphibious exercises. One Operation – &quot;Good Friendship/Double Effect&quot; – included ships of the Turkish Navy. On 20 October, she steamed out of Rota to return to the United States. She arrived in Norfolk on 31 October and operated in the western Atlantic through the end of 1974.

On 7 March 1975, she embarked Marines at Morehead City and headed south. After an amphibious assault exercise at Onslow Beach from 8 to 10 March, she continued south to the Caribbean. During the two-month cruise, Trenton participated in four exercises, two of which – &quot;LantReadEx 2–76&quot; and &quot;Rum Punch&quot; – were held in cooperation with units of the Royal Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy. She returned to Norfolk on 28 April. In May, she hosted a class from the Naval War College, conducted a midshipman training cruise for the United States Naval Academy, and returned to Onslow Beach for joint service Exercise &quot;Solid Shield.&quot; During the early summer, &quot;Trenton&quot; prepared for overhaul. On 14 August, she headed north to New York, moored at the Coastal Drydock and Repair Company on the following day, and commenced a nine-month overhaul.

===1976–1980===

On 12 May 1976, &quot;Trenton&quot; completed her overhaul and, following loadout at Little Creek, Virginia, she deployed to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba on 6 July for refresher training. Returning to Norfolk on 17 August, the ship&#x27;s next three months was spent in preparation for a forthcoming Mediterranean deployment. On 15 November, &quot;Trenton&quot;, with embarked elements of Marine Battalion Landing Team 1/6, formed Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group 3–76 and operated with the Sixth Fleet. On 17 January 1977, in Barcelona, Spain, a landing craft being used as a liberty boat by &quot;Trenton&quot; and , was run over by a freighter. The boat capsized and came to rest against the fleet landing pier. Crewmembers from both vessels were on hand to assist with rescue operations. There were over one hundred sailors and marines on board the landing craft. 49 sailors and marines were killed. A memorial is erected at the landing pier in memory. She returned to Norfolk on 12 May 1977.

Following post-deployment stand down which ended on 30 June, &quot;Trenton&quot; spent the remainder of 1977 conducting midshipman training cruises, engaging in amphibious exercises, and participating in Comptuex 3–77, which involved units of the Standing Naval Force Atlantic.

The year 1978 found &quot;Trenton&quot; embarking elements of Battalion Landing Team 1/2 and deploying to the Caribbean from 30 January to 7 March to participate in Atlantic Fleet Readiness Exercise 1–78. The succeeding four months were spent in preparations for a return to the Mediterranean. The ship, with embarked elements of Marine Battalion Landing Team 2/8, departed Morehead City on 27 July, as part of Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group 2–78. The remainder of 1978 was spent with the Sixth Fleet in that sea.

In September 1980, &quot;Trenton&quot; served as the Advance Force flagship for the three-week NATO Exercise Teamwork – 80, in the fjords of Norway. &quot;Trenton&quot; embarked the flag staff of Commander Service Force Atlantic, including two female officers – the first time that female officers were embarked on Navy ships for long-term major exercises. As the Advance Force flagship, &quot;Trenton&quot; inserted SEALs and Marine Recon units as the first phase of the exercise, before landing other Marine units. After the exercise, the ship made port visits to Malmö, Sweden; Bremen, Germany; and Portsmouth, England before returning to Norfolk.

===1981–1996===

In January 1981, &quot;Trenton&quot; departed Norfolk for a six-month deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean as part of the Marine Amphibious Ready Group (MARG 1-81) and Battalion Landing Team 2/8. The ship with her embarked Marines conducted amphibious landings and exercises with Spain, Italy and Greece. During operations in Spain, the Marines lost a Cobra helicopter with the pilot and a Marine killed. Plans to transit the Suez Canal and operate in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean were cancelled in order to remain south of Crete for possible Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) in Lebanon. The ship remained at sea more than 70 days. Port visits were made around the Mediterranean. On 27 April 1981, during the five-day port visit to Alexandria, &quot;Trenton&quot; and the submarine were slightly damaged when the &quot;Jack&quot;, surged against &quot;Trenton&quot; in heavy sea swells. In June, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Hayward, visited the ship. &quot;Trenton&quot; returned to Norfolk in July 1981.

On 17 October 1983 the &quot;Trenton&quot; departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea. Somewhere east of Bermuda, she was diverted to Grenada to take part in Operation Urgent Fury. &quot;Trenton&quot; transited to the Eastern Mediterranean in November and took station off the coast of Beirut. While there she lost the hydraulic operating system for the port sterngate, as a result of operating in high sea conditions, and had to retire to Larnaca Bay, Cyprus to raise it lest it be lost to heavy seas. Further repairs were made at Haifa, Israel during December and until 3 January 1984.

In April 1988, &quot;Trenton&quot; participated in Operation Praying Mantis, a one-day naval battle between the United States and Iran, one helicopter was lost. The ship and its crew were awarded the Combat Action Ribbon, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for various operations.

In August 1990, &quot;Trenton&quot; was ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Her crew received a Navy Unit Commendation, the Southwest Asia Service Medal with two bronze stars for both Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the Kuwait Liberation Medal by the Kuwaiti government and the Kuwait Liberation Medal by the Saudi Arabian government.

On 26 December 1990, Navy Seals, Marine Recon, and Marine MPs from &quot;Trenton&quot; boarded the Libyan ship &quot;Kahldoon&quot; to search for prohibited cargo. of rice was found and confiscated. It was determined that the Libyan vessel was in violation of the supply embargo placed on Iraq.

On 2 January 1991, &quot;Trenton&quot; along with USS &quot;Guam&quot; were dispatched from anchorage off Oman to be prepared for Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) from Mogadishu, Somalia&#x27;s capital, which had been suddenly enveloped by violence when rebels entered the city and the central government collapsed. On 5–6 January, 281 US and foreign nationals were airlifted from the US embassy, including all of the embassy&#x27;s staff along with diplomats from several nations (notably, the Soviet ambassador to Somalia and 38 Soviet diplomats). The vessels returned to Oman and the evacuees disembarked on 11 January, ending Operation Eastern Exit. The ship and crew were awarded the Navy Unit Commendation as part of PHIBRON 6.

In April 1996, President Clinton ordered the ship to steam towards the coast of Liberia to assist in the evacuation of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals. This operation became known as Operation Assured Response. Her crew received the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.

===End of United States Navy career===

In July 2006, the U.S. tasked the vessel with evacuating citizens from Lebanon. The ship took some 3,500 Americans in two trips one to Cyprus and the other to Turkey. During the deployment, the ship&#x27;s crew also conducted maritime security operations off the Somali Peninsula in Africa. &quot;Trenton&quot; and its nearly 400 sailors made their final homecoming 21 September 2006 before the ship&#x27;s decommissioning and transfer to the Indian Navy on 17 January 2007.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Trenton&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award. 

==Sale to the Indian Navy==

In 2006, the Indian government purchased &quot;Trenton&quot; for US$48.44 million (Rs 2.18 billion). The ship was turned over to the Indian Navy on 17 January 2007. The Indian Navy renamed the ship as the (Sanskrit for &quot;Hippopotamus&quot;). It remained at Norfolk Naval Base for refitting until May 2007. Six UH-3 Sea King maritime utility transport helicopters are operated from the ship. The ship is based at Visakhapatnam under the Eastern Naval Command.

<text>Sharon Cohen (; born 2 February 1969), professionally known as Dana International (), is an Israeli pop singer. She has released eight albums and three additional compilation albums. She was the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song &quot;Diva&quot;.

After consolidating her initial commercial success with the albums &quot;Umpatampa&quot; (1994) and &quot;Maganuna&quot; (1996), she was selected in 1998 to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest with her song &quot;Diva&quot;. Placing first at the international competition, she came to public attention throughout Europe.

Dana following up this success with the albums &quot;Free&quot; (1999), &quot;Yoter VeYoter&quot; (2001), &quot;HaHalom HaEfshari&quot; (2002) and &quot;Hakol Ze Letova&quot; (2007), she represented Israel in Eurovision a second time in 2011, this time with the song &quot;Ding Dong&quot;, which failed to make it into the final. The same year, she became a judge on the Israeli television music talent contest &quot;Kokhav Nolad&quot;.

== Early life ==
Cohen was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to a family of Yemenite-Jewish descent. Her paternal grandparents lived in Petah Tikva. She is the youngest of three children, and was named after an uncle who had been killed during a terrorist attack.

Though assigned male at birth, she identified as female from a very young age. She wanted to become a singer from the age of eight, when she watched Israeli singer Ofra Haza perform her song &quot;Chai&quot; in the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest. Although the family was quite poor, her mother worked to pay for her music lessons, and she stated that her childhood was happy. She came out as transgender at the age of 13.

== Career ==

=== 1990–1993: Dana International ===
At 18 years of age, Cohen (still legally male at the time) earned a living as a drag queen, parodying many famous female singers. During one of her performances, she was discovered by Offer Nissim, a well-known Israeli DJ, who produced her debut single &quot;Saida Sultana&quot; (&quot;The Great Saida&quot;), a satirical version of Whitney Houston&#x27;s song &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot;. The song received considerable exposure and helped launch her career as a professional singer.

In 1993, Dana International flew to London for male-to-female sex reassignment surgery and legally changed her name to Sharon Cohen. Returning home with her new name, that same year Cohen released her first album, titled &quot;Danna International&quot;, in Israel. Soon after, the album was also released in several other countries including Greece, Jordan, and Egypt (In Jordan and Egypt the album sold illegally). Sharon&#x27;s stage name Dana International comes from the title track of the album, and was originally spelled with two n&#x27;s. &quot;Danna International&quot; soon became a gold record in Israel.

=== 1994–1995: Umpatampa and Eurovision Song Contest ===
In 1994, Dana released her second, Trance-influenced album &quot;Umpatampa&quot;, which built on the success of her debut and provided further hit singles. The album went platinum in Israel and has sold more than 50,000 copies to date. Because of her popularity and the success of this album, she won the award for &quot;Best Female Artist of the Year&quot; in Israel.

In 1995, Dana attempted to fulfill her childhood dream of performing in the Eurovision Song Contest. She entered the Eurovision qualifying contest in Israel with a song entitled &quot;Layla Tov, Eropa&quot; (&quot;Good Night Europe&quot;) which finished second in the pre-selections, but became another hit single.

In late 1995, Dana released an E.P. called &quot;E.P. Tampa&quot; with three new songs and four remixes and special versions of her earlier songs.

=== 1996–1998: Consolidating popularity, &quot;Diva&quot; and mainstream spotlight ===
In 1996, Dana released her third album, &quot;Maganuna&quot;. Although this album was less successful than her previous efforts, it still reached gold record sales in Israel and included the hits &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;Menafnefet&quot; (Waving) and the club favorite &quot;Cinque Milla.&quot; In 1997, Dana collaborated with the Israeli artist Eran Zur on his album &quot;Ata Havera Sheli,&quot; and together they sang the duet &quot;Shir Kdam-Shnati (Sex Acher)&quot; (&quot;Pre-Bed Song (A Different Kind of Sex)&quot;) which became a huge hit.

Dana was chosen to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song &quot;Diva&quot;. Orthodox Jews and others with conservative views were opposed to the choice and attempted to void her participation in the contest. In May 1998, Dana performed &quot;Diva&quot; at the Eurovision final and won the contest with 172 points. She became known internationally, and was interviewed by CNN, BBC, Sky News, and MTV among others mostly focusing on her life as a transsexual person before winning the contest. Dana&#x27;s own words &quot;the message of reconciliation&quot; were; &quot;My victory proves God is on my side. I want to send my critics a message of forgiveness and say to them: try to accept me and the kind of life I lead. I am what I am and this does not mean I don&#x27;t believe in God, and I am part of the Jewish Nation.&quot;

Dana released &quot;Diva&quot; as a single in Europe and it became a hit, reaching number 11 in the UK charts and the top ten in Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

=== 1999–2001: Stage falling, Streisand cover and new albums ===
In 1999, Dana released &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, a Barbra Streisand cover. In May 1999, Dana again participated in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem. Dana was a part of the interval act and sang the Stevie Wonder song &quot;Free&quot;. One memorable moment from the event happened when she presented the award to the winners of the contest. Whilst she was carrying the heavy trophy, one of the composers of the winning Swedish entry stepped on the long trail of her dress by mistake, and she fell over on stage – in front of a television audience estimated to be one million or more, making it one of the most memorable moments in the 50-year-long history of the contest.

She released her next album &quot;Free&quot; in Europe in 1999, which enjoyed moderate success. A few months later Dana moved back to Israel and started to work on different projects. Israeli and Japanese editions of &quot;Free&quot; were released in 2000. That same year, an Israeli documentary film was made about Dana called &quot;Lady D&quot;.

In 2001, after a break, Dana released her seventh album &quot;Yoter Ve Yoter&quot; (&quot;More and More&quot;). The album put her career in Israel back on track and provided two hits called &quot;Ani Nitzachti&quot; (I Won) and &quot;Achrei HaKol&quot; (After All), which eventually both went gold.

=== 2002–2007: Fading from the scene and Sony BMG incident ===

Dana was about to sign with a major label, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, for an international recording contract. There were disagreements that led to Sony Music cancelling the deal before it was completed.

In 2002, she released another album, &quot;HaHalom HaEfshari&quot; (&quot;The Possible Dream&quot;), which was a minor chart success. In 2003, she released an exclusive 8-CD box set, containing all singles from &quot;The Possible Dream&quot; and a new house version of the hit single &quot;Cinque Milla&quot;, titled &quot;A.lo.ra.lo.la&quot;.

A few years later, in 2005, Dana participated in the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Copenhagen, after &quot;Diva&quot; was selected as one of fourteen songs considered to be the best Eurovision songs. The song did not make it into the final top five. Dana got the chance to perform both &quot;Diva&quot; and an old Eurovision favourite of hers, Baccara&#x27;s 1978 entry &quot;Parlez-Vous Français?&quot;. She also recorded the song &quot;Lola&quot; (sung in French), to which she released a video. This video can be found on the CD &quot;Hakol Ze Letova&quot;, released in 2007 as a bonus CD-rom video.

=== 2007–2011: Return to music and Eurovision comeback ===

After a few years away from show business, together with the relaunch of her official website, a first single of the upcoming album was released in March 2007: &quot;HaKol Ze LeTova&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s All For the Best&quot;). The second single to be released from the album, &quot;Love Boy&quot;, became the most played song on Israeli radio in a decade. It also gained a respectable place on the airplay of the Greek radio station FLY FM 89,7. The following album, also titled &quot;Hakol Ze Letova&quot;, was released on 15 August 2007. &quot;At Mukhana&quot; (You Are Ready) was the third single and &quot;Seret Hodi&quot; (Indian Movie; feat. &quot;Idan Yaniv&quot;) the fourth to be released from the album, which became a bestseller in many online stores. The next single released from the album was &quot;Yom Huledet&quot; (Birthday).

On 26 February 2008, Dana gained an additional achievement when the song &quot;Ke&#x27;ilu Kan&quot; written and composed by her and performed by Boaz Mauda, was chosen on Kdam Eurovision to represent Israel at Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia. It came 5th in the semi-final and gained 9th place in the final rank.

Dana also recorded the song &quot;Mifrats HaAhava&quot; (&quot;The Love Bay&quot;) for an Israeli version of the TV-show &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot;. She also collaborated with the Ukrainian duo NeAngely (Not Angels), recording &quot;I Need Your Love&quot; and releasing a video. In 2009, Dana starred in a mock reality show called &quot;Dana Kama/Nama&quot; for cellphone provider Cellcom

Dana campaigned for Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni shortly before 2009 legislative elections in Israel. At a women&#x27;s political rally in Jerusalem Dana performed a disco song alongside Livni onstage, announcing &quot;I now formally invite you to the diva sisterhood.&quot;

In April 2009, Dana performed in the opening concert of Tel Aviv-Yafo Centennial Year. She performed a cover version of Danny Robas&#x27; song &quot;Lo Nirdemet Tel Aviv&quot; (Tel Aviv Doesn&#x27;t Fall Asleep) in front of 250,000 people.

Also in 2009, Dana International joined the 7th season of &quot;Kokhav Nolad&quot; (the Israeli version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;) as a judge, also joining the 8th one in 2010. Dana made a guest appearance, as herself, in an episode of the second series of UK sitcom &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, which was set around her Eurovision appearance.

On 8 March 2011, Dana International won the Israeli National Final for Eurovision with the song &quot;Ding Dong&quot;, and represented Israel at Eurovision for a second time. The song did not qualify for the final; she thus became the first Eurovision winner to do so.

=== 2013–present: new singles, TV show and album ===
In April 2013, after a two-year break, Dana released a new single, &quot;Ma La&#x27;asot&quot; (What To Do). It was released digitally worldwide on 24 April 2013. On 29 May, Dana released a video clip for the song Loca, to promote the Gay Pride Tel Aviv 2013. Dana would perform on the main event for the Gay Pride on 7 June. Her third single for that year, &quot;Ir Shlema&quot; (A Whole City), was released in July. Late in January 2014, Dana&#x27;s new music reality show &quot;Yeshnan Banot&quot; premiered. Dana is the main judge on the show, attempting to find Israel&#x27;s next girl group.

Also in 2014, Dana was the main attraction aboard the first Jewish boat to participate in the Amsterdam Pride Canal Parade. Dana stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in any religion, so I&#x27;m here as an Israeli, not as a Jew. But it&#x27;s time to end the persecution over religion or national reasons. Just cut out all that shit. That&#x27;s my message.&quot; Previously, after she won the Eurovision song competition, a religious debate had been held as to whether, and how, Dana should pray in a synagogue, with one rabbinical authority concluding that Dana should be counted in a minyan as a man. She could not sing in front of the community since she was also a woman, according to the rabbi, and that would violate the Orthodox rule of kol isha.

In June 2017, Dana released a new single, called &quot;Ruti&quot;. In August 2017 she released another single, called &quot;Yesh Li Ahava (La Costa)&quot;. In November 2017 she released a third single, called &quot;Nish&#x27;eret Itcha&quot; (Staying With You).

In April 2018, Dana recorded a new version of the Jewish folk song &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; to promote &quot;Israel Calling&quot;, a pre-Eurovision event. 20 years after her win in the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest in Birmingham with her song Diva, Dana released a new version of her hit in June 2018, in association with NYX Hotel and pagfilms.

In July 2018, Dana performed at the rally during the 2018 Israeli LGBT&#x27;s strike events with her song &quot;Ani Nitzakhti&quot; (I Won). Later that month she released a new version of the Jewish song &quot;Mi Ha&#x27;Ish&quot; (Who is the Man) to promote the Jerusalem Pride and Tolerance Parade, in which she performed in August.

In May 2019, Dana performed &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; as an interval act in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, held in Tel Aviv, 20 years after her Eurovision win last brought the contest to Israel. She later performed Omer Adam&#x27;s &quot;Tel Aviv&quot; and her Eurovision-winning song &quot;Diva&quot; during the final&#x27;s opening flag parade.
