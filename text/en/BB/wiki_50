<text>Kathakali (IAST: Kathakaḷi ) is a traditional form of Indian Classical Dance, and one of the most complex forms of Indian theatre. It is a play of verses. These verses are called Kathakali literature or &quot;Attakatha&quot;. Mostly played in the courts of kings and temple festivals. Hence it is known as suvarna art forms. This performance uses the &quot;navarasas&quot; from the Natya Shastra text, authored by sage Bharata. Makeup and costumes are unique and large. It represents one of Kerala&#x27;s traditional theater artforms. It is native to the Malayalam-speaking state of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced by Malayali people.

Kathakali is closely related to a more ancient theater artform of Kerala called &quot;Kutiyattam&quot; which is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the common era, and is officially recognized by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.


==Overview== 

The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 16th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) of the southwestern Indian peninsula, which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE. A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India. Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.

The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk stories, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas. The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in Sanskritised Malayalam. In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women artistes, and adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare. In 2011, a performance expressing Christian doctrine was staged for the first time in Kerala.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The term &quot;Kathakali&quot; is derived from &quot;katha&quot; () which means &quot;story or a conversation, or a traditional tale&quot;, and &quot;kaḷi&quot; () which means &quot;performance&quot; or &quot;play&quot;. The dance symbolises the eternal fight between good and evil.

==History==
Elements and aspects of Kathakali are taken from ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra. The Natya Shastra is attributed to sage Bharata, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BC and 200 AD, but estimates vary between 500 BC and 500 AD.

The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures–all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathakali. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.

The roots of Kathakali are unclear. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. Kathakali emerged as a distinct genre of performance art during the 16th and 17th centuries in Kerala. The roots of Kathakali, states Mahinder Singh, are more ancient and some 1500 years old.

===Links to older performance arts: Kutiyattam, Krishnanattam and Koothu===
According to Farley Richmond and other scholars, Kathakali shares many elements such as costumes with ancient Indian performance arts such as &quot;Kutiyattam&quot; (classical Sanskrit drama) and medieval era &quot;Krishnanattam&quot;, even though a detailed examination shows differences. &quot;Kutiyattam&quot;, adds Richmond, is &quot;one of the oldest continuously performed theatre forms in India, and it may well be the oldest surviving art form of the ancient world&quot;. &quot;Kutiyattam&quot;, traditionally, was performed in theatres specially designed and attached to Hindu temples, particularly dedicated to the Shiva and later to Krishna. The designs of these theatres usually matched the dimensions and architecture recommended as &quot;ideal&quot; in the ancient &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, and some of them could house 500 viewers.

&quot;Krishnanattam&quot; is the likely immediate precursor of Kathakali, states Zarrilli. &quot;Krishnanattam&quot; is dance-drama art form about the life and activities of Hindu god Krishna, that developed under the sponsorship of Sri Manavedan Raja, the ruler of Calicut (1585-1658 AD). The traditional legend states that Kottarakkara Thampuran (also known as Vira Kerala Varma) requested the services of a &quot;Krishnanattam&quot; troupe, but his request was denied. So Kottarakkara Thampuran created another art form based on &quot;Krishnanattam&quot;, called it &quot;Ramanattam&quot; because the early plays were based on the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, which over time diversified beyond &quot;Ramayana&quot; and became popular as &#x27;Kathakali&#x27;.

Another related performance art is &quot;Ashtapadiyattom&quot;, a dance drama based on the Gita Govinda of the twelfth-century poet Jayadeva, told the story of Krishna embodied as a humble cowherd, his consort Radha, and three cow girls. Kathakali also incorporates several elements from other traditional and ritualistic art forms like Mudiyettu, Theyyam and Padayani besides folk arts such as Porattu Nadakam that shares ideas with the Tamil &quot;Therukoothu&quot; tradition. The south Indian martial art of &quot;Kalarippayattu&quot; has also influenced Kathakali.

Despite the links, &quot;Kathakali&quot; is different from temple-driven arts such as &quot;Krishnanattam&quot;, &quot;Kutiyattam&quot; and others because unlike the older arts where the dancer-actor also had to be the vocal artist, &quot;Kathakali&quot; separated these roles allowing the dancer-actor to excel in and focus on choreography while the vocal artists focused on delivering their lines. &quot;Kathakali&quot; also expanded the performance repertoire, style and standardized the costume making it easier for the audience to understand the various performances and new plays.

==Repertoire==
&quot;Kathakali&quot; is structured around plays called Attakatha (literally, &quot;enacted story&quot;), written in Sanskritized Malayalam. These plays are written in a particular format that helps identify the &quot;action&quot; and the &quot;dialogue&quot; parts of the performance. The &quot;Sloka&quot; part is the metrical verse, written in third person – often entirely in Sanskrit - describing the action part of the choreography. The &quot;Pada&quot; part contains the dialogue part. These &quot;Attakatha&quot; texts grant considerable flexibility to the actors to improvise. Historically, all these plays were derived from Hindu texts such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

A &quot;Kathakali&quot; repertoire is an operatic performance where an ancient story is playfully dramatized. Traditionally, a Kathakali performance is long, starting at dusk and continuing through dawn, with interludes and breaks for the performers and audience. Some plays continued over several nights, starting at dusk every day. Modern performances are shorter. The stage with seating typically in open grounds outside a temple, but in some places, special theatres called &quot;Kuttampalam&quot; built inside the temple compounds have been in use.

The stage is mostly bare, or with a few drama-related items. One item, called a Kalivilakku (kali meaning dance; &quot;vilakku&quot; meaning lamp), can be traced back to Kutiyattam. In both traditions, the performance happens in the front of a huge Kalivilakku with its thick wick sunk in coconut oil, burning with a yellow light. Traditionally, before the advent of electricity, this special large lamp provided light during the night. As the play progressed, the actor-dancers would gather around this lamp so that the audience could see what they are expressing.

The performance involves actor-dancers in the front, supported by musicians in the background stage on right (audience&#x27;s left) and with vocalists in the front of the stage (historically so they could be heard by the audience before the age of microphone and speakers). Typically, all roles are played by male actor-dancers, though in modern performances, women have been welcomed into the Kathakali tradition.

===Costumes===

Of all classical Indian dances, Kathakali has the most elaborate costuming consisting of head dresses, face masks and vividly painted faces. It typically takes several evening hours to prepare a Kathakali troupe to get ready for a play. Costumes have made Kathakali&#x27;s popularity extend beyond adults, with children absorbed by the colors, makeup, lights and sounds of the performances.

The makeup follows an accepted code, that helps the audience easily identify the archetypal characters such as gods, goddesses, demons, demonesses, saints, animals and characters of a story. Seven basic makeup types are used in Kathakali, namely &quot;Pachcha&quot; (green), &quot;Pazhuppu&quot; (ripe), &quot;Kathi&quot;, &quot;Kari&quot;, &quot;Thaadi&quot;, &quot;Minukku&quot; and &quot;Teppu (red)&quot;. These vary with the styles and the predominant colours made from rice paste and vegetable colors that are applied on the face. Pachcha (green) with lips painted brilliant coral red portrays noble characters and sages such as Krishna, Vishnu, Rama, Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nala and philosopher-kings.

&quot;Thaadi&quot; (red) is the code for someone with an evil streak such as Dushasana and Hiranyakashipu. Some characters have a green face (representing heroic or excellence as a warrior) with red dots or lines on their cheeks or red-coloured moustache or red-streaked beard (representing evil inner nature), while others have a full face and beard coloured red, the latter implying excessively evil characters. 

Kari (black) is the code for forest dwellers, hunters, and middle ground character. Demonesses and treacherous characters are also painted black but with streaks or patches of red.

Yellow is the code for monks, mendicants, and women. &quot;Minukka&quot; (radiant, shining) with a warm yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous feminine characters such as Sita, Panchali and Mohini. Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region. Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as Hanuman. &quot;Teppu&quot; is for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as Garuda, Jatayu and Hamsa who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories. Face masks and headgear is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colours have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.

The character types, states Zarrilli, reflect the Guṇa theory of personalities in the ancient Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. There are three Guṇas, according to this philosophy, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world. These three &quot;Guṇas&quot; are &#x27; (goodness, constructive, harmonious, virtuous), &#x27; (passion, aimless action, dynamic, egoistic), and &quot;&quot; (darkness, destructive, chaotic, viciousness). All of these three &quot;gunas&quot; (good, evil, active) are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to the Hindu worldview. The interplay of these &quot;gunas&quot; defines the character of someone or something, and the costumes and face colouring in Kathakali often combines the various colour codes to give complexity and depth to the actor-dancers.

===Acting===

Like many classical Indian arts, Kathakali is choreography as much as it is acting. It is said to be one of the most difficult styles to execute on stage, with young artists preparing for their roles for several years before they get a chance to do it on stage. The actors speak a &quot;sign language&quot;, where the word part of the character&#x27;s dialogue is expressed through &quot;hand signs (mudras)&quot;, while emotions and mood is expressed through &quot;facial and eye&quot; movements. In parallel, vocalists in the background sing rhythmically the play, matching the beats of the orchestra playing, thus unifying the ensemble into a resonant oneness.

Several ancient Sanskrit texts such as &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; and &quot;Hastha Lakshanadeepika&quot; discuss hand gestures or mudras. Kathakali follows the &quot;Hastha Lakshanadeepika&quot; most closely, unlike other classical dances of India.

There are 24 main mudras, and numerous more minor ones in Kathakali. There are nine facial expressions called &quot;Navarasas&quot;, which each actor masters through facial muscle control during his education, in order to express the emotional state of the character in the play. The theory behind the &quot;Navarasas&quot; is provided by classical Sanskrit texts such as Natya Shastra, but sometimes with different names, and these are found in other classical Indian dances as well. The &quot;Navarasas&quot; express nine &quot;bhava-&quot;s (emotions) in Kathakali as follows: 

# &quot;Sringara&quot; expresses &quot;Rati&quot; (love, pleasure, delight)
# &quot;Hasya&quot; expresses &quot;Hasa&quot; (comic, laugh, mocking)
# &quot;Karuna&quot; expresses &quot;Shoka&quot; (pathetic, sad)
# &quot;Raudra&quot; expresses &quot;Krodha&quot; (anger, fury)
# &quot;Vira&quot; expresses &quot;Utsaha&quot; (vigor, enthusiasm, heroic)
# &quot;Bhayanaka&quot; expresses &quot;Bhaya&quot; (fear, concern, worry)
# &quot;Bibhatsa&quot; expresses &quot;Jugupsa&quot; (disgust, repulsive)
# &quot;Adbhuta&quot; expresses &quot;Vismaya&quot; (wondrous, marvel, curious)
# &quot;Shanta&quot; expresses &quot;Sama&quot; (peace, tranquility).

===Sequence===

A Kathakali performance typically starts with artists tuning their instruments and warming up with beats, signalling to the arriving audience that the artists are getting ready and the preparations are on. The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the &quot;Thodayam&quot; and &quot;Purappadu&quot; performances, which are preliminary &#x27;pure&#x27; (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion. &quot;Thodayam&quot; is performed behind a curtain and without all the costumes, while &quot;Purappadu&quot; is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.

The expressive part of the performance, which constitutes the dance-drama, is split into four types: &quot;Kalasham&quot; (major and most common), &quot;Iratti&quot; (special, used with battles-related &quot;Chempata&quot; rhythm), &quot;Thonkaram&quot; (similar to &quot;Iratti&quot; but different music), and &quot;Nalamiratti&quot; (used for exits or link between the chapters of the play).

The entrance of characters onto the Kathakali stage can be varied. Many of these ways are not found in other major Indian classical dance traditions. Kathakali employs several methods: 

# direct without special effects or curtain
# through the audience, a method that engages the audience, led by torchbearers since Kathakali is typically a night performance
# tease and suspense called &quot;nokku&quot; or &quot;thirasheela&quot; or &quot;tiranokku&quot;, where the character is slowly revealed by the use of a curtain. The &quot;tease&quot; method is typically used for characters with hidden, dangerous intentions.

==Songs and musical instruments==

The play is in the form of verses that are metered and lyrical, sung by vocalists whose voice has been trained to various melodies (&quot;ragas&quot;), music and synchronized with the dance-acting on the stage. The vocalists not only deliver the lines, but help set the context and express the inner state of the character by modulating their voice. For example, anger is expressed by the use of sharp high voice and pleading is expressed by the use of a sad tone.

Music is central to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and triggers emotions resonant with the nature of the scene. It also sets the rhythm to which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: Chempada (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); &quot;Chempa&quot; music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); &quot;Panchari&quot; (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); &quot;Triputa&quot; (thought-provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); Adantha (scenes involving kings or divine beings); Muri Adantha musical style (for comic, light-hearted, or fast-moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).

Many musical instruments are used in Kathakali. Three major drums found are &quot;Maddalam&quot;(barrel-shaped), Chenda (cylindrical drum played with curved sticks) and &quot;Idakka&quot; (Idakka, hourglass-shaped drum with muted and melodious notes played when female characters perform).

Traditional plays

Over five hundred Kathakali plays (&quot;Aattakatha&quot;) exist, most of which were written before the 20th century. Of these, about four dozen are most actively performed. These plays are sophisticated literary works, states Zarrilli, and only five authors have written more than two plays. The late 17th century Unnayi Variyar, in his short life, produced four plays which are traditionally considered the most expressive of the Kathakali playwrights. Typically, his four plays are performed on four nights, and they relate to the mythical Hindu love story of Nala and Damayanti. The Nala-Damayanti story has roots in the texts of 1st millennium BCE and is found in the Mahabharata, but the Kathakali play version develops the characters, their inner states, the emotions and their circumstances far more than the older texts.

A tradition Kathakali play typically consists of two interconnected parts, the third-person &quot;Shlokas&quot; and first-person &quot;Padams&quot;. The &quot;Shlokas&quot; are in Sanskrit and describe the action in the scene, while &quot;Padams&quot; are dialogues in Malayalam (Sanskritized) for the actors to interpret and play. A &quot;Padam&quot; consists of three parts: a &quot;Pallavi&quot; (refrain), &quot;Anupallavi&quot; (subrefrain) and &quot;Charanam&quot; (foot), all of which are set to one of the ancient &quot;Ragas&quot; (musical mode), based on the mood and context as outlined in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. In historic practice of a play performance, each &quot;Padam&quot; was enacted twice by the actor while the vocalists sang the lines repeatedly as the actor-dancer played his role out.

The traditional plays were long, many written to be performed all night, some such as those based on the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; written to be performed for many sequential nights. However, others such as the &quot;Prahlada Charitham&quot; have been composed so that they can be performed within four hours. Modern productions have extracted parts of these legendary plays, to be typically performed within 3 to 4 hours.

===Offshoots and modern adaptations===
Kathakali is still practiced in its Traditional ways and there are experimental plays based on European classics and Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Recent productions have adapted stories from other cultures and mythologies, such as those of Miguel de Cervantes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Shakespeare.

==Styles: Sampradayam ==
Kathakali has lineages or distinctive schools of play interpretation and dance performance called &quot;Sampradayam&quot;. These developed in part because of the gurukula system of transmission from one generation to the next. By the 19th-century, many such styles were in vogue in Kerala, of which two major styles have crystallized and survived into the modern age.

The &quot;Kidangoor&quot; style is one of the two, that developed in Travancore, and it is strongly influenced by &quot;Kutiyattam&quot;, while also drawing elements of &quot;Ramanattam&quot; and &quot;Kalladikkotan&quot;. It is traditionally attributed to Nalanunni, under the patronage of Utram Tirunal Maharaja (1815-1861).

The &quot;Kalluvazhi&quot; style is second of the two, which developed in Palakkad (Olappamanna Mana) in central Kerala, and it is a synthesis of the older &quot;Kaplingadan&quot; and &quot;Kalladikkotan&quot; performance arts. It is traditionally attributed to Unniri Panikkar, in a Brahmin household (~1850), and became the dominant style established in Kerala Kalamandalam – a school of performance arts.

==Training centres and awards==

 Kathakali has traditionally been an art that has continued from one generation to the next through a guru-disciples (&quot;gurukkula&quot;) based training system. Artist families tended to pick promising talent from within their own extended families, sometimes from outside the family, and the new budding artist typically stayed with his guru as a student and treated like a member of the family. The guru provided both the theoretical and practical training to the student, and the disciple would accompany the guru to formal performances. In modern times, professional schools train students of Kathakali, with some such as those in Trivandrum Margi school emphasizing a single teacher for various courses, while others such as the Kerala Kalamandalam school wherein students learn subjects from different teachers. Kathakali schools are now found all over India, as well as in parts of Western Europe and the United States.

A typical Kathakali training centre auditions for students, examining health and physical fitness necessary for the aerobic and active stage performance, the body flexibility, sense of rhythm and an interview to gauge how sincere the student is in performance arts. A typical course work in Kathakali emphasizes physical conditioning and daily exercises, yoga and body massage to tone the muscles and sculpt the growing body, along with studies and dance practice. Per ancient Indian tradition, young students continue to start their year by giving symbolic gifts to the guru, such as a few coins with betel leaves, while the teacher gives the student a loincloth, a welcome and blessings.

Kathakali is still hugely male-dominated, but since the 1970s, women have made entry into the art form on a recognisable scale. The central Kerala temple town of Tripunithura has a ladies&#x27; troupe (Tripunithura Kathakali Kendram Ladies Troupe) who perform Kathakali. The troupe won a national award, i.e. Nari Shakti Puraskar, for their work.

===Awards for Kathakali artistes===

* Nambeesan Smaraka Awards — For artistic performances related kathakali (1992–2008)
* International Centre for Kathakali Award

==Related dance forms==

The theory and foundations of &quot;Kathakali&quot; are same as other major classical Indian dances, traceable to Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, but the expression style in each is very different and distinctive. &quot;Kathakali&quot; is different from a similar-sounding &quot;Kathak&quot;, though both are Indian classical dance traditions of &quot;story play&quot; wherein the stories have been traditionally derived from the Hindu epics and the Puranas. Kathak is an ancient performance art that emerged in North India, with roots in traveling bards retelling mythical and spiritual stories through dance-acting. Kathak traditionally has included female actor-dancers, unlike Kathakali which has traditionally been performed by an all-male troupe. Kathak deploys much simpler costumes, makeup and no face masks. Both dance forms employ choreography, face and hand gestures traceable to the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, but &quot;Kathak&quot; generally moves around a straight leg and torso movements, with no martial art leaps and jumps like Kathakali. Kathak uses the stage space more, and does not typically include separate vocalists. Both deploy a host of similar traditional Indian musical instruments.

Kathakali-style, costume rich, musical drama are found in other cultures. For example, the Japanese &quot;Noh&quot; (能) integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized gestures while the costumes communicate the nature of the characters in a &quot;Noh&quot; performance, as in Kathakali. In both, costumed men have traditionally performed all the roles including those of women in the play. The training regimen and initiation of the dance-actors in both cultures have many similarities.

Kabuki, another Japanese art form, has similarities to Kathakali. Jīngjù, a Chinese art of dance-acting (&quot;zuo&quot;), like Kathakali presents artists with elaborate masks, costumes and colorfully painted faces. Balinese dance as well as tibetan art forms also shares similarities.

<doc id="233492" wikidata="Q1949773" url="?curid=233492" title="Seton Hill University">
<text>Seton Hill University is a private Catholic university in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Originally a women&#x27;s college, it became a coeducational university in 2002 and enrolls about 2,200 students.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1885 by the Sisters of Charity. It is named for Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774–1821), who founded the Sisters of Charity and who, after her death, was canonized as the United States&#x27; first native-born saint. (Seton Hall University and Saint Elizabeth University in New Jersey are also named after Elizabeth Ann Seton.)

In 1914, Seton Hill Junior college was opened by the Sisters of Charity. With the approval of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Seton Hill College was created four years later.

In 1946, 40 male World War II veterans were accepted as students at Seton Hill. During the 1980s, men were regularly admitted to many programs at Seton Hill College, including music and theater. In 2002, Seton Hill was officially granted university status by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Seton Hill University received widespread public attention after announcing a technology plan that includes providing an iPad to all full-time students, as well a 13&quot; MacBook to all incoming freshmen. Upon graduation, students keep both devices. Beginning in the fall of 2013, new full-time students will receive an iPad Mini and new full-time freshmen will be provided with a MacBook Air. Seton Hill University is recognized as an Apple Distinguished School.

==Academics==
Seton Hill divides its undergraduate programs into six schools: Business, Education &amp; Applied Social Sciences, Humanities, Natural &amp; Health Sciences, and Visual &amp; Performing Arts. In addition to their major, all students take liberal arts core classes in arts, mathematics, sciences, culture, history, and writing. The university also offers twelve graduate programs. Subjects include art, writing, education, therapy, business, orthodontics, and physician assistant studies.

The typical class size for courses in the major is about 20–25. Liberal arts core classes tend to be larger, at 30-45 students.

===LECOM at Seton Hill===
LECOM, one of the largest medical schools in the United States, entered a partnership with SHU and extended its LECOM Erie campus to the university in 2009. LECOM at Seton Hill added an additional 104 medical students to the first-year class, and, now, it has graduated more than 1,000 physicians since the first graduating class of 2013.

SHU is also one of LECOM&#x27;s EAP (Early Acceptance Program) affiliates, allowing qualified high school seniors to apply for its combined BS/DO program and get accepted to LECOM before entering SHU or while studying in the underclassmen years at SHU.

== Athletics ==
The Seton Hill athletics teams are called the Griffins. The university is a member of the Division II ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) since the 2013–14 academic year. The Griffins previously competed as a member of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from 2006–07 to 2012–13; and in the American Mideast Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1999–2000 to 2006–07. During the 2006–07 school year, Seton Hill had dual membership with both the NAIA and the NCAA as part of the transition.

Seton Hill competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, lacrosse, soccer, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

=== History ===
After president JoAnne Boyle formalized the school&#x27;s new status as a university, the teams&#x27; nickname was changed from &quot;Spirits&quot; to &quot;Griffins,&quot; and several men&#x27;s athletics teams were added, including football. In 2006, Seton Hill announced it was transferring to NCAA Division II and joining the WVIAC as a provisional member (with full WVIAC competition in 2007–08). Prior to that, they had belonged to the NAIA and in the American Mideast.

As of July 1, 2013, following the breakup of the WVIAC, along with the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, also from the WVIAC, Seton Hill joined the PSAC.

In 2005, 60% of the entering class was male, due to an influx of male students who were interested in new sports programs such as football. In 2008, the football team had a 10–3 record. The football team and the men&#x27;s soccer team each won the inaugural West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference&#x27;s team sportsmanship award in 2008.

In 2006, the baseball team received a berth to the NAIA World Series in the program&#x27;s third year of existence.

In 2014, the baseball team had its most successful season; winning the PSAC, the Atlantic Regional, and advancing to the College World Series. The team ended up finishing top six in the country.

In 2022, Seton Hill created their first Esports team. The team is co-ed and includes about 25 students.

In 2025, the school put the student newspaper, &quot;The Setonian&quot;, on an indefinite hiatus.

<doc id="233493" wikidata="Q56354214" url="?curid=233493" title="SS Columbia Eagle incident">
<text>The SS &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; incident refers to a mutiny that occurred aboard the U.S. flagged merchant vessel &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; in March 1970 when two crewmembers seized the vessel with the threat of a bomb and handgun, and forced the master to sail to Cambodia. The ship was under contract with the Military Sea Transportation Service to carry napalm bombs to be used by the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for Sattahip, Thailand. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the Gulf of Thailand while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; was returned to U.S. control in April 1970. This is the only mutiny of a United States Ship in recent history.

==Background==

===&quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;===
The &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; was a Victory-type cargo ship constructed by Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation of Portland, Oregon in 1945 for the U.S. Navy and originally christened . She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to Pacific theaters during World War II. SS &quot;Pierre Victory&quot; survived three separate kamikaze attacks by the Japanese in 1945.

After World War II the &quot;Pierre Victory&quot; was converted to a livestock ship, also called a Seagoing cowboys ship. &quot;Pierre Victory&quot; made 6 trips with 780 horses on each trip to war-torn Poland and Greece. SS &quot;Pierre Victory&quot; served as merchant marine ship supplying goods for the Korean War. Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, &quot;Pierre Victory&quot; was decommissioned after the war and then sold to a commercial shipping company. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War. Because &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the Merchant Marine fleet and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.

===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===
Clyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near Hemet, California. His father was in the military then and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school. He never finished high school, and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his merchant marine documents on 23 October 1963 and joined the Seafarers International Union shortly thereafter.

===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===
Alvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 in Augusta, Georgia. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at sixteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship operated by the Seafarers International Union. Lundeberg School teaches the skills needed to get deck, engine and steward jobs on merchant marine ships. On 17 April 1967, Glatkowski received his merchant mariner papers stating he was eligible for entry-level jobs on U.S.-flagged ships.

==Timeline of the mutiny==
McKay and Glatkowski had been considering the operation for some time but had little in the way of a plan with the exception of bringing a gun on board.

On 14 March 1970, McKay and Glatkowski used guns they had smuggled aboard to seize control of their ship, SS &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;, in the first armed mutiny aboard an American ship in 150 years. The ship had been sailing on a Department of Defense supply charter carrying Napalm to the U.S. Air Force bases in Thailand for use in the Vietnam War.

McKay and Glatowski had planned their action to ensure that they would involve the least amount of crew members, knowing full well that they were risking their freedom if not their lives. In order to give themselves the maximum amount of time to secure the ship and their freedom, they planned their action to take place immediately after the daily radio communication of the ship&#x27;s location, ensuring they had 24 hours before the ship&#x27;s change of course would be officially noticed.

In order to involve the fewest crew members during the mutiny, McKay and Glatkowski decided that triggering a fire drill would be a good time to get most of the crew off board the ship. After triggering the fire alarm, all but a few crew members took position in lifeboats, as per fire protocol. McKay and Glatowski then took the captain hostage and, claiming that they had a live bomb on board the ship, they demanded that the captain order severing the lifeboat lines, leaving 24 of the crewmen in the lifeboats. By taking action right after the daily radio communication of the ship&#x27;s location they ensured that the crew on the lifeboats would be found and rescued. The ship&#x27;s cargo, 3,500 500-pound bombs, and 1,225 750-pound bombs, provided leverage and credibility to the bomb threat.

When the crewmen departed in lifeboats, an SOS was transmitted. A Lockheed P-3B from VP-1 Crew 6, the &quot;Scalf Hunters&quot;, operating from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand, was directed to launch a search and rescue (SAR) mission to find the SS &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; and assist as needed. Upon arrival at the ship, they found a small crew and the presence of small arms and immediately reported their assessment that the ship had been hijacked and was heading for Cambodia. Crew 6 maintained communications and status reporting until the ship anchored in Cambodian waters. Afterward, they were relieved and other P-3 Orion aircrews kept the &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; under constant surveillance from outside Cambodian territorial waters.

The merchant ship &quot;Rappahanock&quot; picked up the lifeboats and crew members and broadcast the news of the mutiny. The United States Coast Guard cutter was the first US military vessel to pursue the &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;. The amphibious transport dock was diverted to relieve &quot;Mellon&quot; in its pursuit. The destroyer, , was detached from the station at I Corps to pursue the &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; at flank speed and to intervene. However, the &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; reached Cambodian waters before any U.S. naval ships could intercept it.

With only 13 crewmen remaining aboard besides the mutineers, they sailed into Cambodian waters, where they assumed they would be welcomed as heroes. They anchored within the territorial limit claimed by Cambodia on the afternoon of 15 March.

At 09:51 on 16 March, &quot;Denver&quot; anchored from the coast in the Gulf of Siam, remaining outside Cambodian waters. &quot;Mellon&quot; joined shortly thereafter with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, as the senior officer present. Two CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters landed on &quot;Denver&quot; from bases in South Vietnam to assist in visual surveillance. Meanwhile, the mutineers had turned the ship over to Cambodia&#x27;s Prince Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s government, declared themselves anti-war revolutionaries, and been granted asylum.

On 17 March, the helicopters were detached and &quot;Denver&quot;, with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, departed for Singapore, passing on-scene command to &quot;Mellon&quot;.
&quot;Turner Joy&quot; remained on station in a cruising pattern within shipping lanes and in sight of the harbor channel.

On 18 March at 06:36, &quot;Denver&quot; reversed her course; Prince Sihanouk had been deposed by a coup led by the pro-U.S. Sirik Matak and Lon Nol. If the Cambodians could be persuaded to release &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;, &quot;Denver&quot;&#x27;s flight deck could help the rescued crew members rejoin their ship. The coup was unfortunate for mutineers McKay and Glatkowski; as they had hoped to find asylum in a pro-Communist country; instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government. At 23:59 on 18 March, &quot;Denver&quot; anchored in the Gulf of Siam from the coast of Cambodia.

Sihanouk, now in exile, charged that the CIA had masterminded the mutiny to deliver weapons to Lon Nol. Both the mutineers and U.S. officials denied his charges.

When it became clear that &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot;&#x27;s release was not imminent, &quot;Denver&quot; was detached to proceed to Da Nang.

On 8 April, &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; was permitted to leave Cambodian waters. She rendezvoused with where a Navy explosive ordnance disposal team inspected the ship while &quot;Chase&quot; departed to An Thoi Naval Base to pick up the &quot;Columbia Eagle&quot; crew and return them to the ship. With the crew and ship reunited, &quot;Chase&quot; escorted her to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay arriving 12 April.

==Status==
McKay and Glatkowski were held by the post-coup Cambodian government for several months after their capture. A United Press International newspaper interview from August 1970 describes them as living under guard in &quot;a rusting World War II landing ship moored in the Mekong River,&quot; regularly using marijuana supplied by their guards, and making statements supporting the Manson Family and violent overthrow of the United States government. Both claimed they supported Students for a Democratic Society.

McKay said to a reporter: 

We are sympathetic with the Asian people and, while I&#x27;m not an authority on the war in Vietnam I respect the opinions of people who were authorities like Bertrand Russell and Jean Paul Sartre who said the war in Asia was genocide and I intend to carry on my actions against the American Government.

In June both men were indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of mutiny, kidnapping and assault.

===Glatkowski===
After months of imprisonment Glatowski was released and, after seeking asylum at the Chinese and USSR embassies, he turned himself in at a US Embassy in Phnom Penh and was extradited to the United States to face trial. He was charged with mutiny, kidnapping, assault and neglect of duty. On 2 March 1971 Glatkowski pled guilty in a Los Angeles District Court to mutiny and assault. United States federal judge Manuel Real heard the testimony of four psychiatrists; three of the psychiatrists reported that Glatkowski was currently sane and was sane at the time of the mutiny incident. Glatowski was sentenced to 6 months to 10 years in Federal prison and served nearly eight of the ten years when mandatorily released from Lompoc, California federal prison. He has admitted to mistakes in the hijacking but remained unapologetic about their goal of interrupting the napalm shipment.

===McKay===
McKay escaped from his captors, along with U.S. Army deserter Larry Humphrey, in October 1970 and sought out the Khmer Rouge. He was officially declared accounted for, with a Date of Loss on 4 November 1970 without being located by the authorities.

According to an article for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, entitled &quot;The Last Mutineer&quot;, by Richard Linnett and Roberto Loiederman, co-authors of the book &quot;The Eagle Mutiny&quot;, remains of a corpse brought back from Cambodia in 1991 were positively identified as Clyde McKay&#x27;s by the Central Identification Laboratory - Hawaii (CILHI), the U.S. Navy&#x27;s forensic lab in Hawaii. Subsequently, the remains were cremated and the ashes were buried by his family in their cemetery plot in Hemet, California, where McKay had spent his youth.

<text>**Pilottone** (or **Pilotone**) and the related **neo-pilot one** are specialized synchronization signals used in analog audio recording systems. These signals, often associated with double-system recordings, were primarily developed for motion picture production to maintain synchronization between sound and film when recorded on separate media. Before the widespread adoption of timecode in the film industry, pilotone synchronization was the standard method used on nearly all 1/4-inch magnetic double-system sound recordings for motion pictures from the late 1950s through the late 1980s. Prior to the use of 1/4-inch audio tape, sound recordings were made on 35mm optical film and later on 16mm or 35mm magnetic film. The first 1/4-inch recorder capable of recording a sync track to regulate playback speed was developed by Rangertone, which introduced a precursor to the Pilotone system.

== History ==

According to Carsten Diercks, a camera operator and filmmaker at West-German &quot;Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (NWDR) during the 1950s, pilottone was invented at the NWDR studio in Hamburg-Lokstedt, West Germany by NWDR technical engineer Adalbert Lohmann and his assistant Udo Stepputat in the early 1950s for single-camera 16mm TV news gathering and documentaries. The first program featuring the use of pilottone was the documentary (&quot;Musuri: Upstream/progress at the Congo&quot;), shot in early 1954 in Africa and first broadcast on ARD on March 31, 1954. The new technology required new editing suites, and camera operator Diercks turned to a small nearby 6-man workshop named Steenbeck. The subsequent success of previously shunned 16mm for TV program gathering facilitated by the pilotone system turned Steenbeck into a multinational corporation.

Neo-pilottone was invented in 1957 by Stefan Kudelski with the Nagra III tape recorder.

The new technology of pilottone was brought to international attention by its use by Richard Leacock, former cameraman of filmmaker Robert Flaherty, in his documentary feature &quot;Primary&quot; (1960), documenting the competing Democratic presidential nominee candidates Hubert Humphrey and John F. Kennedy. Diercks himself helped the spread of pilottone in the USA when he was the only Western reporter allowed to shoot in Havana during the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. CBS secured the licensing rights to Diercks&#x27;s material via &quot;Norddeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (NWDR had split in 1956 into NDR and WDR), and brought it on air on May 14, 1961, ten days prior to the German broadcast of the same material. At a time when North American TV program gathering was dominated by either Movietone (see also Movietone News) or magnetic pre-striping for live-sound recording, and the use of pilottone was still unheard of, according to Diercks, the US TV networks were impressed with the system demonstrated by the 60-minute documentary feature.

== Technology ==

Synchronization in audio and visual recording systems has historically been achieved through one of two primary methods. The initial approach involved utilizing a microphone cable to connect a motion picture camera to an audio recorder, such as those manufactured by Stellavox or Nagra. A camera equipped with a synchronous motor transmits a 60/50 Hz signal to the recorder, which is captured as a sine wave pilot tone. This method has since been supplanted by the incorporation of a crystal oscillator within the audio recorder, which generates the 60 Hz signal, in conjunction with a crystal-controlled camera motor. The audio recorder is equipped with two recording heads: a full-track mono head that records audio in the conventional manner and a neo-pilot head, which also functions for playback of the pilot tone signal. 

This neo-pilot head is aligned at a 90-degree angle to the audio head and records the pilot tone down the center of the mono audio signal. The phase difference of 90 degrees causes the pilot tone signal, being a push-pull signal, to cancel itself out, rendering it inaudible during audio playback. This phenomenon is analogous to a single audio signal being split into two channels, where a phase inversion on one channel results in the cancellation of the signal when both tracks are played back simultaneously at equal levels. A notable limitation of this system is that, when a pilot tone tape is played on a stereo recorder, the 60 Hz signal may be audible unless the stereo channels are recombined into mono. 

During playback, the pilot head functions as a push-pull playback head, facilitating the reproduction of the pilot tone. The playback mechanism compares the reproduced pilot signal to the line frequency (60/50 Hz), which governs the motor speed of the synchronous 16/35mm magnetic recorder and subsequently adjusts the playback speed accordingly. Modern 16/35mm recorders employ an internal quartz oscillator, while the 1/4-inch tape player references the playback pilot signal against its own highly accurate internal crystal oscillator. 

Although standard audio tape recorders exhibit commendable regulation of tape speed, they lack the precision necessary to ensure that a playback machine will consistently match the recording speed over extended periods. In contrast, the pilottone system provides a reliable solution for maintaining synchronization.

== Obsolescence ==
The pilottone system was phased out in the early 1990s when SMPTE timecode became the sync reference standard. The advantage of timecode over pilottone synch is that it is not only a speed reference but also a positioning reference. The hour:minute:second: frame readout that the timecode provides allows the film transferred to tape digital, or video precise matching of picture and sound.

The only &quot;problem&quot; with timecode is that it is a machine-read system so pictures and sound must be transferred to an editing system (such as DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere Pro) to be synched and edited. With the use of editing programs becoming the standard in film industry, this is not seen as a huge issue. However, for some movies, e.g. Quentin Tarantino, which are still shot on analog film, this can cause some trouble.

<doc id="233497" wikidata="Q1152135" url="?curid=233497" title="Unsupervised learning">
<text>Unsupervised learning is a framework in machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from unlabeled data. Other frameworks in the spectrum of supervisions include weak- or semi-supervision, where a small portion of the data is tagged, and self-supervision. Some researchers consider self-supervised learning a form of unsupervised learning.

Conceptually, unsupervised learning divides into the aspects of data, training, algorithm, and downstream applications. Typically, the dataset is harvested cheaply &quot;in the wild&quot;, such as massive text corpus obtained by web crawling, with only minor filtering (such as Common Crawl). This compares favorably to supervised learning, where the dataset (such as the ImageNet1000) is typically constructed manually, which is much more expensive.

There were algorithms designed specifically for unsupervised learning, such as clustering algorithms like k-means, dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), Boltzmann machine learning, and autoencoders. After the rise of deep learning, most large-scale unsupervised learning have been done by training general-purpose neural network architectures by gradient descent, adapted to performing unsupervised learning by designing an appropriate training procedure.

Sometimes a trained model can be used as-is, but more often they are modified for downstream applications. For example, the generative pretraining method trains a model to generate a textual dataset, before finetuning it for other applications, such as text classification. As another example, autoencoders are trained to good features, which can then be used as a module for other models, such as in a latent diffusion model.

== Tasks ==
Tasks are often categorized as discriminative (recognition) or generative (imagination). Often but not always, discriminative tasks use supervised methods and generative tasks use unsupervised (see Venn diagram); however, the separation is very hazy. For example, object recognition favors supervised learning but unsupervised learning can also cluster objects into groups. Furthermore, as progress marches onward, some tasks employ both methods, and some tasks swing from one to another. For example, image recognition started off as heavily supervised, but became hybrid by employing unsupervised pre-training, and then moved towards supervision again with the advent of dropout, ReLU, and adaptive learning rates.

A typical generative task is as follows. At each step, a datapoint is sampled from the dataset, and part of the data is removed, and the model must infer the removed part. This is particularly clear for the denoising autoencoders and BERT.

== Neural network architectures ==

=== Training ===
During the learning phase, an unsupervised network tries to mimic the data it&#x27;s given and uses the error in its mimicked output to correct itself (i.e. correct its weights and biases). Sometimes the error is expressed as a low probability that the erroneous output occurs, or it might be expressed as an unstable high energy state in the network.

In contrast to supervised methods&#x27; dominant use of backpropagation, unsupervised learning also employs other methods including: Hopfield learning rule, Boltzmann learning rule, Contrastive Divergence, Wake Sleep, Variational Inference, Maximum Likelihood, Maximum A Posteriori, Gibbs Sampling, and backpropagating reconstruction errors or hidden state reparameterizations. See the table below for more details.

=== Energy ===
An energy function is a macroscopic measure of a network&#x27;s activation state. In Boltzmann machines, it plays the role of the Cost function. This analogy with physics is inspired by Ludwig Boltzmann&#x27;s analysis of a gas&#x27; macroscopic energy from the microscopic probabilities of particle motion formula_1, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature. In the RBM network the relation is formula_2, where formula_3 and formula_4 vary over every possible activation pattern and formula_5. To be more precise, formula_6, where formula_7 is an activation pattern of all neurons (visible and hidden). Hence, some early neural networks bear the name Boltzmann Machine. Paul Smolensky calls formula_8 the &quot;Harmony&quot;. A network seeks low energy which is high Harmony.

=== Networks ===
This table shows connection diagrams of various unsupervised networks, the details of which will be given in the section Comparison of Networks. Circles are neurons and edges between them are connection weights. As network design changes, features are added on to enable new capabilities or removed to make learning faster. For instance, neurons change between deterministic (Hopfield) and stochastic (Boltzmann) to allow robust output, weights are removed within a layer (RBM) to hasten learning, or connections are allowed to become asymmetric (Helmholtz).

Of the networks bearing people&#x27;s names, only Hopfield worked directly with neural networks. Boltzmann and Helmholtz came before artificial neural networks, but their work in physics and physiology inspired the analytical methods that were used.

=== History ===

=== Specific Networks ===

Here, we highlight some characteristics of select networks. The details of each are given in the comparison table below.







=== Comparison of networks ===

=== Hebbian Learning, ART, SOM ===

The classical example of unsupervised learning in the study of neural networks is Donald Hebb&#x27;s principle, that is, neurons that fire together wire together. In Hebbian learning, the connection is reinforced irrespective of an error, but is exclusively a function of the coincidence between action potentials between the two neurons. A similar version that modifies synaptic weights takes into account the time between the action potentials (spike-timing-dependent plasticity or STDP). Hebbian Learning has been hypothesized to underlie a range of cognitive functions, such as pattern recognition and experiential learning.

Among neural network models, the self-organizing map (SOM) and adaptive resonance theory (ART) are commonly used in unsupervised learning algorithms. The SOM is a topographic organization in which nearby locations in the map represent inputs with similar properties. The ART model allows the number of clusters to vary with problem size and lets the user control the degree of similarity between members of the same clusters by means of a user-defined constant called the vigilance parameter. ART networks are used for many pattern recognition tasks, such as automatic target recognition and seismic signal processing.

== Probabilistic methods ==
Two of the main methods used in unsupervised learning are principal component and cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is used in unsupervised learning to group, or segment, datasets with shared attributes in order to extrapolate algorithmic relationships. Cluster analysis is a branch of machine learning that groups the data that has not been labelled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, cluster analysis identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. This approach helps detect anomalous data points that do not fit into either group.

A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, though unsupervised learning encompasses many other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features. It can be contrasted with supervised learning by saying that whereas supervised learning intends to infer a conditional probability distribution conditioned on the label of input data; unsupervised learning intends to infer an a priori probability distribution .

=== Approaches ===
Some of the most common algorithms used in unsupervised learning include: (1) Clustering, (2) Anomaly detection, (3) Approaches for learning latent variable models. Each approach uses several methods as follows:

* Clustering methods include: hierarchical clustering, k-means, mixture models, model-based clustering, DBSCAN, and OPTICS algorithm
* Anomaly detection methods include: Local Outlier Factor, and Isolation Forest
* Approaches for learning latent variable models such as Expectation–maximization algorithm (EM), Method of moments, and Blind signal separation techniques (Principal component analysis, Independent component analysis, Non-negative matrix factorization, Singular value decomposition)

=== Method of moments ===
One of the statistical approaches for unsupervised learning is the method of moments. In the method of moments, the unknown parameters (of interest) in the model are related to the moments of one or more random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can be estimated given the moments. The moments are usually estimated from samples empirically. The basic moments are first and second order moments. For a random vector, the first order moment is the mean vector, and the second order moment is the covariance matrix (when the mean is zero). Higher order moments are usually represented using tensors which are the generalization of matrices to higher orders as multi-dimensional arrays.

In particular, the method of moments is shown to be effective in learning the parameters of latent variable models. Latent variable models are statistical models where in addition to the observed variables, a set of latent variables also exists which is not observed. A highly practical example of latent variable models in machine learning is the topic modeling which is a statistical model for generating the words (observed variables) in the document based on the topic (latent variable) of the document. In the topic modeling, the words in the document are generated according to different statistical parameters when the topic of the document is changed. It is shown that method of moments (tensor decomposition techniques) consistently recover the parameters of a large class of latent variable models under some assumptions.

The Expectation–maximization algorithm (EM) is also one of the most practical methods for learning latent variable models. However, it can get stuck in local optima, and it is not guaranteed that the algorithm will converge to the true unknown parameters of the model. In contrast, for the method of moments, the global convergence is guaranteed under some conditions.

<text>The French Revolutionary Wars began on 20 April 1792 when the French Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria. This launched the War of the First Coalition.

== Background ==

From 1789 to early 1792, the French Revolution gradually radicalised, breaking with old institutions and practices as it went, and targeting defenders of the Ancien Régime. Some of these defenders, or people who were unintentionally caught in the crossfire, emigrated from France to avoid persecution. King Louis XVI himself attempted to escape with his family to Varennes in June 1791, but he was caught. The French king was put under surveillance, and increasingly suspected of conspiring with other European monarchs, who wished to preserve the House of Bourbon in France and restore its pre-revolutionary authority. This was explicitly stated in the Declaration of Pillnitz (17 August 1791) by king Frederick William II of Prussia and emperor Francis II (Austria, Hungary and Bohemia), who called on all monarchs in Europe to &#x27;liberate&#x27; Louis. Leading radical revolutionaries called for the complete abolition of the monarchy, but the republican movement was dealt a severe blow in the July 1791 Champs de Mars Massacre. Although this cleared the way for the establishment of the constitutional monarchy in September, it did not secure Louis XVI&#x27;s position. The uncertain future of the Bourbon monarchy caused tensions to rise between France and other European states.

In early 1792, conservative royalist Armées des Émigrés were forming just across the borders in cities such as Koblenz, readying themselves to invade and end the Revolution with the help of other monarchies. The Girondin majority in the Legislative Assembly favoured war, especially with Austria, in order to display the Revolution&#x27;s strength and defend its achievements (such as the Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789 and the early beginnings of parliamentary democracy) against a possible return to an (Enlightened) absolutist regime. They cited the Declaration of Pillnitz to justify the urgent need to strike first. Many of the French revolutionaries wanted to spread their Revolution to other countries, and refugees from recently failed revolutions, such as Dutch Patriots and Belgian-Liégois rebels, urged their French comrades to &#x27;liberate&#x27; the Low Countries. However, there was a real risk that France would be overwhelmed by foreign forces if a large anti-French coalition were to be formed. This is why many leftist deputies within the Assembly such as Robespierre opposed a war, arguing France was not ready for it and could lose all progress (as they saw it) made thus far during the Revolution.

== Preparations ==
=== Diplomacy ===

Major-general Charles François Dumouriez was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in March 1792, and by mid-April had managed to obtain the neutrality of all European great powers except Austria and Prussia through diplomacy. Meanwhile, he organised plans to incite a rebellion in the Austrian Netherlands by cooperating with the Committee of United Belgians and Liégeois, who represented remnants of the rebel armies formed during the recently failed anti-Austrian Brabant Revolution and Liège Revolution (August 1789 – January 1791).

=== Strategy ===
Finally, France declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792. Dumouriez planned to defeat the Austrian army within 15 days to achieve a successful quick victory. From Dunkirk to Strasbourg, the French northern frontier comprised 164,000 soldiers, divided into three armies under the leadership of general Lafayette (Armée du Centre; targets: from Givet to Namur and Liège), marshal Luckner (Armée du Rhin; targets: Flemish cities such as Menen and Kortrijk) and marshal Rochambeau (Armée du Nord; targets: Quiévrain, Mons and Brussels).

The invasion heavily relied on the presumption that Belgian and Liégois patriotic rebellions would break out spontaneously the moment French troops crossed the border, aiding them in driving out the Habsburg forces as they had done themselves 2.5 years before. Dumouriez assured his fellow ministers:

As soon as the French army enters the Belgian provinces, it will be helped by the people, who are ashamed of their own futile revolutionary efforts of [1789–1790]. They will join forces with our troops and will easily drive the dispersed hordes of Austrian mercenaries from their towns or scatter them. Paris will be defended on the banks of the Meuse. For the Country of Liège, the one most worthy of freedom of all those who have raised its flag, our negotiators will depart to dictate a wise peace, which we will under no circumstances spoil by the spirit of conquest.

=== State of the French military ===
The French army was plagued by troubles: leading generals such as Lafayette and Rochambeau were moderate royalists, and had doubts about the republican minister&#x27;s intentions as well as the feasibility of his strategies; the troops were poorly equipped, many of them untrained volunteers, and they distrusted their aristocratic officers; and finally, queen Marie Antoinette, who was Austrian and feared further republican radicalisation would result in her execution, secretly passed war plans to the Austrian government in Brussels, with Louis XVI&#x27;s approval. Moreover, Prussia soon joined Austria against France, later followed by other powers and the armies of émigrés, while the ferment of the Revolution caused political instability, and want of materiel and funds left France&#x27;s armed forces disorganised.

More than 50% of the army&#x27;s officers, which consisted solely of noblemen, had fled the country in the past three years of revolutionary upheaval. It took time to replace these by non-commissioned officers and volunteers from the middle class. There was also animosity between the old regulars (the &quot;whites&quot;, from their uniform) and the new soldiers who joined the army as volunteers in 1791–2 (the so-called &quot;blues&quot;). And because of the revolutionary egalitarian ideas penetrating the ranks of the military, there was distrust against the remaining noble officers; their loyalty to the cause of the Revolution and their orders were questioned.

One lasting morale-boosting effect was the composition of the battle hymn &quot;Chant de guerre pour l&#x27;armée du Rhin&quot; (&quot;War Song for the Rhine Army&quot;) by Rouget de Lisle in April 1792. It became popular among French soldiers nationwide, and was soon identified with a battalion from Marseille. Thus, the song became known as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and on 26 Messidor III (14 July 1795) and again on 14 February 1879 it was officially recognised as the national anthem of France.

== Belgian front ==
=== April: first French invasion ===
Despite protesting that the army was not in condition to fight, Rochambeau obeyed his orders. He departed Paris and moved towards Valenciennes on 21 April to assume command of the northern army, and make final preparations for the invasion. Rochambeau&#x27;s subordinate general Biron and &quot;maréchal du camp&quot; Théobald Dillon would lead the invasion.

The French national anthem, La Marseillaise, was composed in Strasbourg, April 25, while the French were still mustering troops, as the &quot;Chant de guerre pour l&#x27;Armée du Rhin&quot; (&quot;War Song for the Army of the Rhine&quot;).

The French army performed poorly in the first engagements. At the Battle of Marquain near Tournai (29 April), French soldiers fled almost at first sight of the Austrian outposts and murdered their general Théobald Dillon, whom they accused of treason. Meanwhile, general Biron suffered a defeat at Quiévrain near Mons. On 30 April, the Dunkirk column marched 15 miles to Veurne, but encountered no enemy and retreated back to Dunkirk.

When both his subordinates Dillon and Biron failed in their missions, Rochambeau resigned. On 30 April, Lafayette heard of the defeats and Rochambeau&#x27;s resignation, cancelled his assault on Namur and Liège as well and awaited new orders from Paris. The Belgian-Liègeois Committee was disappointed and felt betrayed, claiming Lafayette could have easily taken both cities by sheer superior numbers.

=== May: French troops regroup ===
The commanders-in-chief of the armies became political &quot;suspects&quot;; and before a serious action had been fought, the three armies commanded respectively by Rochambeau, Lafayette and Luckner had been reorganised into two commanded by Dumouriez and Kellermann.

=== June: second French invasion ===
On 9 June, a 20,000 strong force commanded by Luckner invaded the Austrian Netherlands again, this time capturing Menen and Kortrijk (19 June). The Austrian troops under Johann Peter Beaulieu counter-attacked, however, blocking further advance. The French withdrew back to Lille on 30 June, effectively putting an end to their second northward incursion.

== Rhine front ==
=== July: allies rally and issue Brunswick Manifesto ===
On the Rhine, a combined army of Prussians, Austrians, Hessians and French émigrés under the Duke of Brunswick was formed for the invasion of France, flanked by two smaller armies on its right and left, all three being under the supreme command of King Frederick William II of Prussia. In the Southern Netherlands, plans called for the Austrians to besiege Lille, and in the south the Piedmontese also took the field. Observing the enemy coalition gathering at its borders, the Assembly declared the &#x27;nation in danger&#x27;, and commanded 100,000 National Guards (&quot;Fédérés&quot;) to strengthen the defence of Paris; the king vetoed the decision, but he was ignored.

The first step was the issue of the Brunswick Manifesto (25 July), a proclamation which, couched in terms most insulting to the French nation, generated the spirit that was afterwards to find expression in the &quot;armed nation&quot; of 1793–1794, and sealed the fate of King Louis. It was issued against the advice of Brunswick himself, whose signature appeared on it; the duke, a model sovereign in his own principality, sympathised with the constitutional side of the French Revolution, while as a soldier he had no confidence in the success of the enterprise. Brunswick stressed that civilians would not be harmed or looted, unless they harmed the royal family: &quot;If the least violence, the least outrage, be done to their majesties... [my troops] will take... unforgettable vengeance [on] the city of Paris...&quot;. The Brunswick Manifesto reached Paris on 1 August and was posted in numerous places across the capital, and received much hostility and mockery. Instead of intimidating the Parisians, it confirmed their determinacy to oppose any foreign invasion, and to get rid of the royals who were increasingly, and with ever more evidence, suspected of treason against the Revolution, the Assembly and the French people.

=== 10 August: storming of the Tuileries ===

With the imminent invasion of the allied European monarchies against it, radical revolutionaries in Paris could no longer tolerate the king&#x27;s rule, as his foreign friends might soon restore his former powers and crush the Revolution. In the night of 9 to 10 August, the insurrectional Paris Commune was formed at the Hôtel de Ville under the leadership of Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins and Jacques Hébert from the ranks of radical Jacobins, the sans-culottes and a patriot regiment from Marsaille. In a complicated series of actions by various groups, king Louis was isolated within his Tuileries Palace and gradually abandoned its defence until he and the royal family left it when Roederer persuaded him to seek &#x27;safety&#x27; in the building of the Legislative Assembly instead. Most of the National Guard defected to the rebels and eventually the Tuileries were successfully stormed and most of the remaining Swiss guards slaughtered. Louis became a de facto prisoner of the Assembly, was stripped from his kingship and the royal family was imprisoned in the Temple on 13 August. The monarchy was not abolished yet, however; the question of which form of government the country should install was postponed for five more weeks. For the revolutionaries, the most important issue was quelling possible treason from within, to avoid being stabbed in the back while the armies were fighting the monarchist forces on the frontiers.

=== August/September: Prussian-led invasion of France ===

After completing its preparations in the leisurely manner of the previous generation, Brunswick&#x27;s army crossed the French frontier on 19 August 1792. The Allies readily captured Longwy (23 August) and slowly marched on to besiege Verdun (29 August), which appeared more indefensible even than Longwy. The commandant there, Colonel Beaurepaire, shot himself in despair, and the place surrendered on 2 September 1792. Because this left the path to Paris wide open, radical revolutionaries in Paris and other cities panicked and started the September Massacres (2–7 September), killing hundreds of prisoners suspected of royalist sympathies and being in league with the enemy.

Brunswick now began his march on Paris and approached the defiles of the Argonne Forest. But Dumouriez, who had been training his raw troops at Valenciennes in constant small engagements, with the purpose of invading Belgium, now threw himself into the Argonne by a rapid and daring flank march, almost under the eyes of the Prussian advance guard. He barred all five road to Paris through the Argonne. Although Clerfayt seized one of the five roads and outflanked Dumouriez at Grandpré, Brunswick did not attack, instead camping for three days at Landres (15–17 September). The majority of his troops were plagued by dysentery, likely due to eating green apples in the Argonne, and needed to recover first. War Minister Servan ordered Kellermann to Dumouriez&#x27; assistance from Metz to Sainte-Menehould. Although having only 16,000 men from the Armée du Centre, these were the most professional. Kellermann moved but slowly, reaching Dampierre-le-Château on 18 September, and before he arrived the northern part of the line of defence had been forced. Dumouriez, undaunted, changed front so as to face north, with his right wing on the Argonne and his left stretching towards Châlons (where Luckner camped), and in this position Kellermann joined him at Sainte-Menehould on 19 September 1792.

Meanwhile, Brunswick had left Landres on 18 September, passed the northern defiles and then swung round to cut off Dumouriez from Châlons. He himself wanted to fight Dumouriez at Sainte-Menehould, but Prussian king Frederick William II, misled by false news that Dumouriez was withdrawing to Paris, ordered Brunswick to cut the retreat. At the moment when the Prussian manoeuvre was nearly completed, Kellermann, commanding in Dumouriez&#x27;s momentary absence, advanced his left wing and took up a position between Sainte-Menehould and Valmy. The result was the Cannonade of Valmy (20 September 1792). Kellermann&#x27;s infantry, nearly all regulars, stood steady. The French artillery justified its reputation as the best in Europe, and eventually, with no more than a half-hearted infantry attack, the duke broke off the action and retired.

This seemingly minor engagement proved the turning point of the campaign. Ten days later, without firing another shot, the invading army began its retreat (30 September). Dumouriez did not press the pursuit seriously; he occupied himself chiefly with a series of subtle and curious negotiations which, with the general advance of the French troops, brought about the complete withdrawal of the enemy from the soil of France. Once gone, Dumouriez refocused his military efforts on the &#x27;liberation&#x27; of Belgium.

== Post-Valmy campaigns ==
=== Launch of the Flanders Campaign ===
In the north, the Austrian siege of Lille had completely failed by 8 October, and Dumouriez now resumed his interrupted scheme for the invasion of the Southern Netherlands. He took command of the newly formed Armée de la Belgique – comprising 40,000 soldiers from the Valmy campaign – at Valenciennes on 20 October. Controlling enormously superior forces, ten days later he made his advance to Mons, late in the season and surprising the Austrians. On 6 November, he won the first great victory of the war at Jemappes near Mons and, this time advancing boldly, he overran the whole country from Namur to Antwerp within a month. He began planning the invasion of the Dutch Republic.

=== Piedmontese front ===
Meanwhile, the French forces in the south had driven back the Piedmontese and had conquered Savoy and Nice in September, annexing them in November. Army of the Var commander Anselme invaded the county of Nice on 28 September, and forced the city of Nice to surrender the next day at 4 pm. On 7 November, the army was renamed Army of Italy.

=== Rhineland campaign ===
Another French success was the daring expedition from Alsace into Germany made by Custine, leading the newly created 14,300 strong Armée des Vosges from 19 September onward. He attacked Speyer on 29 September and conquered it the next day. He went on to occupy Worms and Philippsburg without a fight. Custine captured Mainz on 21 October 1792 and penetrated as far as Frankfurt, which surrendered on 31 October.

== Cultural representations ==
* The situation of 1792, and the feeling of dire threat felt by the invaded French, are reflected in large parts of the wording of the French anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, written at the time: &quot;Against us, tyranny&#x27;s/Bloody banner is raised./Do you hear in the countryside/Those ferocious soldiers roaring?/They come right into our bosom/To slit the throats of our sons, our wives!&quot;
* Custine&#x27;s invasion of the German Palatinate forms the background for Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot;, written a few years later. The epic poem&#x27;s plot takes place in a small town near Mainz, flooded by refugees who fled their villages on the western side of the Rhine in order to seek refuge from the French troops on the eastern side.

<text>A scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) is a variant of a ramjet airbreathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow. As in ramjets, a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to compress the incoming air forcefully before combustion (hence &quot;ram&quot;jet), but whereas a ramjet decelerates the air to subsonic velocities before combustion using shock cones, a scramjet has no shock cone and slows the airflow using shockwaves produced by its ignition source in place of a shock cone. This allows the scramjet to operate efficiently at extremely high speeds.

Although scramjet engines have been used in a handful of operational military vehicles, scramjets have so far mostly been demonstrated in research test articles and experimental vehicles.

==History==

===Before 2000===
The Bell X-1 attained supersonic flight in 1947 and, by the early 1960s, rapid progress toward faster aircraft suggested that operational aircraft would be flying at &quot;hypersonic&quot; speeds within a few years. Except for specialized rocket research vehicles like the North American X-15 and other rocket-powered spacecraft, aircraft top speeds have remained level, generally in the range of Mach1 to Mach3.

During the US aerospaceplane program, between the 1950s and the mid 1960s, Alexander Kartveli and Antonio Ferri were proponents of the scramjet approach.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a variety of experimental scramjet engines were built and ground tested in the US and the UK. Antonio Ferri successfully demonstrated a scramjet producing net thrust in November 1964, eventually producing 517 pounds-force (2.30 kN), about 80% of his goal. In 1958, an analytical paper discussed the merits and disadvantages of supersonic combustion ramjets. In 1964, Frederick S. Billig and Gordon L. Dugger submitted a patent application for a supersonic combustion ramjet based on Billig&#x27;s PhD thesis. This patent was issued in 1981 following the removal of an order of secrecy.

In 1981, tests were made in Australia under the guidance of Professor Ray Stalker in the T3 ground test facility at ANU.

The first successful flight test of a scramjet was performed as a joint effort with NASA, over the Soviet Union in 1991. It was an axisymmetric hydrogen-fueled dual-mode scramjet developed by Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM), Moscow in the late 1970s, but modernized with a FeCrAl alloy on a converted SM-6 missile to achieve initial flight parameters of Mach 6.8, before the scramjet flew at Mach 5.5. The scramjet flight was flown captive-carry atop the SA-5 surface-to-air missile that included an experimental flight support unit known as the &quot;Hypersonic Flying Laboratory&quot; (HFL), &quot;Kholod&quot;.

Then, from 1992 to 1998, an additional six flight tests of the axisymmetric high-speed scramjet-demonstrator were conducted by CIAM together with France and then with NASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA/TP-1998-206548&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum flight speed greater than Mach6.4 was achieved and scramjet operation during 77 seconds was demonstrated. These flight test series also provided insight into autonomous hypersonic flight controls.

===2000s===

In the 2000s, significant progress was made in the development of hypersonic technology, particularly in the field of scramjet engines.

The HyShot project demonstrated scramjet combustion on 30 July 2002. The scramjet engine worked effectively and demonstrated supersonic combustion in action. However, the engine was not designed to provide thrust to propel a craft. It was designed more or less as a technology demonstrator.

A joint British and Australian team from UK defense company Qinetiq and the University of Queensland were the first group to demonstrate a scramjet working in an atmospheric test.

Hyper-X claimed the first flight of a thrust-producing scramjet-powered vehicle with full aerodynamic maneuvering surfaces in 2004 with the X-43A. The last of the three X-43A scramjet tests achieved Mach9.6 for a brief time.

On 15 June 2007, the US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), in cooperation with the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), announced a successful scramjet flight at Mach10 using rocket engines to boost the test vehicle to hypersonic speeds.

A series of scramjet ground tests was completed at NASA Langley Arc-Heated Scramjet Test Facility (AHSTF) at simulated Mach8 flight conditions. These experiments were used to support HIFiRE flight 2.

On 22 May 2009, Woomera hosted the first successful test flight of a hypersonic aircraft in HIFiRE (Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation). The launch was one of ten planned test flights. The series of flights is part of a joint research program between the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the US Air Force, designated as the HIFiRE. HIFiRE is investigating hypersonics technology and its application to advanced scramjet-powered space launch vehicles; the objective is to support the new Boeing X-51 scramjet demonstrator while also building a strong base of flight test data for quick-reaction space launch development and hypersonic &quot;quick-strike&quot; weapons.

===2010s===
On 22 and 23 March 2010, Australian and American defense scientists successfully tested a (HIFiRE) hypersonic rocket. It reached an atmospheric speed of &quot;more than 5,000 kilometres per hour&quot; (Mach4) after taking off from the Woomera Test Range in outback South Australia.

On 27 May 2010, NASA and the United States Air Force successfully flew the X-51A Waverider for approximately 200 seconds at Mach5, setting a new world record for flight duration at hypersonic airspeed. The Waverider flew autonomously before losing acceleration for an unknown reason and destroying itself as planned. The test was declared a success. The X-51A was carried aboard a B-52, accelerated to Mach4.5 via a solid rocket booster, and then ignited the Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne scramjet engine to reach Mach5 at . However, a second flight on 13 June 2011 was ended prematurely when the engine lit briefly on ethylene but failed to transition to its primary JP-7 fuel, failing to reach full power.

On 16 November 2010, Australian scientists from the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy successfully demonstrated that the high-speed flow in a naturally non-burning scramjet engine can be ignited using a pulsed laser source.

A further X-51A Waverider test failed on 15 August 2012. The attempt to fly the scramjet for a prolonged period at Mach6 was cut short when, only 15 seconds into the flight, the X-51A craft lost control and broke apart, falling into the Pacific Ocean north-west of Los Angeles. The cause of the failure was blamed on a faulty control fin.

In May 2013, an X-51A Waverider reached 4828 km/h (Mach3.9) during a three-minute flight under scramjet power. The WaveRider was dropped at from a B-52 bomber, and then accelerated to Mach4.8 by a solid rocket booster which then separated before the WaveRider&#x27;s scramjet engine came into effect.

On 28 August 2016, the Indian space agency ISRO conducted a successful test of a scramjet engine on a two-stage, solid-fueled rocket. Twin scramjet engines were mounted on the back of the second stage of a two-stage, solid-fueled sounding rocket called Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV), which is ISRO&#x27;s advanced sounding rocket. The twin scramjet engines were ignited during the second stage of the rocket when the ATV achieved a speed of 7350 km/h (Mach6) at an altitude of 20 km. The scramjet engines were fired for a duration of about 5 seconds.

On 12 June 2019, India successfully conducted the maiden flight test of its indigenously developed uncrewed scramjet demonstration aircraft for hypersonic speed flight from a base from Abdul Kalam Island in the Bay of Bengal at about 11:25 am. The aircraft is called the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle. The trial was carried out by the Defence Research and Development Organisation. The aircraft forms an important component of the country&#x27;s programme for development of a hypersonic cruise missile system.

===2020s===

On 27 September 2021, DARPA announced successful flight of its Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept scramjet cruise missile. Another successful test was carried out in mid-March 2022 amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Details were kept secret to avoid escalating tension with Russia, only to be revealed by an unnamed Pentagon official in early April.

== Design principles ==
Scramjet engines are a type of jet engine, and rely on the combustion of fuel and an oxidizer to produce thrust. Similar to conventional jet engines, scramjet-powered aircraft carry the fuel on board, and obtain the oxidizer by the ingestion of atmospheric oxygen (as compared to rockets, which carry both fuel and an oxidizing agent). This requirement limits scramjets to suborbital atmospheric propulsion, where the oxygen content of the air is sufficient to maintain combustion.

The scramjet is composed of three basic components: a converging inlet, where incoming air is compressed; a combustor, where gaseous fuel is burned with atmospheric oxygen to produce heat; and a diverging nozzle, where the heated air is accelerated to produce thrust. Unlike a typical jet engine, such as a turbojet or turbofan engine, a scramjet does not use rotating, fan-like components to compress the air; rather, the achievable speed of the aircraft moving through the atmosphere causes the air to compress within the inlet. As such, no moving parts are needed in a scramjet. In comparison, typical turbojet engines require multiple stages of rotating compressor rotors, and multiple rotating turbine stages, all of which add weight, complexity, and a greater number of failure points to the engine.

Due to the nature of their design, scramjet operation is limited to near-hypersonic velocities. As they lack mechanical compressors, scramjets require the high kinetic energy of a hypersonic flow to compress the incoming air to operational conditions. Thus, a scramjet-powered vehicle must be accelerated to the required velocity (usually about Mach4) by some other means of propulsion, such as turbojet, or rocket engines. In the flight of the experimental scramjet-powered Boeing X-51A, the test craft was lifted to flight altitude by a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress before being released and accelerated by a detachable rocket to near Mach4.5. In May 2013, another flight achieved an increased speed of Mach5.1.

While scramjets are conceptually simple, actual implementation is limited by extreme technical challenges. Hypersonic flight within the atmosphere generates immense drag, and temperatures found on the aircraft and within the engine can be much greater than that of the surrounding air. Maintaining combustion in the supersonic flow presents additional challenges, as the fuel must be injected, mixed, ignited, and burned within milliseconds. While scramjet technology has been under development since the 1950s, only very recently have scramjets successfully achieved powered flight.

Scramjets are designed to operate in the hypersonic flight regime, beyond the reach of turbojet engines, and, along with ramjets, fill the gap between the high efficiency of turbojets and the high speed of rocket engines. Turbomachinery-based engines, while highly efficient at subsonic speeds, become increasingly inefficient at transonic speeds, as the compressor rotors found in turbojet engines require subsonic speeds to operate. While the flow from transonic to low supersonic speeds can be decelerated to these conditions, doing so at supersonic speeds results in a tremendous increase in temperature and a loss in the total pressure of the flow. Around Mach3–4, turbomachinery is no longer useful, and ram-style compression becomes the preferred method.

Ramjets use high-speed characteristics of air to literally &#x27;ram&#x27; air through an inlet diffuser into the combustor. At transonic and supersonic flight speeds, the air upstream of the inlet is not able to move out of the way quickly enough, and is compressed within the diffuser before being diffused into the combustor. Combustion in a ramjet takes place at subsonic velocities, similar to turbojets but the combustion products are then accelerated through a convergent-divergent nozzle to supersonic speeds. As they have no mechanical means of compression, ramjets cannot start from a standstill, and generally do not achieve sufficient compression until supersonic flight. The lack of intricate turbomachinery allows ramjets to deal with the temperature rise associated with decelerating a supersonic flow to subsonic speeds. However, as speed rises, the internal energy of the flow after diffusor grows rapidly, so the relative addition of energy due to fuel combustion becomes lower, leading to decrease in efficiency of the engine. This leads to decrease in thrust generated by ramjets at higher speeds. 

Thus, to generate thrust at very high velocities, the rise of the pressure and temperature of the incoming air flow must be tightly controlled. In particular, this means that deceleration of the airflow to subsonic speed cannot be allowed. Mixing the fuel and air in this situation presents a considerable engineering challenge, compounded by the need to closely manage the speed of combustion while maximizing the relative increase of internal energy within the combustion chamber. Consequently, current scramjet technology requires the use of high-energy fuels and active cooling schemes to maintain sustained operation, often using hydrogen and regenerative cooling techniques.

==Theory==
All scramjet engines have an intake which compresses the incoming air, fuel injectors, a combustion chamber, and a divergent thrust nozzle. Sometimes engines also include a region which acts as a flame holder, although the high stagnation temperatures mean that an area of focused waves may be used, rather than a discrete engine part as seen in turbine engines. Other engines use pyrophoric fuel additives, such as silane, to avoid flameout. An isolator between the inlet and combustion chamber is often included to improve the homogeneity of the flow in the combustor and to extend the operating range of the engine.

Shockwave imaging by the University of Maryland using Schlieren imaging determined that the fuel mixture controls compression by creating backpressure and shockwaves that slow and compress the air before ignition, much like the shock cone of a Ramjet. The imaging showed that the higher the fuel flow and combustion, the more shockwaves formed ahead of the combustor, which slowed and compressed the air before ignition.

A scramjet is reminiscent of a ramjet. In a typical ramjet, the supersonic inflow of the engine is decelerated at the inlet to subsonic speeds and then reaccelerated through a nozzle to supersonic speeds to produce thrust. This deceleration, which is produced by a normal shock, creates a total pressure loss which limits the upper operating point of a ramjet engine.

For a scramjet, the kinetic energy of the freestream air entering the scramjet engine is largely comparable to the energy released by the reaction of the oxygen content of the air with a fuel (e.g. hydrogen). Thus the heat released from combustion at Mach2.5 is around 10% of the total enthalpy of the working fluid. Depending on the fuel, the kinetic energy of the air and the potential combustion heat release will be equal at around Mach8. Thus the design of a scramjet engine is as much about minimizing drag as maximizing thrust.

This high speed makes the control of the flow within the combustion chamber more difficult. Since the flow is supersonic, no downstream influence propagates within the freestream of the combustion chamber. Throttling of the entrance to the thrust nozzle is not a usable control technique. In effect, a block of gas entering the combustion chamber must mix with fuel and have sufficient time for initiation and reaction, all the while traveling supersonically through the combustion chamber, before the burned gas is expanded through the thrust nozzle. This places stringent requirements on the pressure and temperature of the flow, and requires that the fuel injection and mixing be extremely efficient. Usable dynamic pressures lie in the range , where

:formula_1

where
:&quot;q&quot; is the dynamic pressure of the gas
:&quot;ρ&quot; (rho) is the density of the gas
:&quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the gas

To keep the combustion rate of the fuel constant, the pressure and temperature in the engine must also be constant. This is problematic because the airflow control systems that would facilitate this are not physically possible in a scramjet launch vehicle due to the large speed and altitude range involved, meaning that it must travel at an altitude specific to its speed. Because air density reduces at higher altitudes, a scramjet must climb at a specific rate as it accelerates to maintain a constant air pressure at the intake. This optimal climb/descent profile is called a &quot;constant dynamic pressure path&quot;. It is thought that scramjets might be operable up to an altitude of 75 km.

Fuel injection and management is also potentially complex. One possibility would be that the fuel be pressurized to 100 bar by a turbo pump, heated by the fuselage, sent through the turbine and accelerated to higher speeds than the air by a nozzle. The air and fuel stream are crossed in a comb-like structure, which generates a large interface. Turbulence due to the higher speed of the fuel leads to additional mixing. Complex fuels like kerosene need a long engine to complete combustion.

The minimum Mach number at which a scramjet can operate is limited by the fact that the compressed flow must be hot enough to burn the fuel, and have pressure high enough that the reaction be finished before the air moves out the back of the engine. Additionally, to be called a scramjet, the compressed flow must still be supersonic after combustion. Here two limits must be observed: First, since when a supersonic flow is compressed it slows down, the level of compression must be low enough (or the initial speed high enough) not to slow the gas below Mach1. If the gas within a scramjet goes below Mach1 the engine will &quot;choke&quot;, transitioning to subsonic flow in the combustion chamber. This effect is well known amongst experimenters on scramjets since the waves caused by choking are easily observable. Additionally, the sudden increase in pressure and temperature in the engine can lead to an acceleration of the combustion, leading to the combustion chamber exploding.

Second, the heating of the gas by combustion causes the speed of sound in the gas to increase (and the Mach number to decrease) even though the gas is still travelling at the same speed. Forcing the speed of air flow in the combustion chamber under Mach1 in this way is called &quot;thermal choking&quot;. It is clear that a pure scramjet can operate at Mach numbers of 6–8, but in the lower limit, it depends on the definition of a scramjet. There are engine designs where a ramjet transforms into a scramjet over the Mach3–6 range, known as dual-mode scramjets. In this range however, the engine is still receiving significant thrust from subsonic combustion of the ramjet type.

The high cost of flight testing and the unavailability of ground facilities have hindered scramjet development. A large amount of the experimental work on scramjets has been undertaken in cryogenic facilities, direct-connect tests, or burners, each of which simulates one aspect of the engine operation. Further, vitiated facilities (with the ability to control air impurities), storage heated facilities, arc facilities and the various types of shock tunnels each have limitations which have prevented perfect simulation of scramjet operation. The HyShot flight test showed the relevance of the 1:1 simulation of conditions in the T4 and HEG shock tunnels, despite having cold models and a short test time. The NASA-CIAM tests provided similar verification for CIAM&#x27;s C-16 V/K facility and the Hyper-X project is expected to provide similar verification for the Langley AHSTF, CHSTF, and HTT.

Computational fluid dynamics has only recently reached a position to make reasonable computations in solving scramjet operation problems. Boundary layer modeling, turbulent mixing, two-phase flow, flow separation, and real-gas aerothermodynamics continue to be problems on the cutting edge of CFD. Additionally, the modeling of kinetic-limited combustion with very fast-reacting species such as hydrogen makes severe demands on computing resources.
Reaction schemes are numerically stiff requiring reduced reaction schemes.

Much of scramjet experimentation remains classified. Several groups, including the US Navy with the SCRAM engine between 1968 and 1974, and the Hyper-X program with the X-43A, have claimed successful demonstrations of scramjet technology. Since these results have not been published openly, they remain unverified and a final design method of scramjet engines still does not exist.

The final application of a scramjet engine is likely to be in conjunction with engines which can operate outside the scramjet&#x27;s operating range.
Dual-mode scramjets combine subsonic combustion with supersonic combustion for operation at lower speeds, and rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engines supplement a traditional rocket&#x27;s propulsion with a scramjet, allowing for additional oxidizer to be added to the scramjet flow. RBCCs offer a possibility to extend a scramjet&#x27;s operating range to higher speeds or lower intake dynamic pressures than would otherwise be possible.

Unlike a rocket that quickly passes mostly vertically through the atmosphere or a turbojet or ramjet that flies at much lower speeds, a hypersonic airbreathing vehicle optimally flies a &quot;depressed trajectory&quot;, staying within the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Because scramjets have only mediocre thrust-to-weight ratios, acceleration would be limited. Therefore, time in the atmosphere at supersonic speed would be considerable, possibly 15–30 minutes. Similar to a reentering space vehicle, heat insulation would be a formidable task, with protection required for a duration longer than that of a typical space capsule, although less than the Space Shuttle.

New materials offer good insulation at high temperature, but they often sacrifice themselves in the process. Therefore, studies often plan on &quot;active cooling&quot;, where coolant circulating throughout the vehicle skin prevents it from disintegrating. Often the coolant is the fuel itself, in much the same way that modern rockets use their own fuel and oxidizer as coolant for their engines. All cooling systems add weight and complexity to a launch system. The cooling of scramjets in this way may result in greater efficiency, as heat is added to the fuel prior to entry into the engine, but results in increased complexity and weight which ultimately could outweigh any performance gains.

The performance of a launch system is complex and depends greatly on its weight. Normally craft are designed to maximise range (formula_2), orbital radius (formula_2) or payload mass fraction (formula_4) for a given engine and fuel. This results in tradeoffs between the efficiency of the engine (takeoff fuel weight) and the complexity of the engine (takeoff dry weight), which can be expressed by the following:

:formula_5

Where :
*formula_6 is the empty mass fraction, and represents the weight of the superstructure, tankage and engine.
*formula_7 is the fuel mass fraction, and represents the weight of fuel, oxidiser and any other materials which are consumed during the launch.
*formula_8 is initial mass ratio, and is the inverse of the payload mass fraction. This represents how much payload the vehicle can deliver to a destination.

A scramjet increases the mass of the motor formula_9 over a rocket, and decreases the mass of the fuel formula_10. It can be difficult to decide whether this will result in an increased formula_4 (which would be an increased payload delivered to a destination for a constant vehicle takeoff weight). The logic behind efforts driving a scramjet is (for example) that the reduction in fuel decreases the total mass by 30%, while the increased engine weight adds 10% to the vehicle total mass. Unfortunately the uncertainty in the calculation of any mass or efficiency changes in a vehicle is so great that slightly different assumptions for engine efficiency or mass can provide equally good arguments for or against scramjet powered vehicles.

Additionally, the drag of the new configuration must be considered. The drag of the total configuration can be considered as the sum of the vehicle drag (formula_12) and the engine installation drag (formula_13). The installation drag traditionally results from the pylons and the coupled flow due to the engine jet, and is a function of the throttle setting. Thus it is often written as:
:formula_14

Where:
*formula_15 is the loss coefficient
*formula_16 is the thrust of the engine

For an engine strongly integrated into the aerodynamic body, it may be more convenient to think of (formula_13) as the difference in drag from a known base configuration.

The overall engine efficiency can be represented as a value between 0 and 1 (formula_18), in terms of the specific impulse of the engine:

:formula_19

Where:
*formula_20 is the acceleration due to gravity at ground level
*formula_21 is the vehicle speed
*formula_22 is the specific impulse
*formula_23 is fuel heat of reaction

Specific impulse is often used as the unit of efficiency for rockets, since in the case of the rocket, there is a direct relation between specific impulse, specific fuel consumption and exhaust velocity. This direct relation is not generally present for airbreathing engines, and so specific impulse is less used in the literature. Note that for an airbreathing engine, both formula_18 and formula_22 are a function of velocity.

The specific impulse of a rocket engine is independent of velocity, and common values are between 200 and 600 seconds (450s for the space shuttle main engines). The specific impulse of a scramjet varies with velocity, reducing at higher speeds, starting at about 1200s, although values in the literature vary.

For the simple case of a single stage vehicle, the fuel mass fraction can be expressed as:
:formula_26

Where this can be expressed for single stage transfer to orbit as:

:formula_27

or for level atmospheric flight from air launch (missile flight):

:formula_28

Where formula_2 is the range, and the calculation can be expressed in the form of the Breguet range formula:

:formula_30

Where:
*formula_31 is the lift coefficient
*formula_32 is the drag coefficient

This extremely simple formulation, used for the purposes of discussion assumes:

* Single stage vehicle
* No aerodynamic lift for the transatmospheric lifter

However they are true generally for all engines.

A scramjet cannot produce efficient thrust unless boosted to high speed, around Mach5, although depending on the design it could act as a ramjet at low speeds. A horizontal take-off aircraft would need conventional turbofan, turbojet, or rocket engines to take off, sufficiently large to move a heavy craft. Also needed would be fuel for those engines, plus all engine-associated mounting structure and control systems. Turbofan and turbojet engines are heavy and cannot easily exceed about Mach2–3, so another propulsion method would be needed to reach scramjet operating speed. That could be ramjets or rockets. Those would also need their own separate fuel supply, structure, and systems. Many proposals instead call for a first stage of droppable solid rocket boosters, which greatly simplifies the design.

Unlike jet or rocket propulsion systems facilities which can be tested on the ground, testing scramjet designs uses extremely expensive hypersonic test chambers or expensive launch vehicles, both of which lead to high instrumentation costs. Tests using launched test vehicles very typically end with destruction of the test item and instrumentation.

=== Orbital vehicles ===

An advantage of a hypersonic airbreathing (typically scramjet) vehicle like the X-30 is avoiding or at least reducing the need for carrying oxidizer. For example, the Space Shuttle external tank held 616,432.2 kg of liquid oxygen (LOX) and 103,000 kg of liquid hydrogen (LH) while having an empty weight of 30,000 kg. The orbiter gross weight was 109,000 kg with a maximum payload of about 25,000 kg and to get the assembly off the launch pad the shuttle used two very powerful solid rocket boosters with a weight of 590,000 kg each. If the oxygen could be eliminated, the vehicle could be lighter at liftoff and possibly carry more payload.

On the other hand, scramjets spend more time in the atmosphere and require more hydrogen fuel to deal with aerodynamic drag. Whereas liquid oxygen is quite a dense fluid (1141 kg/m3), liquid hydrogen has much lower density (70.85 kg/m3) and takes up more volume. This means that the vehicle using this fuel becomes much bigger and gives more drag. Other fuels have more comparable density, such as RP-1 (810 kg/m3) JP-7 (density at 15 °C 779–806 kg/m3) and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) (793.00 kg/m3).

One issue is that scramjet engines are predicted to have exceptionally poor thrust-to-weight ratio of around 2, when installed in a launch vehicle. A rocket has the advantage that its engines have &quot;very&quot; high thrust-weight ratios (~100:1), while the tank to hold the liquid oxygen approaches a volume ratio of ~100:1 also. Thus a rocket can achieve a very high mass fraction, which improves performance. By way of contrast the projected thrust/weight ratio of scramjet engines of about 2 mean a much larger percentage of the takeoff mass is engine (ignoring that this fraction increases anyway by a factor of about four due to the lack of onboard oxidiser). In addition the vehicle&#x27;s lower thrust does not necessarily avoid the need for the expensive, bulky, and failure-prone high performance turbopumps found in conventional liquid-fuelled rocket engines, since most scramjet designs seem to be incapable of orbital speeds in airbreathing mode, and hence extra rocket engines are needed.

Scramjets might be able to accelerate from approximately Mach5–7 to around somewhere between half of orbital speed and orbital speed (X-30 research suggested that Mach17 might be the limit compared to an orbital speed of Mach25, and other studies put the upper speed limit for a pure scramjet engine between Mach10 and 25, depending on the assumptions made). Generally, another propulsion system (very typically, a rocket is proposed) is expected to be needed for the final acceleration into orbit. Since the delta-V is moderate and the payload fraction of scramjets high, lower performance rockets such as solids, hypergolics, or simple liquid fueled boosters might be acceptable.

Theoretical projections place the top speed of a scramjet between and . For comparison, the orbital speed at low Earth orbit is .

The scramjet&#x27;s heat-resistant underside potentially doubles as its reentry system if a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle using non-ablative, non-active cooling is visualised. If an ablative shielding is used on the engine it will probably not be usable after ascent to orbit. If active cooling is used with the fuel as coolant, the loss of all fuel during the burn to orbit will also mean the loss of all cooling for the thermal protection system.

Reducing the amount of fuel and oxidizer does not necessarily improve costs as rocket propellants are comparatively very cheap. Indeed, the unit cost of the vehicle can be expected to end up far higher, since aerospace hardware cost is about two orders of magnitude higher than liquid oxygen, fuel and tankage, and scramjet hardware seems to be much heavier than rockets for any given payload. Still, if scramjets enable reusable vehicles, this could theoretically be a cost benefit. Whether equipment subject to the extreme conditions of a scramjet can be reused sufficiently many times is unclear; all flown scramjet tests only survive for short periods and have never been designed to survive a flight to date. The eventual cost of such a vehicle is the subject of intense debate since even the best estimates disagree whether a scramjet vehicle would be advantageous. It is likely that a scramjet vehicle would need to lift more load than a rocket of equal takeoff weight to be equally as cost efficient (if the scramjet is a non-reusable vehicle).

Space launch vehicles may or may not benefit from having a scramjet stage. A scramjet stage of a launch vehicle theoretically provides a specific impulse of 1000 to 4000s whereas a rocket provides less than 450s while in the atmosphere. A scramjet&#x27;s specific impulse decreases rapidly with speed, however, and the vehicle would suffer from a relatively low lift to drag ratio.

The installed thrust to weight ratio of scramjets compares very unfavorably with the 50–100 of a typical rocket engine. This is compensated for in scramjets partly because the weight of the vehicle would be carried by aerodynamic lift rather than pure rocket power (giving reduced &#x27;gravity losses&#x27;), but scramjets would take much longer to get to orbit due to lower thrust which greatly offsets the advantage. The takeoff weight of a scramjet vehicle is significantly reduced over that of a rocket, due to the lack of onboard oxidiser, but increased by the structural requirements of the larger and heavier engines.

Whether this vehicle could be reusable or not is still a subject of debate and research.

==Proposed applications==
An aircraft using this type of jet engine could dramatically reduce the time it takes to travel from one place to another, potentially putting any place on Earth within a 90-minute flight. However, there are questions about whether such a vehicle could carry enough fuel to make useful length trips. In addition, some countries ban or penalize airliners and other civil aircraft that create sonic booms. (For example, in the United States, FAA regulations prohibit supersonic flights over land, by civil aircraft.

Scramjet vehicle has been proposed for a single stage to tether vehicle, where a Mach12 spinning orbital tether would pick up a payload from a vehicle at around 100 km and carry it to orbit.

<text>The Gorani (, ) or Goranci (, ), are a Slavic ethnic group inhabiting the Gora region—the triangle between Kosovo, Albania, and North Macedonia. They number an estimated 60,000 people, and speak a transitional South Slavic dialect, called &quot;Goranski&quot;. The vast majority of the Gorani people adhere to Sunni Islam.

== Name ==
The ethnonym &quot;Goranci&quot;, meaning &quot;highlanders&quot;, is derived from the Slavic toponym &quot;gora&quot;, which means &quot;hill, mountain&quot;. Another autonym of this people is &quot;Našinci&quot;, which literally means &quot;our people, our ones&quot;.

In Macedonian sources, the Gorani are sometimes grouped together with &quot;Torbeši&quot;.

In the Albanian language, they are known as &quot;Goranët&quot; and sometimes by other exonyms, such as &quot;Bullgarët&quot; (&quot;Bulgarians&quot;), &quot;Torbesh&quot; (&quot;bag carriers&quot;) and &quot;Poturë&quot; (&quot;turkified&quot;, from &quot;po-tur&quot;, literally not Turk but, &quot;turkified&quot;, used for Islamized Slavs).

== Population ==

Some of the local Gorani people have over time also self declared themselves as Serbs, Albanians, Macedonians, Bosniaks, Muslim Bulgarians, Turks, or just as Muslims, due to geopolitical circumstances and in censuses.

In Kosovo, the Gorani number 10,265 inhabitants, which is drastically lower than before the Kosovo War. In 1998, it was estimated that their total population number was at least 50,000.

According to the 2023 Albanian census, the first one where a Bulgarian minority was officially recognised by the Albanian government, a total of 2,174 people self-identified as Bulgarians in the Kukës County. At the same time, the population of the two Gorani-inhabited administrative units of Zapod and Shishtavec stood at 3,671 in 9 Gorani and 5 Albanian villages. 

By comparison, 5 residents of the entire Kukës County self-identified as Macedonians, 8 as Montenegrins, 13 as Bosniaks and 19 as Serbs.

===Settlements===

In Albania, there are nine Gorani-inhabited villages: Zapod, Pakisht, Orçikël, Kosharisht, Cernalevë, Orgjost, Oreshkë, Borje and Shishtavec.

In Kosovo, there are 18 Gorani-inhabited villages: Baćka, Brod, Vranište, Globočice, Gornja Rapča, Gornji Krstac, Dikance, Donja Rapča, Donji Krstac, Zli Potok, Kruševo, Kukaljane, Lještane, Ljubošta, Mlike, Orčuša, Radeša, and Restelica, plus the town of Dragash.

Following 1999, Dragash has a mixed population of Gorani, who live in the lower neighbourhood, and Albanians in the upper neighbourhood constituting the majority of inhabitants.

In North Macedonia, there are two Gorani-inhabited villages located in the Polog region: Jelovjane and Urvič.

== History ==
===Contemporary===
The Gora municipality and Opoja region remained separated during the Milošević period. After the war, the Gorani-majority Gora municipality was merged with the Albanian inhabited Opoja region to form the municipality of Dragash by the United Nations Mission (UNMIK) and the new administrative unit has an Albanian majority.

In 2007 the Kosovar provisional institutions opened a school in Gora to teach the Bosnian language, which sparked minor consternation amongst the Gorani population. Many Gorani refuse to send their children to school due to societal prejudices, and threats of assimilation to Bosniaks or Albanians. Consequently, Gorani organized education per Serbia&#x27;s curriculum.

Gorani activists stated they want Gora (a former municipality which still has a Gorani majority) to join the Association of Serb Municipalities.

In 2018 Bulgarian activists among Gorani have filed a petition in the country&#x27;s parliament demanding their official recognition as a separate minority.

Most Gorani state that the unstable situation and economic issues drive them to leave Kosovo. There is also some mention of threats and discrimination by ethnic Albanians.

Apart from the multiethnic town of Dragash, the Gorani of Kosovo continue to live in villages primarily inhabited by their community and relations with Albanians remain tense. Mixed marriage between both communities do not occur with the exception of a few Gorani families that have migrated to Prizren.

==Culture==

===Religion===

In the 18th century, a wave of Islamization began in Gora. The Ottoman abolition of the Archbishopric of Ohrid and Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in 1766/1767 is thought to have prompted the Islamization of Gora as was the trend of many Balkan communities. The last Christian Gorani, Božana, died in the 19th century – she has received a cult, signifying the Gorani&#x27;s Christian heritage, collected by Russian consuls Anastasiev and Yastrebov in the second half of the 19th century.

===Traditions===
The Gorani are known for being &quot;the best confectioners and bakers&quot; in former Yugoslavia.

The Slavs of Gora were Christianized after 864 when Bulgaria adopted Christianity. The Ottomans conquered the region in the 14th century, which started the process of Islamization of the Gorani and neighbouring Albanians. However, the Gorani still tangentially observe some Orthodox Christian traditions, such as Slavas and Đurđevdan, and like Serbs they know their Onomastik or saint&#x27;s days.

Gorani are Sunni Muslims and Sufism and in particular the Halveti and Bektashi Sufi orders are widespread.

Traditional Gorani folk music includes a two-beat dance called &quot;oro&quot; (&#x27;circle&#x27;), which is a circle dance focused on the foot movements: it always starts on the right foot and moves in an anti-clockwise direction. The Oro is usually accompanied by instruments such as curlje, kaval, čiftelija or tapan, and singing is used less frequently in the dances than in those of the Albanians and Serbs.

The &quot;national&quot; sport of &quot;Pelivona&quot; is a form of oil wrestling popular among Gorani with regular tournaments being held in the outdoors to the accompaniment of curlje and tapan with associated ritualized hand gestures and dances, with origins in the Middle East through the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s conquest of the Balkans.

Another popular drink is Turkish coffee which is drunk in small cups accompanied by a glass of water. Tasseography is popular among all Gorani using the residue of Turkish coffee.

===Language===
The Gorani people speak a local South Slavic dialect known as &quot;Našinski&quot; or &quot;Goranski&quot;, which forms part of a wider Torlakian dialect, spoken in Southern Serbia, Western Bulgaria and part of North Macedonia. The Slavic dialect of the Gorani community is known as &quot;Gorançe&quot; by Albanians. Within the Gorani community there is a recognition of their dialects being closer to the Macedonian language than to Serbian. The Torlakian dialect is a transitional dialect of Serbian and Bulgarian whilst also sharing features with Macedonian. The Gorani speech is classified as an Old-Shtokavian dialect of Serbian, the Prizren-Timok dialect.

Bulgarian linguists classify the Gorani dialect as part of a Bulgarian dialectal area. The Gorani have been used as a lever of Bulgarian irredentism, on the premise that if the Gora dialect is Bulgarian, then all Macedonian dialects are Bulgarian. Illustrating the Bulgarian interest is the first Gorani–Albanian dictionary (with 43,000 words and phrases) published in 2007 by Albanian-Gorani scholar Nazif Dokle, sponsored and printed by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In this dictionary, Dokle defined the language as related to &quot;the Bulgarian dialects spoken in the northwest&quot; North Macedonia.

Within scholarship, the Goran dialects previously classified as belonging to Serbian have been reassigned to Macedonian in the 21st century.

Gorani speech has numerous loan-words, being greatly influenced by Turkish and Arabic due to the influence of Islam, as well as Albanian areally. It is similar to the Bosnian language because of the numerous Turkish loanwords. Gorani speak Serbo-Croatian in school.

According to the 1991 Yugoslav census, 54.8% of the inhabitants of the Gora municipality said that they spoke the Gorani language, while the remainder had called it Serbian. Some linguists, including Vidoeski, Brozovic and Ivic, identify the Slavic-dialect of the Gora region as Macedonian. There are assertions that Macedonian is spoken in 50 to 75 villages in the Gora region (Albania and Kosovo). According to some unverified sources, in 2003 the Kosovo government acquired Macedonian language and grammar books for Gorani schools.

In 2008 the first issue of a Macedonian-language newspaper, &quot;Гороцвет&quot; (&quot;Gorocvet&quot;) was published.

<doc id="233507" wikidata="Q314490" url="?curid=233507" title="Gorm the Old">
<text>Gorm the Old (; ; ), also called Gorm the Languid (), was ruler of Denmark, reigning from to his death or a few years later. He ruled from Jelling, and made the oldest of the Jelling stones in honour of his wife Thyra. Gorm was born before 900 and died perhaps around 958 or possibly 963 or 964.

== Ancestry and reign ==
Gorm is the reported son of semi-legendary Danish king Harthacnut. Chronicler Adam of Bremen says that Harthacnut came from &quot;Northmannia&quot; to Denmark and seized power in the early 10th century. He deposed the young king Sigtrygg Gnupasson, reigning over Western Denmark. When Harthacnut died, Gorm ascended the throne.

Heimskringla reports Gorm taking at least part of the kingdom by force from Gnupa, and Adam himself suggests that the kingdom had been divided prior to Gorm&#x27;s time. Gorm is first mentioned as the host of Archbishop Unni of Hamburg and Bremen in 936. According to the Jelling Stones, Gorm&#x27;s son, Harald Bluetooth, &quot;won all of Denmark&quot;, so it is speculated that Gorm only ruled Jutland from his seat in Jelling.

== Marriage to Thyra ==
Gorm married Thyra, who is given conflicting and chronologically dubious parentage by late sources, but no contemporary indication of her parentage survives. Gorm raised one of the great burial mounds at Jelling as well as the oldest of the Jelling Stones for her, calling her &quot;tanmarkar but&quot; (&quot;Denmark&#x27;s Salvation&quot; or &quot;Denmark&#x27;s Adornment&quot;). Gorm was the father of three sons, Toke, Knut and Harald, later King Harald Bluetooth.

His wife, Thyra, is credited with the completion of the Danevirke, a wall between Denmark&#x27;s southern border and its unfriendly Saxon neighbours to the south. The wall was not new, but it was expanded with a ditch and earthen foundation topped by a timber stockade above it. The Danevirke ran between the Schlei and the Treene river, across what is now Schleswig.

== Death, burial and reburial ==
One theory is that Gorm died in the winter of 958–959, this is based on dendrochronology that shows that the burial chamber in the northern burial mound in Jelling was made from wood felled in 958. Arild Huitfeldt relates one legend of his death in &quot;Danmarks Riges Krønike&quot;:


This account would contradict information on the Jelling Stones which point to Queen Thyra dying before Gorm. Some archaeologists and historians have suggested that Gorm was buried first in Queen Thyra&#x27;s grave mound at Jelling, and later moved by his son, Harald Bluetooth, into the original wooden church in Jelling. According to this theory it is believed that the skeleton found at the site of the first Christian church of Jelling is in fact Gorm the Old, though the theory is still much debated. During the reign of Gorm, most Danes still worshipped the Norse gods, but during the reign of Gorm&#x27;s son, Harald Bluetooth, Denmark officially converted to Christianity. Harald, accordingly, left the hill where Gorm had originally been interred as a memorial.

== Legacy == 
Gorm was &quot;old&quot; in the sense that he was considered the traditional ancestral &quot;head&quot; of the Danish monarchy. Saxo Grammaticus in the asserts that Gorm was older than other monarchs and, having lived so long, was blind by the time his son Canute was killed.

<text>Lisa Deshaun Leslie (born July 7, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player. She is currently the head coach for Triplets in the BIG3 professional basketball league, as well as a studio analyst for Orlando Magic broadcasts on FanDuel Sports Network Florida. In 2002, Leslie made history as the first player to dunk during a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) game. Leslie was ranked 5th on ESPN.com&#x27;s 2021 list of the WNBA&#x27;s greatest players of all time.

Leslie played in the WNBA for the Los Angeles Sparks from 1997 to 2009. She is a three-time WNBA MVP and a four-time Olympic gold medal winner. The number-seven pick in the 1997 inaugural WNBA draft, she followed her career at the University of Southern California with eight WNBA All-Star selections and two WNBA championships over the course of 11 seasons with the Los Angeles Sparks, before retiring in 2009. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. All throughout her WNBA career, Leslie also played for USA Basketball in international competition, winning four Olympic gold medals (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008) and two FIBA World Championships (1998, 2002).

In 2015, Leslie was inducted into both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame.

Upon becoming coach of the Triplets in 2019, she led the team to the BIG3 Championship that year.

==Early life==
Leslie was born in Compton, California, the daughter of Christine Lauren Leslie, who stood , and Walter Leslie, a former professional basketball player. Christine started her own truck driving business to support her three children. Walter left the family when her mother was four months pregnant with her. Leslie has two sisters: Dionne, who is five years older, and Tiffany, who is eight years younger. She also has a brother, Elgin (named after Elgin Baylor of the Los Angeles Lakers). She played on an all-girls team with the record 33–1.

===Middle school ===
During the first few weeks of middle school, a classmate asked Leslie to help out the basketball team. On her first day of basketball tryouts, team members were told to split into two groups for layup drills: lefties and righties. Leslie was the only lefty in the group, so from then on, she decided to become right-hand dominant so she would not have to stand in a line by herself. That decision worked to her advantage, as she became ambidextrous.

In eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls&#x27; basketball team, and joined a boys&#x27; basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence in her playing abilities.

===High school===
At the age of 14, before Leslie had started high school at Morningside, she received more than a hundred college recruiting letters, including some from top Division I programs at the University of Tennessee and Stanford University.

Leslie continued her education in 1986 by enrolling at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California. She made an immediate impact on the basketball program, starting every game for the girl&#x27;s varsity team. She also joined the volleyball team and competed in track and field. She ended up being a state qualifier in the 400-meter run and the high jump.

By the time she was a sophomore in high school, she was able to dunk the ball in the open court, even though she was not able to palm the ball. She was her team&#x27;s leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the 1989 California state championship. Leslie was invited to participate in the USA&#x27;s Junior World Championship team. Entering her senior year, she developed into the top player in the country. She led her team to a state championship averaging 27 points and 15 rebounds per game. She tied the national record for points scored by a high school basketball player with Cheryl Miller in 1990 with 101 points scored, all in the first half. She had scored 105 points but four of the points were due to a technical foul charged on the opposing team for a delay of game after halftime, which were later voided as the game was deemed to end after the first half when the opposing team from South Torrance refused to play.

==College career==
Leslie attended the University of Southern California from 1990 to 1994. She graduated from USC with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications and later completed her master&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix.

Leslie played in a total of 120 college games, averaging 20.1 points, hitting 53.4% of her shots, and knocking down 69.8% of her free throws. She set the Pac-10 Conference records for scoring, rebounding, and blocked shots accumulating 2,414 points, 1,214 rebounds, and 321 blocked shots. She also holds the USC single season record for blocked shots (95).

During her college career, USC compiled a 89–31 record. They won one Pac-10 conference championship and earned four NCAA tournament appearances. Leslie was honored with All-Pac-10 recognition all four years, as well as becoming the first player in Pac-10 history to obtain first team all four years and earn the Pac-10 Rookie of the Year award in 1991. Leslie was also honored on the national platform by earning the national freshman of the year award in 1991. In 1994, she won multiple national player of the year awards—the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women&#x27;s National Player of the Year award, the Honda Sports Award for basketball, and the WBCA Player of the Year award. In 1992, 1993, and 1994, she earned All-American Honors as well.

===USC statistics===

==WNBA career==
The WNBA was incorporated in 1996 and began playing in 1997. Leslie was drafted on January 22 by the Los Angeles Sparks as part of the Initial Allocation phase of the draft. Her debut game was played on June 21, 1997, in a 67 - 57 loss to the New York Liberty. In her first game, Leslie recorded 16 points, 14 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocks. Due to her performance, Leslie has the distinction of recording the first double-double in WNBA history. Ruthie Bolton of the Sacramento Monarchs also recorded a double-double of 16 points and 11 rebounds on June 21, 1997, against the Utah Starzz. But chronologically, the Sparks vs. Liberty game was played before the Monarchs vs. Starzz game.

Leslie helped the Sparks make the playoffs five consecutive times, but the team did not win a WNBA title until 2001. That year, Leslie was named the 2001 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation.

On July 30, 2002, Leslie became the first woman to dunk the ball in a WNBA game. That same year she became the first WNBA player to score over 3,000 total career points and contributed to the Sparks winning their second straight WNBA championship that season. Two seasons later, she became the first player to reach the 4,000-career point milestone. Leslie remains the Sparks&#x27; career scoring and rebounding leader. She is the 4th highest all-time rebound leader, after Rebekkah Brunson, Sylvia Fowles, and Tamika Catchings. Within that same season, she also became the third player in WNBA history to record a triple double, when she had 29 points, 15 rebounds and 10 blocks. In the 2005 WNBA All-Star Game, Leslie had also become the first WNBA player to dunk in an all-star game. On August 11, 2009, Leslie became the first player to score 6,000 points in a career. Earlier that month she was the first player to reach 10,000 career PRA (points + rebounds + assists), a statistic fundamental to the WNBA &quot;Pick One Challenge&quot; fantasy game.

Leslie announced her retirement effective at the end of the 2009 season on February 4, 2009. The Sparks held a farewell ceremony for Leslie during their final home game of the season in September. She finished holding the league records for points (6,263), rebounds (3,307) and PRA (10,444).

Leslie&#x27;s final WNBA game ever was Game 3 of the 2009 Western Conference Finals between the Sparks and the Phoenix Mercury. Although Leslie recorded 22 points and 9 rebounds, the Sparks lost the game 74 - 85 and were eliminated from the playoffs.

In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA. In 2016, she was voted into the WNBA Top 20@20, in celebration of the league&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==National team career==

Leslie was named to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s Junior National Team (now called the U19 team). She was 17 at the time, the youngest player on the USA team. The team participated in the second Junior World Championship, held in Bilbao, Spain in July 1989. The USA team lost their opening game to South Korea in overtime, then lost a two-point game to Australia. After winning their next game against Bulgaria, behind 22 points and nine rebounds from Leslie, the USA team again fell in a close game, losing by three points to Czechoslovakia. After beating Zaire in their next game, the USA team played Spain, and fell three points short. Leslie led the team in scoring, rebounds, and blocks, averaging 13.3 points and 7.0 rebounds per game and recording 21 blocks over the course of the event. The USA team finished in seventh place.

Leslie was a member of the USA team competing at the 1991 World University Games held in Sheffield, England. Leslie was the second leading scorer on the USA squad, averaging 13.0 points per game, and helped the Tara VanDerveer-coached team to a 7–0 record and the gold medal.

She competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 1992 Jones Cup Team that won the Gold in Taipei for the first time since 1987.

Leslie has made four consecutive Olympic appearances, and has earned four gold medals. She was the second female basketball player ever to earn that many gold medals, after Teresa Edwards. Leslie has also made appearances with the United States national women&#x27;s basketball team where she won gold medals in 1996 and 2000, and has also earned a world championship. Leslie scored 35 points against Japan in the semifinals of the 1996 Olympics to set an American Olympic women&#x27;s scoring record.

Leslie is one of seven USA Basketball&#x27;s three-time Olympians, and one of two players with four gold medals. She led the U.S. team in scoring during the 2004 Olympic Games. During her third Olympic completion, she became the USA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, rebounder, and shot blocker in Olympic competition. Every time she has competed in a major international event, she has compiled double-digit scoring averages. Leslie, at age 20, was also the youngest player to participate at the USA Olympic Trials in 1992.

Leslie has had a rivalry with Lauren Jackson ever since the 2000 Olympics, when the Australian star ripped out Leslie&#x27;s hair extensions during a game.

Leslie had her second child in 2010.

Leslie is a Christian. In an interview, she spoke about her faith, &quot;As a prayerful kid, I was always putting my faith and goals in the Lord&#x27;s name. That was always one of the things that helped me the most. I always wanted to fulfill His purpose. I think that&#x27;s really been the saving grace for me. When you have faith, you have to step out on it [and trust God].&quot;

On February 4, 2020, Leslie was interviewed by Gayle King to talk about her friendship with Kobe Bryant. During the interview, Leslie was asked about Bryant&#x27;s sexual assault case in 2003. Leslie responded that those accusations did not align with the person she knew.

<text>Louisbourg is an unincorporated community and former town in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia.

==History==
The French military founded the Fortress of Louisbourg in 1713 and its fortified seaport on the southwest part of the harbour, naming it in honour of Louis XIV. They did so by transplanting settlers there from the evacuated Terre-Neuve colony. The harbour had been used by European mariners since at least the 1590s, when it was known as English Port and Havre à l&#x27;Anglois, the French settlement that dated from 1713. The settlement was burned the first day the British landed during the Siege of Louisbourg (1745). The French were terrorized and abandoned the Grand Battery, which the British occupied the following day. It was returned to France in 1748 but recaptured by the British in 1758.

After the capture in 1758, its fortifications were demolished in 1760 and the town-site abandoned by British forces in 1768. A small civilian population continued to live there after the military left.

English settlers subsequently built a small fishing village across the harbour from the abandoned site of the fortress. The village grew slowly with additional Loyalists settlers in the 1780s. The harbour grew more accessible with the construction of the second Louisbourg Lighthouse in 1842 on the site of the original French lighthouse destroyed in 1758. A railway first reached Louisbourg in 1877, but it was poorly built and abandoned after a forest fire. However the arrival of Sydney and Louisburg Railway in 1894 brought heavy volumes of winter coal exports to Louisbourg Harbour&#x27;s ice-free waters as a winter coal port. The harbour was used by the Canadian government ship &quot;Montmagny&quot; in 1912 to land bodies from the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. In 1913 the Marconi Company established a transatlantic radio transmitting station here.

Incorporated in 1901, the Town of Louisbourg was disincorporated when all municipal units in Cape Breton County were merged into a single tier regional municipality in 1995.

==Name==
Pronounced &quot;Lewisburg&quot; by its largely English-speaking population, the present community has been identified by slightly different spellings over the years by both locals and visitors. The town was originally spelled Louisburg and several companies, including the Sydney and Louisburg Railway adopted this spelling. On 6 April 1966, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly passed &quot;An Act to Change the Name of the Town of Louisburg&quot; which resulted in the town changing its official name to the original French spelling Louisbourg.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Louisbourg had a population of 825 living in 377 of its 420 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 877. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
Louisbourg&#x27;s economy is dominated by the seasonal tourism industry and seafood processing. The depletion of groundfish stocks has negatively affected local fish processing operations in recent decades.

In the 1960s, Parks Canada completed a partial reconstruction of the Fortress of Louisbourg. Today this National Historic Site of Canada is the town&#x27;s dominant economic engine, employing many residents and attracting thousands of tourists every year. The fortress holds large scale historical reenactments every few years to mark important historical events and attract visitors to the town. The most recent in July 2008, commemorated the 250th anniversary of the first British siege victory over French forces in July 1758. The town&#x27;s more recent history is preserved at the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Museum located in the restored railway station in the centre of town.

Annually, the community hosts the Louisbourg Crab Fest. A large golf course and residential resort is planned near the community; designed by Nick Faldo, the resort was expected to open in 2010 but development stalled in the recession.

Louisbourg is home to the Louisbourg Playhouse, a theatre company operating in an Elizabethan theatre that was used as a prop in the live-action 1994 Disney film &quot;&quot;.

==Climate==

Louisbourg experiences a marine influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). The highest temperature ever recorded in Louisbourg was on 2 September 2010 and 15 July 2013. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 18 January 1982.

==Fictional usage==
Louisbourg (spelled Louisberg) was mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s story &quot;Feathertop&quot;. The town is also a major setting for Thomas H. Raddall&#x27;s 1946 novel &quot;Roger Sudden&quot;. The town &quot;Louisburg&quot; is mentioned in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Evangeline&quot;. The 2011 film &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; begins with a re-enactment scene from the fortress and features the lighthouse in several shots.

<text>Richard Gridley (3 January 1710 – 21 June 1796) was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was a soldier and engineer who served for the British Army during the French and Indian Wars and for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life and military career==
Gridley married Hannah Deming 25 February 1730. They had nine children. He served as a military engineer during the French and Indian Wars from the reduction of Fortress Louisbourg in 1745 to the fall of Quebec. For his services he was awarded a captain&#x27;s commission in 65th, or Shirley&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, a grant of the Magdalen Islands, of land in New Hampshire, and a life annuity. Placed on half-pay in 1749, he was colonel of a Massachusetts provincial regiment during William Johnson&#x27;s 1755 expedition against Fort Saint-Frédéric. In John Winslow&#x27;s failed 1756 expedition against Fort Saint-Frédéric, he served as provincial colonel of artillery and chief engineer. He vehemently supported Winslow&#x27;s resistance against a merger of the regular and provincial forces.

Gridley sided with the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolutionary War and was made Chief Engineer in the New England Provincial Army. He laid out the defenses on Breed&#x27;s Hill and was wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. When the Continental Congress first created a Continental Army under command of George Washington in 1775 Gridley was named to Chief Engineer (artillery). He directed the construction of the fortifications on Dorchester Heights which forced the British to evacuate Boston in March 1776. When Washington moved his army south, Gridley remained as Chief Engineer of the Eastern Department.

==Later life and death==
Gridley retired in 1781 at age 70. He died from blood poisoning induced by cutting dogwood bushes, in Stoughton, Massachusetts, and is buried in Canton, Massachusetts, at the Canton Corner Cemetery. He was buried within a small enclosure near his house in what is now Canton, off Washington Street. In this spot his body rested until 28 October 1876, when a committee disinterred his remains and removed them to his final resting place in the Canton Corner Cemetery. A small queue (braided hair) was removed and pocketed during the exhumation and today is on display at the Canton Historical Society.

==Legacy==
The monument to Gridley at Canton Corner is of Quincy Granite and the dado of Randolph Granite are faced with polished tablets bearing several inscriptions including &quot;I shall fight for justice and my country&quot;, &quot;I love my God, my country, and my neighbor as myself.&quot;, and a quote by General Washington: &quot;I know of no man better fitted to be Chief Engineer than General Gridley.&quot; The whole monument is surmounted by a cannon in the imitation of &quot;Hancock&quot; or &quot;Adams,&quot; - one of the guns Gridley served with his own hands at Bunker Hill.

Gridley is widely to be understood as one of the most distinguished military characters of New England, renowned for personal bravery, skilled artillerist, a scientific engineer, and a contemporary of Prescott and Putnam and Knox, of Warren and Washington.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers considers Gridley &#x27;America&#x27;s First Chief Engineer.

<text>MOOSE, originally an acronym for Man Out Of Space Easiest but later changed to the more professional-sounding Manned Orbital Operations Safety Equipment, was a proposed emergency &quot;bail-out&quot; system capable of bringing a single astronaut safely down from Earth orbit to the planet&#x27;s surface.
The design was proposed by General Electric in the early 1960s. The system was quite compact, weighing and fitting inside a suitcase-sized container. It consisted of a small twin-nozzle rocket motor sufficient to deorbit the astronaut, a PET film bag long with a flexible ablative heat shield on the back, two pressurized canisters to fill it with polyurethane foam, a parachute, radio equipment and a survival kit.

The astronaut would leave the vehicle in a space suit, climb inside the plastic bag, and then fill it with foam. The bag had the shape of a blunt cone, with the astronaut embedded in its base facing the apex of the cone. The rocket pack would protrude from the bag and be used to slow the astronaut&#x27;s orbital speed enough so that he would reenter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and the foam-filled bag would act as insulation during the subsequent aerobraking. Finally, once the astronaut had descended to where air was sufficiently dense, the parachute would automatically deploy and slow the astronaut&#x27;s fall to . The foam heat shield would serve a final role as cushioning when the astronaut touched down and as a flotation device should they land on water. The radio beacon would guide rescuers.

General Electric performed preliminary testing on some of the components of the MOOSE system, including flying samples of heat shield material on a Mercury mission, inflating a foam-filled bag with a human subject embedded inside, and test-dropping dummies and a human subject in MOOSE foam shields short distances. U.S. Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger&#x27;s historic freefall from a balloon at in August 1960 also helped demonstrate the feasibility of such extreme parachuting. However, the MOOSE system was nonetheless always intended as an extreme emergency measure when no other option for returning an astronaut to Earth existed; falling from orbit protected by nothing more than a spacesuit and a bag of foam was unlikely to ever become a particularly safe—or enticing—maneuver.

Neither NASA nor the U.S. Air Force expressed an interest in the MOOSE system, and so by the end of the 1960s the program had been quietly shelved.

<doc id="233528" wikidata="Q182228" url="?curid=233528" title="Brainstem">
<text>The brainstem (or brain stem) is the posterior stalk-like part of the brain that connects the cerebrum with the spinal cord. In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The midbrain is continuous with the thalamus of the diencephalon through the tentorial notch, and sometimes the diencephalon is included in the brainstem.

The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent of the brain&#x27;s total weight. It has the critical roles of regulating heart and respiratory function, helping to control heart rate and breathing rate. It also provides the main motor and sensory nerve supply to the face and neck via the cranial nerves. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem. Other roles include the regulation of the central nervous system and the body&#x27;s sleep cycle. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).

==Structure==
The parts of the brainstem are the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata; the diencephalon is sometimes considered part of the brainstem.

The brainstem extends from just above the tentorial notch superiorly to the first cervical vertebra below the foramen magnum inferiorly.

===Midbrain===

The midbrain is further subdivided into three parts: tectum, tegmentum, and the ventral tegmental area. The tectum forms the ceiling. The tectum comprises the paired structure of the superior and inferior colliculi and is the dorsal covering of the cerebral aqueduct. The inferior colliculus is the principal midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input from several peripheral brainstem nuclei, as well as inputs from the auditory cortex. Its inferior brachium (arm-like process) reaches to the medial geniculate nucleus of the diencephalon. The superior colliculus is positioned above the inferior colliculus, and marks the rostral midbrain. It is involved in the special sense of vision and sends its superior brachium to the lateral geniculate body of the diencephalon.

The tegmentum which forms the floor of the midbrain, is ventral to the cerebral aqueduct. Several nuclei, tracts, and the reticular formation are contained here.

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is composed of paired cerebral peduncles. These transmit axons of upper motor neurons.

====Midbrain nuclei====
The midbrain consists of:
*Periaqueductal gray: The gray matter around the cerebral aqueduct contains neurons involved in the pain desensitization pathway. Neurons synapse here. When stimulated by a signal, the synaptic connections activate neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus. The pathway then projects down into the posterior grey column of the spinal cord, inhibiting pain sensation transmission.
*Oculomotor nerve nucleus: This is the third cranial nerve nucleus.
*Trochlear nerve nucleus: This is the fourth cranial nerve.
*Red nucleus: This is a motor nucleus that sends a descending tract to the lower motor neurons.
*Substantia nigra pars compacta: This is a concentration of neurons in the ventral portion of the midbrain that uses dopamine as its neurotransmitter and is involved in both motor function and emotion. Its dysfunction is implicated in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
*Reticular formation: This is a large area in the midbrain that is involved in various important functions of the midbrain. In particular, it contains lower motor neurons, is involved in the pain desensitization pathway, is involved in the arousal and consciousness systems, and contains the locus coeruleus, which is involved in intensive alertness modulation and in autonomic reflexes.
*Central tegmental tract: Directly anterior to the floor of the fourth ventricle, this is a pathway by which many tracts project up to the cortex and down to the spinal cord.
*Ventral tegmental area: A dopaminergic nucleus, known as group A10 cells is located close to the midline on the floor of the midbrain.
*Rostromedial tegmental nucleus: A GABAergic nucleus located adjacent to the ventral tegmental area.

===Pons===
The pons lies between the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. It is separated from the midbrain by the superior pontine sulcus, and from the medulla by the inferior pontine sulcus. It contains tracts that carry signals from the cerebrum to the medulla and to the cerebellum and also tracts that carry sensory signals to the thalamus. The pons is connected to the cerebellum by the cerebellar peduncles. The pons houses the respiratory pneumotaxic center and apneustic center that make up the pontine respiratory group in the respiratory center. The pons co-ordinates activities of the cerebellar hemispheres.
The pons and medulla oblongata are parts of the hindbrain that form much of the brainstem.

===Medulla oblongata===
The medulla oblongata, often just referred to as the medulla, is the lower half of the brainstem continuous with the spinal cord. Its upper part is continuous with the pons. The medulla contains the cardiac, dorsal and ventral respiratory groups, and vasomotor centres, dealing with heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. Another important medullary structure is the area postrema whose functions include the control of vomiting.

===Pontomedullary junction===
The pons meets the medulla at the pontomedullary junction. This region is supplied by the joining of the basilar, vertebral arteries. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery also joins from which a large number of perforating arteries arise. Lateral spinal arteries also emerge to supply the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata.

===Appearance===
;From the front
In the medial part of the medulla is the anterior median fissure. Moving laterally on each side are the medullary pyramids. The pyramids contain the fibers of the corticospinal tract (also called the pyramidal tract), or the upper motor neuronal axons as they head inferiorly to synapse on lower motor neuronal cell bodies within the anterior grey column of the spinal cord.

The anterolateral sulcus is lateral to the pyramids. Emerging from the anterolateral sulci are the CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) rootlets. Lateral to these rootlets and the anterolateral sulci are the olives. The olives are swellings in the medulla containing underlying inferior nucleary nuclei (containing various nuclei and afferent fibers). Lateral (and dorsal) to the olives are the rootlets for CN IX (glossopharyngeal), CN X (vagus) and CN XI (accessory nerve). The pyramids end at the pontine medulla junction, noted most obviously by the large basal pons. From this junction, CN VI (abducens nerve), CN VII (facial nerve) and CN VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) emerge. At the level of the midpons, CN V (the trigeminal nerve) emerges. Cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve) emerges ventrally from the midbrain, while the CN IV (the trochlear nerve) emerges out from the dorsal aspect of the midbrain.

Between the two pyramids can be seen a decussation of fibers which marks the transition from the medulla to the spinal cord. The medulla is above the decussation and the spinal cord below.

;From behind

The most medial part of the medulla is the posterior median sulcus. Moving laterally on each side is the gracile fasciculus, and lateral to that is the cuneate fasciculus. Superior to each of these, and directly inferior to the obex, are the gracile and cuneate tubercles, respectively. Underlying these are their respective nuclei. The obex marks the end of the fourth ventricle and the beginning of the central canal. The posterior intermediate sulcus separates the gracile fasciculus from the cuneate fasciculus. Lateral to the cuneate fasciculus is the lateral funiculus.

Superior to the obex is the floor of the fourth ventricle. In the floor of the fourth ventricle, various nuclei can be visualized by the small bumps that they make in the overlying tissue. In the midline and directly superior to the obex is the vagal trigone and superior to that it the hypoglossal trigone. Underlying each of these are motor nuclei for the respective cranial nerves. Superior to these trigones are fibers running laterally in both directions. These fibers are known collectively as the striae medullares. Continuing in a rostral direction, the large bumps are called the facial colliculi. Each facial colliculus, contrary to their names, do not contain the facial nerve nuclei. Instead, they have facial nerve axons traversing superficial to underlying abducens (CN VI) nuclei. Lateral to all these bumps previously discussed is an indented line, or sulcus that runs rostrally, and is known as the sulcus limitans. This separates the medial motor neurons from the lateral sensory neurons. Lateral to the sulcus limitans is the area of the vestibular system, which is involved in special sensation. Moving rostrally, the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles are found connecting the midbrain to the cerebellum. Directly rostral to the superior cerebellar peduncle, there is the superior medullary velum and then the two trochlear nerves. This marks the end of the pons as the inferior colliculus is directly rostral and marks the caudal midbrain. Middle cerebellar peduncle is located inferior and lateral to the superior cerebellar peduncle, connecting pons to the cerebellum. Likewise, inferior cerebellar peduncle is found connecting the medulla oblongata to the cerebellum.

===Blood supply===

The main supply of blood to the brainstem is provided by the basilar arteries and the vertebral arteries. It is important to note that there is a bit of variability in how these arteries connect and supply blood to the brain, such as where the arteries fuse or are reinforced. The variability that exists allows for syndromes to be introduced if certain vessels are excluded from where they should normally be. Syndromes can be in fragments or combinations depending on how the vessels are arranged and if the brain is getting adequate blood supply.

===Development===
The human brainstem emerges from two of the three primary brain vesicles formed of the neural tube. The mesencephalon is the second of the three primary vesicles, and does not further differentiate into a secondary brain vesicle. This will become the midbrain. The third primary vesicle, the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) will further differentiate into two secondary vesicles, the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The metencephalon will become the cerebellum and the pons. The more caudal myelencephalon will become the medulla.

==Function==
The brainstem plays important functions in breathing, heart rate, arousal / consciousness, sleep / wake functions and attention / concentration.

There are three main functions of the brainstem:
# The brainstem plays a role in conduction. That is, all information relayed from the body to the cerebrum and cerebellum and vice versa must traverse the brainstem. The ascending pathways coming from the body to the brain are the sensory pathways and include the spinothalamic tract for pain and temperature sensation and the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) including the gracile fasciculus and the cuneate fasciculus for touch, proprioception, and pressure sensation. The facial sensations have similar pathways and will travel in the spinothalamic tract and the DCML. Descending tracts are the axons of upper motor neurons destined to synapse on lower motor neurons in the ventral horn and posterior horn. In addition, there are upper motor neurons that originate in the brainstem&#x27;s vestibular, red, tectal, and reticular nuclei, which also descend and synapse in the spinal cord.
# The cranial nerves III-XII emerge from the brainstem. These cranial nerves supply the face, head, and viscera. (The first two pairs of cranial nerves arise from the cerebrum).
# The brainstem has integrative functions being involved in cardiovascular system control, respiratory control, pain sensitivity control, alertness, awareness, and consciousness. Thus, brainstem damage is a very serious and often life-threatening problem.

===Cranial nerves===

Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves either target or are sourced from the brainstem nuclei. The nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV) are located in the midbrain. The nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) are located in the pons. The nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII) are located in the medulla. The fibers of these cranial nerves exit the brainstem from these nuclei.

==Clinical significance==
Diseases of the brainstem can result in abnormalities in the function of cranial nerves that may lead to visual disturbances, pupil abnormalities, changes in sensation, muscle weakness, hearing problems, vertigo, swallowing and speech difficulty, voice change, and co-ordination problems. Localizing neurological lesions in the brainstem may be very precise, although it relies on a clear understanding on the functions of brainstem anatomical structures and how to test them.

Brainstem stroke syndrome can cause a range of impairments including locked-in syndrome.

Duret haemorrhages are areas of bleeding in the midbrain and upper pons due to a downward traumatic displacement of the brainstem.

Cysts known as syrinxes can affect the brainstem, in a condition, called syringobulbia. These fluid-filled cavities can be congenital, acquired or the result of a tumor.

Criteria for claiming brainstem death in the UK have developed in order to make the decision of when to stop ventilation of somebody who could not otherwise sustain life. These determining factors are that the patient is irreversibly unconscious and incapable of breathing unaided. All other possible causes must be ruled out that might otherwise indicate a temporary condition. The state of irreversible brain damage has to be unequivocal. There are brainstem reflexes that are checked for by two senior doctors so that imaging technology is unnecessary. The absence of the cough and gag reflexes, of the corneal reflex and the vestibulo-ocular reflex need to be established; the pupils of the eyes must be fixed and dilated; there must be an absence of motor response to stimulation and an absence of breathing marked by concentrations of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. All of these tests must be repeated after a certain time before death can be declared.

<doc id="233529" wikidata="Q308442" url="?curid=233529" title="Aftershock">
<text>In seismology, an aftershock is a smaller earthquake that follows a larger earthquake, in the same area of the main shock, caused as the displaced crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock. Large earthquakes can have hundreds to thousands of instrumentally detectable aftershocks, which steadily decrease in magnitude and frequency according to a consistent pattern. In some earthquakes the main rupture happens in two or more steps, resulting in multiple main shocks. These are known as doublet earthquakes, and in general can be distinguished from aftershocks in having similar magnitudes and nearly identical seismic waveforms.

==Distribution of aftershocks==
Most aftershocks are located over the full area of fault rupture and either occur along the fault plane itself or along other faults within the volume affected by the strain associated with the main shock. Typically, aftershocks are found up to a distance equal to the rupture length away from the fault plane.

The pattern of aftershocks helps confirm the size of area that slipped during the main shock. In both the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the aftershock distribution in each case showed that the epicenter (where the rupture initiated) lay to one end of the final area of slip, implying strongly asymmetric rupture propagation.

==Aftershock size and frequency with time==
Aftershocks rates and magnitudes follow several well-established empirical laws.

===Omori&#x27;s law ===
The frequency of aftershocks decreases roughly with the reciprocal of time after the main shock. This empirical relation was first described by Fusakichi Omori in 1894 and is known as Omori&#x27;s law. It is expressed as

: formula_1

where &quot;k&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are constants, which vary between earthquake sequences. A modified version of Omori&#x27;s law, now commonly used, was proposed by Utsu in 1961.

: formula_2

where &quot;p&quot; is a third constant which modifies the decay rate and typically falls in the range 0.7–1.5.

According to these equations, the rate of aftershocks decreases quickly with time. The rate of aftershocks is proportional to the inverse of time since the mainshock and this relationship can be used to estimate the probability of future aftershock occurrence. Thus whatever the probability of an aftershock are on the first day, the second day will have 1/2 the probability of the first day and the tenth day will have approximately 1/10 the probability of the first day (when &quot;p&quot; is equal to 1). These patterns describe only the statistical behavior of aftershocks; the actual times, numbers and locations of the aftershocks are stochastic , while tending to follow these patterns. As this is an empirical law, values of the parameters are obtained by fitting to data after a mainshock has occurred, and they imply no specific physical mechanism in any given case.

The Utsu-Omori law has also been obtained theoretically, as
the solution of a differential equation describing the evolution of the aftershock activity, where the interpretation of the evolution equation is based on the idea of deactivation of the faults in the vicinity of the main shock of the earthquake. Also, previously Utsu-Omori law was obtained from a nucleation process. Results show that the spatial and temporal distribution of aftershocks is separable into a dependence on space and a dependence on time. And more recently, through the application of a fractional solution of the reactive differential equation, a double power law model shows the number density decay in several possible ways, among which is a particular case the Utsu-Omori Law.

===Båth&#x27;s law===
The other main law describing aftershocks is known as Båth&#x27;s Law and this states that the difference in magnitude between a main shock and its largest aftershock is approximately constant, independent of the main shock magnitude, typically 1.1–1.2 on the Moment magnitude scale.

===Gutenberg–Richter law===

Aftershock sequences also typically follow the Gutenberg–Richter law of size scaling, which refers to the relationship between the magnitude and total number of earthquakes in a region in a given time period.

: formula_3

Where:
* formula_4 is the number of events greater or equal to formula_5
* formula_6 is magnitude
* formula_7 and formula_8 are constants
In summary, there are more small aftershocks and fewer large aftershocks.

==Effect of aftershocks==
Aftershocks are dangerous because they are usually unpredictable, can be of a large magnitude, and can collapse buildings that are damaged from the main shock. Bigger earthquakes have more and larger aftershocks and the sequences can last for years or even longer especially when a large event occurs in a seismically quiet area; see, for example, the New Madrid seismic zone, where events still follow Omori&#x27;s law from the main shocks of 1811–1812. An aftershock sequence is deemed to have ended when the rate of seismicity drops back to a background level; i.e., no further decay in the number of events with time can be detected.

Land movement around the New Madrid is reported to be no more than a year, in contrast to the San Andreas Fault which averages up to a year across California. Aftershocks on the San Andreas are now believed to top out at 10 years while earthquakes in New Madrid were considered aftershocks nearly 200 years after the 1812 New Madrid earthquake.

==Foreshocks==

Some scientists have tried to use foreshocks to help predict upcoming earthquakes, having one of their few successes with the 1975 Haicheng earthquake in China. On the East Pacific Rise however, transform faults show quite predictable foreshock behaviour before the main seismic event. Reviews of data of past events and their foreshocks showed that they have a low number of aftershocks and high foreshock rates compared to continental strike-slip faults.

== Modeling ==
Seismologists use tools such as the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence model (ETAS) to study cascading aftershocks and foreshocks.
==Psychology==
Following a large earthquake and aftershocks, many people have reported feeling &quot;phantom earthquakes&quot; when in fact no earthquake was taking place. This condition, known as &quot;earthquake sickness&quot; is thought to be related to motion sickness, and usually goes away as seismic activity tails off.

==NUTS-2 regions==

As a member of the EFTA, Switzerland is included in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). The three NUTS levels are:
* NUTS-1: Switzerland (CH0)
* NUTS-2: 7 Regions
* NUTS-3: 26 Cantons

The seven NUTS-2 regions are the following:
Below the NUTS levels, there are two LAU levels (LAU-1: districts; LAU-2: municipalities).

==Cantons==

The two-letter abbreviations are widely used, e.g. on car license plates and as disambiguator for localities on postal addresses if two localities in different cantons have the same name. They are also used with the prefix &quot;CH-&quot; as ISO 3166-2 codes of Switzerland, e.g. CH-SZ for the canton of Schwyz.

SFSO also uses a numerical code ordering the cantons by their constitutional order (1 to 26).

The FIPS 10-4 region codes of Switzerland were used by the United States government. This standard was withdrawn in 2008.

The NUTS-3 codes are used by the European Union.

==Districts==
Districts are assigned three-digit numerical codes by SFSO.

Districts are used as LAU-1 level.

==Municipalities==
See Community Identification Number#Switzerland

Municipalities are used as LAU-2 level.

==Localities==

<doc id="233539" wikidata="Q17086986" url="?curid=233539" title="List of Puerto Rican rums">
<text>Rum (&quot;ron&quot; in Spanish) production has been an important part of Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy since the 16th century. While sugar cane harvesting has virtually disappeared in Puerto Rico (except for a few isolated farms and agricultural experiments), distilleries around the island still produce large amounts of rum every year. Don Q is the top-selling rum brand on the island, where more than 70% of the rum consumed in the United States is produced.

==Rum production by city==
===Arecibo===
The main rum producing enterprise in Arecibo is Barceló, Marqués Y Co. Its flagship brand was Ron Palo Viejo. Ron Palo Viejo is now owned by Serrallés, whose flagship rum is Don Q.

Rum has been produced in Arecibo since the second half of the 19th century. Roses, García y Co. was bottling their &quot;Ron de la Casa de Roses&quot; as early as 1868. Ron Llave dates from 1891, and by 1893 they were purveyors of rum under license from the Royal house of Spain.

There were several rum producers in Arecibo by the beginning of the 20th century. Most of them merged their distillery operations into a single entity, the Puerto Rico Distilling Co., which was formally incorporated on February 2, 1911. The new company eventually became the principal supplier of partially refined or final product to rum aging, blending and bottling companies in Mayagüez and Bayamón. During Prohibition the company turned into producing denatured alcohol, bay rum (up to 265 different brands of bay rum were eventually produced at the main distilling plant, including the best-selling Alcoholado Superior 70 and Alcoholado Santa Claus) and other industrial products. Rum production returned in 1934, with Ron Candado. In 1935, a joint venture with Florida Cane Products, Inc., spawned a new corporation, Ron Rico, whose flagship product was the Ronrico rum and which had considerable success selling rum in the United States. A new distilling plant was opened in 1942.

The following are rums produced in Arecibo (or in nearby Barceloneta while the holding company was Arecibo-based):
* Ron Pizá
* Ron Llave
* Ron Candado
* Ron Tres Estrellas
* Ron San Isidro
* Ron Cañón
* Ron Portela
* Ron Granado
* Ron Palo Viejo (Produced in Camuy, near Arecibo)

===Bayamón===
* Ron del Barrilito - Edmundo B. Fernandez Inc.

The company producing it was founded by Edmundo Fernandez in the early 19th century. It has produced its rum inside a brick and mortar windmill tower located originally within a sugar cane plantation, the &quot;Hacienda Santa Ana&quot;, now an industrial park in the outskirts of Bayamón. Its yearly production run is a limited one. The company is known for a rum liqueur which is made with honey. The company was sold and recapitalized by a partnership led by a member of the Bacardi family including other local investors. It has diversified its product to include premium aged rums.

===Cataño===
* Bacardi is produced in Cataño near San Juan. It is owned by the Bacardi family who are originally from Cuba.

===Cidra===
In 2014 it was announced that CC1 Industries Inc. would be constructing a new rum distillery Club Caribe Distillers in Cidra, Puerto Rico. This was the location of a pharmaceutical plant owned by GlaxoSmithKline which had closed. The new distillery however included a hospitality center and function hall contributing to local tourism. CC1 Industries Inc. is affiliated with Florida Caribbean Distillers which is based in Florida. The distillery was completed and ran its first distillation run in September 2018.
===Jayuya===
* PitoRico - Destilería Cruz Ron Artesanal Puertorriqueño

The word &quot;pitorro&quot; is something deeply engrained into the collective consciousness of Puerto Ricans. For decades, the production of this rum has been deemed clandestine by the authorities, simply because it did not pay taxes. Destilería Cruz is a company founded by José Luis Cruz and produces PitoRico in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. Mr. Cruz, a native of Jayuya, remembers fondly how his uncle and other family members would skillfully brew the pitorro, especially during the Christmas season. The drink is made in various fruit flavor, including passion fruit, coconut, anise, and tamarind.

===Mayagüez===
The city of Mayagüez had various rum producing companies, some of which were contractors for United States- and Bahamian-based public and private brands. The most successful was José González Clemente y Co. (JGC); other companies were: Ron Oro Nativo (RON, whose parent company was Seagram), Alfredo Vega Toro y Co. (AVT), Baltasar Cruz y Co. (BC), Luis García y Co. (LG), Julio Maldonado y Co. (JM), the Mayagüez Rum Company (MRC), and &quot;Primitivo Grau y Co (PG). Among the brands produced in Mayagüez were (bottler in parentheses):
* Christopher Columbus Rum (RON, credited as being bottled by the Christopher Columbus Rum Co.)
* Government House Rum (MRC) This was originally produced in the United States Virgin Islands.
* Myers&#x27;s Rum - Jamaican bulk heavy dark rum bottled once in Mayagüez by JGC, later bottled by Destilería Serrallés, Inc. in Ponce
* Reserva Especial (RON)
* Ron 738 (LG)
* Ron Delicias (JM)
* Ron El Campesino (JM)
* Ron El Invencible (BC)
* Ron Imporico (JCG) - an imitator of Ronrico
* Ron Latino (AVT)
* Ron Mister Kuba (JM)
* Ron Oro Nativo (RON)
* Ron Patria y Cuna (JGC)
* Ron Rey de Copas (BC)
* Ron Superior Escudo (BC) - an imitator of Ron Superior; use of the name was discontinued due to an injunction by JGC
* Ron Superior Puerto Rico (JGC) - the best known brand, which lasted from 1909 until the company&#x27;s closing in 1980.
* Ron Caneca (PG) - Known to this day for the flask-shaped bottle. Now produced organically by descendants of Primitivo Grau.
* Ron Toro Negro (LG)
* Ron Yagüez (LG)
Samples of all these brands or their labels are kept as part of the historical collection of the Castillo Serrallés in Ponce.

Since 2009 The only distillery operating in Mayaguez is Destileria Coqui producing: Pitorro®, Ron Coquí, Carjakers Handcrafted Rum, Rincon Rum.

Destileria Coqui Inc established a new rum distillery in Mayagüez in 2009, named Destilería Coquí;. The Destilería&#x27;s main product is an artisan rum called &quot;Pitorro&quot;, analogous to the name in common use to describe Puerto Rican moonshine rum.

===Ponce===
* Don Q (Serrallés) - Puerto Rico&#x27;s top-selling rum
* Blackbeard Spiced Rum (Serrallés)
* Boca Chica Rum - Boca Chica Distilling Company
* Caliche Rum (Serrallés)

The main rum-producing enterprise in Ponce is Destilería Serrallés, Inc., which has been producing rum in site since 1865. Its flagship brand, Ron Don Q (short for Don Quijote, the favorite character of one of the Serrallés family heirs) dates from 1932. Don Q is Puerto Rico&#x27;s top-selling rum.

===San Juan===
* Scryer Rum - small-batch pot-distilled, premium rum aged in Old San Juan, PR

===Vieques===
* Crab Island Rum - small-batch column distilled, Handcrafted artisanal rum from molasses. Produced by Laboratorio Clandestino Viequense inc. in the island of Vieques, south east Puerto Rico mainland.Founded by Ivan Torres Ortiz in 2015.

=== &quot;Pitorro&quot; (also known as &quot;ron caña&quot;) ===
In addition to the brands mentioned above, illegal makers of &quot;moonshine&quot; rum, nicknamed &quot;cañita&quot; (not to be confused with the current &quot;legal&quot; brand, which merely adopted the popular term, and which had a precursor in the late 1930s) or &quot;pitorro&quot; rum, tend to operate in Puerto Rico, particularly around the Christmas season. The word &quot;pitorro&quot; is actually a corruption of the word &quot;pintorro&quot;, an Andalusian term used to depict inferior-quality wine or rum that had a weak color (hence the name). Clandestine rum operations are rather uncommon nowadays in Puerto Rico, given the fact that sugar cane production has dwindled in Puerto Rico since the closing of government-owned &quot;centrales&quot; or mills. Nevertheless, authorities confiscate many &quot;cañita&quot;/&quot;pitorro&quot; rum productions every year. A town renowned for its &quot;pitorro&quot; production is Añasco, given its proximity to Mayagüez (rum production talent and recipes) and its former (and current, in some areas) harvesting of sugar cane.

Pitorro is also a term given to homemade flavored rum, prepared by adding various fruits spices and/or flavorings to ferment over a period of time. A particularly favored variety made with quenepas called &quot;Bilí&quot; is made in Vieques.

==Miscellaneous rum production notes==
* Club Caribe - (Company: Club Caribe LLC, Cidra, Puerto Rico) created to offset the losses from Captain Morgan moving to the Virgin Islands

<text>Jostein Gaarder (; born 8 August 1952) is a Norwegian intellectual and author of several novels, short stories, and children&#x27;s books. Gaarder often writes from the perspective of children, exploring their sense of wonder about the world. He often utilizes metafiction in his works and constructs stories within stories. His best known work is the novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy&quot; (1991). It has been translated into 60 languages; there are over 40 million copies in print.

==Early life==

Gaarder attended Oslo Cathedral School and the University of Oslo, where he studied Scandinavian languages and theology. After graduation in 1976, he was a high school teacher in Bergen, Norway, prior to his literary career.

In 1997, Gaarder and Siri Dannevig established the Sophie Prize. It was an environmental development prize of (USD 100,000 = 77,000 €), awarded annually until 2013, when it was announced that it would no longer be awarded due to lack of funds. It was named after the novel.

Through the Sophie Prize, Gaarder contributed over $1.5 million to worthy environmental causes. The final Sophie Prize was awarded in October 2013 to Bill McKibben.

==Political advocacy and religious controversy==

Jostein Gaarder is active politically. The focus of his concern is the plight of Palestinian refugees, and he has vehemently criticized the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. In August 2006, Gaarder wrote a controversial op-ed titled &quot;God&#x27;s Chosen People&quot; that was published in the largest daily newspaper in Norway, &quot;Aftenposten&quot;. Gaarder wrote it in response to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. He argued in favor of &quot;recognizing the State of Israel of 1948, but not the one of 1967&quot;.

&quot;God&#x27;s Chosen People&quot; had a broader scope than conflicting territorial claims. Gaarder described Judaism as &quot;an archaic national and warlike religion&quot;, contrasting it with the Christian idea that the &quot;Kingdom of God is compassion and forgiveness&quot;. Gaarder disputed allegations of anti-Semitism.

<text>The canton of Zug or Zoug (, , ; ; ; ) is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland. It is located in central Switzerland and its capital is Zug. At the canton is one of the smallest of the Swiss cantons in terms of area. It is not subdivided into districts, but eleven municipalities.

== History ==

The first trace of a settlement in the canton dates from approximately 14,000 BC, with additional finds from the Paleolithic (12,400-9250 BC) and the Mesolithic (9250-5500 BC). During the Neolithic (5500-2200 BC) and the Bronze Age (2200-850 BC) about 50 different stilt house villages were built in 33 locations around Lake Zug. Some of these sites are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps. Prehistoric sites around the lake and throughout the canton include examples from the Neolithic Egolzwiler, Cortaillod, Pfyn and Horgen cultures. Traces of the later Neolithic Bell Beaker and Corded Ware cultures as well as the early Bronze Age are less common. There were several large later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements. On the Baarburg the ruins of an Iron Age celtic prince&#x27;s castle from about 500 BC contained Greek ceramics and etruscan metal vessels. Some of the names around the canton are possibly celtic in origin including Baar, Cham, Lorze, Sihl and possibly Reuss.

After the Roman conquest the area was home to as many as ten Villa rustica. In addition to a number of coin hoards, graves and ruins, a collection of 23 terracotta religious statues were discovered in Cham. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the area was incorporated into the Frankish Empire in 536/37. During the Early Middle Ages a number of parish churches were founded in the canton as the population grew. A settlement existed near the present location of Zug Castle and Cham by the 9th or 10th century. The city of Zug was founded in the first half of the 13th century.

Near the southern shore of the lake of Ägeri is the site of the Battle of Morgarten, won by the Swiss in 1315. In this battle the powerful Habsburgs were defeated. The hamlet of Morgarten (Municipality of Oberägeri) borders the canton of Schwyz and is home to the Morgarten Battle Monument (). The actual battlefield is just across the border in the hamlet of Schornen (Municipality of Sattel) in the canton of Schwyz.

During the 1798 French Invasion its inhabitants opposed the invading army until the collapse of the Ancien Regime. The canton formed part of the &quot;Tellgau&quot; and was later a district of the large canton of the &quot;Waldstätten&quot; in the French supported Helvetic Republic. The canton of Waldstätten also included what are today the cantons of Schwyz, Lucerne, Unterwalden and Uri.
In 1803, under the Act of Mediation, the canton of Zug regained its independence as a separate canton. The constitution of 1814 abolished public assemblies (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;), which had existed in the canton since 1376. In 1845 the canton of Zug became a member of the Sonderbund and participated in the war of 1847 which was lost to the Swiss Confederation. In 1848 the remaining functions of the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; were abolished. Both in 1848 and in 1874 the canton voted against the federal constitutions. The constitution of 1876 was amended in 1881, and replaced by a new one in 1894.

== Geography ==

The canton of Zug is located in central Switzerland and covers an area of . The cantons of Lucerne and Aargau lie to its west. To the north, the canton is bounded by the canton of Zürich, whereas to the east and south lies the canton of Schwyz.

Most of the land is considered productive. The Lake of Zug () and Lake Ägeri () make up a considerable part of the canton&#x27;s area. Lake Ägeri is wholly within the canton, whereas the Zugersee is shared with the cantons of Lucerne and Schwyz.

The canton is located on a hilly plateau. The Höhronen (near &quot;Höhboden&quot;) is the highest elevation (1,229 m) in the east of the canton. The Zugerberg (1,039 m) in the south is another notable elevation. It connects in the south with the Rossberg massif which rises to the Wildspitz (1,583 m) east of the Zugersee. This massif separates the Zugersee from the basin and Ägerisee. It also separates the hilly district of Menzingen from the Zugersee.

The river Lorze is the principal drainage in the canton. It originates in Ägerisee, from where it flows northward through moraine deposits in a deep gorge with fine stalactite caverns. The river eventually enters the Zugersee, before flowing back out of the lake through the town of Cham, and joining the Reuss in the northern corner of the canton. The Reuss forms the boundary of the canton in the north west.

Canton Zug&#x27;s borders were mainly established by nature itself: the rivers Sihl and Biber, and the Höhronen ridge in the east; the Rossberg mountain in the south, and the Rooterberg mountain, and the Reuss in the west. Only the 87.5 km-long border between the cantons of Zürich and Zug is not naturally defined. With its 1580 m peak, the Wildspitz is the highest point in the canton. The lowest point in the north of the canton is at 388 m, at &quot;Rüssspitz&quot; () on the border, the confluence of the rivers Lorzen and Reuss.

===Diverse landscape===
The canton of Zug is multi-faceted, despite its small size. In rough terms, there are two zones, divided by the north-south axis of Lake Zug: the western part with Ennetsee and the plateau of Zug, Steinhausen and Baar; and the eastern part consisting of the hilly and mountainous zone. In the latter is the Zugerberg with the Rossberg mountain chain, the valley of Oberägeri and Unterägeri, with Lake Ägeri, and the mountain ridge of Höhronen and the countryside of Menzingen and Neuheim.

The power of the glaciers in the ice ages is impressively shown in the lateral moraines of the mountains Walchwilerberg and Zugerberg. These are the remaining traces of the Reuss Glacier. The moraine and drumlin landscape of Menzingen and Neuheim are the result of the convergence of the Reuss Glacier and the Linth Glacier. The Swiss geologist Albert Heim (1849–1937) once noted that &quot;this must be the most impressive moraine landscape in Switzerland&quot;. The glaciation of the Zug mountains stopped in around 15,000 BCE.

The Lorze is the only large river flowing wholly within the canton. The Sihl and Reuss both follow cantonal borders. The Lorze flows from Lake Ägeri through the deep valley of the Lorzentobel to Baar and Lake Zug. In Cham, the Lorze leaves Lake Zug and joins the Reuss at the aforementioned Reussspitz.

== Political subdivisions ==

The canton forms a single administrative district, which comprises eleven municipalities. The legislature (&quot;Kantonsrat&quot;) has 80 members. The executive (&quot;Regierungsrat&quot;) has seven members. Members of both governments are elected directly by popular vote. The term of office in both cases is four years. The two members of the Federal Ständerat, as well as the three members of the Federal Nationalrat, are also elected by a popular vote.

===Municipalities===
The eleven municipalities of the canton are: Zug, Oberägeri, Unterägeri, Menzingen, Baar, Cham, Hünenberg, Steinhausen, Risch, Walchwil, Neuheim

== Demographics ==
The population of the canton (as of ) is . , the population included 31,643 foreigners, or about 26% of the total population, up from 15.6% in 1990. The largest foreign population is to be found in the municipality of Walchwil with 33.2% foreign nationals, then Zug (31.7%), Baar (28.1%), Risch (26.3%), and Oberägeri (25.3%). The lowest rate is to be found in Menzingen (18.9%) and Hünenberg (16.5%).

The majority of the population () is Roman Catholic (62%) with a Protestant minority (18%). Until 1814, Zug was in the Diocese of Konstanz, but on the reconstruction of the diocese of Basel in 1828 it was assigned to the latter.

While the majority of the population understands standard German, most residents speak the Swiss German dialect of central Switzerland.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1910–1911) described the economy as follows:
Since 1910 the economy has shifted dramatically in Zug. In 2014, about 1.8% of the workers in Zug work in the primary sector (the total for all of Switzerland is 3.3%) Of these 1.8%, in 2008, nearly two-thirds kept dairy cows. However, its low tax rates and business friendly climate have brought many small and medium-sized businesses in all areas of the economy. There are over 24,300 registered companies and over 70,000 jobs in the canton, with 12,900 of the registered companies based in the city of Zug.

In 2014 the secondary sector employed 22,096 or about 20.5% of the total. Of those in the secondary sector, 28.3% worked in the manufacture of data-processing equipment, electronic and optical products. About a quarter of all secondary sector workers in the canton work in construction, with 19.7% in specialized trades such as electrician or plumber and 7% in construction management or labor. The tertiary sector employed 83,591 or about 77.7% of the total. Of those in the tertiary sector, the largest group of employees (17% of all tertiary sector) work in wholesale business including wholesale pharmaceuticals. The next largest group category is education which makes up 6.22% of the sector. Due to Zug&#x27;s status as a business center and tax haven, 5.74% of the tertiary sector is in management and business consultancy, 4.67% provide information technology services, 4% provide legal and tax consultancy and nearly 4% provide financial services.

In 2016, the town of Zug began accepting digital currency for small payments of municipal fees. Then, in 2021, the canton started accepting bitcoin or Ethereum for personal and company taxes up to CHF100,000. To reduce risk, Zug converts the cryptocurrency into Swiss francs. This is part of a strategy to associate Zug with new technologies.

Zug has also been referred to as the Crypto Valley by Ethereum co-founder Mihai Alisie because of the large number of companies engaged in cryptocurrency in the area. By 2018, a Crypto Valley Association had been formed with Oliver Bussmann, as its president.

At the end of 2019, the following were identified as the largest cryptocurrency companies in Zug: Ethereum ($14.4 billion), Dfinity ($2bn), Polkadot ($1.2bn), Bitmain ($1bn), Libra ($1bn), Tezos ($924m), Cardano ($869m) and Cosmos ($818m). By 2021, the term &#x27;Crypto Valley&#x27; was being used to cover Switzerland and Liechtenstein with 960 companies; Zug accounted for 433 companies, followed by Zurich (178). Eleven companies were described as &#x27;unicorns&#x27; with the largest – Ethereum ($157 billion), Cardano ($41bn) and Polkadot ($29bn), all being based in the canton. By 2024, there were 1,290 cryptocurrency companies in the Crypto Valley; 512 in Zug and 278 in Zurich. The largest companies – Ethereum ($273 billion), Solana ($43 billion), Cardano ($21bn) and Polkadot ($10bn), were all based in the canton. The 50 biggest companies had a valuation of $383 billion.
The canton of Zug has one of the lowest tax rates in Switzerland. Bloomberg L. P. reported that trading houses with ties to Russian oligarchs are peppered all over the low tax canton of Zug. Local officials estimate that there are at least 40 companies connected to Russia that employ about 900 people in the canton. Twenty firms identified as Russian by the canton paid CHF31 million ($33 million) in cantonal and municipal taxes in 2020, but &quot;the true scale of Russian operations in Zug is hard to determine because Swiss registration rules demand limited information from companies looking to do business there,&quot; writes Bloomberg.

== Transport ==
Zug is located on the north side of the transalpine north–south axis via the Thalwil–Arth-Goldau railway, connecting the Gotthard line to Zürich. It is also a major railway junction of the Zug–Lucerne railway and the north–south axis.

The motorway A4 traverses the canton west of the Zugersee.

==Eurovision Song Contest==

Urban Trad participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, where they ended second with the song &quot;Sanomi&quot;, a modern folk song with vocals in an imaginary language. A few months before the contest, the selectors dropped singer Soetkin Collier on the advice of the Belgian security services, who claimed that she&#x27;d had extreme right sympathies in the past. Collier vigorously denied the claims, and later that year after an investigation it was concluded that the accusations were exaggerated and based on outdated information.

As a result of this, two versions of the song exist on record. One was the standard album version (4:08) and another version was released on single and on the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 collaboration album. Often known as the Eurovision edit, it cut down to 3:01 and it had Soetkin Collier&#x27;s vocals removed.

<text>Misiones (, &quot;Missions&quot;) is one of the 23 provinces of Argentina, located in the northeastern corner of the country in the Mesopotamia region. It is surrounded by Paraguay to the northwest, Brazil to the north, east and south, and Corrientes Province of Argentina to the southwest.

This was an early area of Roman Catholic missionary activity by the Jesuits in what was then called the province of Paraguay, beginning in the early 17th century. In 1984, the ruins of four mission sites in Argentina were designated World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

==History==

Indigenous peoples of various tribes lived in the area of the future province for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, the area was occupied by the Kaingang and Xokleng tribes, later followed by the Guarani tribe. The first European to visit the region, Sebastian Cabot, discovered Apipé Falls while navigating the Paraná River in December 1527. In 1541 Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca reached the Iguazú Falls.

In the 17th century, members of the Society of Jesus came to the region as missionaries, initially led by Diego de Torres Bello (1551-1638). From 1609 onwards the Jesuits established a string of Jesuit &quot;Reductions&quot;, most notably that of San Ignacio (founded in 1610). In a few years they set up 30 mission villages. They taught the Guarani western-style agriculture and crafts. Their crafts were sold and traded along the river and they shared in the Reductions&#x27; prosperity.

In 1759 the Portuguese government, at the insistence of its anti-Jesuit Secretary of State, the Marquis de Pombal, ordered all Reductions closed in its territory (which then included much of present-day Misiones Province). The Marquis eventually prevailed in 1773 on Pope Clement XIV to have the Jesuit Order suppressed. With the abandoning of the missions, the prosperous trade surrounding these Reductions quickly vanished. Colonists imposed a brutal plantation economy in the region, forcing the Guarani to act as slave labor.

In 1814, Gervasio Posadas, the Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, declared Misiones annexed to Argentina&#x27;s Corrientes (at this time Argentina was quasi-independent but nominally still a Spanish colony). Argentina did not exert &quot;de facto&quot; control over Misiones, which was claimed by several countries and effectively governed itself. In 1830 Argentine military forces from Corrientes Province took control of Misiones.

In 1838, Paraguay occupied Misiones, claiming the area on the basis that the Misiones population consisted of indigenous Guarani, the major ethnic group of Paraguay. In 1865, Paraguayan forces invaded Misiones again in what became the War of the Triple Alliance (1864–1870). Following the defeat of Paraguay and its peace agreement with Argentina (eventually signed in 1876), Paraguay gave up its claim to the Misiones territory.

Although Argentina had claimed Misiones since 1814, academics tend to interpret Argentine possession of Misiones as beginning with the defeat of Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. John Lynch writes that &quot;the treaty of alliance [i.e. against Paraguay] contained secret clauses providing for the annexation of disputed territory in northern Paraguay by Brazil and regions in the east and west of Paraguay by Argentina [...]. After a long and harrowing war (1865–70), Argentina prised from a prostrate Paraguay territory in Misiones between the Paraná and the Uruguay and other land further west.&quot;
Scobie states that &quot;the political status of Misiones remained vague&quot; and that Argentina gained the region &quot;as a by-product of the Paraguayan war in the 1860s&quot;.

The War of the Triple Alliance left Paraguay much impoverished, and Misiones benefited economically from belonging to Argentina. In 1876 the Argentine President Nicolás Avellaneda, assisted by his close friend, General Pietro Canestro (an Italian nobleman who devoted much of his life and wealth to the achievement and sustainability of the peace in the region), proclaimed the Immigration and Colonization Law. This law fostered the immigration of European colonists
in order to populate the vast unspoiled Argentinian territories.

On 22 December 1881 the national government in Buenos Aires detached the from the province of Corrientes.
Several colonizing companies formed under the Immigration and Colonization Law. One of them, Adolf Schwelm&#x27;s &quot;Eldorado Colonización y Explotación de Bosques Ltda. S.A.&quot;, founded the city of Eldorado in 1919 with a port on the Upper Paraná. Its agricultural colonies and experimental farms, the orange- and grapefruit-tree plantations, and the cultivation of yerba mate, the mills and the dryers for such product are characteristic of this area. Swedish-Argentines became well known for growing yerba mate.

Misiones received many immigrants, mostly from Europe, coming mainly via Southern Brazil. Some came from Buenos Aires, and from Eastern Europe, in particular large numbers of Poles and Ukrainians. Since then, Misiones has continued to benefit economically and has developed politically within Argentina. It has been successfully integrated into the Argentine state. control of the province is not contested. On December 10, 1953, the &quot;National Territory of Misiones&quot; gained provincial status in accordance with Law 14.294, and its constitution was approved on April 21, 1958.

Misiones received more attention from national policy-makers following a 1973 international agreement to construct the Yacyretá hydroelectric dam on a point in the Paraná River shared by Paraguay and Corrientes Province. When the dam became fully operative in the 1990s, the Paraná&#x27;s waters all along the Misiones shores rose. They flooded lands that the dam&#x27;s authorities had failed to clear and condition adequately, resulting in the onset of mosquito-transmitted illnesses, such as leishmaniasis, yellow fever, dengue, and malaria. The entire Misiones shores along the Paraná River is now confined by two dams, one of them Yaciretá, downstream of the river, and the other Itaipú, located in Brazil and Paraguay, upstream of the river and north of Puerto Iguazú. Argentina was pursuing an agreement with Paraguay to expand the reservoir works in order to double the facility&#x27;s electricity production.

== Geography ==
Misiones is the second-smallest province after Tucumán.
The Misiones plateau includes a part of Brazil across the border. The rocks contain significant quantities of iron which forms a part of the soil, giving it a reddish color. At the center of the plateau rises the Sierra de Misiones, its highest peak, 843 m, near Bernardo de Irigoyen, in the Cerro Rincón.

The province is embraced by three big rivers including the Paraná, Uruguay and Iguazú. Iguazu Falls are spectacular waterfalls on the Iguazú River in the northwest corner of the province, near the city of Puerto Iguazú. Misiones shares the falls with the Brazilian state of Paraná (in that nation&#x27;s Southern Region). Meanwhile, the international border with Paraguay is close by.

=== Climate ===
The province has a humid subtropical climate characterized by a lack of a dry season and abundant rainfall throughout the year. Under the Köppen climate classification, it is classified as &quot;Cfa&quot;. There are four distinct seasons although winters and autumns are fairly short. The mean annual temperature is around . June–August typically register the coldest days when temperatures can fall below . However, rare incursions of polar air into the province from the south can lead to frost. Summers are hot with temperatures exceeding from December to February. One of the main characteristic is the presence of hills in the central and northern parts of the province leading to lower temperatures as a result of the higher elevation. Average annual rainfall ranges from a low of in the south to in the north. The rainfall pattern in the province has a bimodal distribution with two peaks occurring in Spring and Autumn with winters being the driest. The exceptions are the north and higher altitude areas where precipitation is well distributed throughout the year. Snowfall has occurred at the higher hills. For example, during the winter of 1975, snowfall was observed and accumulated in Bernando de Irigoyen, one of the coldest towns in the province due to its high altitude . Owing to the humid climate and high rainfall, relative humidity is high.

The vegetation is the so-called &quot;&quot;. Part of it has been transformed by mankind to implant cultures and ranching. The original biome is protected in Iguazú National Park, part of the Alto Paraná Atlantic forests, in turn part of the Atlantic Forest biome.

== Demographics ==

There are 1,280,960 people living in Misiones according to the national census of 2022. A part of the population is descendant of indigenous peoples (especially Guaranis) and also Spanish who reached during the colonization and mixed with natives. Another part of the residents are descendants of European immigrants. Unlike many regions of Argentina, where the immigrants came through Buenos Aires, most of the immigrants who settled in Misiones came through Southern Brazil. The ethnic groups who settled in Misiones after Spaniards are Italians, Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Swiss, Russians, Swedes, Danes and a small number of Arabs, Japanese and, recently, Laotians (in the late 1970s) and Chinese (in the 2000s). From the 1960s, the province has also received immigrants from Brazil (mostly descendants of East Europeans) and Paraguay (mostly descendants both of indigenous peoples and Spaniards).

The literacy rate is 91.4%.

== Economy ==

Misiones&#x27; economy, like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underdeveloped yet fairly well-diversified. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.8 billion (which shall be around US$7.2 billion in 2011, according to Argentina&#x27;s economical growing) or US$4,940 per capita (around US$6,500 in 2011), over 40% below the national average.

Though its rainy, erosion-prone geography discourages intensive crop farming, agriculture makes an important contribution to the province&#x27;s economy, adding about 10% to the total. Misiones&#x27; thick forests have long provided for the ample production of roundwood without excessive impact on its ecosystem. The principal exploited trees are the Paraná pine, Guatambú, Cedar, Petiribí, Incense, Cane water-pipe, Anchico, Eucalyptus and Gueycá.

Misiones&#x27; chief source of agricultural income, however, has long been the cultivation of yerba mate: Misiones is Argentina&#x27;s leading producer (yielding about half a million tons, annually). Tea, citrus fruit and, in minor amounts, tobacco, sugar cane, rice, coffee, cocoa and coconut are also cultivated in Misiones.

Light manufacturing and tourism also contribute to the local economy, each adding about 13% to the total.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Misiones Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Misiones Provincial Police.

== Political division ==
The province is divided in 17 departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;):

==Notable people==
* Clotilde González de Fernández (1880-1935), pioneer of education in Misiones Province

<text>Puntland (, , or &quot;Paese di Punt&quot;), officially the Puntland State of Somalia (, ), is an autonomous territory formed in 1998 that became a federal member state. Puntland is located in the northeastern part of Somalia and its state capital is the city of Garoowe in the Nugal region. The region had a population of 4,334,633 in 2016.

Puntland is bordered by Somaliland to its west, the Gulf of Aden in the north, the Guardafui Channel in the northeast, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, the central Galmudug region in the south, and Ethiopia in the southwest. There are several major geographical apexes in Puntland, including the Cape Guardafui, which forms the tip of the Horn of Africa, Ras Hafun the easternmost place on the entire African continent, and the beginning of the Karkaar mountain range. It also has the northernmost major city in Somalia, Bosaso, located at a line of latitude higher than 11° north.

The name &quot;Puntland&quot; is derived from the Land of Punt mentioned in ancient Egyptian sources, although the exact location of the fabled territory is still a mystery. Many studies suggest that the Land of Punt was located in present-day Somalia, whereas others propose that it was situated elsewhere.

On 31 March 2024, following changes of the constitutional crisis, the government of Puntland stated that it no longer recognizes the authority of the Somali federal government and would no longer participate in Somali federal institutions. Furthermore, it was declared itself an independent state based on Article 4 of the Puntland Constitution that would allow it to &quot;operate as the independent state&quot; until there is a federal government with a constitution agreed upon in a referendum in which Puntland participates.

== History ==
=== Majeerteen and Hobyo Sultanates ===

The Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia) was founded in the mid-18th century. It rose to prominence the following century, under the reign of the resourceful Boqor (King) Osman Mahamuud. Centred in Alula, it controlled much of northern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Boqor Osman was one of the prominent Darood clan chiefs who ruled the ancient towns of Alula, Bargaal, Bosaso and Hafun and subsequently emerged as a powerful traditional elder who fully controlled areas under his rule. The polity maintained a robust trading network, entered into treaties with foreign powers, and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.

The Majeerteen Sultanate was nearly destroyed in the mid-1800s by a power struggle between Boqor Osman and his ambitious cousin, Yusuf Ali Kenadid. After almost five years of battle, the young upstart was finally forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to overpower the local clans and establish the Sultanate of Hobyo in 1878.

In late 1889, Boqor Osman entered into a treaty with Italy, making his realm an Italian protectorate. His rival Sultan Kenadid had signed a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Sultanate the year before. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy&#x27;s support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate. Boqor Osman and Sultan Kenadid also hoped to exploit the conflicting interests among the European imperial powers that were then looking to control the Somali peninsula, so as to avoid direct occupation of their territories by force.

With the gradual extension into northern Somalia of European colonial rule, all three sultanates were annexed to Italian Somaliland in the early 20th century.

===Establishment of Puntland===
Following the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991, a home-grown constitutional conference was held in Garoowe in 1998 over a period of three months. Attended by the area&#x27;s political elite, traditional elders (&quot;Issims&quot;), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous Puntland State of Somalia was established to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with domestic and international partners. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed served as the fledgling state&#x27;s founding president.

As stipulated in Article 1 of the Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic, Puntland is a part of the Federal State of Somalia. As such, the region seeks the unity of Somalis and adheres to a federal system of government. Unlike the republic of Somaliland to its west, Puntland is not trying to obtain international recognition as a separate nation. However, both regions have one thing in common: they base their support upon clan elders and their organizational structure along lines based on clan relationships and kinship. However, a key difference was that Puntland was formed as a descendant-based entity unlike in Somaliland. The state was established as a &quot;homeland&quot; for the Harti community of Northern Somalia, whereby the Majeerten were deemed as the &quot;chief architects&quot; of the entity. Since its establishment in 1998, Puntland has also been in territorial disputes with Somaliland over the Sool, Sanaag and Ayn regions.

The legal structure of Puntland consists of the judiciary, legislative (House of Representatives) and the executive (the President and his nominated Council of Ministries) branches of government. Though relatively peaceful, the region briefly experienced political unrest in 2001 when then President of Puntland, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, one of the founding fathers of the Puntland State and its first president, wanted his term extended. Ahmed and Jama Ali Jama fought for control of the region, with Ahmed emerging victorious the following year. Ahmed served his second term as president until October 2004, when he was elected President of Somalia. He was succeeded in office by Mohamed Hashi, who served until January 2005 when he lost a re-election bid in parliament to General Mohamud Muse Hersi &quot;Adde&quot;.

== Politics ==

Puntland uses a parliamentary system in which the president and the vice president are elected by the unicameral Parliament of Puntland.

=== General Adde Muse administration ===

In March 2005, President Muse began an ambitious plan to build an airport in Puntland&#x27;s commercial capital of Bosaso, a project that is now complete and referred to as Bender Qassim International Airport.

In April 2007, Muse held meetings with Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the crown prince and deputy ruler of Ras al-Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the two leaders signed an agreement on a deal for setting up of a dedicated livestock quarantine facility to facilitate the import of livestock from Somalia to the UAE. In October 2008, Muse also signed a Dh170 million agreement with Dubai&#x27;s Lootah Group to support the construction of an airport, seaport and free zone in the coastal city of Bosaso. Muse indicated that &quot;I believe that when we finish all these projects our people will benefit by getting good health services, education and overall prosperity.&quot;

=== Farole administration ===

In January 2009, Abdirahman Farole was elected the new president of Puntland. Upon assuming office, the Farole administration implemented a number of reforms, particularly in the security and judicial sectors. To bolster the region&#x27;s justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court is also expected to be established within the region&#x27;s existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task.

Fiscally, a transparent, budget-based public finance system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government. In addition, a new regional constitution was drafted and later passed on 15 June 2009, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a multi-party political system to the region for the first time; such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region.

More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government has hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans under way for school and hospital renovations. One of the most significant new reforms enacted by the incumbent Puntland administration is the launching in May 2009 of the Puntland Agency For Social Welfare (PASWE), the first organization of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counselling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (&quot;ulema&quot;), business people, intellectuals and traditional elders.

=== Democratization process ===
On 15 June 2009, the Puntland government passed a new regional draft constitution, representing a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a multi-party political system to the region for the first time.
On 15 April 2012, the Puntland government opened a four-day constitutional convention officially inaugurating the new Constitution of Puntland. Overseen by the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC), the constitution represented the final step in the extant regional democratization process and was scheduled to be followed by the formation of political parties.

On 12 September 2012, the Puntland Electoral Commission announced that the registration process for political parties in Puntland was now open. This came after the passing of the Political Association Law, the Referendum Act, the District Elections Law and the inauguration of the state constitution. They will also be challengers in the next elections, scheduled for January 2014.

On 14 November 2012, President Farole announced the launching of his new political party, Horseed. The association counts over 200 members and represents the incumbent Puntland government, including Vice President Abdisamad Ali Shire and the state Ministers. It is the first prospective party to register for an application with the Transitional Puntland Electoral Commission (TPEC). According to Farole, the general public will be eligible for membership in the organization once it is selected as an official political party. Five other political associations were established the following month, including the Development and Justice Party Horcad launched by an entrepreneur and businessman Omar Ismail Waberi along other politicians, the Union of the People of the Regions or UPR (Ururka Gobolada Umadaha Bahoobey or UGUB), Midnimo, Talowadaag (Consensus-building), and GAHAYR or Golaha Aqoonta iyo Horumarinta ee Asaaska Yoolka Runta (Council of Education and Development towards Founding the True Goal).

=== Dr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali Gaas administration ===

On 8 January 2014, former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali was elected as the 5th President of Puntland overcoming Dr. Farole by a single electoral vote. Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar was concurrently elected Puntland&#x27;s vice president.

=== Deni administration ===
On 8 January 2019 the former Federal Minister for Planning and International Cooperation, Said Abdullahi Deni, was declared the new president. The election was closely contested, going to a third round of voting. Deni defeated former intelligence officer, Asad Osman Diyano. Deni got 35 votes, to Diayno&#x27;s 31 votes.

Deni addressed the lawmakers after being declared the winner. He said he would continue the policies of his predecessor, Abdiweli Gaas. In April 2024, Puntland announced it would operate as an independent state amid a dispute over Somali constitutional changes.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Regions ===
As stipulated in Article 3 of the &quot;Transitional Constitution of the Puntland Regional Government&quot; of 2001, Puntland consists of the following claimed regions:
=== Redistricting and border disputes ===

In January 2009, the short-lived quasi-state of Maakhir was officially incorporated into Puntland.

Control of the western Sool, Sanaag and Ayn (SSC) provinces is disputed with Somaliland.

On 8 April 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region named Gardafuul. Carved out of the Bari region, it consists of three districts and has its capital at Aluula. Prior to naming this new region, the previous government of Puntland created three regions, all carved out of the existing regions: Karkaar was carved out of Bari, Haylaan out of Sanaag, and Ayn out of Togdheer region.

In the south, according to the federal government of Somalia and CIA, the southern part of Mudug is part of Galmudug.
== Geography ==

Puntland is geographically situated in the northeastern portion of Somalia. It is bordered by Somaliland to its west, the Gulf of Aden in the north, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and Ethiopia in the southwest. Puntland occupies a total land area of or roughly one-third of Somalia&#x27;s geographical area. Mountains include Golis Mountains, Galgala, and Al Madow.

===Climate===
The region is semi-arid, with a warm climate and average daily temperatures ranging from to . These climatic conditions favor pastoralism as the most effective use of land in most parts of the region. Grazing lands include the Hawd region in the high plateau to the west of the Mudug and Sool regions, into the lush green land of Sanaag and into Ethiopia and the low Nugaal valley. Mild temperatures, by contrast, are experienced only along the high mountain ranges of Bari.

Rainfall is sparse and variable, with no single area receiving more than of rain annually. Nomads primarily rely on wells as a source of water rather than surface water. There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. Puntland&#x27;s seasons are:

* &quot;Jilal&quot; – from January to March; the harshest dry season of the year
* &quot;Gu&quot; – from April to June; the main rainy season
* &quot;Xagaa&quot; – from July to September; the second dry season
* &quot;Deyr&quot; – from October to December; the shorter and less reliable rainy season

== Education ==
Following the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia, numerous problems arose with regard to access to education in rural areas and along gender lines, quality of educational provisions, responsiveness of school curricula, educational standards and controls, management and planning capacity, and financing. To address these concerns, the Puntland government is in the process of developing an educational policy to guide the region&#x27;s scholastic process as it embarks on the path of reconstruction and economic development. The latter includes a gender sensitive national education policy compliant with world standards, such as those outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Examples of this and other educational measures at work are the government&#x27;s enactment of legislation aimed at securing the educational interests of girls, promoting the growth of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) program designed to reach parents and care-givers in their homes as well as in the ECD centers for 0- to 5-year-old children, and introducing incentive packages to encourage teachers to work in remote rural areas. Puntland&#x27;s education system is considered the most progressive, and is attempting to close the gender gap so that more females will be able to attend school. Other regions are following Puntland&#x27;s lead in that regard.

Within the Puntland government, the Ministry of Education is responsible for developing and managing the region&#x27;s educational needs. It is headed by the Minister Mohamud Bile Dubbe, under whom a Vice Minister and Director General help oversee a Post-Primary Education Division (PPED) and a Basic Education Directorate (BED), among other boards.
The educational system of Puntland comprises two years of Early Childhood Development (ECD), eight years of primary education (four years of lower primary and four years of upper primary) and four years of secondary education. Tertiary education comprises an average of four years, with the region currently counting seven major universities: Puntland State University in Garowe, Puntland State University in Galkayo, Bosaso College in Bosaso, East Somalia University in Qardho, Mogadishu University (Puntland branch) in Bosaso, Maakhir University in Badhan, Sanaag, and Nugaal University in Las Anod. East Africa University also has six branches in Puntland, with campuses in Bosaso, Erigavo, Galdogob, Galkayo, Garowe and Qardho. Thus, it is a 2-4-4-4 system. Puntland&#x27;s Ministry of Education also recognizes non-formal education (NFE) and technical/vocational education and training (TVET) as integral parts of the region&#x27;s educational system.

From 2005/2006 to 2006/2007, there was a significant increase in the number of schools in Puntland, up 137 institutions from just one year prior. During the same period, the number of classes in the region increased by 504, with 762 more teachers also offering their services. Total student enrollment increased by 27% over the previous year, with girls lagging only slightly behind boys in attendance in most regions. The highest class enrollment was observed in the northernmost Bari region, and the lowest was observed in the under-populated Ayn region. The distribution of classrooms was almost evenly split between urban and rural areas, with marginally more pupils attending and instructors teaching classes in urban areas.

Following the COVID-19 crisis, the Government of Puntland launched the Learning Passport, a digital remote learning platform where children can access educational content both online and offline from their homes. The Learning Passport is a ground-breaking partnership between UNICEF, Microsoft and the University of Cambridge.

== Demographics and religion ==
As of 2016, the population of Puntland is estimated at 4,334,633 residents, 39% of whom are nomads. The region is primarily inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the Darod especially well-represented. There are also a number of Mehri residents.

Currently, 31% of the region&#x27;s residents live in the fast-growing towns of Bosaso, Gardo, Las Anod, Buuhoodle, Badhan, Galdogob, Garowe and Galkayo. Approximately 70% of the population is also below the age of 30.

The population density in Puntland is estimated at .

As with the rest of Somalia, Islam is the main religion of the Puntland region.
== Transport ==
Municipal bus services operate in Bosaso, Garowe, Las Anod, Galkayo and Qardho. Shuttle services between the region&#x27;s major towns and adjacent hamlets are also available via different types of vehicles, such as 4 wheel drives and light goods vehicles (LGV). As of May 2015, over 70,000 vehicles are registered with the Puntland Ministry of Works and Transport.
Puntland is traversed by a north–south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of Somalia, such as Garowe, Bosaso and Galkayo, with towns in the south. In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority completed rehabilitation work on the central artery linking Garowe with Galkayo. The transportation body also started an upgrade and repair project in June 2012 on the large thoroughfare between the regional capital and Bosaso. Additionally, renovations began in October 2012 on the freeway linking Bosaso with Qardho. Plans are also in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway.
Bosaso has a major seaport, which was constructed during the mid-1980s for annual livestock shipments to the Middle East. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched, with KMC contracted to upgrade the harbor. The initiative&#x27;s first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port&#x27;s adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships. In 2012, a team of engineers was also enlisted by the Puntland authorities to assess the ongoing renovations taking place at the Las Khorey port. According to the Minister of Ports, Said Mohamed Rage, the Puntland government intends to launch more such development projects in Las Khorey.

Local airlines offer flights to various domestic and international locations, such as Djibouti, Addis Ababa, Dubai and Jeddah; they also provide flights for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. The most prominent airlines in Puntland are Jubba Airways, Osob Air and Daallo Airlines, which operate from Bender Qassim International Airport in Bosaso and Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport (formerly Galkayo Airport) in Galkayo, among other places. In late September 2013, a launching ceremony of a tender process for the Bosaso airport&#x27;s renovations was held at the facility. The renovations will include the extension of the airport&#x27;s gravel runway from 1,800 m to 2,650 m. The runway&#x27;s width will also be widened from 30 m to 45 m, and feature 7.5 m gravel shoulders on both sides. According to Puntland Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation Abdiqani Gelle, the Puntland government plans to carry out similar upgrades at the Garowe International Airport in Garowe, the Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport in Galkayo, and the Qardho Airport in Qardho.

== Military ==
The Puntland Security Force (PSF) is the armed force of the autonomous Puntland region. Commanders and senior officials of the military are appointed by a qualified panel approved by the Council of Ministers. The Puntland security apparatus also has an independent military judiciary.

The PSF includes the Puntland Dervish Force (PDF), its official paramilitary division. It operates its own police force, which includes a Special Protection Unit.

The Puntland Intelligence Agency (PIA) is the intelligence bureau of Puntland&#x27;s military. It was established in 2001 as the &quot;Puntland Intelligence Service&quot; during the rule of President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, with help from the United States.

The Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) is a locally recruited, professional maritime security force. It is primarily aimed at preventing, detecting and eradicating piracy, illegal fishing, and other illicit activity off of the coast of Somalia, and at generally safeguarding the nation&#x27;s marine resources. In addition, the Force provides civic support, including repairing wells, rehabilitating hospitals and clinics, and refurbishing roads, airports and other infrastructure. It also offers skills training programs to local communities.

== Economy ==

Puntland has of coastline, which is abundant with fish and other natural marine resources. Additional economic products and activities of the region include livestock, frankincense, myrrh, gum arabic, manufacturing and agriculture. Agricultural products such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, lemons, sugarcanes, and peanuts are grown on plantations around the state.

Food items and consumer goods imported via Berbera, Somaliland sell more cheaply compared to those imported via Bosaso. Therefore, in exchange live animals originating from Puntland are exported via Berbera. The key trading centres in Puntland are centred in Bosaso and Galkayo. However, other towns such as Qardho and Garowe act as second-grade market places.

Income is generated through the following industries: livestock, fishery, frankincense, and petty trading. Animals originating from Puntland are exported via Bosaso. The key trading centres in Puntland are centred in Bosaso and Galkayo. Milk collectors ( aanoley in Somali ) are based in markets in the cities of Qardho, Garowe and Boosaso.

Puntland has the lowest rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, compared to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe this is because of higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty does not appear to be driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland&#x27;s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.
In December 2011, a new commercial market opened in Bosaso&#x27;s northern Dayaha (&quot;Star&quot;) neighborhood, near the seaport. Approximately half a kilometer in size, it was designed to ensure easy vehicle access. The market is the result of careful planning between Puntland government officials and civil society representatives.

Bosaso is also home to Golis Telecom Somalia, the largest telecommunications operator in northeastern Somalia. Founded in 2002 with the objective of supplying the country with GSM mobile services, fixed line and internet services, it has an extensive network that covers all of the nation&#x27;s major cities and more than 40 districts in both Puntland and Somaliland. Additionally, Netco has its headquarters in the city. Other telecommunication firms serving the region include Telcom and NationLink.

In April 2013, the Puntland Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources officially inaugurated a new fish market in Garowe. Constructed in conjunction with the UK authorities and the UNDP, it is part of a larger regional development plan that will see two other similar marketplaces launched within the year in Galkayo and Qardho.

In August 2014, in conjunction with the government of Djibouti and an international construction firm headquartered in China, the Puntland Transport and Seaports Ministry launched a project to establish new seaports in the regional state. The initiative is part of a broader campaign by the Puntland administration to focus on tapping into the region&#x27;s commercial potential through various development projects.

=== Oil exploration ===
In the 2000s, the Puntland government began official negotiations with foreign oil companies over exploration rights in the area. The provincial authorities in October 2005 granted Range Resources a majority stake in two sizable land-based mineral and hydrocarbon exploration licenses, in addition to offshore rights. The onshore Nugaal and Dharoor Valley blocks in question span over , respectively. Two years later, Range Resources obtained a 100% interest in the two blocks and concurrently farmed out 80% of that share to Canmex Minerals.

In January 2007, the Puntland administration, which was then led by President Mohamud Muse Hersi, signed the Puntland Product Sharing Agreement (PSA) with Range Resources Limited and the Canmex Minerals subsidiary Canmex Holdings (Bermuda) II Limited.

Following a change in leadership in 2009, the Puntland government, now led by President Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, sought to renegotiate the profit sharing agreement with Range Resources to ensure more favorable terms for the region. In 2012, the Puntland government gave the green light to the first official oil exploration project in Puntland and Somalia at large.

In 2017, Puntland ministers held a cabinet meeting where they approved an oil exploration deal with Chinese company CCECC, in return for constructing a road connecting Eyl and Garowe as well as renovations and refurbishments to the Abdullahi Yusuf Airport.

<text>Romsdal is a traditional district in the Norwegian county Møre og Romsdal, located between Nordmøre and Sunnmøre. The district of Romsdal comprises Aukra, Fræna, Midsund, Molde, Nesset, Rauma, Sandøy, and Vestnes. It is named after the valley of Romsdalen, which covers part of Rauma.
The largest town is Molde, which is also the seat of Møre og Romsdal County Municipality. Åndalsnes is a town located near the mouth of the river Rauma in the municipality of Rauma. The Rauma Line comes from Dombås and terminates at Åndalsnes.

==Naming==
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Raumsdalr&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of a name &quot;*Raumr&quot;, probably the old (uncompounded) name of Romsdal Fjord, again derived from the name of the river Rauma, i.e. &quot;The Dale of Rauma&quot;. The name &quot;Rauma&quot; is itself a mystery, but a tantalizing clue may be found in the works of the Gothic historian Jordanes. He mentions a tribe called &quot;Raumii&quot;, which might be the origin of both the landscape Romerike (o.no &quot;raumariki&quot;) and the river Rauma.
The Norwegian comedy group KLM (named after the surnames of the three comedians Trond Kirkvaag, Knut Lystad and Lars Mjøen), in their feuilleton series &quot;Brødrene Dal&quot; (&quot;The Brothers Dale&quot; – as in &#x27;valley&#x27;), named their three protagonists after the valleys Gausdal, Romsdal and Brumunddal.

==Geography==
The valley of Romsdalen, through which the Rauma river passes to the Romsdalfjord. It is surrounded by the Romsdalsalpene mountain range. The 1,550 meter tall Romsdalhorn has been compared to the Matterhorn. Trolltindane peaks stands opposite across the Rauma. The North Face of Trollryggen peak (1,740 m), Trollveggen (Troll Wall), is the tallest vertical cliff in Europe. Norway&#x27;s most famous hair-pin road is Trollstigen, or &quot;Troll&#x27;s Trail&quot;, which leads to the south out of Åndalsnes to the Nordalsfjorden and Tafjorden.

The Rauma river originates in Lesjaskogsvatnet, a lake with outlets at both ends, in the adjacent mountain municipality of Lesja. A dam was constructed by the Lesja Iron Works in the 1660s to improve transportation obstructed the Rauma and caused the water to flow both west to the Rauma and eastward into the river Lågen.

==History==

===Legendary history===
According to legend, Romsdal is an eponym after Raum the Old, son of the equally eponymous Nór who appears in &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; as the legendary founder of Norway. Jøtunbjørn the Old was the son of Raum the Old and Bergdis, a giant&#x27;s daughter. He inherited Raumsdal (modern: Romsdal) from his father, and was himself the father of King Raum, who was the father of Hrossbjörn, who was the father of Orm Broken-shell, who was the father of Knatti, who had two sons: Thórolf and Ketill Raum (in one version, Thórolf and Ketill Raum are sons of Orm). According to legend, among Thórolf&#x27;s descendants came some of the first settlers of Iceland.

The Laxdæla saga says that Raumsdal was the home of Ketill Flatnose, a descendant of Ketill Raum. In the 850s, Ketil was a prominent chieftain. He conquered the Hebrides and the Isle of Man. Some sources refer to him as &quot;King of the Sudreys&quot; (Hebrides), but there is little evidence that he himself claimed that title. Harald Fairhair appointed him the ruler of these islands, but he failed to pay tribute to the Norwegian king and was outlawed. He and his family left Norway and fled westwards across the sea, to Scotland, then Ireland, where he married off his daughter, Aud the Deep-Minded, to Olaf the White, king of Dublin. Aud went eventually to Iceland where she began that country&#x27;s shift to Christianity.
===9th century===
Before Harald Fairhair, Romsdal was a petty kingdom. Ragnvald Eysteinsson (&quot;Ragnvald Mørejarl&quot;) was jarl of Møre, which was roughly equivalent to today&#x27;s Møre og Romsdal. He died at the Orkney Islands. He was son of King Eystein &quot;Glumra (the Noisy)&quot; Ivarsson of Oppland, and a contemporary of Harald Fairhair who he supported in the unification process and from whom he received his fiefdom. He is likely to have resided on or nearby the important township of Veøya, Romsdal&#x27;s Viking Age hub for commerce and communication. The legend says Ragnvald was the one to cut the hair of Harald Fairhair after he became king over all of Norway.

Ragnvald Eysteinsson was the father of several sons. With Ragnhild Rolfsdatter, he had the sons: Tore (&quot;Thorir Ragnvaldsson&quot;) who inherited the earldom after his father&#x27;s death and Hrolf Ganger (&quot;Hrólfr Ragnvaldsson&quot;). Although historians are quite divided its accuracy in this regard, the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; claims Hrolf Ganger is identical to Rollo of Normandy ancestor of William I of England. Turf-Einar (&quot;Einarr Ragnvaldsson&quot;), a son by a concubine, was an ancestor of the Norse Earls of Orkney.

===12th century===
In 1122, while staying as a guest at the village of Hustad in Romsdal, King Eystein I was taken ill and died. His body was taken in impressive funeral procession to burial at Nidaros.

At Veøy, an island in the middle of the Romsdalfjord, there had been in time immemorial a religious site. At the close of the 12th century, Veøy gamle kirke, a church dedicated to St. Peter, was constructed over an ancient site of pagan worship.
===17th century===
During the 1600s, Romsdal market (&quot;Romsdalsmarkedet&quot;) was opened as a trading center at Devold on the Rauma river upstream from Åndalsnes. The market was moved from Devold to Veblungsnes in 1820. This was an important outlet for the ironworks at Lesja, providing an outlet for their products as well as a source of supplies. Molde later inherited the role as the principal market town for the region.
A Scottish mercenary force landed in Romsdal at Isfjorden on its way to Sweden. The incursion was stopped at the Battle of Kringen.

In the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the Trondheim region of Norway was ceded to Sweden, down to the north bank of the Romsdalfjord. The Romsdal farmers defied the Swedish taxes and military conscription, and the Swedish governor was forced to send a full company of soldiers, and 50 cavalry besides, to collect taxes. Following the attack on Copenhagen and the city&#x27;s successful defence, and the reconquest by Norwegian forces of Trondheim, the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 restored that province to Norway. The few months of experience with Swedish taxation and conscription left such a bitter taste that it strengthened Norwegian unity and patriotism, making resistance to Swedish invasions of Norway stronger over the next 80 years.

===20th century===
After the World War II German Military invasion of Norway in April 1940, British troops landed in Åndalsnes as a part of a pincer movement to retake the key mid-Norwegian city of Trondheim.

<text>Dormancy is a period in an organism&#x27;s life cycle when growth, development, and (in animals) physical activity are temporarily stopped. This minimizes metabolic activity and therefore helps an organism to conserve energy. Dormancy tends to be closely associated with environmental conditions. Organisms can synchronize entry to a dormant phase with their environment through predictive or consequential means. Predictive dormancy occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase &quot;before&quot; the onset of adverse conditions. For example, photoperiod and decreasing temperature are used by many plants to predict the onset of winter. Consequential dormancy occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase &quot;after&quot; adverse conditions have arisen. This is commonly found in areas with an unpredictable climate. While very sudden changes in conditions may lead to a high mortality rate among animals relying on consequential dormancy, its use can be advantageous, as organisms remain active longer and are therefore able to make greater use of available resources.

== Animals ==
=== Hibernation ===
Hibernation is a mechanism used by many mammals to reduce energy expenditure and survive food shortages over the winter. Hibernation may be predictive or consequential. An animal prepares for hibernation by building up a thick layer of body fat during late summer and autumn that will provide it with energy during the dormant period. During hibernation, the animal undergoes many physiological changes, including decreased heart rate (by as much as 95%) and decreased body temperature. In addition to shivering, some hibernating animals also produce body heat by non-shivering thermogenesis to avoid freezing. Non-shivering thermogenesis is a regulated process in which the proton gradient generated by electron transport in mitochondria is used to produce heat instead of ATP in brown adipose tissue. Animals that hibernate include bats, ground squirrels and other rodents, mouse lemurs, the European hedgehog and other insectivores, monotremes and marsupials. Although hibernation is almost exclusively seen in mammals, some birds, such as the common poorwill, may hibernate.

=== Diapause ===
Diapause is a predictive strategy that is predetermined by an animal&#x27;s genotype. Diapause is common in insects, allowing them to suspend development between autumn and spring, and in mammals such as the roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;, the only ungulate with embryonic diapause), in which a delay in attachment of the embryo to the uterine lining ensures that offspring are born in spring, when conditions are most favorable.

=== Aestivation ===

Aestivation, also spelled &quot;estivation&quot;, is an example of consequential dormancy in response to very hot or dry conditions. It is common in invertebrates such as the garden snail and worm but also occurs in other animals such as lungfish, salamanders, desert tortoises, and crocodiles.

=== Brumation ===
While endotherms and other heterotherms are described scientifically as hibernating, the way ectotherms such as lizards become dormant in cold conditions is very different, and a separate term was coined for it in the 1920s: &quot;brumation&quot;. It differs from hibernation in the metabolic processes involved: energy is stored in glycogen in addition to or in place of fats, and periodic water intake is required.

Reptiles generally begin brumation in late autumn (more specific times depend on the species). They often wake up to drink water and return to &quot;sleep&quot;. They can go for months without food. Reptiles may eat more than usual before the brumation time but eat less or refuse food as the temperature drops. However, they do need to drink water. The brumation period is anywhere from one to eight months depending on the air temperature and the size, age, and health of the reptile. During the first year of life, many small reptiles do not fully brumate, but rather slow down and eat less often. Brumation is triggered by a lack of heat and a decrease in the hours of daylight in winter, similar to hibernation.

== Plants ==
In plant physiology, dormancy is a period of arrested plant growth. It is a survival strategy exhibited by many plant species, which enables them to survive in harsh conditions and climates where part of the year is unsuitable for growth, such as winter or dry seasons.

Many plant species that exhibit dormancy have a biological clock that tells them when to slow activity and to prepare soft tissues for a period of freezing temperatures or water shortage. On the other hand, dormancy can be triggered after a normal growing season by decreasing temperatures, shortened day length, and/or a reduction in rainfall. Chemical treatment on dormant plants has been proven to be an effective method to break dormancy, particularly in woody plants such as grapes, berries, apples, peaches, and kiwis. Specifically, hydrogen cyanamide stimulates cell division and growth in dormant plants, causing buds to break when the plant is on the edge of breaking dormancy. Slight injury of cells may play a role in the mechanism of action. The injury is thought to result in increased permeability of cellular membranes. The injury is associated with the inhibition of catalase, which in turn stimulates the pentose phosphate cycle. Hydrogen cyanamide interacts with the cytokinin metabolic cycle, which results in triggering a new growth cycle. The two adjacent images show two particularly widespread dormancy patterns amongst sympodially growing orchids:

=== Seeds ===
When a mature and viable seed under a favorable condition fails to germinate, it is said to be dormant. Seed dormancy is referred to as embryo dormancy or internal dormancy and is caused by endogenous characteristics of the embryo that prevent germination (Black M, Butler J, Hughes M. 1987). Dormancy should not be confused with seed coat dormancy, external dormancy, or hardheadedness, which is caused by the presence of a hard seed covering or seed coat that prevents water and oxygen from reaching and activating the embryo. It is a physical barrier to germination, not a true form of dormancy (Quinliven, 1971; Quinliven and Nichol, 1971).

Seed dormancy is desired in nature, but the opposite in the agriculture field. This is because agricultural practice desires rapid germination and growth for food whereas in nature, most plants are only capable of germinating once every year, making it favorable for plants to pick a specific time to reproduce. For many plants, it is preferable to reproduce in spring as opposed to fall even when there are similar conditions in terms of light and temperature due to the ensuing winter that follows fall. Many plants and seeds recognize this and enter a dormant period in the fall to stop growing. The grain is a popular example in this aspect, where they would die above ground during the winter, so dormancy is favorable to its seedlings but extensive domestication and crossbreeding has removed most dormancy mechanisms that their ancestors had.

While seed dormancy is linked to many genes, abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone, has been linked as a major influencer to seed dormancy. In a study on rice and tobacco plants, plants defective in zeaxanthin epoxidase gene, which are linked to ABA-synthesis pathway. Seeds with higher ABA content, from over-expressing zeaxanthin epoxidase, led to an increased dormancy period while plants with lower numbers of zeaxanthin epoxidase were shown to have a shorter period of dormancy. A simple diagram can be drawn of ABA inhibits seed germination, while gibberellin (GA, also plant hormone) inhibits ABA production and promotes seed germination.

=== Trees ===
Typically, temperate woody perennial plants require chilling temperatures to overcome winter dormancy (rest). The effect of chilling temperatures depends on species and growth stage (Fuchigami et al. 1987). In some species, rest can be broken within hours at any stage of dormancy, with either chemicals, heat, or freezing temperatures, effective dosages of which would seem to be a function of sublethal stress, which results in stimulation of ethylene production and increased cell membrane permeability.

&quot;Dormancy&quot; is a general term applicable to any instance in which a tissue predisposed to elongate or grow in some other manner does not do so (Nienstaedt 1966). &quot;Quiescence&quot; is dormancy imposed by the external environment. &quot;Correlated inhibition&quot; is a kind of physiological dormancy maintained by agents or conditions originating within the plant, but not within the dormant tissue itself. &quot;Rest&quot; (winter dormancy) is a kind of physiological dormancy maintained by agents or conditions within the organ itself. However, physiological subdivisions of dormancy do not coincide with the morphological dormancy found in white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) and other conifers (Owens et al. 1977). Physiological dormancy often includes early stages of bud-scale initiation before measurable shoot elongation or before flushing. It may also include late leaf initiation after shoot elongation has been completed. In either of those cases, buds that appear to be dormant are nevertheless very active morphologically and physiologically.

Dormancy of various kinds is expressed in white spruce (Romberger 1963). White spruce, like many woody plants in temperate and cooler regions, requires exposure to low temperature for a period of weeks before it can resume normal growth and development. This &quot;chilling requirement&quot; for white spruce is satisfied by uninterrupted exposure to temperatures below 7 °C for 4 to 8 weeks, depending on physiological condition (Nienstaedt 1966, 1967).

Tree species that have well-developed dormancy needs may be tricked to some degree, but not completely. For instance, if a Japanese maple (&quot;Acer palmatum&quot;) is given an &quot;eternal summer&quot; through exposure to additional daylight, it grows continuously for as long as two years. Eventually, however, a temperate-climate plant automatically goes dormant, no matter what environmental conditions it experiences. Deciduous plants lose their leaves; evergreens curtail all new growth. Going through an &quot;eternal summer&quot; and the resultant automatic dormancy is stressful to the plant and usually fatal. The fatality rate increases to 100% if the plant does not receive the necessary period of cold temperatures required to break the dormancy. Most plants require a certain number of hours of &quot;chilling&quot; at temperatures between about 0 °C and 10 °C to be able to break dormancy (Bewley, Black, K.D 1994).

Short photoperiods induce dormancy and permit the formation of needle primordia. Primordia formation requires 8 to 10 weeks and must be followed by 6 weeks of chilling at 2 °C. Bud break occurs promptly if seedlings are then exposed to 16-hour photoperiods at the 25 °C/20 °C temperature regime. The free growth mode, a juvenile characteristic that is lost after 5 years or so, ceases in seedlings experiencing environmental stress (Logan and Pollard 1976, Logan 1977).

==Bacteria==
Many bacteria can survive adverse conditions such as temperature, desiccation, and antibiotics by forming endospores, cysts, or general states of reduced metabolic activity lacking specialized cellular structures. Up to 80% of the bacteria in samples from the wild appear to be metabolically inactive—many of which can be resuscitated. Such dormancy is responsible for the high diversity levels of most natural ecosystems.

Bacteria enter a state of reduced metabolic activity not only during stress, but also when a bacterial population has reached a stable state. Many bacteria are capable of producing proteins called hibernation factors which can bind to and inactivate their ribosomes, pausing protein production, which can take more than 50% of a cell&#x27;s energy usage.

A recent study has characterized the bacterial cytoplasm as a glass forming fluid approaching the liquid-glass transition, such that large cytoplasmic components require the aid of metabolic activity to fluidize the surrounding cytoplasm, allowing them to move through a viscous, glass-like cytoplasm. During dormancy, when such metabolic activities are put on hold, the cytoplasm behaves like a solid glass, &#x27;freezing&#x27; subcellular structures in place and perhaps protecting them, while allowing small molecules like metabolites to move freely through the cell, which may be helpful in cells transitioning out of dormancy.

== Viruses ==

Dormancy, in its rigid definition, does not apply to viruses, as they are not metabolically active. However, some viruses such as poxviruses and picornaviruses, after entering the host, can become latent for long periods of time, or even indefinitely until they are externally activated. Herpesviruses, for example, can become latent after infecting the host, and after years they can activate again if the host is under stress or exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

<text>Bartolomeo Eustachi (27 August 1574), also known as Eustachio or by his Latin name of Bartholomaeus Eustachius (), was an Italian anatomist and one of the founders of the science of human anatomy.

==Biography==
Bartolomeo was born in San Severino in the province of Ancona, where his father, Marinao Eustachius, was a wealthy and prominent physician. Bartolomeo received the required broad humanistic education typical of that time, and then studied medicine at the Archiginnasio della Sapienza in Rome. He was also well versed in Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek, which gave him access to original medical treatises written in those languages. As a physician, Eustachius enjoyed great prestige among the upper classes, having among his patients the Duke of Urbino, the Cardinal della Rovero, and the Duke of Terranova. He became a member of the Medical College of Rome and in 1549 was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the Papal College, the Archiginnasio dell Sapienza. He soon obtained papal dispensation to dissect cadavers from patients from the Santo Spirito Hospital.

During 1562 and 1563 Bartolomeo Eustachio (writing under the Latin surname Eustacius) wrote a remarkable series of scientific works on the anatomy of the kidney, the hearing apparatus, the teeth and their structure, and the circulatory system, including the lower vena cava and its valves (now known as the Eustachian valve). These works were organized and published (illustrated with eight plates) as &quot;Opscula Anatomica&quot; in 1564.

Eustachius was deeply interested in understanding the anatomical structures of the human body through direct observation, instead of accepting the many &quot;a priori&quot; theories current among other physicians. His anatomical investigations into the vena caval Eustachian valve, led him to conclude that its function was to avoid reflux of blood. He also discovered the thoracic canal. Trying to understand how diseases affected body structures, Eustachius made comparative anatomical analysis of healthy and disease-altered organs (pathological anatomy). Working with Pier Matteo Pini, he produced a series of 47 detailed drawings of the studied organs. This series of illustrations, &quot;Tabulae Anatomicae Clariviri&quot;, was published in 1714.

Eustachio extended knowledge of the internal ear by rediscovering and describing correctly the &quot;Eustachian tube&quot; that bears his name. He was the first to describe the internal and anterior muscles of the malleus and the stapedius, and the complicated figure of the cochlea. He was the first to study accurately the anatomy of the teeth, and the phenomena of the first and second dentitions. Eustachius also discovered the adrenal glands (reported in 1563). His greatest work, which he was unable to publish, was his &quot;Anatomical Engravings&quot;. These were completed in 1552, nine years after Vesalius had published his magnum opus, &quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem&quot; in Basel.

Published in 1714 by Giovanni Maria Lancisi at the expense of Pope Clement XI, and again in 1744 by Cajetan Petrioli, and again in 1744 by Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, and subsequently at Bonn in 1790, the engravings show that Eustachius had dissected with the greatest care and diligence, and had taken the utmost pains to give accurate views of the shape, size, and relative position of the organs of the human body.

The first seven plates illustrate the history of the kidneys and some of the facts relating to the structure of the ear. The eighth represents the heart, the ramifications of the vena azygos, and the valve of the vena cava, named after the author. The seven subsequent plates offer different views of the viscera of the chest and abdomen. The seventeenth contains the brain and spinal cord; and the eighteenth more accurate views of the origin, course, and distribution of the nerves than had been given before. Fourteen plates are devoted to the muscles.

Eustachius did not confine his researches to the study of comparative anatomy. He attempted to derive the physiology of organs on the basis of their anatomy. He did not restrict himself to gross anatomy: what was too minute for unassisted vision he inspected by means of glasses (early microscopes). Structure that could not be understood in their pristine state he unfolded by maceration in different fluids, or rendered more distinct by injection and exsiccation.

He was known as a supporter of the 2nd century AD Roman anatomist Galen, entering into a public dispute with the eminent contemporary anatomist, Vesalius. However, both made their anatomic observations from dissection of human cadavers.

Eustachius died in Umbria in 1574, during a trip to meet Cardinal della Rovere.

<doc id="233586" wikidata="Q320561" url="?curid=233586" title="Eustachian tube">
<text>The Eustachian tube (), also called the auditory tube or pharyngotympanic tube, is a tube that links the nasopharynx to the middle ear, of which it is also a part. In adult humans, the Eustachian tube is approximately long and in diameter. It is named after the sixteenth-century Italian anatomist Bartolomeo Eustachi.

In humans and other tetrapods, both the middle ear and the ear canal are normally filled with air. Unlike the air of the ear canal, however, the air of the middle ear is not in direct contact with the atmosphere outside the body; thus, a pressure difference can develop between the atmospheric pressure of the ear canal and the middle ear. Normally, the Eustachian tube is collapsed, but it gapes open with swallowing and with positive pressure, allowing the middle ear&#x27;s pressure to adjust to the atmospheric pressure. When taking off in an aircraft, the ambient air pressure goes from higher (on the ground) to lower (in the sky). The air in the middle ear expands as the plane gains altitude, and pushes its way into the back of the nose and mouth; on the way down, the volume of air in the middle ear shrinks, and a slight vacuum is produced. Active opening of the Eustachian tube (through actions like swallowing or the Valsalva maneuver) is required to equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the ambient atmosphere as the plane descends. A diver also experiences this change in pressure, but with greater rates of pressure change; active opening of the Eustachian tube is required more frequently to equalize pressure as the diver goes deeper, into higher pressure.

==Structure==

The Eustachian tube extends from the anterior wall of the middle ear to the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, approximately at the level of the inferior nasal concha. It consists of a bony part and a cartilaginous part.

===Bony part===
The bony part () nearest to the middle ear is made of bone and is about 12 mm in length. It begins in the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, below the septum canalis musculotubarius, and, gradually narrowing, ends at the angle of junction of the squamous and the petrous parts of the temporal bone, its extremity presenting a jagged margin which serves for the attachment of the cartilaginous part.
The vestibule of the Eustachian tube is known as the &quot;protympanum&quot;, The protympanum is also known as the anterior part of the bony part of the tube.

===Cartilaginous part===
The cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube is about 24 mm in length and is formed of a triangular plate of elastic fibrocartilage, the apex of which is attached to the margin of the medial end of the bony part of the tube, while its base lies directly under the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx, where it forms an elevation, the torus tubarius or cushion, behind the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube.

The upper edge of the cartilage is curled upon itself, being bent laterally so as to present on transverse section the appearance of a hook; a groove or furrow is thus produced, which is open below and laterally, and this part of the canal is completed by fibrous membrane. The cartilage lies in a groove between the petrous part of the temporal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid; this groove ends opposite the middle of the medial pterygoid plate. The cartilaginous and bony portions of the tube are not in the same plane, the former inclining downward a little more than the latter. The diameter of the tube is not uniform throughout, being greatest at the pharyngeal opening, least at the junction of the bony and cartilaginous portions, and again increased toward the tympanic cavity; the narrowest part of the tube is termed the isthmus.

The position and relations of the pharyngeal opening are described with the nasal part of the pharynx. The mucous membrane of the tube is continuous in front with that of the nasal part of the pharynx, and behind with that of the tympanic cavity; it is covered with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia and is thin in the osseous portion, while in the cartilaginous portion it contains many mucous glands and near the pharyngeal orifice a considerable amount of adenoid tissue, which has been named by Gerlach the tube tonsil.

===Muscles===
There are four muscles associated with the function of the Eustachian tube:
* Levator veli palatini (innervated by the vagus nerve)
* Salpingopharyngeus (innervated by the vagus nerve)
* Tensor tympani (innervated by the mandibular nerve of CN V)
* Tensor veli palatini (innervated by the mandibular nerve of CN V)

The tube is opened during swallowing by contraction of the tensor veli palatini and levator veli palatini, muscles of the soft palate. The tensor veli palatini makes the largest contribution to active opening of the tube.

=== New anatomical perspectives ===
Since 2015, two developments have enhanced our understanding of the anatomy of the eustachian tube: Valsalva computerized tomography and endoscopic ear surgery.

# Given the greater access to the ear anatomy using endoscopic methods, it has been suggested that the bony part of the eustachian tube is really the anterior extension of the middle ear cavity, or the &quot;Protympanum&quot;. The term &quot;Eustachian Tube&quot; should be limited to the fibrocartilaginous structure connecting the protympanum to the nasopharynx.
# The Eustachian tube is a saclike irregular structure rather than a tubular structure.
# The ear side of the eustachian tube is by far the narrowest segment, called isthmus, and is probably the site of possible obstructive pathology causing chronic ear disease.

==Development==
The Eustachian tube is derived from the dorsal part of the first pharyngeal pouch and second endodermal pouch, which during embryogenesis forms the tubotympanic recess. The distal part of the tubotympanic sulcus gives rise to the tympanic cavity, while the proximal tubular structure becomes the Eustachian tube. It helps transformation of sound waves.

==Function==

===Pressure equalization===

Under normal circumstances, the human Eustachian tube is closed, but it can open to let a small amount of air through to prevent damage by equalizing pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. Pressure differences cause temporary conductive hearing loss by decreased motion of the tympanic membrane and ossicles of the ear. Various methods of ear clearing such as yawning, swallowing, or chewing gum may be used to intentionally open the tube and equalize pressures. When this happens, humans hear a small popping sound, an event familiar to aircraft passengers, scuba divers, or drivers in mountainous regions. Devices assisting in pressure equalization include an &quot;ad hoc&quot; balloon applied to the nose, creating inflation by positive air pressure.
Some people learn to voluntarily &#x27;click&#x27; their ears, together or separately, performing a pressure equalizing routine by opening their Eustachian tubes when pressure changes are experienced, as in ascending/descending in aircraft, mountain driving, elevator lift/drops, etc. Some are even able to deliberately keep their Eustachian tubes open for a brief period, and even increase or decrease air pressure in the middle ear. The &#x27;clicking&#x27; can actually be heard by putting one&#x27;s ear to another&#x27;s while performing the clicking sound. This voluntary control may be first discovered when yawning or swallowing, or by other means (above). Those who develop this ability may discover that it can be done deliberately without force even when there are no pressure issues involved.

===Mucus drainage===
The Eustachian tube also drains mucus from the middle ear. Upper respiratory tract infections or allergies can cause the Eustachian tube, or the membranes surrounding its opening to become swollen, trapping fluid, which serves as a growth medium for bacteria, causing ear infections. This swelling can be reduced through the use of decongestants such as pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, and phenylephrine. Ear infections are more common in children because the tube is horizontal and shorter, making bacterial entry easier, and it also has a smaller diameter, making the movement of fluid more difficult. In addition, children&#x27;s developing immune systems and poor hygiene habits make them more prone to upper respiratory infections.

==Clinical significance==

Otitis media, or inflammation of the middle ear, commonly affects the Eustachian tube. Children under 7 are more susceptible to this condition, one theory being that this is because the Eustachian tube is shorter and at more of a horizontal angle than in the adult ear. Others argue that susceptibility in this age group is related to immunological factors and not Eustachian tube anatomy.

Barotitis, a form of barotrauma, may occur when there is a substantial difference in air or water pressure between the outer and the middle ear – for example, during a rapid ascent while scuba diving, or during sudden decompression of an aircraft at high altitude.

Some people are born with a dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is much slimmer than usual. The cause may be genetic, but it has also been posited as a condition in which the patient did not fully recover from the effects of pressure on the middle ear during birth (retained birth compression). It is suggested that Eustachian tube dysfunction can result in a large amount of mucus accumulating in the middle ear, often impairing hearing to a degree. This condition is known as otitis media with effusion.

A patulous Eustachian tube is a rare condition in which the Eustachian tube remains intermittently open, causing an echoing sound of the person&#x27;s own heartbeat, breathing, and speech. This may be temporarily relieved by holding the head upside down.

Smoking can also cause damage to the cilia that protect the Eustachian tube from mucus, which can result in the clogging of the tube and a buildup of bacteria in the ear, leading to a middle ear infection.

Recurring and chronic cases of sinus infection can result in Eustachian tube dysfunction caused by excessive mucus production which, in turn, causes obstruction to the openings of the Eustachian tubes.

=== Ventilation tubes ===
In severe cases of childhood middle ear infections and Eustachian tube blockage, ventilation can be provided by a surgical puncturing of the eardrum to permit air equalization, known as myringotomy. The eardrum would normally naturally heal and close the hole, so a tiny plastic rimmed grommet is inserted into the hole to hold it open. This is known as a tympanostomy tube. As a child grows, the tube is eventually naturally expelled by the body. Longer-lasting vent grommets with larger flanges have been researched, but these can lead to permanent perforation of the eardrum.

=== Dilation of the Eustachian tube ===
More recently, dilation of the eustachian tube using balloon catheter has gained attention as a method of treating eustachian tube obstruction. There are two methods of performing this procedure depending on the route of the catheter introduction and the area of the Eustachian tube to be dilated. Dennis Poe popularized the transnasal introduction and the dilation of the nose side of the eustachian tube. Muaaz Tarabichi pioneered the transtympanic (ear) introduction of the balloon catheter and the dilatation of the proximal part (the ear side) of the cartilaginous eustachian tube.

==Other animals==
In the equids (horses) and some rodent-like species such as the desert hyrax, an evagination of the Eustachian tube is known as the guttural pouch and is divided into medial and lateral compartments by the stylohyoid bone of the hyoid apparatus. This is of great importance in equine medicine as the pouches are prone to infections, and, due to their intimate relationship to the cranial nerves (VII, IX, X, XI) and the internal and external carotid artery, various syndromes may arise relating to which is damaged. Epistaxis (nosebleed) is a very common presentation to veterinary surgeons and this may often be fatal unless a balloon catheter can be placed in time to suppress bleeding.

<doc id="233592" wikidata="Q177869" url="?curid=233592" title="Gabriele Falloppio">
<text>Gabriele Falloppio (1522/23 – 9 October 1562) was an Italian priest and anatomist often known by his Latin name Fallopius. He was one of the most important anatomists and physicians of the sixteenth century, giving his name to the fallopian tube.

==Life==

Falloppio grew up in Modena. His father died early but thanks to the support of affluent relatives he enjoyed a thorough humanist education in Modena, learning Latin and Greek and moving in the local circle of humanist scholars. He was for some years in the service of the Church, among others as a kind of warden at Modena&#x27;s cathedral, but soon turned to medicine. In 1544, he performed a public anatomy in Modena. In 1545, at the latest, he began to study medicine at the University of Ferrara, at that time one of the best medical schools in Europe. It was there also that he much later, in 1552, when he was already professor in Padua, received his medical doctorate under the guidance of Antonio Musa Brasavola. He taught on medicinal plants in Ferrara but was not professor of anatomy there, as has sometimes been claimed. He also was never a personal student of Andreas Vesalius as is often falsely maintained (he explicitly called himself a student of Vesalius in the sense only that he had read his works). In 1548, he took the chair of anatomy at the University of Pisa. In 1551, he was invited to occupy the chair of anatomy and surgery at the University of Padua and also lectured on medicinal plants or botany. In Padua, he shared his house over years with the German botanist Melchior Wieland which gave rise to some suspicions about the nature of their relationship and got Falloppia involved in Wieland&#x27;s vitriolic controversy with the irascible botanist Pietro Andrea Mattioli. Falloppia was a very popular teacher and had numerous students. He also ran an extensive medical and surgical practice and took his students with him so they could learn from him. He died in Padua in October 1562, not even 40 years old. His plans for a major illustrated anatomical textbook were thus never realized.

==Contributions==

Falloppio published only one major work during his lifetime, the &quot;Observationes anatomicae&quot;, which first came out in 1561. Here he presented his numerous new anatomical findings, correcting and expanding on the works of Galen and Vesalius. Some of his findings referred to the head and the brain. He added much to what was known before about the internal ear and described in detail the tympanum and its relations to the osseous ring in which it is situated. He also described minutely the circular and oval windows (fenestræ) and their communication with the vestibule and cochlea. He was the first to point out the connection between the mastoid cells and the middle ear. His description of the lacrimal ducts in the eye was a marked advance on those of his predecessors and he also gave a detailed account of the ethmoid bone and its cells in the nose. The aquaeductus Fallopii, the canal through which the facial nerve passes after leaving the auditory nerve, is also named after him. He also described the Fallopian hiatus, an opening in the anterosuperior part of the petrosal bone. 

His contributions to the anatomy of the bones and muscles were very valuable as well. He discovered, among others, the muscle that lifts the upper eyelid. He studied the reproductive organs in both sexes, and gave the first precise description of the uterine tube, which leads from the ovary to the uterus and bears his name to this day. He was the first to describe the ileocecal valve, which prevents a reflux of fecal matter from the colon to the small intestines, and demonstrated its function to his students. He also was the first to identify the vessels in the abdomen which were later called lacteals because of their milky appearance after meals.

His contributions to practical medicine were also important. He was the first to use an aural speculum for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, and his writings on surgical subjects are still of interest. After his death, some of his students published their lectures, in particular, on ulcers, tumors, medical cosmetics, and other surgical topics and on botany and mineral waters. In his lectures, Falloppio also described, around 1555, a linen sheath that previously had been soaked in medicinal substances and then dried and some authors have praised him as the inventor of condom. The sheath was not to be used during intercourse, however. A man who had intercourse with a woman he suspected of being infected with the French disease or syphilis was to put the sheath over the glans penis after intercourse and leave it there for several hours to destroy infectious matter that might have entered the skin. Some authors have taken Falloppio&#x27;s claim seriously - which is clearly phantastical - that he tested this sheath on a thousand or more men. 

Falloppio also lectured extensively on mineral waters and their medicinal qualities and presented the results of his chemical analysis of the waters from various springs by means of distilliation. He argued against &#x27;s theory of fossils, as described as follows in &#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;: 

Falloppio of Padua conceived that petrified shells had been generated by fermentation in the spots where they were found, or that they had in some cases acquired their form from &#x27;the tumultuous movements of terrestrial exhalations.&#x27; Although a celebrated professor of anatomy, he taught that certain tusks of elephants dug up in his time at Puglia were mere earthy concretions, and, consistently with these principles, he even went so far as to consider it not improbable, that the vases of Monte Testaceo at Rome were natural impressions stamped in the soil.
==Legacy==
Various anatomical structures were described by Falloppio, including fallopian tube, Fallopian canal, and Fallopian ligament. 

A genus of about 12 species of flowering plants bears his name (&quot;Fallopia&quot;).

<text>Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia or Ioannis Philippi Ingrassiae (1510–1580) was an Italian physician, student of Vesalius, professor at the University of Naples, &quot;Protomedicus&quot; of Sicily and a major figure in the history of medicine and human anatomy.

==Early life and education==
Ingrassia was born in Regalbuto, Sicily. His family was well-educated and Ingrassia received a classical education that included the study of Latin and Greek. From 1532 to 1537 he attended the University of Padua studying under the famous anatomist Vesalius and leaving with a degree in medicine. He then worked as personal physician to nobleman near Palermo.

==University of Naples==
In 1544 he became professor of anatomy and medicine at the University of Naples. He conducted dissection studies and recorded his findings in the book &quot;In Galeni librum de ossibus doctissima et expectatissima commentaria&quot;, a critical commentary on Galen&#x27;s &quot;De Ossibus&quot; that was published posthumously in 1603. He gave the first distinct account of the true configuration of the sphenoid and the ethmoid bone as well as several other bones of the head, and has the merit of first describing (1546) the third ear bone, the stapes.

His work &quot;De tumoribus praeter naturam&quot; (1553) contains what is probably the first description of scarlet fever: he reported on a disease of children different from measles that caused a red rash all over the body, however he didn&#x27;t mention the common symptom of a sore throat. The book also contains a detailed study of the penis and the mechanism of its erection. In addition, it contains a description of 163 different types of tumors.

==Palermo==
In 1556 he was recruited to Palermo as lecturer of medicine and anatomy, working at the monastery of Saint Domenicus. The following year he was asked by the Sicilian Senate to help the government manage an outbreak of pandemic influenza that arrived in Sicily through Palermo. He proposed the a system for managing contagious fevers would aid in epidemic responses. His fame increased considerably in 1562 when he was able to heal a persistent wound of the Duke of Terranova. In 1563 he became &quot;Protomedicus&quot; (chief medical administrator) of Sicily. In this capacity, he emphasized the continuing education of physicians and insisted that medicine be treated as a scientific discipline that collected objective knowledge to ensure optimal treatments.

He established Sicily&#x27;s first Board of Health and Sanitary Code.

His 1560 work &quot;Trattato assai bello et utile dei doi mostri nati in Palermo in differenti tempi&quot; contains the detailed description of two cases of Siamese twins born in Palermo.

To combat endemic malaria, he ordered the draining of surrounding swamps and instituted isolation hospitals for contagious patients.

He managed the outbreak of the plague in Sicily in 1575/1576 by ordering measures of hygiene and separating suspected, confirmed and convalescing cases in different hospital wards. In his 1576 book &quot;Informatione del pestifero, et contagioso morbo&quot; he described the disease, traced its outbreak in Sicily, and was the first to recommend public health countermeasures.

In 1578 he wrote &quot;Methodus dandi relationes pro mutilatis torquendis aut a tortura exusandi&quot;, an evaluation, from an anatomical standpoint, of the contemporary methods of torture employed by the Roman Inquisition. The work was not published until 1914.

He died in 1580 in Palermo and was buried there in the Church of San Domenico.

<text>Jean François Fernel (Latinized as Ioannes Fernelius; 1497 – 26 April 1558) was a French physician who introduced the term &quot;physiology&quot; to describe the study of the body&#x27;s function. He was the first person to describe the spinal canal. The lunar crater Fernelius is named after him.

Fernel suggested that taste buds are sensitive to fat, an idea which research in the early 21st century proved to be correct.

==Life==
He was born in Montdidier and, after receiving his early education at Clermont, he entered the College of Sainte-Barbe, Paris. At first he devoted himself to mathematical and astronomical studies; but from 1534 he gave himself up entirely to medicine, in which he graduated in 1530. His general erudition, and the skill and success with which he sought to revive the study of the old Greek physicians, gained him a reputation, and ultimately the office of physician to the court. Catherine de&#x27; Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, sought his advice regarding their difficulty in conceiving a child. He practiced with success, and at his death at Paris in 1558 left him a large fortune. His remains were entombed at the Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie.

==Work==

===Astronomy and geodesy===
Fernel&#x27;s &quot;Cosmotheoria&quot; (1528) records a determination (arc measurement) of a degree of arc of the meridian, which he made by counting the revolutions of his carriage wheels on a journey between Paris and Amiens. Using his measurements he calculated the circumference of the earth to within one percent of the correct value. He computated a degree of a meridian would have been long 56,746 toises instead of the 57,024 that were subsequently measured. His works on mathematical and astronomical subjects also include &quot;Monalosphaerium, sive astrolabii genus, generalis horarii structura et usus&quot; (1526), and &quot;De proportionibus&quot; (1528).

===Physiology===
As a physician and professor of medicine at the Collège de Coenouailles for over 20 years, Fernel is credited with the neologism, &quot;physiology&quot;, a discipline which became one of the central topics of education and research in the field of medicine. His early understanding of physiology, especially of the brain, was represented by three statements commonly quoted in physiological history:
*&quot;Anatomy is to physiology as geography is to history; it describes the theatre of events.&quot;
*The brain was &quot;the seat of the mind and its parts; the mind being endowed with numerous faculties, man has rightly been provided with a larger accommodation for it than the other creature possess, and this accommodation is associated with more instruments.&quot;
*&quot;The brain is the citadel and dwelling of the human mind, the abode of thoughts and of the reason, the wellspring and origin of movement and of every sense; it occupies the highest point of the body, looking upwards, nearest to heaven.&quot;
His medical works included &quot;De naturali parte medicinae&quot; (1542), &quot;De vacuandi ratione&quot; (1545), &quot;De abditis rerum causis&quot; (1548) which included a chapter on angelology and demonology. What has been called his &quot;crowning work&quot;, &quot;Universa Medicina&quot;, comprises three parts: the &quot;Physiologia&quot; (developed from the &quot;De naturali parte&quot;), the &quot;Pathologia&quot;, and the &quot;Therapeutice&quot;.

<text>The ruble or rouble (; symbol: [[₽]]; ISO code: RUB) is the currency of the Russian Federation. Banknotes and coins are issued by the Central Bank of Russia, which is Russia&#x27;s monetary authority independent of all other government bodies.

 the ruble was the 17th-, however, following the 2022 sanctions, as of April 2022, the ruble dropped to being the 34th most traded currency in the world. The ruble is subdivided into 100 kopecks which have fallen out of use due to inflation.

The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire, which was replaced by the Soviet ruble during the Soviet Union era. Following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, by 1992, the Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was replaced in the Russian Federation by the Russian ruble (code: RUR) at par. The Russian ruble then further continued to be used in eleven post-Soviet states, forming a &quot;ruble zone&quot; until 1993. The ruble was further redenominated with the new code &quot;RUB&quot; just preceding the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and was exchanged at the rate of 1,000 RUR = 1 RUB.

==History==

===Overview===
The ruble has been used in the Russian territories since the 14th century, and is the second-oldest currency still in circulation, behind sterling. Historically, the grivna, ruble and denga were used across Russian territories as measurements of weight. As a result of monetary reforms by Peter the Great, the ruble became a circulating coin in 1704 just before the establishment of the Russian Empire. It was also the first currency in Europe to be decimalised in 1704, when it was divided into 100 kopecks. The silver ruble was used until 1897 and the gold ruble was used until 1917. 

The Soviet ruble officially replaced the imperial ruble in 1922 and continued to be used until 1993, when it was formally replaced with the Russian ruble in the Russian Federation and by other currencies in other post-Soviet states. The ruble has seen several incarnations and redenominations during its history, the latest of which is the introduction in 1998 of the current Russian ruble (code: RUB) at the rate of 1 RUB = 1,000 RUR.

===Etymology===
According to one version, the word &quot;ruble&quot; is derived from the Russian verb рубить (&quot;rubit&quot;), &quot;to cut, to chop, to hack&quot;, as a ruble was considered a cutout piece of a silver grivna.

Others say the ruble was never part of a grivna but a synonym for it. This is attested in a 13th-century birch bark manuscript from Novgorod, where both ruble and grivna referred to of silver. The casting of these pieces included some sort of cutting (the exact technology is unknown), hence the name from рубить (&quot;rubit&quot;). Another version of the word&#x27;s origin is that it comes from the Russian noun рубец (&quot;rubets&quot;), the seam that is left around a silver bullions after casting: silver was added to the cast in two steps. Therefore, the word &quot;ruble&quot; means &quot;a cast with a seam&quot;. A popular theory deriving the word ruble from &quot;rupee&quot; is probably not correct.

The ruble was the Russian equivalent of the mark, a measurement of weight for silver and gold used in medieval Western Europe. The weight of one &quot;ruble&quot; was equal to the weight of one &quot;grivna&quot;. Since the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod &quot;denga&quot; coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins or even smaller 400 &quot;polushka&quot; coins. Exactly the former coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as &quot;kopek&quot; and was the higher coin until the beginning of the 18th century. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins. Apart from one ruble and one kopek coins other smaller and greater coins existed as well.

Both the spellings &quot;ruble&quot; and &quot;rouble&quot; are used in English, depending on the author&#x27;s native dialect. The earliest use recorded in English is the now completely obsolete &quot;robble&quot;. The form &quot;rouble&quot; is preferred by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and probably derives from the transliteration into French used among the Tsarist aristocracy. It may have been retained in English to avoid confusion with &quot;rubble&quot;. In general, American, and some Canadian, authors tend to use &quot;ruble&quot; while other English-speaking authors use &quot;rouble&quot;. In American English there is a tendency for older sources to use &quot;rouble&quot; and more recent ones to use &quot;ruble&quot;. However, usage is not consistent and major publications are known to use both (though usually preferring one or the other).

The Russian plurals that may be seen on the actual currency are modified according to Russian grammar. Numbers ending in 1 (except for 11) are followed by nominative singular рубль &quot;rubl&quot;, копейка &quot;kopeyka&quot;. Numbers ending in 2, 3 or 4 (except for 12–14) are followed by genitive singular рубля &quot;rublya&quot;, копейки &quot;kopeyki&quot;. Numbers ending in 5–9, 0, or 11–14 are followed by genitive plural рублей &quot;rubley&quot;, копеек &quot;kopeyek&quot;.

In several languages spoken in Russia and the former Soviet Union, the currency name has no etymological relation with &quot;ruble&quot;. Especially in Turkic languages or languages influenced by them, the ruble is often known (also officially) as &quot;som&quot; or &quot;sum&quot; (meaning &quot;pure&quot;), or &quot;manat&quot; (from Russian &quot;moneta&quot;, meaning &quot;coin&quot;). Soviet ruble banknotes had their value printed in the languages of all 15 republics of the Soviet Union.

===Imperial ruble (1704-1922)===

From the 14th to the 17th centuries the ruble was neither a coin nor a currency but rather a unit of weight. The most used currency was a small silver coin called &quot;denga&quot; (pl. &quot;dengi&quot;). There were two variants of the denga, minted in Novgorod and Moscow. The weight of a denga silver coin was unstable and inflating, but by 1535, one Novgorod denga weighed , the Moscow denga being a half that of the Novgorod denga. Thus one &quot;account ruble&quot; consisted of 100 Novgorod or 200 Moscow dengi ( of silver). As the Novgorod denga bore the image of a rider with a spear (), it later has become known as &quot;kopek&quot;. In the 17th century, the weight of a kopek coin reduced to , thus one ruble was equal to of silver.

In 1654–1655 tsar Alexis I tried to carry out a monetary reform and ordered the mintage of silver one ruble coins from imported joachimsthalers and new kopek coins from copper (old silver kopeks were left in circulation). Although around 1 million of such rubles was made, its lower weight (28–32 grams) against the nominal ruble (48 g) led to counterfeiting, speculation and inflation, and after the Copper Riot of 1662 the new monetary system was abandoned in favour of the old one.

In 1704 Peter the Great finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, minting a silver ruble coin of weight and 72% fineness; hence 20.22 g fine silver. The decision to subdivide it primarily into 100 copper kopeks, rather than 200 Muscovite denga, made the Russian ruble the world&#x27;s first decimal currency.

The amount of silver in a ruble varied in the 18th century. Additionally, coins worth over a ruble were minted in gold and platinum. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 &quot;zolotnik&quot; 21 &quot;dolya&quot; (or 4 &quot;zolotnik&quot;, almost exactly equal to 18 grams) of pure silver or 27 &quot;dolya&quot; (almost exactly equal to ) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77 &quot;dolya&quot; (3.451 grams).

On 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161 grams, pegging the gold ruble to the French franc at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2 francs (17.424 &quot;dolya&quot; or 0.77424 g fine gold). This ruble was worth about US$0.5145 in 1914.

With the outbreak of World War I, the gold standard peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from hyperinflation in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary Chervonetz was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922 to 1925.

====Imperial ruble coins====
By the beginning of the 19th century, copper coins were issued for , , 1, 2 and 5 kopeks, with silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 kopeks and 1 ruble and gold 5, although production of the 10 ruble coin ceased in 1806. Silver 20 kopeks were introduced in 1820, followed by copper 10 kopeks minted between 1830 and 1839, and copper 3 kopeks introduced in 1840. Between 1828 and 1845, platinum 3, 6 and 12 rubles were issued. In 1860, silver 15 kopeks were introduced, due to the use of this denomination (equal to 1 złoty) in Poland, whilst, in 1869, gold 3 rubles were introduced.

In 1886, a new gold coinage was introduced consisting of 5 and 10 ruble coins. This was followed by another, in 1897. In addition to smaller 5 and 10 ruble coins, and 15 ruble coins were issued for a single year, as these were equal in size to the previous 5 and 10 ruble coins. The gold coinage was suspended in 1911, with the other denominations produced until the First World War.

The Constantine ruble (Russian: , ) is a rare silver coin of the Russian Empire bearing the profile of Constantine, the brother of emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I. Its manufacture was being prepared at the Saint Petersburg Mint during the brief Interregnum of 1825, but it was never minted in numbers, and never circulated in public. Its existence became known in 1857 in foreign publications.

====Imperial ruble banknotes====

In 1768, during the reign of Catherine the Great, the Russian Assignation Bank was instituted to issue the government paper money. It opened in Saint Petersburg and in Moscow in 1769. 

In 1769, Assignation rubles were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 rubles, with 5 and 10 rubles added in 1787 and 200 rubles in 1819. The value of the Assignation rubles fell relative to the coins until, in 1839, the relationship was fixed at 1 silver ruble = assignat rubles. In 1840, the State Commercial Bank issued 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ruble notes, followed by 50 ruble credit notes of the Custody Treasury and State Loan Bank.

In 1843, the Assignation Bank ceased operations, and &quot;state credit notes&quot; (Russian: , ) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. In 1859 a paper credit ruble was worth about nine-tenths of a silver ruble These circulated, in various types, until the revolution, with 500 ruble notes added in 1898 and 250 and 1,000 ruble notes added in 1917. In 1915, two kinds of small change notes were issued. One, issued by the Treasury, consisted of regular style (if small) notes for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 kopeks. The other consisted of the designs of stamps printed onto card with text and the imperial eagle printed on the reverse. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 kopeks.

In 1917, the Provisional Government issued treasury notes for 20 and 40 rubles. These notes are known as &quot;Kerenki&quot; or &quot;Kerensky rubles&quot;. The provisional government also had 25 and 1,000 ruble state credit notes printed in the United States but most were not issued.

===Soviet ruble - SUR (1922-1992)===
Between 1917 and 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble (ISO 4217 code: SUR) which, issued by the State Bank of the USSR, remained the sole currency of the Soviet Union, until its breakup in 1991. Afterwards, it continued to be used in the 15 Post-Soviet states until it was replaced by new national currencies by the end of 1992, and in the Russian Federation, the Russian ruble was reintroduced by 1992. The Central Bank of Russia responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions on the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the &quot;ruble zone&quot; began with the exchange of banknotes by the Central Bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of 1993. As a result, other countries still in the &quot;ruble zone&quot; were &quot;pushed out&quot;.

===Ruble - RUR (1992–1998)===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet ruble remained the currency of the Russian Federation until 1992. A new set of coins was issued in 1992 and a new set of banknotes was issued in the name of Bank of Russia in 1993. The currency replaced the Soviet ruble at par and was assigned the ISO 4217 code RUR and number 810.

Apart from Russia, the Russian ruble was used in eleven post-Soviet states, forming a &quot;ruble zone&quot; between 1992 and 1993. Russian ruble was used in Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Turkmenistan until 1993, in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan until 1994, and in Tajikistan until 1995.

The ruble&#x27;s exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar depreciated significantly from US$1 = 125 RUR in July 1992 to approximately US$1 = 6,000 RUR when the currency was redenominated in 1998.

====RUR coins====
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation introduced new coins in 1992 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 rubles. The coins depict the double-headed eagle without a crown, sceptre and globus cruciger above the legend &quot;Банк России&quot; (&quot;Bank of Russia&quot;). It is exactly the same eagle that the artist Ivan Bilibin painted after the February Revolution as the coat of arms for the Russian Republic. The 1 and 5-ruble coins were minted in brass-clad steel, the 10 and 20-ruble coins in cupro-nickel, and the 50 and 100-ruble coins were bimetallic (aluminium-bronze and cupro-nickel-zinc). In 1993, aluminium-bronze 50-ruble coins and cupro-nickel-zinc 100-ruble coins were issued, and the material of 10 and 20-ruble coins was changed to nickel-plated steel. In 1995 the material of 50-ruble coins was changed to brass-plated steel, but the coins were minted with the old date 1993. As high inflation persisted, the lowest denominations disappeared from circulation and the other denominations became rarely used.

During this period, the commemorative one-ruble coins were regularly issued continuing the specifications of prior commemorative Soviet rubles (31 mm diameter, 12.8 grams cupronickel). It is nearly identical to those of the 5-Swiss franc coin (31.45 mm, 13.2 g cupronickel), worth approx. €4.39 or US$5.09 as of August 2018. For this reason, there have been several instances of (now worthless) Soviet and Russian ruble coins being used on a large scale to defraud automated vending machines in Switzerland.

====RUR banknotes====
In 1961, new State Treasury notes were introduced for 1, 3 and 5 rubles, along with new State Bank notes worth 10, 25, 50, and 100 rubles. In 1991, the State Bank took over production of 1, 3 and 5-ruble notes and also introduced 200, 500 and 1,000-ruble notes, although the 25-ruble note was no longer issued. In 1992, a final issue of notes was made bearing the name of the USSR before the Russian Federation introduced 5,000 and 10,000-ruble notes. These were followed by 50,000-ruble notes in 1993, 100,000 rubles in 1995 and, finally, 500,000 rubles in 1997 (dated 1995).

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian ruble banknotes and coins have been notable for their lack of portraits, which traditionally were included under both the Tsarist and Communist regimes. With the issue of the 500-ruble note depicting a statue of Peter I and then the 1,000-ruble note depicting a statue of Yaroslav, the lack of recognizable faces on the currency has been partially alleviated.

===Ruble - RUB (1998–present)===

In 1998, the Russian ruble was redenominated with the new ISO 4217 code &quot;RUB&quot; and number 643 and was exchanged at the rate of 1 RUB = 1,000 RUR. All Soviet coins issued between 1961 and 1991, as well as 1-, 2- and 3-kopeck coins issued before 1961, also qualified for exchange into new rubles. The redenomination was an administrative step that reduced the unwieldiness of the old ruble but occurred on the brink of the 1998 Russian financial crisis. The ruble lost 70% of its value against the US dollar in the six months following this financial crisis, from US$1 = to approximately .

After stabilizing at around US$1 = from 2001 to 2013, it depreciated to the range of US$1 = from 2014 to 2021 as a result of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 and the 2010s oil glut. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, it declined further to US$1 = due to sanctions. The ruble was subject to fluctuation when, in April 2022, the ruble went above its pre-full scale invasion level after falling as low as per dollar in early March, with the longer-term trend showing a steady decline from mid-2022 to mid-2023, falling from to per dollar.

On 15 July 2024 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation closed the statistics of the over-the-counter currency market, and three days later the sale of ruble-note artwork on toilet paper was banned by a judge from Moscow. On 18 November 2024, the Ruble fell below the US$1 = 100 RUB, a benchmark the Russian government was attempting to maintain. By 27 November, the Ruble had fallen to US$1 = 114.5 RUB, with the currency depreciating against USD and EUR at a rate of nearly 2% per day. 

On 27 November 2024 in response to the currency collapse, the Bank of Russia halted formal foreign currency purchases from 28 November until year-end 2024, in &quot;an effort to reduce the volatility on financial markets&quot;.

====Symbol====

A currency symbol was used for the ruble between the 16th century and the 18th century. The symbol consisted of the Russian letters &quot;Р&quot; (rotated 90° anti-clockwise) and &quot;У&quot; (written on top of it). The symbol was placed over the amount number it belonged to. This symbol, however, fell into disuse by the mid-19th century.

No official symbol was used during the final years of the Empire, nor was one introduced in the Soviet Union. The abbreviations &quot;Rbl&quot; (plural: &quot;Rbls&quot;) in Latin script and &quot;руб.&quot; (Cyrillic) and the simple characters &quot;R&quot; (Latin) and &quot;р&quot; (Cyrillic) were used. These are still used today, though are unofficial.

In July 2007, the Central Bank of Russia announced that it would decide on a symbol for the ruble and would test 13 symbols. This included the symbol РР (the initials of &quot;Russian ruble&quot;), which received preliminary approval from the Central Bank. However, one more symbol, a Р with a horizontal stroke below the top similar to the Philippine peso sign, was proposed unofficially. Proponents of the new sign claimed that it is simple, recognizable and similar to other currency signs. This symbol is also similar to the Armenian letter ք or the Latin letter Ꝑ.

On 11 December 2013, the official symbol for the ruble became , a Cyrillic letter &quot;Er&quot; with a single added horizontal stroke, though the abbreviation &quot;руб.&quot; is in wide use. The Unicode CJK Compatibility block contains , a square version of (), the Japanese word for &quot;ruble&quot;.

On 4 February 2014, the Unicode Technical Committee during its 138th meeting in San Jose accepted symbol for Unicode version 7.0; the symbol was then included into Unicode 7.0 released on 16 June 2014. In August 2014, Microsoft issued updates for all of its mainstream versions of Microsoft Windows that enabled support for the new ruble sign. 

The ruble sign can be entered on a Russian computer keyboard as on Windows and Linux, or (Qwerty position) on macOS.

==Coins==
In 1998, the following coins were introduced in connection with the ruble revaluation and are currently in circulation:

Kopeck coins are rarely used due to their low value and in some cases may not be accepted by stores or individuals.

These coins were issued starting in 1998, although some of them bear the year 1997. Kopeck denominations all depict St George and the Dragon, and all ruble denominations (with the exception of commemorative pieces) depict the double headed eagle. Mint marks are denoted by &quot;СП&quot; or &quot;M&quot; on kopecks and the logo of either the Saint Petersburg or Moscow mint on rubles. Since 2000, many bimetallic circulating commemorative coins have been issued. These coins have a unique holographic security feature inside the &quot;0&quot; of the denomination 10.

In 2008, the Bank of Russia proposed withdrawing 1 and 5 kopeck coins from circulation and subsequently rounding all prices to multiples of 10 kopeks, although the proposal has not been realized yet (though characteristic &quot;x.99&quot; prices are treated as rounded in exchange). The Bank of Russia stopped minting one-kopeck and five-kopeck coins in 2012, and kopecks completely in 2018. The material of , and coins was switched from copper-nickel-zinc and copper-nickel clad to nickel-plated steel in the second quarter of 2009. 10 and 50 kopecks were also changed from brass to brass-plated steel.

In October 2009, a new coin made of brass-plated steel was issued, featuring optical security features. The banknote would have been withdrawn in 2012, but a shortage of coins prompted the Central Bank to delay this and put new ones in circulation. A series of circulating Olympic commemorative coins started in 2011. The new coins are struck in cupronickel. A number of commemorative smaller denominations of these coins exist in circulation as well, depicting national historic events and anniversaries. The Bank of Russia issues other commemorative non-circulating coins ranging from to .

==Banknotes==

On 1 January 1998, a new series of banknotes dated 1997 was released in denominations of , , , and . The banknote was first issued on 1 January 2001 and the 5,000₽ banknote was first issued on 31 July 2006. Modifications to the series were made in 2001, 2004, and 2010.

In April 2016, the Central Bank of Russia announced that it will introduce two new banknotes – and – in 2017. In September 2016, a vote was held to decide which symbols and cities will be displayed on the new notes. In February 2017, the Central Bank of Russia announced the new symbols. The 200₽ banknote will feature symbols of Crimea, that the country illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014: the Monument to the Sunken Ships, a view of Sevastopol, and a view of Chersonesus. The 2,000₽ banknote will bear images of the Russian Far East: the bridge to Russky Island and the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Amur Oblast.

In 2018, the Central Bank issued a &quot;commemorative&quot; banknote designed to recognize Russia&#x27;s role as the host of the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament. The banknote is printed on a polymer substrate, and has several transparent portions as well as a hologram. Despite the note being intended for legal tender transactions, the Central Bank has simultaneously refused to allow the country&#x27;s automated teller machines (ATMs) to recognize or accept it.

In March 2021, the Central Bank announced plans to gradually update the designs of the , , , and banknotes and make them more secure; this is expected to be completed in 2025. The first new design, for the note, was unveiled on 30 June 2022. The design of the new note includes symbols of Moscow on the obverse – Red Square, Zaryadye Park, Moscow State University on Sparrow Hills, and Ostankino Tower – and the Rzhev Memorial to the Soviet Soldier on the reverse. In late 2022, the Central Bank resumed the printing of 5 ₽ and 10 ₽ notes for circulation; freshly printed notes began appearing in 2023.


For the rest of the 2017–2025 series, the following designs are planned:
* (2025): Novosibirsk on the obverse, Siberian Federal District on the reverse
* (2025): Saint Petersburg on the obverse, Northwestern Federal District on the reverse
* (2025): Pyatigorsk on the obverse, North Caucasian Federal District on the reverse.

===Printing===
All Russian ruble banknotes are currently printed at the state-owned factory Goznak in Moscow, which was founded on 6 June 1919 and operated ever since. Coins are minted in the Moscow Mint and at the Saint Petersburg Mint, which has been operating since 1724.

=== note controversy===

On 8 July 2014, State Duma deputy and vice-chairman of the Duma Regional Political Committee Roman Khudyakov alleged that the image of the Greek god Apollo driving a quadriga on the portico of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the banknote constitutes pornography that should only be available to persons over the age of 18. Since it is impractical to limit the access of minors to banknotes, he requested in his letter to the Governor of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina to immediately change the design of the banknote.

Khudyakov, a member of parliament for the LDPR party stated, &quot;You can clearly see that Apollo is naked, you can see his genitalia. I submitted a parliamentary request and forwarded it directly to the head of the central bank asking for the banknote to be brought into line with the law protecting children and to remove this Apollo.&quot; Khudyakov&#x27;s efforts did not lead to any changes being made to the design.

===Crimea controversy===
On 13 October 2017, the National Bank of Ukraine issued a decree forbidding the country&#x27;s banks, other financial institutions and Ukraine&#x27;s state postal service to circulate Russian banknotes which use images of Crimea, a territory that is regarded as Russian-occupied by Ukraine and whose annexation by Russia is not recognised by most UN member states. The NBU stated that the ban applies to all financial operations, including cash transactions, currency exchange activities and interbank trade. Crimea is featured on three banknotes that are currently in circulation – the commemorative notes issued in 2015 and 2018, as well as the note issued in 2017.

=== note controversy===
On 16 October 2023, the day of unveilling of the new design of the 1,000-ruble note, the design of the note was criticised by the Russian Orthodox Church for displaying the Islamic crescent on one of the buildings on the reverse of the note at the same time as excluding the Orthodox cross from a different building (a former church that is now a museum). The Bank of Russia announced on the following day that the design would be revised and the notes would not be printed.

===Effect of international sanctions===

&quot;Kommersant&quot; reported that the new note introduced in 2022 will not work with an estimated 60% of cash registers and bank machines because they are imported and therefore must be updated by foreign companies, and this work may not be completed due to sanctions. However, Russian banks have been transferring their ATM networks to domestic software which does not require foreign specialists since at least 2018, with the biggest Russian bank, Sberbank, completing 80% of the transfer by June 2022. Russian banks will start purchasing domestic ATMs with Elbrus processors in 2023; the mandatory share of Russian products in the purchase of ATMs was to be at least 18% for banks with state partnership; since 2022 it has grown to 20%.

===Commemorative banknotes===
On 30 October 2013, a special banknote in honour of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi was issued. The banknote is printed on high-quality white cotton paper. A transparent polymer security stripe is embedded into the paper to make a transparent window incorporating an optically variable element in the form of a snowflake. The highlight watermark is visible in the upper part of the banknote. Ornamental designs run vertically along the banknote. The front of the note features a snowboarder and some of the Olympic venues of the Sochi coastal cluster. The back of the note features the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi. The predominant colour of the note is blue.

On 23 December 2015, another commemorative banknote was issued to celebrate the &quot;reunification of Crimea and Russia&quot;. The banknote is printed on light yellow cotton paper. One side of the note is devoted to Sevastopol, the other one – to Crimea. А wide security thread is embedded into the paper. It comes out on the surface on the Sevastopol side of the banknote in the figure-shaped window. A multitone combined watermark is located on the unprinted area in the upper part of the banknote. Ornamental designs run vertically along the banknote. The Sevastopol side of the note features the Monument to Sunken Ships in Sevastopol Bay and a fragment of the painting &quot;Russian Squadron on the Roads of Sevastopol&quot; by Ivan Aivazovsky. The Crimea side of the note features the Swallow&#x27;s Nest, a decorative castle and local landmark. In the lower part of the Sevastopol side of the banknote in the green stripe there is a QR-code containing a link to the Bank of Russia&#x27;s webpage, which lists historical information related to the banknote. The predominant colour of the note is olive green.

On 22 May 2018, a special banknote to celebrate the 2018 FIFA World Cup was issued. The banknote is printed on polymer. The top part of the note bears a transparent window that contains a holographic element. The design of the note is vertically oriented. The main images of the obverse are a boy with a ball under his arm and a goalkeeper diving for a ball. The main image of the reverse is a stylized image of the globe in the form of a football with green image of the Russian territory outlined on it. On the reverse there is the number 2018 that marks both the issue of the banknote and the World Cup, as well as the name of the host cities in the Russian language. The bottom right corner of the obverse bears a QR-code, which contains a link to the page of the Bank of Russia website with the description of the note&#x27;s security features. Predominant colours of the note are blue and green.

==Economics==
The use of other currencies for transactions between Russian residents is punishable, with a few exceptions, with a fine of 75% to 100% of the value of the transaction.

===International trade===
On 23 November 2010, at a meeting of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, it was announced that Russia and China had decided to use their own national currencies for bilateral trade, instead of the US dollar. The move is aimed to further improve relations between Beijing and Moscow and to protect their domestic economies during the Great Recession. The trading of the Chinese yuan against the ruble has started in the Chinese interbank market, while the yuan&#x27;s trading against the ruble was set to start on the Russian foreign exchange market in December 2010.

In January 2014, President Putin said there should be a sound balance on the ruble exchange rate; that the Central Bank only regulated the national currency exchange rate when it went beyond the upper or lower limits of the floating exchange rate; and that the freer the Russian national currency is, the better it is, adding that this would make the economy react more effectively and timely to processes taking place in it. The Russian ruble is one of the very few free floating curriencies in the world.

The sanctions contributed to the value&#x27;s reduction of the Russian ruble and worsened the economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also caused economic damage to the EU economy, with total losses estimated at €100 billion (). , Russia&#x27;s finance minister announced that the sanctions had cost Russia $40 billion, with another $100 billion loss in 2014 due to decrease in the price of oil the same year. Following sanctions imposed in August 2018, economic losses incurred by Russia amounted to around 0.5–1.5% in foregone GDP growth.

A second round of sanctions involved various Russian banks being removed from SWIFT, and direct sanctions on the Russian Central Bank. The value of the ruble fell 30% against the U.S. dollar, to as low as ₽119/$1 as of 28 February 2022. The Russian central bank raised interest rates to 20% as a result. In an attempt to balance the sinking ruble, it temporarily shut down the Moscow Stock Exchange, mandated that all Russian companies sell 80% of foreign exchange reserves, and prohibited foreigners from liquidating assets in Russia. On 7 March, the ruble was reported to be as low as ₽142.46/$1. During the month of March 2022, the ruble gradually recovered back to its pre-war value of ~80 Rubles per dollar, partially due to increased gas and oil demand from Western companies, as they feared a potential ban on Russian resources, as well as various economic measures designed to prop up the currency.

===Exchange rates===


The first Russian ruble (RUR) introduced in January 1992 depreciated significantly versus the US dollar from US$1 = 125 RUR to around US$1 = 6,000 RUR (or 6 RUB) when it was redenominated in January 1998. The new ruble then depreciated rapidly in its first year to US$1 = 20 RUB before stabilizing at around US$1 = 30 RUB from 2001 to 2013.

The financial crisis in Russia in 2014–2016 was the result of the collapse of the Russian ruble beginning in the second half of 2014. A decline in confidence in the Russian economy caused investors to sell off their Russian assets, which led to a decline in the value of the Russian ruble and sparked fears of a Russian financial crisis. The lack of confidence in the Russian economy stemmed from at least two major sources. The first is the fall in the price of oil in 2014. Crude oil, a major export of Russia, declined in price by nearly 50% between its yearly high in June 2014 and 16 December 2014. The second was the result of international economic sanctions imposed on Russia following Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.

The crisis affected the Russian economy, both consumers and companies, and regional financial markets, as well as Putin&#x27;s ambitions regarding the Eurasian Economic Union. The Russian stock market in particular experienced large declines, with a 30% drop in the RTS Index from the beginning of December through 16 December 2014. From July 2014 to February 2015 the ruble fell dramatically against the U.S. dollar. A 6.5 percentage point interest rate rise to 17 percent failed to prevent the currency hitting record lows in a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of low oil prices, looming recession and international sanctions over the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Russia faced steep economic sanctions due to the invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. In response to the military campaign, several countries imposed strict economic sanctions on the Russian economy. This led to a 32 percent drop in the value of the ruble, which traded at an exchange rate of 120 rubles per dollar in March 2022. On 23 March 2022, President Putin announced that Russia would only accept payments for Russian gas exports from &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; in rubles. This, along with several other actions to control capital flow, coinciding with soaring commodity prices led to the ruble rallying to a record high in May 2022 that economists feel is unlikely to last. However, the ruble continued to rally in June 2022, hitting its highest point (51 rubles to the dollar) for the past seven years at the end of the month.

In early November 2023, the value of the Russian ruble increased slightly reaching a three-month high of 90 against the USD. The Russian key interest rate rose to 15% in October. Capital control measures, including the mandatory FX sales for Russian exporters imposed by Moscow were also effective to support the value of the currency. On November 2, the U.S. announced new sweeping sanctions against Russian energy exports and limits on foreign currency payments by Russia&#x27;s Central Bank, which was thought to be another reason for the higher value of the ruble, forcing Russian banks to pay in ruble. Stock indices for Russian companies were also up. The ruble&#x27;s overall decline is a major problem for the Russian economy as it increases inflation particularly for imported goods.

<text>East China Normal University (ECNU) is a public university in Shanghai, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education and co-funded with the Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

It was formed in 1951 by the merger of the Great China University (est. 1924) and Kwang Hua University (est. 1925) and originated from the St. John&#x27;s College founded in 1879. As of 2020, ECNU is organized into 22 schools, colleges, and institutes, located in two campuses throughout Minhang and Putuo.

==History==


===Origins===

East China Normal University traces its roots to the formation of St. John&#x27;s College (later to become St. John&#x27;s University) in 1879, and its heritage has had a deep influence in the development of Chinese modern higher education.

In 1879, St. John&#x27;s College was founded by William Jones Boone and Joseph Schereschewsky, Bishop of Shanghai, by combining two pre-existing Anglican colleges in Shanghai. In 1905, the college became St. John&#x27;s University and was registered in Washington D.C. in the United States. It was the first institution to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees in China, starting in 1907.

After the May Thirtieth Movement in 1925, some academics and students left the St. John&#x27;s University, later forming the private Kwang Hua University to support the labor and anti-imperialist movement during the middle period of the Republic of China era.

In 1924, after a student protest at the Xiamen University in Fujian some academics fled north to Shanghai, where they established what became the Great China University (also known as Daxia University).

===Establishment of the university===

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, East China Normal University was officially formed in 1951 by the merger of the Great China University and the Kwang Hua University, and was joined at the same time by a number of faculty members from Fudan University, Tongji University, University of Shanghai and East China PE Academy, making it the first national teacher’s training university of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This was done in part due to the government&#x27;s desire to pool these institutions&#x27; resources into a single, stronger entity, cultivate talents with professional knowledge, and promote the development of education in the country.

In the 1950s, the Chinese government regrouped the country&#x27;s higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet-style system. Under this policy, most of the faculties from Saint John&#x27;s University, Zhejiang University, University of Shanghai, Utopia University, and Aurora University were incorporated into ECNU to form a comprehensive multi-disciplinary university. Some of the academics at the Tongji University and Jiaotong University were also transferred to ECNU.

In March 1959, ECNU was authenticated as one of the first 16 National Key Universities in China, and this status was reaffirmed in 1978. From 1972 to 1980 (during the Cultural Revolution in mainland China), five schools including ECNU were merged to create Shanghai Normal University, and in 1980 its original name was resumed.
===1980 to present===

In June 1986, ECNU was one of the first 33 higher education institutions authorized, by the State Council, to establish their graduate schools. In 1996, ECNU passed the prerequisites appraisal and became one of universities sponsored by the major national program &quot;Project 211&quot;. In 2006, the Ministry of Education and Shanghai Municipality signed into a partnership for co-sponsoring the development of the university, qualifying ECNU as a member of the &quot;Project 985&quot;.

ECNU is now under the direct auspices of the Ministry of Education. The university sponsors or supervises publication of more than 20 academic journals and periodicals. The library collection exceeds 4,000,000 volumes. 25 primary or secondary schools are affiliated to the university.

==International partnerships==
The university has established strategic cooperative partnership with universities such as École Normale Supérieure and its group in France, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University in USA, Tokyo University and Kobe University in Japan, and the University of Melbourne in Australia, the University of Warwick in the UK, etc. It has been carrying out academic exchanges with over 150 universities and institutions of Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Australia, Korea, and Russia, etc. ECNU plays host to a CIEE satellite campus, where 100 American college students study each semester. The university also runs an Online College of the Chinese language in collaboration with the National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (NOCFL), which is the first of its kind to be established in the country with over 5,800 students in 137 countries and regions. In 2008, it set up the NOCFL Study and Training Base for International Chinese Teachers.

* In 2002 the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, the École normale supérieure de Cachan, and the École normale supérieure de Lyon set up a Master&#x27;s-PhD programme at East China Normal University in Shanghai. An ENS campus is housed in the ECNU at the Aspiring Researchers Institute and at the Franco-Chinese Advanced Studies Institute.
* In 2007, the EMLYON Business School opened the official EMLYON Asia Campus in the heart of the ECNU campus.
* In 2008, the Cornell-ECNU Center for Comparative Culture was jointly funded by Cornell University and ECNU.
* China&#x27;s first Sino-American university – New York University Shanghai (NYU Shanghai) – was co-established by New York University and ECNU and was approved by the Ministry of Education in early 2011.

===Study China Programme===

Along with several other Chinese universities, East China Normal University has hosted the United Kingdom (UK) government-funded Study China Programme for a number of years. In this programme, students from UK institutions spend one to two summer months studying Mandarin Chinese and Chinese culture at a university in China. The programme is organised by the University of Manchester and is fully funded by UK government bodies, such as the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. Its purpose is to strengthen ties between UK university students and China, in particular as relatively few British students enroll in degrees in China. The programme has increased relations between ECNU and numerous leading UK universities.

===Diplomats&#x27; Program===

Sponsored by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office, the Diplomats&#x27; Program has been organized by ECNU since 2011. In this program, consular officials from over 20 countries spend two months during summer studying at East China Normal University.

<text>Pollination is the transfer of pollen from an anther of a plant to the stigma of a plant, later enabling fertilisation and the production of seeds. Pollinating agents can be animals such as insects, for example beetles or butterflies; birds, and bats; water; wind; and even plants themselves. Pollinating animals travel from plant to plant carrying pollen on their bodies in a vital interaction that allows the transfer of genetic material critical to the reproductive system of most flowering plants. When self-pollination occurs within a closed flower. Pollination often occurs within a species. When pollination occurs between species, it can produce hybrid offspring in nature and in plant breeding work. 

In angiosperms, after the pollen grain (gametophyte) has landed on the stigma, it germinates and develops a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches an ovary. Its two gametes travel down the tube to where the gametophyte(s) containing the female gametes are held within the carpel. After entering an ovule through the micropyle, one male nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm tissues, while the other fuses with the egg cell to produce the embryo. Hence the term: &quot;double fertilisation&quot;. This process would result in the production of a seed, made of both nutritious tissues and embryo.

In gymnosperms, the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the surface of a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question. Two main modes of fertilisation are found in gymnosperms: cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot; have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube.

Pollination research covers various fields, including botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. The pollination process as an interaction between flower and pollen vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian Konrad Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and agriculture, because fruiting is dependent on fertilisation: the result of pollination. The study of pollination by insects is known as &quot;anthecology&quot;. There are also studies in economics that look at the positives and negatives of pollination, focused on bees, and how the process affects the pollinators themselves.

==Process of pollination==
Pollen germination has three stages; hydration, activation and pollen tube emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated so that its mass is reduced, enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does not take place in the anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.
In conifers, the reproductive structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are monoecious and others dioecious. A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. Spore mother cells in the microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). The four resulting cells consist of a large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. These cells comprise a very reduced microgametophyte, that is contained within the resistant.

The pollen grains are dispersed by the wind to the female, ovulate cone that is made up of many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium (the nucellus) wrapped in two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte&#x27;s archegonium.

In flowering plants, the anthers of the flower produce microspores by meiosis. These undergo mitosis to form male gametophytes, each of which contains two haploid cells. Meanwhile, the ovules produce megaspores by meiosis, further division of these form the female gametophytes, which are very strongly reduced, each consisting only of a few cells, one of which is the egg. When a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of a carpel it germinates, developing a pollen tube that grows through the tissues of the style, entering the ovule through the micropyle. When the tube reaches the egg sac, two sperm cells pass through it into the female gametophyte and fertilisation takes place.

== Methods ==

Pollination may be biotic or abiotic. Biotic pollination relies on living pollinators to move the pollen from one flower to another. Abiotic pollination relies on wind, water or even rain. Adding natural habitat areas into farm systems generally improves pollination, as farms that are closer to natural habitat have higher crop yield because they are visited by more pollinators. 

=== Biotic pollination===


About 80% of angiosperms rely on biotic pollination. (also called pollen vectors): organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the receptive part of the carpel or pistil (stigma) of another. Between 100,000 and 200,000 species of animal act as pollinators of the world&#x27;s 250,000 species of flowering plant. The majority of these pollinators are insects, but about 1,500 species of birds and mammals visit flowers and may transfer pollen between them. Besides birds and bats which are the most frequent visitors, these include monkeys, lemurs, squirrels, rodents and possums.

Entomophily, pollination by insects, often occurs on plants that have developed colored petals and a strong scent to attract insects such as bees, wasps, and occasionally ants (Hymenoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), and flies (Diptera). The existence of insect pollination dates back to the dinosaur era.

Insect pollinators such as honey bees (&quot;Apis&quot; spp.),
bumblebees (&quot;Bombus&quot; spp.), and butterflies (e.g., &quot;Thymelicus flavus&quot;) have been observed to engage in flower constancy, which means they are more likely to transfer pollen to other conspecific plants. This can be beneficial for the pollinators, as flower constancy prevents the loss of pollen during interspecific flights and pollinators from clogging stigmas with pollen of other flower species. It also improves the probability that the pollinator will find productive flowers easily accessible and recognisable by familiar clues. The primary insect pollinators are hymenopterans, mostly bees, but also including sawflies, ants, and many species of wasps.

Many flowers attract pollinators by odor. For example, orchid bee species such as &quot;Euglossa cordata&quot; are attracted to orchids this way, and it has been suggested that some orchid species intoxicate bees during visits which can last up to 90 minutes. However, in general, plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured and have little odor, but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated. Night-blooming flowers have little color, but are often very aromatic. Plants with vertebrate pollinators also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short.

Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness, attach pollen to specific body parts (as happens in many orchid and &quot;Asclepias&quot; species), or require specialized behaviors or morphology in order to extract pollen or nectar. One such syndrome is &quot;buzz pollination&quot; (or &quot;sonication&quot;), where a bee must vibrate at a certain frequency in order to cause pollen to be released from the anthers.

In zoophily, pollination is performed by vertebrates such as birds and bats, particularly, hummingbirds, sunbirds, spiderhunters, honeyeaters, and fruit bats. Ornithophily or bird pollination is the pollination of flowering plants by birds. Chiropterophily or bat pollination is the pollination of flowering plants by bats. Plants adapted to use bats or moths as pollinators typically have white petals, strong scent and flower at night, whereas plants that use birds as pollinators tend to produce copious nectar and have red petals.

Mammals are not generally thought of as pollinators, but some rodents, bats and marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such activities. In South Africa certain species of &quot;Protea&quot; (in particular &quot;Protea humiflora&quot;, &quot;P. amplexicaulis&quot;, &quot;P. subulifolia&quot;, &quot;P. decurrens&quot; and &quot;P. cordata&quot;) are adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly Cape Spiny Mouse, &quot;Acomys subspinosus&quot;) and elephant shrews (&quot;Elephantulus&quot; species). The flowers are borne near the ground, are yeasty smelling, not colourful, and sunbirds reject the nectar with its high xylose content. The mice apparently can digest the xylose and they eat large quantities of the pollen. In Australia pollination by flying, gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated.

Reptile pollinators are known, but they form a minority in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation to a lack of animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar. Most species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as Varanidae and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the Gekkonidae are active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the Lacertidae, &quot;Podarcis lilfordi&quot;, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major pollinator of &quot;Euphorbia dendroides&quot; on various Mediterranean islands.

=== Abiotic pollination===
Abiotic pollination uses nonliving methods such as wind and water to move pollen from one flower to another. This allows the plant to spend energy directly on pollen rather than on attracting pollinators with flowers and nectar. Pollination by wind is more common amongst abiotic pollination.

==== By wind ====

Some 98% of abiotic pollination is anemophily, i.e., pollination by wind. This probably arose from insect pollination (entomophily), most likely due to changes in the environment or the availability of pollinators. The transfer of pollen is more efficient than previously thought; wind pollinated plants have developed to have specific heights, in addition to specific floral, stamen and stigma positions that promote effective pollen dispersal and transfer.

==== By water ====
Pollination by water, hydrophily, uses water to transport pollen, sometimes as whole anthers; these can travel across the surface of the water to carry dry pollen from one flower to another. In &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot;, an unopened male flower floats to the surface of the water, and, upon reaching the surface, opens up and the fertile anthers project forward. The female flower, also floating, has its stigma protected from the water, while its sepals are slightly depressed into the water, allowing the male flowers to tumble in.

==== By rain ====

Rain pollination is used by a small percentage of plants. Heavy rain discourages insect pollination and damages unprotected flowers, but can itself disperse pollen of suitably adapted plants, such as &quot;Ranunculus flammula&quot;, &quot;Narthecium ossifragum&quot;, and &quot;Caltha palustris&quot;. In these plants, excess rain drains allowing the floating pollen to come in contact with the stigma. In some orchids ombrophily occurs, and rain water splashes cause the anther cap to be removed, allowing for the pollen to be exposed. After exposure, raindrops causes the pollen to be shot upward, when the stipe pulls them back, and then fall into the cavity of the stigma. Thus, for the orchid &quot;Acampe rigida&quot;, this allows the plant to self-pollinate, which is useful when biotic pollinators in the environment have decreased.

==== Switching methods ====
It is possible for a plant to have varying pollination methods, including both biotic and abiotic pollination. The orchid &quot;Oeceoclades maculata&quot; uses both rain and butterflies, depending on its environmental conditions.

==Mechanism==

Pollination can be accomplished by cross-pollination or by self-pollination:
* Cross-pollination, also called &quot;allogamy&quot;, occurs when pollen is delivered from the stamen of one flower to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species. Plants adapted for cross-pollination have several mechanisms to prevent self-pollination; the reproductive organs may be arranged in such a way that self-fertilisation is unlikely, or the stamens and carpels may mature at different times.
* Self-pollination occurs when pollen from one flower pollinates the same flower or other flowers of the same individual. It is thought to have evolved under conditions when pollinators were not reliable vectors for pollen transport, and is most often seen in short-lived annual species and plants that colonize new locations. Self-pollination may include &quot;autogamy&quot;, where pollen is transferred from anther (male part) to the stigma (female part) of the same flower; or &quot;geitonogamy&quot;, when pollen is transferred from anther of a flower to stigma of another flower on the same plant. Plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar stamen and carpel lengths. Plants that can pollinate themselves and produce viable offspring are called self-fertile. Plants that cannot fertilize themselves are called self-sterile, a condition which mandates cross-pollination for the production of offspring.
*&quot;Cleistogamy&quot;: is self-pollination that occurs before the flower opens. The pollen is released from the anther within the flower or the pollen on the anther grows a tube down the style to the ovules. It is a type of sexual breeding, in contrast to asexual systems such as apomixis. Some &quot;cleistogamous&quot; flowers never open, in contrast to &quot;chasmogamous&quot; flowers that open and are then pollinated. Cleistogamous flowers are by necessity found on self-compatible or self-fertile plants. Although certain orchids and grasses are entirely cleistogamous, other plants resort to this strategy under adverse conditions. Often there may be a mixture of both cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers, sometimes on different parts of the plant and sometimes in mixed inflorescences. The ground bean produces cleistogamous flowers below ground, and mixed cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers above.

An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers. It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants have a mixed mating system in nature. In the most common kind of mixed mating system, individual plants produce a single type of flower and fruits may contain self-pollinated, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types.

Pollination also requires consideration of pollenizers, the plants that serve as the pollen source for other plants. Some plants are &quot;self-compatible&quot; (&quot;self-fertile&quot;) and can pollinate and fertilize themselves. Other plants have chemical or physical barriers to self-pollination.

In agriculture and horticulture pollination management, a good pollenizer is a plant that provides compatible, viable and plentiful pollen and blooms at the same time as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be stored and used when needed to pollinate the desired flowers. Hybridization is effective pollination between flowers of different species, or between different breeding lines or populations. see also Heterosis.

Peaches are considered self-fertile because a commercial crop can be produced without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. Apples are considered self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. One means of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.

==Coevolution==
The first fossil record for abiotic pollination is from fern-like plants in the late Carboniferous period. Gymnosperms show evidence for biotic pollination as early as the Triassic period. Many fossilized pollen grains show characteristics similar to the biotically dispersed pollen today. Furthermore, the gut contents, wing structures, and mouthpart morphology of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association between beetles and angiosperms during the early Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous. The evolution of nectaries in late Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.

Bees provide a good example of the mutualism that exists between hymenopterans and angiosperms. Flowers provide bees with nectar (an energy source) and pollen (a source of protein). When bees go from flower to flower collecting pollen they are also depositing pollen grains onto the flowers, thus pollinating them. While pollen and nectar, in most cases, are the most notable reward attained from flowers, bees also visit flowers for other resources such as oil, fragrance, resin and even waxes. It has been estimated that bees originated with the origin or diversification of angiosperms. In addition, cases of coevolution between bee species and flowering plants have been illustrated by specialized adaptations. For example, long legs are selected for in &quot;Rediviva neliana&quot;, a bee that collects oil from &quot;Diascia capsularis&quot;, which have long spur lengths that are selected for in order to deposit pollen on the oil-collecting bee, which in turn selects for even longer legs in &quot;R. neliana&quot; and again longer spur length in &quot;D. capsularis&quot; is selected for, thus, continually driving each other&#x27;s evolution.

==In agriculture==
The most essential staple food crops on the planet, like wheat, maize, rice, soybeans and sorghum are wind pollinated or self pollinating. When considering the top 15 crops contributing to the human diet globally in 2013, slightly over 10% of the total human diet of plant crops (211 out of 1916 kcal/person/day) is dependent upon insect pollination.

Pollination management is a branch of agriculture that seeks to protect and enhance present pollinators and often involves the culture and addition of pollinators in monoculture situations, such as commercial fruit orchards. The largest managed pollination event in the world is in California almond orchards, where nearly half (about one million hives) of the US honey bees are trucked to the almond orchards each spring. New York&#x27;s apple crop requires about 30,000 hives; Maine&#x27;s blueberry crop uses about 50,000 hives each year. The US solution to the pollinator shortage, so far, has been for commercial beekeepers to become pollination contractors and to migrate. Just as the combine harvesters follow the wheat harvest from Texas to Manitoba, beekeepers follow the bloom from south to north, to provide pollination for many different crops.

In America, bees are brought to commercial plantings of cucumbers, squash, melons, strawberries, and many other crops. Honey bees are not the only managed pollinators: a few other species of bees are also raised as pollinators. The alfalfa leafcutter bee is an important pollinator for alfalfa seed in western United States and Canada. Bumblebees are increasingly raised and used extensively for greenhouse tomatoes and other crops.

The ecological and financial importance of natural pollination by insects to agricultural crops, improving their quality and quantity, becomes more and more appreciated and has given rise to new financial opportunities. The vicinity of a forest or wild grasslands with native pollinators near agricultural crops, such as apples, almonds or coffee can improve their yield by about 20%. The benefits of native pollinators may result in forest owners demanding payment for their contribution in the improved crop results – a simple example of the economic value of ecological services. Farmers can also raise native crops in order to promote native bee pollinator species as shown with the native sweat bees &quot;L. vierecki&quot; in Delaware and &quot;L. leucozonium&quot; in southwest Virginia.

The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that native insect pollination saves the United States agricultural economy nearly an estimated $3.1 billion annually through natural crop production; pollination produces some $40 billion worth of products annually in the United States alone.

Pollination of food crops has become an environmental issue, due to two trends. The trend to monoculture means that greater concentrations of pollinators are needed at bloom time than ever before, yet the area is forage poor or even deadly to bees for the rest of the season. The other trend is the decline of pollinator populations, due to pesticide misuse and overuse, new diseases and parasites of bees, clearcut logging, decline of beekeeping, suburban development, removal of hedges and other habitat from farms, and public concern about bees. Widespread aerial spraying for mosquitoes due to West Nile fears is causing an acceleration of the loss of pollinators. Changes in land use, harmful pesticides, and advancing climate change threaten wild pollinators, key insect species that increase yields of three-fourths of crop varieties and are critical to growing healthy foods. 

In some situations, farmers or horticulturists may aim to restrict natural pollination to only permit breeding with the preferred individuals plants. This may be achieved through the use of pollination bags.

===Improving pollination in areas with suboptimal bee densities===

In some instances growers&#x27; demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, to less than 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% in the same time period. Additionally, in the past five years there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside, California, created a semiochemical formulation called SPLAT Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.

==Environmental impacts==

Loss of pollinators, also known as pollinator decline (of which colony collapse disorder is perhaps the most well known) has been noticed in recent years. These loss of pollinators have caused a disturbance in early plant regeneration processes such as seed dispersal and pollination. Early processes of plant regeneration greatly depend on plant-animal interactions and because these interactions are interrupted, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are threatened. Pollination by animals aids in the genetic variability and diversity within plants because it allows for out-crossing instead for self-crossing. Without this genetic diversity there would be a lack of traits for natural selection to act on for the survival of the plant species. Seed dispersal is also important for plant fitness because it allows plants the ability to expand their populations. More than that, it permits plants to escape environments that have changed and have become difficult to reside in. All of these factors show the importance of pollinators for plants, which are a significant part of the foundation for a stable ecosystem. If only a few species of plants depended on Loss of pollinators is especially devastating because there are so many plant species rely on them. More than 87.5% of angiosperms, over 75% of tropical tree species, and 30-40% of tree species in temperate regions depend on pollination and seed dispersal.

Factors that contribute to pollinator decline include habitat destruction, pesticide, parasitism/diseases, and climate change. The more destructive forms of human disturbances are land use changes such as fragmentation, selective logging, and the conversion to secondary forest habitat. Defaunation of frugivores is also an important driver. These alterations are especially harmful due to the sensitivity of the pollination process of plants. Research on tropical palms found that defaunation has caused a decline in seed dispersal, which causes a decrease in genetic variability in this species. Habitat destruction such as fragmentation and selective logging remove areas that are most optimal for the different types of pollinators, which removes pollinators food resources, nesting sites, and leads to isolation of populations. The effect of pesticides on pollinators has been debated because it is difficult to determine that a single pesticide is the cause as opposed to a mixture or other threats. Whether exposure alone causes damage, or if the duration and potency are also factors is unknown. However, insecticides have negative effects, as in the case of neonicotinoids that harm bee colonies. Many researchers believe it is the synergistic effects of these factors which are ultimately detrimental to pollinator populations.

In the agriculture industry, climate change is causing a &quot;pollinator crisis&quot;. This crisis is affecting the production of crops, and the relating costs, due to a decrease in pollination processes. This disturbance can be phenological or spatial. In the first case, species that normally occur in similar seasons or time cycles, now have different responses to environmental changes and therefore no longer interact. For example, a tree may flower sooner than usual, while the pollinator may reproduce later in the year and therefore the two species no longer coincide in time. Spatial disturbances occur when two species that would normally share the same distribution now respond differently to climate change and are shifting to different regions.

=== Examples of affected pollinators ===
The most known and understood pollinator, bees, have been used as the prime example of the decline in pollinators. Bees are essential in the pollination of agricultural crops and wild plants and are one of the main insects that perform this task. Out of the bees species, the honey bee or &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; has been studied the most and in the United States, there has been a loss of 59% of colonies from 1947 to 2005. The decrease in populations of the honey bee have been attributed to pesticides, genetically modified crops, fragmentation, parasites and diseases that have been introduced. There has been a focus on neonicotinoids effects on honey bee populations. Neonicotinoids insecticides have been used due to its low mammalian toxicity, target specificity, low application rates, and broad spectrum activity. However, the insecticides are able to make its way throughout the plant, which includes the pollen and nectar. Due to this, it has been shown to effect on the nervous system and colony relations in the honey bee populations.

Butterflies too have suffered due to these modifications. Butterflies are helpful ecological indicators since they are sensitive to changes within the environment like the season, altitude, and above all, human impact on the environment. Butterfly populations were higher within the natural forest and were lower in open land. The reason for the difference in density is the fact that in open land the butterflies would be exposed to desiccation and predation. These open regions are caused by habitat destruction like logging for timber, livestock grazing, and firewood collection. Due to this destruction, butterfly species&#x27; diversity can decrease and it is known that there is a correlation in butterfly diversity and plant diversity.

=== Food security and pollinator decline ===

Besides the imbalance of the ecosystem caused by the decline in pollinators, it may jeopardise food security. Pollination is necessary for plants to continue their populations and 3/4 of the plant species that contribute to the world&#x27;s food supply are plants that require pollinators. Insect pollinators, like bees, are large contributors to crop production, over 200 billion dollars worth of crop species are pollinated by these insects. Pollinators are also essential because they improve crop quality and increase genetic diversity, which is necessary in producing fruit with nutritional value and various flavors. Crops that do not depend on animals for pollination but on the wind or self-pollination, like corn and potatoes, have doubled in production and make up a large part of the human diet but do not provide the micronutrients that are needed. The essential nutrients that are necessary in the human diet are present in plants that rely on animal pollinators. There have been issues in vitamin and mineral deficiencies and it is believed that if pollinator populations continue to decrease these deficiencies will become even more prominent.

==Plant–pollinator networks==
Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting out of the interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure was found to be similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.

The structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.

Such a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover, could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed.

== Economics of commercial honeybee pollination ==

While there are 200,000 - 350,000 different species of animals that help pollination, honeybees are responsible for majority of the pollination for consumed crops, providing between $235 and $577 US billion of benefits to global food production. The western honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot; L.) provides highly valued pollination services for a wide variety of agricultural crops, and ranks as the most frequent single species of pollinator for crops worldwide. Since the early 1900s, beekeepers in the United States started renting out their colonies to farmers to increase the farmer&#x27;s crop yields, earning additional revenue from providing privatized pollination. As of 2016, 41% of an average US beekeeper&#x27;s revenue comes from providing such pollination service to farmers, making it the biggest proportion of their income, with the rest coming from sales of honey, beeswax, government subsidy, etc. This is an example of how a positive externality, pollination of crops from beekeeping and honey-making, was successfully accounted for and incorporated into the overall market for agriculture. On top of assisting food production, pollination service provide beneficial spillovers as bees germinate not only the crops, but also other plants around the area that they are set loose to pollinate, increasing biodiversity for the local ecosystem. There is even further spillover as biodiversity increases ecosystem resistance for wildlife and crops. Due to their role of pollination in crop production, commercial honeybees are considered to be livestock by the US Department of Agriculture. The impact of pollination varies by crop. For example, almond production in the United States, an $11 billion industry based almost exclusively in the state of California, is heavily dependent on imported honeybees for pollination of almond trees. Almond industry uses up to 82% of the services in the pollination market. Each February, around 60% of the all bee colonies in the US are moved to California&#x27;s Central Valley.

Over the past decade, beekeepers across the US have reported that the mortality rate of their bee colonies has stayed constant at about 30% every year, making the deaths an expected cost of business for the beekeepers. While the exact cause of this phenomenon is unknown, according to the US Department of Agriculture Colony Collapse Disorder Progress Report it can be traced to factors such as pollution, pesticides, and pathogens from evidences found in areas of the colonies affected and the colonies themselves. Pollution and pesticides are detrimental to the health of the bees and their colonies as the bees&#x27; ability to pollinate and return to their colonies are great greatly compromised. Moreover, California&#x27;s Central Valley is determined by the World Health Organization as the location of country&#x27;s worst air pollution. Almond pollinating bees, approximately 60% of the bees in the US as mentioned above, will be mixed with bees from thousands of other hives provided by different beekeepers, making them exponentially susceptible to diseases and mites that any of them could be carrying. The deaths do not stop at commercial honeybees as there is evidence of significant pathogen spillover to other pollinators including wild bumble bees, infecting up to 35-100% of wild bees within 2 km radius of commercial pollination. The negative externality of private pollination services is the decline of biodiversity through the deaths of commercial and wild bees. Despite losing about a third of their workforce every year, beekeepers continue to rent out their bees to almond farms due to the high pay from the almond industry. In 2016, a colony rented out for almond pollination gave beekeepers an income of $165 per colony rented, around three times from average of other crops that use the pollination rental service. However, a recent study published in Oxford Academic&#x27;s Journal of Economic Entomology found that once the costs for maintaining bees specifically for almond pollination, including overwintering, summer management, and the replacement dying bees are considered, almond pollination is barely or not profitable for average beekeepers.

<doc id="233618" wikidata="Q743861" url="?curid=233618" title="Tacit knowledge">
<text>Tacit knowledge or implicit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to extract or articulate—as opposed to conceptualized, formalized, codified, or explicit knowledge—and is therefore more difficult to convey to others through verbalization or writing. Examples of this include individual wisdom, experience, insight, motor skill, and intuition. An example of &quot;explicit&quot; information that can be recorded, conveyed, and understood by the recipient is the knowledge that London is in the United Kingdom. Speaking a language, riding a bicycle, kneading dough, playing an instrument, or designing and operating sophisticated machinery, on the other hand, all require a variety of knowledge that is difficult or impossible to transfer to other people and is not always known &quot;explicitly,&quot; even by skilled practitioners.

==Overview==

=== Origin ===
The term tacit knowing is attributed to Michael Polanyi&#x27;s &quot;Personal Knowledge&quot; (1958). In his later work, &quot;The Tacit Dimension&quot; (1966), Polanyi made the assertion that &quot;we can know more than we can tell.&quot; He states not only that there is knowledge that cannot be adequately articulated by verbal means, but also that all knowledge is rooted in tacit knowledge. While this concept made most of its impact on philosophy of science, education and knowledge management—all fields involving humans—it was also, for Polanyi, a means to show humankind&#x27;s evolutionary continuity with animals. Polanyi describes that many animals are creative, some even have mental representations, but can only possess tacit knowledge. This excludes humans, however, who developed the capability of articulation and therefore can transmit partially explicit knowledge. This relatively modest difference then turns into a big practical advantage, but there is no unexplained evolutionary gap.

=== Definition ===
&quot;Tacit knowledge&quot; can be defined as skills, ideas and experiences that are possessed by people but are not codified and may not necessarily be easily expressed. With tacit knowledge, people are not often aware of the knowledge they possess or how it can be valuable to others. Effective transfer of tacit knowledge generally requires extensive personal contact, regular interaction, and trust. This kind of knowledge can only be revealed through practice in a particular context and transmitted through social networks. To some extent it is &quot;captured&quot; when the knowledge holder joins a network or a community of practice.

Some examples of daily activities and tacit knowledge are: riding a bike, playing the piano, driving a car, hitting a nail with a hammer, putting together pieces of a complex jigsaw puzzle, and interpreting a complex statistical equation.

In the field of knowledge management, the concept of tacit knowledge refers to knowledge that cannot be fully codified. An individual can acquire tacit knowledge without language. Apprentices, for example, work with their mentors and learn craftsmanship not only through language but also by observation, imitation, and practice.

The key to acquiring tacit knowledge is experience. Without some form of shared experience, it is extremely difficult for people to share each other&#x27;s thinking processes.

==== Terrain ====
Tacit knowledge can be divided according to the terrain. Terrains affect the process of changing tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Terrains are of three kinds:

* &quot;Relational tacit knowledge:&quot; Relational tacit knowledge could be made explicit, but not made explicit for reasons that touch on deep principles that have to do with either the nature or location of knowledge of the way humans are made. This knowledge refers to things we could describe in principle if someone put effort into describing them.
* &quot;Somatic tacit knowledge:&quot; Somatic tacit knowledge has to do with properties of individuals bodies and brains as physical things. It includes things our bodies can do but we cannot describe how, like riding a bike. In principle it is possible for it to be explicated as the outcome of research done by human scientists.
* &quot;Collective tacit knowledge:&quot; Collective tacit knowledge is a kind of knowledge that we do not know how to make explicit and that we cannot envisage how to explicate. It is the domain of knowledge that is located in society, such as the rules for language - it has to do with the way society is constituted.

==== Embodied knowledge ====
Tacit knowledge has been described as “know-how” as opposed to “know-what” (facts). This distinction between “know-how” and “know-what” is considered to date back to a 1945 paper by Gilbert Ryle given to the Aristotelian Society in London. In his paper, Ryle argues against the (intellectualist) position that all knowledge is knowledge of Propositions (“know-what”), and therefore the view that some knowledge can only be defined as “know-how”. Ryle&#x27;s argument has, in some contexts, come to be called &quot;anti-intellectualist&quot;. There are further distinctions such as &quot;know-why&quot; (science) or &quot;know-who&quot; (networking).

Tacit knowledge involves learning and skill but not in a way that can be written down. On this account, knowing-how or “embodied knowledge” is characteristic of the expert, who acts, makes judgments, and so forth without explicitly reflecting on the principles or rules involved. The expert works without having a theory of his or her work; he or she just performs skillfully without deliberation or focused attention. Embodied knowledge represents a learned capability of a human body&#x27;s nervous and endocrine systems.

==Differences from explicit knowledge==
Although it is possible to distinguish conceptually between explicit and tacit knowledge, they are not separate and discrete in practice. The interaction between these two modes of knowing is vital for the creation of new knowledge.

Tacit knowledge can be distinguished from explicit knowledge in three major areas:
* &quot;Codifiability and mechanism of transferring knowledge&quot;: Explicit knowledge can be codified (for example, &#x27;can you write it down&#x27; or &#x27;put it into words&#x27; or &#x27;draw a picture&#x27;), and easily transferred without the knowing subject. In contrast, tacit knowledge is intuitive and unarticulated knowledge that cannot be communicated, understood or used without the &#x27;knowing subject&#x27;. Unlike the transfer of explicit knowledge, the transfer of tacit knowledge requires close interaction and the buildup of shared understanding and trust among them.
* &quot;Main methods for the acquisition and accumulation&quot;: Explicit knowledge can be generated through logical deduction and acquired through practical experience in the relevant context. In contrast, tacit knowledge can only be acquired through practical experience in the relevant context.
* &quot;Potential of aggregation and modes of appropriation&quot;: Explicit knowledge can be aggregated at a single location, stored in objective forms, and appropriated without the participation of the knowing subject. Tacit knowledge, in contrast, is personal and contextual; it is distributed across knowing subjects, and cannot easily be aggregated. The realization of its full potential requires the close involvement and cooperation of the knowing subject.

The process of transforming tacit knowledge into explicit or specifiable knowledge is known as codification, articulation, or specification. The tacit aspects of knowledge are those that cannot be codified, but can only be transmitted via training or gained through personal experience. There is a view against the distinction, where it is believed that all propositional knowledge (knowledge that) is ultimately reducible to practical knowledge (knowledge how).

== Nonaka–Takeuchi model ==

Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model of knowledge creation that explains how tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit knowledge, both of which can be converted into organisational knowledge. While introduced by Nonaka in 1990, the model was further developed by Hirotaka Takeuchi and is thus known as the Nonaka–Takeuchi model. In this model, tacit knowledge is presented variously as uncodifiable (&quot;tacit aspects of knowledge are those that cannot be codified&quot;) and codifiable (&quot;transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge is known as codification&quot;). This ambiguity is common in the knowledge management literature.

Assuming that knowledge is created through the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge, the Nonaka–Takeuchi model postulates four different modes of knowledge conversion:

# from tacit knowledge to tacit knowledge, or &quot;socialization&quot;;
# from tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge, or &quot;externalization&quot;;
# from explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge, or &quot;combination&quot;; and
# from explicit knowledge to tacit knowledge, or &quot;internalization&quot;.

Nonaka&#x27;s view may be contrasted with Polanyi&#x27;s original view of &quot;tacit knowing&quot;. Polanyi believed that while declarative knowledge may be needed for acquiring skills, it is unnecessary for using those skills once the novice becomes an expert. Indeed, it does seem to be the case that, as Polanyi argued, when people acquire a skill, they acquire a corresponding understanding that defies articulation.

==Examples==
* One of the most convincing examples of tacit knowledge is facial recognition: one knows a person&#x27;s face, and can recognize it among a thousand, indeed a million. Yet, people usually cannot tell how they recognize that face, so most of this cannot be put into words. When one sees a face, they are not conscious about their knowledge of the individual features (eye, nose, mouth), but rather see and recognize the face as a whole.
* Another example of tacit knowledge is the notion of language itself: it is not possible to learn a language just by being taught the rules of grammar—a native-speaker picks it up at a young age, almost entirely unaware of the formal grammar which they may be taught later.
*Other examples are how to ride a bike, how tight to make a bandage, or knowing whether a senior surgeon feels an intern may be ready to learn the intricacies of surgery; this can only be learned through personal experimentation.
* Harry M. Collins showed that Western laboratories long had difficulties in successfully replicating an experiment that a team led by Vladimir Braginsky at Moscow State University had been conducting for 20 years (the experiment was measuring the quality, &quot;Q&quot;, factors of sapphire). Western scientists became suspicious of the Russian results and it was only when Russian and Western scientists conducted the measurements collaboratively that the trust was reestablished. Collins argues that laboratory visits enhance the possibility for the transfer of tacit knowledge.
* The Bessemer steel process is another example: Henry Bessemer sold a patent for his advanced steelmaking process and was subsequently sued by the purchasers after they could not get it to work. In the end, Bessemer set up his own steel company because he knew how to do it, even though he could not convey it to his patent users.
* When Matsushita (now Panasonic) started developing its automatic home bread-making machine in 1985, an early problem was how to mechanize the dough-kneading process, a process that takes a master baker years of practice to perfect. To learn this tacit knowledge, a member of the software development team, Ikuko Tanaka, decided to volunteer herself as an apprentice to the head baker of the Osaka International Hotel, who was reputed to produce the area&#x27;s best bread. After a period of imitation and practice, one day she observed that the baker was not only stretching, but also twisting the dough in a particular fashion (&quot;twisting stretch&quot;), which turned out to be important in the success of his method. The Matsushita home bakery team drew together eleven members from completely different specializations and cultures: product planning, mechanical engineering, control systems, and software development. The &quot;twisting stretch&quot; motion was finally achieved by a prototype machine after a year of iterative experimentation by the engineers and team members working closely together, combining their explicit knowledge. For example, the engineers added ribs to the inside of the dough case in order to hold the dough better as it is being churned. Another team member suggested a method (later patented) to add yeast at a later stage in the process, thereby preventing the yeast from over-fermenting in high temperatures.
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased remote work seems to have influenced the informal exchange of tacit knowledge among workers, which has subsequently led to an adverse effect on the variety of outputs produced by remote workers.

<doc id="233624" wikidata="Q478019" url="?curid=233624" title="Rational unified process">
<text>The rational unified process (RUP) is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software Corporation, a division of IBM since 2003. RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process framework, intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. RUP is a specific implementation of the Unified Process.

== History ==
Rational Software originally developed the rational unified process as a software process product. The product includes a hyperlinked knowledge-base with sample artifacts and detailed descriptions for many different types of activities. RUP is included in the IBM Rational Method Composer (RMC) product which allows customization of the process.

Philippe Kruchten, an experienced Rational technical representative was tasked with heading up the original RUP team.

These initial versions combined the Rational Software organisation&#x27;s extensive field experience building object-oriented systems (referred to by Rational field staff as the Rational Approach) with Objectory&#x27;s guidance on practices such as use cases, and incorporated extensive content from Jim Rumbaugh&#x27;s Object Modeling Technology (OMT) approach to modeling, Grady Booch&#x27;s Booch method, and the newly released UML 0.8.

To help make this growing knowledge base more accessible, Philippe Kruchten was tasked with the assembly of an explicit process framework for modern software engineering. This effort employed the HTML-based process delivery mechanism developed by Objectory. The resulting &quot;Rational Unified Process&quot; (RUP) completed a strategic tripod for Rational:

* a &quot;tailorable process&quot; that guided development
* &quot;tools&quot; that automated the application of that process
* &quot;services&quot; that accelerated adoption of both the process and the tools.

This guidance was augmented in subsequent versions with knowledge based on the experience of companies that Rational had acquired.

In 1997, a requirements and test discipline were added to the approach, much of the additional material sourced from the Requirements College method developed by Dean Leffingwell et al. at Requisite, Inc., and the SQA Process method developed at SQA Inc., both companies having been acquired by Rational Software.

In 1998 Rational Software added two new disciplines:
# business modeling, much of this content had already been in the Objectory Process
# a Configuration and Change Management discipline, sourced through the acquisition of Pure Atria Corporation.

These additions lead to an overarching set of principles that were defined by Rational and articulated within RUP as the six &quot;best practices&quot; for modern software engineering:
# Develop iteratively, with risk as the primary iteration driver
# Manage requirements
# Employ a component-based architecture
# Model software visually
# Continuously verify quality
# Control changes

These best practices were tightly aligned with Rational&#x27;s product line, and both drove the ongoing development of Rational&#x27;s products, as well as being used by Rational&#x27;s field teams to help customers improve the quality and predictability of their software development efforts.

Additional techniques including performance testing, UI Design, data engineering were included, and an update to reflect changes in UML 1.1.

In 1999, a project management discipline was introduced, as well as techniques to support real-time software development and updates to reflect UML 1.3. Besides, the first book to describe the process, &quot;The Unified Software Development Process&quot; () by Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh., was published in the same year.

Between 2000 and 2003, a number of changes introduced guidance from ongoing Rational field experience with iterative development, in addition to tool support for enacting RUP instances and for customization of the RUP framework. These changes included:
# the introduction of concepts and techniques from approaches such as eXtreme Programming (XP), that would later come to be known collectively as agile methods. This included techniques such as pair programming, test-first design, and papers that explained how RUP enabled XP to scale for use on larger projects.
# a complete overhaul of the testing discipline to better reflect how testing work was conducted in different iterative development contexts.
# the introduction of supporting guidance - known as &quot;tool mentors&quot; - for enacting the RUP practices in various tools. These essentially provided step-by-step method support to Rational tool users.
# automating the customization of RUP in a way that would allow customers to select parts from the RUP process framework, customize their selection with their own additions, and still incorporate improvements in subsequent releases from Rational.

IBM acquired Rational Software in February 2003.

In 2006, IBM created a subset of RUP tailored for the delivery of Agile projects - released as an OpenSource method called OpenUP through the Eclipse web-site.

== Rational unified process topics ==

=== RUP building blocks ===
RUP is based on a set of building blocks and content elements, describing what is to be produced, the necessary skills required and the step-by-step explanation describing how specific development goals are to be achieved. The main building blocks, or content elements, are the following:
* Roles (who) – A role defines a set of related skills, competencies and responsibilities.
* Work products (what) – A work product represents something resulting from a task, including all the documents and models produced while working through the process.
* Tasks (how) – A task describes a unit of work assigned to a Role that provides a meaningful result.

Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into nine disciplines:
* Six &quot;engineering disciplines&quot;
** Business modelling
** Requirements
** Analysis and design
** Implementation
** Test
** Deployment
* Three supporting disciplines
** Configuration and change management
** Project management
** Environment

=== Four project life-cycle phases ===

The RUP has determined a project life-cycle consisting of four phases. These phases allow the process to be presented at a high level in a similar way to how a &#x27;waterfall&#x27;-styled project might be presented, although in essence the key to the process lies in the iterations of development that lie within all of the phases. Also, each phase has one key objective and milestone at the end that denotes the objective being accomplished. The visualization of RUP phases and disciplines over time is referred to as the RUP hump chart.

==== Inception phase ====
The primary objective is to scope the system adequately as a basis for validating initial costing and budgets.
In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.), and financial forecast is established. To complement the business case, a basic use case model, project plan, initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features) are generated.
After these are completed, the project is checked against the following criteria:
* Stakeholder concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.
* Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases.
* Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process.
* Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed.
* Establishing a baseline by which to compare actual expenditures versus planned expenditures.

If the project does not pass this milestone, called the life cycle objective milestone, it either can be cancelled or repeated after being redesigned to better meet the criteria.

==== Elaboration phase ====
The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase.
The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and the architecture of the project gets its basic form.

The outcome of the elaboration phase is:
* A use-case model in which the use-cases and the actors have been identified and most of the use-case descriptions are developed. The use-case model should be 80% complete.
* A description of the software architecture in a software system development process.
* An executable architecture that realizes architecturally significant use cases.
* Business case and risk list which are revised.
* A development plan for the overall project.
* Prototypes that demonstrably mitigate each identified technical risk.
* A preliminary user manual (optional)

This phase must pass the lifecycle architecture milestone criteria answering the following questions:
* Is the vision of the product stable?
* Is the architecture stable?
* Does the executable demonstration indicate that major risk elements are addressed and resolved?
* Is the construction phase plan sufficiently detailed and accurate?
* Do all stakeholders agree that the current vision can be achieved using current plan in the context of the current architecture?
* Is the actual vs. planned resource expenditure acceptable?

If the project cannot pass this milestone, there is still time for it to be canceled or redesigned. However, after leaving this phase, the project transitions into a high-risk operation where changes are much more difficult and detrimental when made.

The key domain analysis for the elaboration is the system architecture.

==== Construction phase ====
The primary objective is to build the software system.
In this phase, the main focus is on the development of components and other features of the system. This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place. In larger projects, several construction iterations may be developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments to produce demonstrable prototypes.

==== Transition phase ====
The primary objective is to &#x27;transit&#x27; the system from development into production, making it available to and understood by the end user.
The activities of this phase include training the end users and maintainers and beta testing the system to validate it against the end users&#x27; expectations. The system also goes through an evaluation phase, any developer which is not producing the required work is replaced or removed. The product is also checked against the quality level set in the Inception phase.

If all objectives are met, the product release milestone is reached and the development cycle is finished.

=== The IBM Rational Method Composer product ===
The IBM Rational Method Composer product is a tool for authoring, configuring, viewing, and publishing processes. See IBM Rational Method Composer and an open source version Eclipse process framework (EPF) project for more details.

=== Certification ===
In January 2007 the new RUP certification examination for &quot;IBM Certified Solution Designer - Rational Unified Process 7.0&quot; was released which replaces the previous version of the course called &quot;IBM Rational Certified Specialist - Rational Unified Process&quot;. The new examination will not only test knowledge related to the RUP content but also to the process structure elements.

To pass the new RUP certification examination, a person must take IBM&#x27;s &quot;Test 839: Rational Unified Process v7.0&quot;. You are given 75 minutes to take the 52 question exam. The passing score is 62%.

=== Six best practices ===
Six best software engineering practices are defined for software projects to minimize faults and increase productivity. These are:
; Develop iteratively:It is best to know all requirements in advance; however, often this is not the case. Several software development processes exist that deal with providing solutions to minimize cost in terms of development phases.
; Manage requirements: Always keep in mind the requirements set by users.
; Use components: Breaking down an advanced project is not only suggested but in fact unavoidable. This promotes ability to test individual components before they are integrated into a larger system. Also, code reuse is a big plus and can be accomplished more easily through the use of object-oriented programming.
; Model visually: Use diagrams to represent all major components, users, and their interaction. &quot;UML&quot;, short for Unified Modeling Language, is one tool that can be used to make this task more feasible.
; Verify quality: Always make testing a major part of the project at any point of time. Testing becomes heavier as the project progresses but should be a constant factor in any software product creation.
; Control changes: Many projects are created by many teams, sometimes in various locations, different platforms may be used, etc. As a result, it is essential to make sure that changes made to a system are synchronized and verified constantly. (See Continuous integration).

<doc id="233625" wikidata="Q1357778" url="?curid=233625" title="Phantom Zone">
<text>The Phantom Zone is a prison-like parallel dimension appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. It is mainly associated with stories featuring Superman. It first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #283 (April 1961), and was created by Robert Bernstein and George Papp. It was frequently used in the &quot;Superman&quot; comics before the continuity was rebooted in the 1980s after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and has appeared occasionally since.

==Fictional history==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Phantom Zone is a &quot;pocket universe&quot; used as a humane method of imprisonment due to Krypton abolishing the death penalty years prior. The inmates of the Phantom Zone reside in a ghost-like state of existence from which they can observe, but cannot interact with, the regular universe. Most have a particular grudge against Superman because his father Jor-El discovered the Zone and was often the prosecutor at their trials.

In the 1982 miniseries &quot;The Phantom Zone&quot;, the Phantom Zone is revealed to be the home of Aethyr, a malevolent deity who presides over it and manifests as a disembodied, dog-like head.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===

In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, various species have independently discovered the Phantom Zone and given it different names. It is called the &quot;Buffer Zone&quot; by the Bgztlians, the &quot;Still Zone&quot; by the White Martians, the &quot;Stasis Zone&quot; by Loophole, the &quot;Ghost Zone&quot; by Prometheus, and the &quot;Honeycomb&quot; by Queen Bee.

&quot;Supergirl&quot; #16 shows a form of life native to the Phantom Zone. They are enraged over the use of their universe to house criminals and seek revenge on the one responsible.

In the &quot;New Krypton&quot; storyline, the Kryptonians in Kandor capture Superman&#x27;s enemies to throw them into the Phantom Zone, including Parasite, Silver Banshee, and Toyman. They are later freed by Superman.

In &quot;52&quot;, Mister Mind consumes the Phantom Zone after transforming into the Hyperfly. In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #11, Chameleon Boy and Superman restore the Phantom Zone.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Jor-El uses the Phantom Zone in a failed attempt to escape Krypton&#x27;s destruction.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Superman theorizes that the Phantom Zone is a permeable membrane between the main universe and the Dark Multiverse.

==Known inmates==
===Inmates in Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books, the following inhabitants of the Phantom Zone have been depicted. Based on this list, at least 34 Kryptonians were projected into the Phantom Zone on Krypton over a period of less than 256 Kryptonian days. The entry on the Kryptonian Calendar shows the details on the relationship between Kryptonian sun-cycles and Earth years.

* Ak-Var – Ak-Var was sentenced to approximately 30 Earth years (22 Kryptonian sun-cycles) in the Phantom Zone for plotting to steal a revered relic called a Sun-Stone. After he serves his sentence, Ak-Var is released, moves to Kandor, and becomes the superhero Flamebird.
* Ar-Ual – Ar-Val was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for destroying priceless knowledge and depriving Krypton of a millennium of scientific progress.
* Az-Rel – Az-Rel is a petty criminal from the island of Bokos who possesses pyrokinetic abilities. He and his partner Nadira work together to terrorize the Kryptonian city of Erkol before being captured and sentenced to 15 Kryptonian sun-cycles (20.55 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone. The two are among those freed from the Zone when Quex-Ul is manipulated into building a crude Phantom Zone Projector. Later, Nadira is killed when Jer-Em exposes her to green kryptonite. She telekinetically inflicts pain on Az-Rel, who commits suicide with his pyrokinesis.
* Bal-Gra – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Bal-Gra once escaped from the Phantom Zone through a temporary space-warp. He battles Superman before being depowered by gold kryptonite and returned to the Phantom Zone.
* Blak-Du – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Blak-Du was Jor-El&#x27;s roommate at Krypton College, and was rated as scientifically brilliant.
* Cha-Mel – A Kryptonian boy who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone after impersonating Jor-El and attempting to rob his house.
* General Zod – He was sentenced to 40 Kryptonian sun-cycles (54.8 Earth years) for using a duplicator ray to create a private army of imperfect clones (Bizarros) to overthrow the government.
* Erndine Ze-Da (Zeda) - The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. One day, a South Seas volcano exploded and the concussion opened a temporary gap in the Phantom Zone, enabling both Erndine Ze-Da and Dr. Xadu to escape. They concocted a plan to trap Superboy in the Zone, but he became aware of their scheme and stranded them on the planet Exon. Years later, Erndine and Dr. Xadu, who had since married and acquired the secret of the cosmic power-grip, escaped from Exon and returned to Earth. Superman defeated them again, and placed them in separate cells on two different worlds.
* Faora – A martial arts expert and hater of males, who was sentenced to 300 Kryptonian sun-cycles (411 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for killing 23 men in a concentration camp. She once escaped captivity by using telepathy to manipulate an Earthman named Jackson Porter into freeing her from the Zone.
* Gann Artar – In one imaginary story, a criminal named Gann Artar was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) for using his de-evolutionary ray to create large, dangerous monsters.
* Gaz-Or – After a lifetime of scientific villainy and because he was dying of old age, the Mighty Gazor attempted to use his earthquake machine to destroy Krypton. He was stopped by Jor-El, who had arrived just in time and was sentenced to the Phantom Zone for his crime. Gazor claimed that he had received the longest sentence ever given to anyone condemned to the Phantom Zone. This contradicts the fact that Jax-Ur and Orn-Zu both received life sentences, but after Mon-El was released from the Zone in the 30th Century, Gazor was indeed the only prisoner remaining in that ghostly dimension.
* Gor-Nu – Once the greatest biochemist on Krypton, Gor-Nu&#x27;s reckless experiments caused several deaths. He was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone. When a lethal crystal-menace threatened to destroy the bottle-city of Kandor, Superman released Gor-Nu in the hope that he could figure out a way to stop it. Gor-Nu was successful, but he then tried to betray Superman. Gor-Nu&#x27;s plans were foiled and he was returned to the Phantom Zone.
* Gra-Mo and two assistants – The criminal Gra-Mo and his two assistants (one possibly named Ni-Van) were captured, sentenced to life for attempting to take over Krypton with Gra-Mo&#x27;s robot hordes, placed in suspended animation, and imprisoned in a space capsule which was placed into orbit around Krypton. They were the last criminals to receive this type of punishment. After Krypton&#x27;s destruction, the capsule drifted through space, and they eventually awakened and traveled to Earth. When Superboy learned of their criminal nature, he figured out a way to defeat them and projected them into the Phantom Zone.
* The Inventor – The history and sentencing of this non-Kryptonian prisoner was not revealed.
* Jackson Porter – Phantom Zone prisoner Faora used telepathy to delude Jackson Porter into believing she was the ghost of his dead wife Katie. Faora soon manipulated him into freeing her from the Phantom Zone. After she is returned to the Phantom Zone, Porter follows her there.
* Jax-Ur – A rogue Kryptonian scientist who was sentenced to an eternity in the Phantom Zone for breaking the law forbidding anyone to experiment with an untested explosive. His rocket missed its target and destroyed Wegthor, an inhabited moon of Krypton, killing 500 colonists. He was the first prisoner projected into the Phantom Zone on Krypton. Jax-Ur also became the first prisoner to escape the Phantom Zone when a passing comet created a momentary warp through which he slipped.
* Jer-Em – A religious fanatic who was sentenced to 30 Kryptonian sun-cycles (41.1 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for wiping out the superpowers of the people of Argo City (the birthplace of the future Supergirl) by guiding it back toward a red sun, leaving the residents stranded in their city in space. Jer-Em was among those freed from the Phantom Zone when Quex-Ul was manipulated into building and activating a crude Phantom Zone Projector. Later, Jer-Em purposely exposes himself to Green Kryptonite to enter the Kryptonian afterlife.
* Kru-El – A weapons designer and cousin of Jor-El (the father of the future Superman). He was sentenced to 35 Kryptonian sun-cycles (47.95 Earth years) for developing an arsenal of super-powerful, forbidden weapons.
* Kur-Dul – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Kur-Dul served his full sentence and was released by Superman and the Kandorian parole board.
* Lar Gand – A superpowered youth arrived on Earth with amnesia. He was found by Superboy, who suspected the youth may be his older brother. Superboy named him Mon-El, because they met on a Monday. When Mon-El was later exposed to lead, he collapsed in pain. His memory returned, and he explained that he is from the planet Daxam, whose natives have a lethal vulnerability to lead. To save Mon-El&#x27;s life, Superboy projected him into the Phantom Zone. Mon-El spent 1,000 years in the Zone before he was released and cured by the Legion of Super-Heroes.
* Lar-On – A Kryptonian who was inflicted with lycanthropy and transported to the Phantom Zone until he could be cured.
* Lester Wallace of Earth – After being mentally manipulated by the Phantom Zone prisoner Zan-Em into developing a deep hatred of aliens and causing him to betray Superboy, Lester Wallace realized he had become the very thing he despised. He projected himself into the Phantom Zone as punishment.
* L. Finn – The history and sentencing of this non-Kryptonian prisoner was not revealed.
* Lois Lane – Lois Lane time-traveled back to Krypton before it exploded and was accidentally trapped in the Phantom Zone by Jor-El when he was testing his new Projector device. She spent more than two and a half decades there before she was discovered and released by Superman.
* Marok – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed.
* Murkk – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Murkk was among a group of Phantom Zone prisoners who escaped by focusing their mental energies on a piece of Jewel Kryptonite. He was later disintegrated by the Vrangs.
* Nadira Va-Dim – Nadira was a petty criminal from Bokos, the Island of Thieves. She possessed psychokinetic powers. Her partner, Az-Rel, possessed pyrotic powers. Together they robbed helpless victims in Erkol, the oldest city of Krypton. Both were captured and sentenced to 15 Kryptonian sun-cycles (20.55 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone. The two criminals were among those freed from the Zone when Quex-Ul was manipulated into building and activating a crude Phantom Zone Projector. Later, Nadira was killed when the dying Jer-Em exposed her to green kryptonite.
* Nam-Ek – A scientist who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone for killing Rondors to harness their healing horns and gain immortality. The serum he creates instead transforms him into a humanoid Rondor.
* Orn-Zu – Believing that Krypton&#x27;s sun would soon go nova, Orn-Zu created Jorlan, an android designed to hypnotically lure children away. He intended to use it to save his world&#x27;s youth by kidnapping them and taking them away from Krypton. Orn-Zu was sentenced to an eternity in the Phantom Zone. When Jorlan arrived on Earth, it attempted to complete its mission. Orn-Zu convinced Superman to release him from the Zone, and they both confronted the android. Already dying from Pythagra Fever, Orn-Zu sacrificed himself to help stop his creation.
* Py-Ron (Evil-Man) – Py-Ron was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for using forbidden experiments to turn humans into bird-like monsters. Years later, a volcanic eruption freed Py-Ron from the Phantom Zone. He donned a costume and harassed Superman, using the name Evil-Man. Superman soon captured Py-Ron and returned him to his prison. A few years after that, when Supergirl was forced through hypnosis by the Sisterhood of Evil to test a deadly poison on a super-human, Py-Ron agreed to be her test subject. When Py-Ron appeared to die, Supergirl was then forced to give the poison to Superman and herself. Luckily, Comet the Super-Horse had learned of the poison and altered it with his X-ray vision so that it only put the victims into suspended animation for a few hours. When Py-Ron woke up, he tried to earn his right to stay out of the Zone by flying to Feminax, the Sisterhood&#x27;s homeworld, and killing everyone in retaliation. For his heartless action, Superman projected Py-Ron back into the Phantom Zone.
* Quex-Ul – Quex-Ul was sentenced to nearly 25 Earth years (18 Kryptonian sun-cycles) in the Phantom Zone for killing Rondors to procure their horns. He was the last prisoner projected into the Phantom Zone on Krypton. When he served his full sentence, Quex-Ul notified Superman and was released. Quex-Ul intended on getting revenge on Jor-El, the man who sentenced him to the Phantom Zone, by exposing his son Superman to Gold Kryptonite. When Superman proved that Quex-Ul was innocent, having been framed by Rog-Ar, Quex-Ul attempted to stop Superman from being exposed. Quex-Ul inadvertently exposed himself and was robbed of his powers and his memory. Clark Kent set Quex-Ul up with a job at the Daily Planet using the alias Charlie Kweskill. Quex-Ul is later killed in battle with Aethyr.
* Ral-En – A college friend and associate of Jor-El and son of the famous psychologist Mag-En. With the help of his father, Ral-En used hyper-hypnotism to make everyone believe that he had gained superpowers, then attempted to become ruler of Krypton. Jor-El exposed his scheme, and Ral-En was sentenced to the Phantom Zone. The existence of both baby Kal-El (Superman) and the city of Kandor were crucial to this story. Since Kandor was stolen by Brainiac before the birth of Kal-El and the invention of the Phantom Zone projector, this entire story is impossible.
* Ran-Zo – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed.
* Ras-Krom – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Ras-Krom was a superstitious Kryptonian criminal who escaped the Phantom Zone when an atomic blast opened a small gap between worlds. He attempted to release the other prisoners, but was outwitted and re-imprisoned by Superman and Jimmy Olsen.
* Roz-Em – The criminal Roz-Em had plastic surgery to look exactly like Nim-El (Jor-El&#x27;s twin brother). He attempted to steal a valuable weapon from the Armory of Forbidden Weapons, but was captured by Jor-El and the real Nim-El. He was placed in suspended animation, and imprisoned in a space capsule which was placed into orbit around Krypton. After Krypton&#x27;s destruction, the capsule drifted through space, and Roz-Em eventually awakened and traveled to Earth. He planned on getting his revenge on Nim-El&#x27;s nephew, Superboy, by pretending to be a Superman created from Superboy&#x27;s exposure to Red Kryptonite. Superboy discovered Roz-Em&#x27;s ruse and projected him into the Phantom Zone.
* Shyla Kor-Onn – A brilliant scientist named Shyla Kor-Onn was sentenced to one Kryptonian sun-cycle (1.37 Earth years) for the crime of manslaughter. She was trapped in the Phantom Zone well past her punishment period due to Krypton&#x27;s destruction. After countless failures, Shyla predicted that she could use her mental powers to manipulate a jet pilot into flying his plane in a specific manner which would create a rip in the Zone. She escaped from her prison and battled Supergirl. When Shyla attempted to use the Phantom Zone Projector in Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude to free the other Phantom Zone prisoners, Supergirl was able to project her back into the Zone. A short time later, Shyla was freed in the bottle-city of Kandor, where she attempted to get her revenge on Supergirl.
* Tal-Var – Jimmy Olsen accidentally released the evil Tal-Var from the Dark Dimension. He intended to loot and lay waste to the Earth, then to trap and kill Superman. Using his wits, Jimmy was able to project the alien into the Phantom Zone before he could carry out his threats.
* Thul-Kar – The last of the Wizards of Juru, Thul-Kar used magic to teleport himself into the Phantom Zone on the day of Krypton&#x27;s destruction. He was the first to discover the Phantom Zone&#x27;s connections to the entity called Aethyr.
* Tor-An – Condemned to the Phantom Zone for carrying out forbidden experiments transferring the minds of a Kryptonian family into the bodies of monsters. Years later, he instructed a group of Phantom Zone prisoners to use their combined mental powers to prompt the Mayor of Midvale to ask Supergirl to perform a feat which would open a small rift in the Zone. The handsome Tor-An escaped and tricked Supergirl into marrying him. When he began to gloat that she would now be forever disgraced, he learned to his dismay that the marriage was invalid and that he himself had been tricked by Supergirl. He was quickly captured and returned to his prison.
* The Toyman – The history and sentencing of this non-Kryptonian prisoner was not revealed.
* Tra-Gob – The leader of a band of Kryptonian thieves which raided the priceless Science Archives. He was betrayed by his own men, but was rescued by Jor-El before they could exterminate him. Tra-Gob was sentenced to nearly 40 Earth years (29 Kryptonian sun-cycles) for his crime, but still remained deeply grateful to Jor-El. Tra-Gob was in the Phantom Zone for nearly 30 Earth years before he escaped due to a freak disruption by the aurora borealis. He rescued Superman and Lois Lane from a Kryptonian monster, repaying his debt to Jor-El. As Tra-Gob was being returned to the Zone to finish out his sentence, Superman commented that he may be pardoned in Kandor for his good behavior.
* Tyb-Ol – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Tyb-Ol was among a group of Phantom Zone prisoners who escaped by focusing their mental energies on a piece of Jewel Kryptonite. He was later disintegrated by the Vrangs.
* Professor Va-Kox (Professor Vakox) – Va-Kox is a mad geneticist who was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) for tossing a test tube full of his life force experiment into the Great Krypton Lake, creating a huge mutated monster.
* Vax-Nor – The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Vax-Nor served his full sentence and was released by Superman and the Kandorian parole board.
* Vorb-Un – Vorb-Un was sentenced to 10 Kryptonian sun-cycles (13.7 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for experimenting with forbidden elements without the Science Council&#x27;s permission. During a parole hearing in Kandor, Vorb-Un explained to Superman and the parole board that his sentence was almost up, and he insisted that he had repented. Due to his advanced age and his sincere remorse, he was released from his prison.
* Vor-Kil – The crime and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Vor-Kil escaped from the Phantom Zone when sunspot activity opened a temporary gap to Earth. He battled Superman using the Kryptonian martial art of Klurkor. Superman lured him back into captivity with the help of Jimmy Olsen.
* Dr. Xadu – Dr. Xadu was sentenced to 30 Kryptonian sun-cycles (41.1 Earth years) for breaking the law which forbids the use of suspended animation in any scientific research. He later escaped the Phantom Zone with a prisoner named Erndine Ze-Da when a South Seas volcano exploded and opened a temporary gap in the Phantom Zone. They concocted a plan to trap Superboy in the Zone, but he became aware of their scheme and stranded them on the planet Exon. Years later, Dr. Xadu and Erndine, who had since married and acquired the secret of the cosmic power-grip, escaped from Exon and returned to Earth. Superman defeated them again, and placed them in separate cells on two different worlds. Inexplicably, Dr. Xadu appeared in the Phantom Zone in many stories set between these two tales.
* Zan-Ar – The crime and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed.
* Zan-Em – A psychic scientist who was banished to the Phantom Zone for unauthorized mind control experiments. As part of his plan to escape the Zone and trap Superboy there, Zan-Em mentally manipulated Lester Wallace into developing a hatred of aliens. When Lester projected Superboy into the Zone, Zan-Em remarked that he had been in the prison dimension for nearly two decades. Superboy escaped the Zone, leaving Zan-Em trapped in his prison.
* Zo-Mar – The criminal Zo-Mar was captured, sentenced to life for attempting to enslave all of Krypton, placed in suspended animation, and imprisoned in a space capsule which was placed into orbit around Krypton. After Krypton&#x27;s destruction, the capsule drifted through space, and Zo-Mar eventually awakened and traveled to Earth. With the help of the Challengers of the Unknown, Superman captured Zo-Mar and projected him into the Phantom Zone.
* Unnamed Kandorian scientist – A scientist in Kandor was sentenced to 20 Kryptonian sun-cycles (27.4 Earth years) for performing experiments with the Z-Bomb, even though he was warned that it could accidentally blow up the bottle-city.
* Unnamed energy creature – An alien whose race evolved into pure energy followed an Earth probe back to Earth. The entity was able to possess and control other physical objects and beings, and used this ability to wreak havoc. Superman and Lois Lane tricked the creature into a Superman puppet, then projected it into the Phantom Zone.
* Two unnamed members of the Superman Revenge Squad – Two members of the Superman Revenge Squad attempted to enslave the people of New Krypton (a.k.a. Rokyn), but Superman foiled their plans by projecting them into the Phantom Zone.

===Inmates in Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The following were imprisoned in the Phantom Zone:

* Az-Rel and Nadira Va-Dim – In the Post-Crisis, Az-Rel and his lover Nadira Va-Dim are Kryptonians that Ursa had enlisted to be sleeper agents on Earth.
* Superman foes such as Bizarro, Parasite, Prankster, Silver Banshee and Toyman were thrown into the Phantom Zone by the Kandorians.
* Car-Vex – A Kryptonian criminal who was banished to the Phantom Zone. General Zod later recruited her to be a sleeper agent on Earth where she infiltrated Project 7734 under the alias of Officer Romundi of the Science Police.
* Dev-Em – A Kryptonian who was arrested and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone for murder and perversion.
* Doomsday – Due to his adaptive powers, Doomsday evolved in a way where his fists tore through the Phantom Zone, allowing him to escape it.
* Faora –
* General Zod – A Kryptonian military general who was exiled to the Phantom Zone after trying to overthrow the Kryptonian Council so he could take over Krypton.
* Jax-Ur –
* Non – A former friend and scientific colleague of Jor-El. After leading a separatist movement that planned to tell all of Krypton on what will happen to their planet, he is abducted and lobotomized by Krypton&#x27;s Science Council. This leaves him a minimally-verbal and highly-aggressive brute. Some aspects of his personality survive and surface as an extreme kindness when dealing with children. Serving as General Zod&#x27;s enforcer, he also becomes guardian and caregiver for Zod&#x27;s son Chris Kent.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;===
In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;, Superman is sentenced to the Phantom Zone in 1989 when he is stripped of his powers in a confrontation with the Ultra-Humanite that ends with his foe&#x27;s death, after the Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s actions led to the death of Superman&#x27;s wife Lois Lane and his son Joel being tricked into killing Superman&#x27;s daughter Kara before Joel dies himself, as well as arranging various &#x27;accidents&#x27; for Clark Kent&#x27;s other remaining loved ones. The judges reason that even if Superman feels that he may have killed his foe deliberately after the deaths of his family and friends, putting him in a conventional prison without his powers would be dangerous and solitary confinement was too extreme given his past deeds, selecting the Zone based on the suggestion of the new Batman, Bruce Wayne Junior. Superman is released in 1999 by the now-rejuvenated Bruce Wayne as Bruce returns to the role of Batman - Bruce noting that he is ending the sentence a few months early but is certain that nobody would object to early release &quot;for good behavior&quot; - although Superman was briefly able to appear as a phantom in the real world in 1997 to distract a foe who was about to kill Knightwing (Superman&#x27;s grandson, adopted by Batman&#x27;s son after the deaths of Superman&#x27;s children).

There had been similar Zones that were in comparison to the Phantom Zone:
* In the Captain Future novel &quot;Planets in Peril&quot; (1942) by Edmond Hamilton, Chapter 13 &quot;Phantom Prisoners&quot;, Captain Future is sent to the &quot;Vault of the Unbodied&quot;, essentially an early version of the Phantom Zone. Hamilton later went on to write some of the early DC comics Superman stories, including some Phantom Zone stories.
* Additionally, in the story &quot;Wonder Woman&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; from &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #70 (November 1954), Wonder Woman is sent by Professor Uxo to another dimension much like the Phantom Zone, in which she becomes a spectral observer, unable to interact with those around her. She is able to escape by telepathically overwhelming Professor Uxo with the thought she is watching his every move, forcing him to &quot;reassemble&quot; her in his laboratory before a barrage of bullets, which she easily deflects. Wonder Woman captures Professor Uxo and his henchmen as they are taken away by the police while his &quot;time dimension transfer machine&quot; is damaged beyond repair.

<text>Serissa japonica is a species of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is the sole species in genus Serissa. It is native to open sub-tropical woodlands and wet meadows in southeast Asia, from India, and China to Japan. It is commonly called the snowrose, tree of a thousand stars, or Japanese boxthorn. Snowrose and tree of a thousand stars are different cultivars. The only method of differentiating is measuring the difference in the shape and size of the flowers produced.

==Description==

&quot;Serissa japonica&quot; is an evergreen or semi-evergreen shrub, 45–60 cm high, with oval, deep green, rather thick leaves that have an unpleasant smell if bruised (hence one of its synonyms, &quot;foetida&quot;). The upright stems branch in all directions and form a wide bushy dome. It is grown for its neat habit, good coverage of branches and long flowering time. It is also valued for its rough, grey trunk which tends to get lighter in colour with age.

It flowers practically all year round, but particularly from early spring to near autumn. The 4- to 6-lobed flowers are funnel-shaped and 1 cm wide. They first appear as pink buds but turn to a profusion of white flowers. Fertilizing is especially important during the long flowering period.

==Cultivars==
Many cultivars with double flowers or variegated leaves are also available. &#x27;Pink Snow Rose&#x27; has pale pink flowers and leaves edged off-white. Other cultivars include: &#x27;Variegata&#x27;, &#x27;Variegated Pink&#x27;, &#x27;Pink Mystic&#x27;, &#x27;Snowflake&#x27;, &#x27;Snowleaves&#x27;, &#x27;Mt. Fuji&#x27;, &#x27;Kyoto&#x27; and &#x27;Sapporo&#x27;.

==Bonsai==
&quot;Serissa japonica&quot; is one of the most common bonsai sold in America and Europe. It is not difficult to maintain as bonsai, but is very fussy. Many beginner bonsai enthusiasts will destroy a plant in their uninformed attempts to care for it. The trees respond adversely by dropping leaves if over-watered, under-watered, if it&#x27;s too cold, too hot, or even if just moved to a new location. The plant usually grows back to health when put back to better conditions.

<text>In electronics, cryoelectronics or cryolectronics is the study of superconductivity under cryogenic conditions and its applications. It is also described as the operation of power electronic devices at cryogenic temperatures. Practical applications of this field is quite broad, although it is particularly useful in areas where cryogenic environment exists such as superconducting technologies and spacecraft design. It also became a special branch of cryophysics and cryotechnics and plays a role in operations that require high resolution and precision measurements.

Cryoelectronic devices include the SQUIDs or the superconducting quantum interference devices, which represent magnetic sensors of highest sensitivity. They serve as the backbone of applications that range from materials evaluation, geological and environmental prospecting, and medical diagnostics, among others.

== Marketable Uses ==
A key factor in production of new technologies is whether it is cost effective and useful. Devices that make use of cryoelectronics and the applications of superconductivity such as computers, information transmission lines, and magnetocardiography have potential for commercial value outside of a few specific devices for singular purposes. At the same time, the presence of other devices made with highly specialized functions can be competitively marketed without having to rely on a large market.
* Devices and activities that are derived from this and have marketable functions include:
* Magnetometry: this includes magnetocardiography, communications, geomagnetism, and submarine detection. This includes several more specialized functions and some broader functions that can be derived from cryoelectronics.
* Computers: being able to mass-produce cheap, compact tunneling cryotron provides a diverse base of uses and marketing. 
* Electrical Metrology: Allowing for more precise readings and measurements of current, voltage, power, and attenuation ratio, this will allow for more precise control over maintaining legal levels which provides a specific need and use for the technology.
* Galvanometers: a range of measurement devices that will be of use to the scientific field though more precise measurements in specialized fields.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2004 was the 49th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Istanbul, Turkey, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot; by Sertab Erener. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), the contest was held at the Abdi İpekçi Arena, and, for the first time, consisted of a semi-final on 12 May, and a final on 15 May 2004. The two live shows were presented by Turkish actors Korhan Abay and Meltem Cumbul. It was the first time that Turkey had hosted the contest, 29 years after the country made its debut, and was also the first time since the contest in Birmingham that it was not hosted in the host country&#x27;s capital city.

Thirty-six countries participated in the contest, beating the record of twenty-six in the previous edition. Albania, Andorra, Belarus and Serbia and Montenegro took part for the first time this year. The old relegation system was replaced with a semi-final format. This was done in order to accommodate the increasing number of countries who wished to participate. The new format allowed all countries to participate every year, rather than being forced to sit out per the relegation rules, which had been the standard since . Because of this, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Monaco and Switzerland all returned to the contest, Monaco not having competed since .

The winner was Ukraine with the song &quot;Wild Dances&quot;, performed by Ruslana who wrote it with her husband Oleksandr Ksenofontov. This was Ukraine&#x27;s first victory in the contest, only one year after the country made its debut in 2003. Serbia and Montenegro, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and Sweden rounded out the top five. Due to the expansion of the contest, this year was the first time in which a non-winning entry scored over 200 points. Prior to this contest, only the winning entries in 1994 and 1997 had passed this mark. In this contest, the top 3 songs all got over 200 points. An official CD was released and, for the first time, the entire contest was released on DVD which included the semi-final and the final.

== Location ==
Istanbul was chosen as the host city of the 2004 edition following Turkey&#x27;s victory in the contest in Riga, Latvia with Sertab Erener&#x27;s &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot;. Originally the Mydonose Showland, an entertainment center in the form of a giant pyramid tent near Atatürk International Airport, was chosen by host broadcaster TRT to host the event, but the venue was later changed to the Abdi İpekçi Arena as the contest approached due to its bigger capacity. The Mydonose Showland, later renamed the Istanbul Show Center, was demolished in 2009 after a fire destroyed it in April that year. The Abdi İpekçi Arena was closed after the 2016/2017 basketball season and was demolished in early 2018.

A number of other venues in the city were reported as possible venues, these included Ataköy Athletics Arena and Istanbul Lütfi Kırdar International Convention and Exhibition Center (ICEC), the latter of which lost out to Mydonose Showland. Istanbul Chamber of Commerce president Mehmet Yıldırım offered the World Trade Center Istanbul (WTCI) as a venue for the event and confirmed that the Chamber would also provide financial support for the contest&#x27;s organisation.

== Participating countries ==
This year&#x27;s Eurovision contest was the first to be a two-day event, with one qualifying round held on a Wednesday and the grand final held on the following Saturday. Under this new format, byes into the final were given to the &#x27;Big 4&#x27;; , , and the (as the largest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union) and the ten highest placed finishers in the contest.

, , and participated in the contest for the first time, with returning after a 25-year absence. were due to return after an absence of 11 years, but later pulled out after money issues arose between RTL and the EBU. was also due to return after last participating in 1998, but ultimately they did not take part in the contest. Hungary would eventually return to the contest the following year, while Luxembourg would not return to the contest until 2024.

All participating countries had the right to vote in both the qualifying round and the grand final. This was the first year in which all 36 participating countries voted based on a public phone vote, in the final. However , and did not broadcast the semi-final (as they were not participating in it) and therefore did not give votes for it like the other thirty-three countries. In Belgium, the French-language RTBF did not broadcast the semi-final, but the Dutch-language VRT did. Monaco&#x27;s televoting results in the semi-final were rendered invalid and a back-up jury had to be used, but no problems occurred in the final.

=== Returning artists ===
== Format ==
===Visual design===

The contest&#x27;s new official generic logo was used for the first time this year, with the heart-shaped flag in the centre due to be changed for future contests. The slogan for Istanbul&#x27;s contest was &quot;Under the Same Sky&quot;, which communicated the importance of a united Europe and Turkish integration.

=== Voting structure ===
Every country in the competition, including those who did not qualify for the final, were allowed to vote for other countries. After all performances were completed, each country opened their phone lines to allow their viewers to vote for their favourite song. Voting for the country in which you are situated is not allowed, however. Each country awarded points based on the number of votes cast for each song: the song which received the most viewer votes was awarded 12 points, the second 10 points, the third 8 points and then 7, 6, 5, etc. down to 1.

In the event of a tie, the number of countries to vote for the tying songs would be counted, and the song having the most countries awarding points to it, would be the winner. In the event of a further tie, then the previously used method of counting back on the number of 12 points, 10 points etc., would be used to find an eventual winner.

This was also the first year that the scores were only re-read by the hosts in one language. Before 2004 every point was repeated in French and English, but due to 36 countries voting, and more in years to come, in 2004 to save time the hosts only re-read each score in one language. This was in the opposite of the original country representative spoke in.

== Contest overview ==

=== Semi-final ===
The semi-final was held on 12 May 2004 at 21:00 (CET). 22 countries performed and all participants voted except France, Poland and Russia who opted not to broadcast the show.

A new ABBA video was shown in the semi-final, briefly outlining how ABBA started and what the response was of the first record company they approached. It featured small puppets of the band performing snippets of their songs (the voices being the ones of the band) and featured Rik Mayall as the record company manager. Due to copyright purposes, this was cut from the Eurovision Song Contest DVD and released separately. References to the video before it was shown were also cut.


=== Final ===
The finalists were:
* the four automatic qualifiers , , and the ;
* the top 10 countries from the 2003 contest (other than the automatic qualifiers);
* the top 10 countries from the 2004 semi-final.

The final was held on 15 May 2004 at 21:00 (CET) and was won by .

In the semi-final and the final, Meltem Cumbul warmed up the audience with a sing-a-long of Eurovision classic &quot;Nel blu dipinto di blu (Volare)&quot;, originally performed by Domenico Modugno. Sertab Erener returned to the stage in the final to perform &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot;, the 2003 winning song, and one of her new songs called &quot;Leave&quot;. Sertab also interviewed contestants in the green room. The Turkish dance ensemble Fire of Anatolia performed as the interval act.


==== Spokespersons ====
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson to announce its respective country&#x27;s points in the final. The voting order in the 2004 contest was determined alphabetically by each country&#x27;s ISO two-letter country code.

== Broadcasts ==

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.


== Incidents ==
Just before the Slovenian entry was about to be performed, the Turkish broadcaster accidentally took a commercial break which meant the Slovenian song was not heard by Turkish viewers. There were technical problems when in a short hiatus halfway through the songs used for the advertising break the hosts tried to contact various parties in Europe. They tried contacting Germany, Spain and Turkey, but in the end were only able to get a response from Germany. During the Romanian postcard introduction, the information for the Romanian entry appeared on the screen, but was quickly taken away. A final minor hiccup occurred when, on her way to present the winner the trophy, Sertab Erener got her shoe stuck in a speaker grill by the side of the stage and had to be freed by stagehands. However this did not delay proceedings, and other than the above the show ran smoothly.

An hour after the semi-final had been aired, the European Broadcasting Union discovered that there had been problems with the vote counting in Monaco and Croatia. Digame, an affiliate of Deutsche Telekom, who had been responsible for processing all the votes (from 2004), reported that they had encountered problems with their calculation software, and there was a problem with text message voting in Croatia. When the votes were counted, results showed that Croatia had awarded themselves 4 points, which is against Eurovision rules. Later, an official EBU statement read that there had been technical problems at the side of the Croatian mobile service provider, who neglected to delete the illegal votes from the results. Consequently, some votes were not counted in the results announced at the end of the broadcast of the semi-final. When the results were corrected to include these additional votes, they were found not to have affected which countries had qualified for the final.

This year was also notable as it was the first year that Turkey voted for Cyprus and the second year in a row that Cyprus voted for Turkey. When the country presented its votes no map of the island was shown although all other presenters were preceded with their country being highlighted on a map. This was probably due to Turkey&#x27;s recognition of the northern half of the island as an independent republic, which is not recognised by any other state.

In addition to the main winner&#x27;s trophy, the AP Awards and the Marcel Bezençon Awards were contested during the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest.

===AP Awards===

===Marcel Bezençon Awards===
The Marcel Bezençon Awards, organised since 2002 by Sweden&#x27;s then-Head of Delegation and 1992 representative Christer Björkman, and 1984 winner Richard Herrey, honours songs in the contest&#x27;s final. The awards are divided into three categories: the Artistic Award which was voted by previous winners of the contest, the Composer Award, and the Press Award.

== Official album ==
Eurovision Song Contest: Istanbul 2004 was the official compilation album of the 2004 contest, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by EMI Records and CMC International on 26 April 2004. The album featured all 36 songs that entered in the 2004 contest, including the semi-finalists that failed to qualify into the grand final.

<text>Claudia Beni (born 30 May 1986) is a Croatian pop singer, born in Opatija.

==Biography==
At the time when she first participated in Dora, the national finals for the Eurovision Song Contest, Claudia was only 12, but she was already an experienced band singer having performed all over Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Montenegro with the Teens - formerly known as Mići rokeri (Little Rockers).

After receiving the 2002 Porin prize, Claudia broke away from the Teens. Her first 12-song solo album “Claudia” was released just before the summer of 2002. The singles “Tako hrabar da me ostaviš” (Brave Enough To Leave Me) (one of the songs in the Best New Album awarded at the Split Festival 2001), “Ili ona ili ja” (Either Her or Me) (Zagrebfest 2001), and “Led” (Ice) (HRF 2002) gave Claudia further notability in the national music industry.

In 2003, Claudia won the Dora 2003 with the song &quot;Više nisam tvoja&quot;, and thus gaining the right to represent Croatia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 in Latvia. At Eurovision in Latvia, she finished in 15th place.

Claudia has also worked together with another member of the Croatian pop scene, Ivana Banfić, singing the song “Hrvatice vas vole” (Croatian Women Love You), dedicated to the national football team during the World Cup in Japan which enjoyed no success.

She returned to Dora in 2006, singing &quot;Samo ti mi ostani&quot;.

She retired from music industry in 2008. She briefly returned in 2013 as a part of band Koktelsi, but retired again in 2015.

<doc id="233636" wikidata="Q1349283" url="?curid=233636" title="Spherical Earth">
<text>Spherical Earth or Earth&#x27;s curvature refers to the approximation of the figure of the Earth to a sphere. The concept of a spherical Earth gradually displaced earlier beliefs in a flat Earth during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. The figure of the Earth is more accurately described as an ellipsoid, which was realized in the early modern period.

==Cause==

Earth is massive enough that the pull of gravity maintains its roughly spherical shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the centrifugal force caused by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an oblate ellipsoid.

===Formation===
The Solar System formed from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more supernovas that produced heavy elements by nucleosynthesis. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the potential energy of their collisions and in-falling as heat. The protoplanetary disk also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to Earth&#x27;s internal heat budget. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.

A sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by Earth&#x27;s rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an ellipsoid, which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth&#x27;s shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.

The liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as planetary differentiation. This event is known as the iron catastrophe; the most abundant heavier elements were iron and nickel, which now form the Earth&#x27;s core.

===Later shape changes and effects===
Though the surface rocks of Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the outer core of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; volcanic and tectonic activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of calderas. Meteors also cause impact craters and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release from these processes halts, then they tend to erode away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. Weather powered by solar energy can also move water, rock, and soil to make Earth slightly out of round.

Earth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to Earth. This is what causes tides in the oceans&#x27; water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.

==History of concept and measurement==
The spherical shape of the Earth was known and measured by astronomers, mathematicians, and navigators from a variety of literate ancient cultures, including the Hellenic World, and Ancient India. Greek ethnographer Megasthenes, , has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans of India believed in a spherical Earth as the center of the universe. The knowledge of the Greeks was inherited by Ancient Rome, and Christian and Islamic realms in the Middle Ages. Circumnavigation of the world in the Age of Discovery provided direct evidence. Improvements in transportation and other technologies refined estimations of the size of the Earth, and helped spread knowledge of it.

The earliest documented mention of the concept dates from around the 5th century BC, when it appears in the writings of Greek philosophers. In the 3rd century BC, Hellenistic astronomy established the roughly spherical shape of Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth&#x27;s circumference. This knowledge was gradually adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. A practical demonstration of Earth&#x27;s sphericity was achieved by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano&#x27;s circumnavigation (1519–1522).

The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a flat Earth: In early Mesopotamian mythology, the world was portrayed as a disk floating in the ocean with a hemispherical sky-dome above, and this forms the premise for early world maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus. Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered ziggurat or cosmic mountain, alluded to in the Avesta and ancient Persian writings (see seven climes).

The realization that the figure of the Earth is more accurately described as an ellipsoid dates to the 17th century, as described by Isaac Newton in &quot;Principia&quot;. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 (Delambre, Everest). The modern value as determined by the US DoD World Geodetic System since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.

==Measurement and representation==
Geodesy, also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of Earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, Earth tides, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.

Geodesy is primarily concerned with positioning and the gravity field and geometrical aspects of their temporal variations, although it can also include the study of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Especially in the German speaking world, geodesy is divided into geomensuration (&quot;Erdmessung&quot; or &quot;höhere Geodäsie&quot;), which is concerned with measuring Earth on a global scale, and surveying (&quot;Ingenieurgeodäsie&quot;), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.

Earth&#x27;s shape can be thought of in at least two ways:
* as the shape of the geoid, the mean sea level of the world ocean; or
* as the shape of Earth&#x27;s land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.

As the science of geodesy measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an oblate spheroid, a specific type of ellipsoid. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing mass concentrations beneath Earth&#x27;s surface.

<text>David Ionovich Bronstein (; February 19, 1924 – December 5, 2006) was a Soviet chess player. Awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950, he narrowly missed becoming World Chess Champion in 1951. Bronstein was one of the world&#x27;s strongest players from the mid-1940s into the mid-1970s, and was described by his peers as a creative genius and master of tactics. He was also a renowned chess writer; his book &quot;Zurich International Chess Tournament 1953&quot; is widely considered one of the greatest chess books ever written.

== Early life ==
David Bronstein was born in Bila Tserkva, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, to Jewish parents. Growing up in a poor family, he learned chess at the age of six from his grandfather. As a youth in Kiev, he was trained by the renowned International Master Alexander Konstantinopolsky. He finished second in the Kiev Championship when he was only 15, and achieved the Soviet Master title at the age of 16 for his second-place result in the 1940 Ukrainian SSR Chess Championship, behind Isaac Boleslavsky, with whom he became close friends both on and off the chessboard. His first wife was Olga Ignatieva one of the strongest female chess players of the 1950s. He went on to marry Boleslavsky&#x27;s daughter, Tatiana, in 1984.

After completing high school in spring 1941, his plans to study mathematics at Kiev University were interrupted by the spread of World War II throughout eastern Europe in the early 1940s. He had begun play in the 1941 semifinal of the Soviet Championship, but this event was cancelled as war began. Shortly after the war&#x27;s conclusion, he began attending Leningrad Polytechnical Institute where he studied for approximately one year.

Judged unfit for military service, Bronstein spent the war performing various jobs; this included doing some reconstruction of war-damaged buildings, and other jobs of a clerical or laboring nature. Also during the war, his father, Johonon, was unfairly imprisoned for several years in the Gulag and was detained without substantial evidence of committing any crimes, it was later revealed. The rumor that Bronstein was related to the former Soviet leader Leon Trotsky (whose real family name was Bronstein), was treated as unconfirmed, but doubtful, by Bronstein in his book &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1995). This belief could have explained the imprisonment of Bronstein&#x27;s father.

== Towards Grandmaster ==
With the tide turning towards an eventual Soviet war victory over the Nazi invaders, Bronstein was able to once again play some competitive chess. His first top-standard Soviet event was the 1944 USSR Championship, where he won his individual game against eventual winner (and soon-to-be world champion) Mikhail Botvinnik. Bronstein moved to Moscow as the war wound up. Then seen as a promising but essentially unproven young player, one of dozens in the deep Soviet vanguard, he raised his playing level dramatically to place third in the 1945 USSR Championship. This result earned him a place on the Soviet team; he won both his games played on board ten, helping the Soviet team achieve victory in the famous 1945 US vs. USSR radio chess match. He then competed successfully in several team matches, and gradually proved he belonged in the Soviet chess elite. Bronstein tied for first place in the Soviet Championships of both 1948 and 1949.

== World Title Challenger (1948–1951) ==
Bronstein&#x27;s first major international tournament success occurred at the Saltsjöbaden Interzonal of 1948, which he won. His qualifying place in this event came through nominations from foreign chess federations. He earned his Grandmaster title in 1950, when FIDE, the World Chess Federation, formalized the process. His Interzonal win qualified him for the Candidates&#x27; Tournament of 1950 in Budapest. Bronstein became the eventual Candidates&#x27; winner over Boleslavsky in a (Moscow) 1950 playoff match, following two overtime match games, after the two had tied in Budapest, and then again remained level over the 12 scheduled match games.

The period 1945–1950 saw a meteoric rise in Bronstein&#x27;s development, as he reached the World Chess Championship challenge match, in 1951.

== 1951 World Championship match against Botvinnik ==
Bronstein is widely considered to be one of the greatest players not to have won the World Championship. He came close to that goal when he tied the 1951 World Championship match 12–12 with Mikhail Botvinnik, the reigning champion. Each player won five games, and the remaining 14 games were drawn.

In a match where the lead swung back and forth several times, the two players tested each other in a wide variety of opening formations, and every game (except the 24th) was full-blooded and played hard to a clear finish. Bronstein often avoided lines he had favoured in earlier events, and frequently adopted Botvinnik&#x27;s own preferred variations. This strategy seemed to catch Botvinnik by surprise; the champion had not played competitively for three years since winning the title in 1948. The quality of play was very high by both players, although Botvinnik would later complain of his own weak play. He only grudgingly acknowledged Bronstein&#x27;s huge talent. Bronstein claimed four of his five match wins by deep combinational play, winning before adjournment in highly complex fashion. He led by one point with two games to go, but lost the 23rd game and drew the final (24th) game. Under FIDE rules, the title remained with the holder, and Bronstein was never to come so close again.

Botvinnik wrote that Bronstein&#x27;s failure was caused by a tendency to underestimate endgame technique, and a lack of ability in simple positions. Botvinnik won four virtually level endgames after the adjournments, and his fifth win came in an endgame that Bronstein resigned at move 40. These adjourned games made up four of Botvinnik&#x27;s five match wins; Botvinnik had no more than a minimal advantage in these games when they were adjourned at move 40.

Bronstein&#x27;s father was sometimes secretly in the audience during the 1951 title match games, at a time when he was not officially permitted in Moscow.

== 1953 Candidates ==
Bronstein challenged throughout at the 1953 Candidates Tournament in Switzerland and finished tied for second-through-fourth places, together with Paul Keres and Samuel Reshevsky, two points behind the winner Vasily Smyslov. Bronstein&#x27;s book on the tournament is considered a classic.

It has been speculated that there was pressure on the Soviet players to collude, to ensure that a Soviet player would win. Even in the wake of glasnost, however, Bronstein only partially confirmed these rumors in his public statements or writings, admitting only to &#x27;strong psychological pressure&#x27; being applied, and that it was up to Bronstein himself whether to decide to give in to this pressure. In his final book &quot;Secret Notes&quot;, published in 2007, shortly after his death, Bronstein went further and alleged that he and Keres were pressured to draw their games with Smyslov, in order to ensure that Smyslov would win ahead of Reshevsky (see ).

== Career after 1953 ==

The 1953 Candidates result qualified him directly for the 1955 Gothenburg Interzonal, which he won with an unbeaten score. From there it was on to another near miss in the 1956 Candidates&#x27; tournament in Amsterdam, where he wound up in a large tie for third through seventh places, behind winner Smyslov and runner-up Keres.

Bronstein had to qualify for the 1958 Interzonal, and did so by placing third at the USSR Championship, Riga, 1958. At the 1958 Interzonal in Portorož, Bronstein, who had been picked as clear pre-event favourite by Bobby Fischer, missed moving on to the 1959 Candidates&#x27; by half a point, dropping a last-round game to the much weaker Filipino Rodolfo Tan Cardoso, when the electrical power failed due to a thunderstorm during the game, and he was unable to regain concentration. Bronstein missed qualification at the Soviet Zonal stage for the 1962 cycle. Then at the Amsterdam 1964 Interzonal, Bronstein scored very well, but only three Soviets could advance, by a FIDE rule, and he finished behind countrymen Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, and Boris Spassky, who finished as the joint winners, along with Larsen. His last Interzonal was at age 49 when he finished sixth at Petropolis 1973.

Bronstein took many first prizes in tournaments, among the most notable being the Soviet Chess Championships of 1948 (jointly with Alexander Kotov) and 1949 (jointly with Smyslov). He also tied for second place at the Soviet Championships of 1957 and 1964–65. He tied first with Mark Taimanov at the World Students&#x27; Championship in 1952 at Liverpool. Bronstein was also a six-time winner of the Moscow Championships, and represented the USSR at the Olympiads of 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1958, winning board prizes at each of them, and losing just one of his 49 games in those events. Along the way he won four Olympiad team gold medals. In the 1954 team match against the US (held in New York), Bronstein scored an almost unheard-of sweep at this level of play, winning all four of his games on second board.

Further major tournament victories were achieved at Hastings 1953–54, Belgrade 1954, Gotha 1957, Moscow 1959, Szombathely 1966, East Berlin 1968, Dnepropetrovsk 1970, Sarajevo 1971, Sandomierz 1976, Iwonicz Zdrój 1976, Budapest 1977, and Jūrmala 1978.

== Legacy and later years ==
David Bronstein wrote many chess books and articles, and had a regular chess column in the Soviet newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; for many years. He was perhaps most highly regarded for his famous authorship of &quot;Zurich International Chess Tournament 1953&quot; (English translation 1979). This book was an enormous seller in the USSR, going through many reprints, and is regarded among the very best chess books ever written. In 1995, he co-authored the autobiographical &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, with his friend Tom Fürstenberg. Both have become landmarks in chess publishing history; Bronstein sought to amplify the ideas behind the players&#x27; moves rather than burdening the reader with pages of analysis of moves that never made it onto the scoresheet. Bronstein&#x27;s romantic vision of chess was shown with his very successful adoption of the rarely seen King&#x27;s Gambit in top-level competition. His pioneering theoretical and practical work (along with Boleslavsky and Efim Geller) in transforming the King&#x27;s Indian Defence from a distrusted, obscure variation into a popular major system should be remembered, and is evidenced in his key contribution to the 1999 book &quot;Bronstein on the King&#x27;s Indian&quot;. Bronstein played an exceptionally wide variety of openings during his long career, on a scale comparable with anyone else who ever reached the top level.
Two more variations are named after him. In the Caro-Kann Defence, the Bronstein–Larsen Variation goes 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6. In the Scandinavian Defence, the Bronstein Variation goes 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qd8.

Bronstein refused to sign a group letter denouncing the 1976 defection of Viktor Korchnoi, and he paid a personal price for this independence, as his state-paid Master&#x27;s stipend was suspended, and he was also barred from major tournaments for more than a year. He was virtually banned from high-class events for several years in the mid-1980s.

Bronstein was a chess visionary. He was an early advocate of speeding up competitive chess. In 1973 he introduced the idea of adding a small time increment for each move made, a variant of which has become very popular and is implemented on almost all digital chess clocks. He challenged computer programs at every opportunity, usually achieving good results.

Bronstein enjoyed experimenting with unusual and offbeat openings such as the King&#x27;s Gambit and Latvian Gambit; however, he generally did not play them in serious games. Like most grandmasters of the 1950s–1960s, he favoured e4 openings, especially the Ruy Lopez, French Defence, and Sicilian Defence. Although he had an extensive knowledge of openings and opening theory, his endgame technique was considered less reliable.

In later years Bronstein continued to stay active in tournament play, often in Western Europe after the breakup of the USSR. He maintained a very good standard (jointly winning the Hastings Swiss of 1994–95 at the age of 70), wrote several important chess books, and inspired young and old alike with endless simultaneous displays, a warm, gracious attitude, and glorious tales of his own rich chess heritage. Bronstein died on December 5, 2006, in Minsk, Belarus, of complications from high blood pressure.

His final book, nearly complete when he died, was published in 2007: &quot;Secret Notes&quot;, by David Bronstein and Sergei Voronkov, Zürich 2007, Edition Olms, . In its introduction, Garry Kasparov, a fervent admirer of Bronstein&#x27;s chess contributions, offers his opinion that Bronstein, based on his play, should have won the 1951 match against Botvinnik.

=== Best combination ===
During the 1962 Moscow vs. Leningrad Match Bronstein played the top board for the Moscow team. With the white pieces he defeated Viktor Korchnoi in a game that ended with a tactic he later described as &quot;one of the best combinations in my life, if not the best&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newinchess2007/1&quot;&gt;New In Chess, 2007/1.

== Notable games ==
*Sergei Belavenets vs. Bronstein, USSR Championship semifinal, Rostov-on-Don 1941, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Fianchetto Variation (E67), 0–1 The 17-year-old Bronstein meets the Chairman of the USSR Classification Committee, who had just awarded him the title of Master.
*Ludek Pachman vs. Bronstein, tt Prague 1946, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Fianchetto Variation (E67), 0–1 A stunning original tactical onslaught which attracted worldwide acclaim.
*Bronstein vs. Isaac Boleslavsky, Candidates&#x27; Playoff Match, Moscow 1950, game 1, Grunfeld Defence (D89), 1–0 Bronstein offers a far-seeing exchange sacrifice, which ties Black up, leading to a beautiful strategical win.
*Mikhail Botvinnik vs. Bronstein, World Championship Match, Moscow 1951, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Rubinstein Variation (E47), 0–1 Although Bronstein had a slight minus record against Botvinnik, he beat Botvinnik several times with the black pieces. Here&#x27;s one of his wins from their 1951 World Championship match.
*Bronstein vs. Mikhail Botvinnik, World Championship Match, Moscow 1951, game 22, Dutch Defence, Stonewall Variation (A91), 1–0 A very deep combination exploits Black&#x27;s back-rank weakness, giving Bronstein a one-game lead with two to play.
*Samuel Reshevsky vs. Bronstein, Zurich Candidates&#x27; 1953, King&#x27;s Indian, Fianchetto Variation (E68), 0–1 Beforehand, Bronstein was ordered by Soviet chess authorities to win this crucial game, in order to stop Reshevsky&#x27;s chances of winning the tournament. He gives it everything he has, and triumphs over stout defense. This game was chosen by Grandmaster Ulf Andersson as his favourite game by another player and he analyses it in the book &quot;Learn from the Grandmasters&quot;.
*Bronstein vs. Paul Keres, Goteborg Interzonal 1955, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Rubinstein Variation (E41), 1–0 A dramatic game between two attacking geniuses.
*Itzak Aloni vs. Bronstein, Moscow Olympiad 1956, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Saemisch Variation (E85), 0–1 This virtuoso game sees Bronstein sacrifice three pawns to open queenside lines into Aloni&#x27;s king position.

*Stefan Brzozka vs. Bronstein, USSR 1963, Dutch Defence, Leningrad Variation (A88), 0–1 A surprising and deep positional breakthrough. The most interesting part of the game starts with White&#x27;s 42nd move, trying to sacrifice an exchange in order to achieve a seemingly sterile blocked position.
*Lev Polugaevsky vs. Bronstein, USSR 1971, English Opening, Symmetrical Variation (A34), 0–1 Bronstein offers an original, problematic pawn sacrifice, which Polugaevsky accepts, leaving him tied up for the rest of the game; Bronstein converts his positional advantage with deep tactics.
*Bronstein vs. Ljubomir Ljubojevic, Petropolis Interzonal 1973, Alekhine&#x27;s Defence, Four Pawns&#x27; Attack (B03), 1–0 A long-range rook sacrifice eventually brings home the point in scintillating style to win the First Brilliancy Prize.
*Bronstein vs. Viktor Kupreichik, USSR Championship semifinal, Minsk 1983, King&#x27;s Indian Defence (E90), 1–0 Kupreichik goes toe-to-toe with Bronstein in the King&#x27;s Indian, and the old master shows the young one a trick or two!
*Bronstein vs. Ivan Sokolov, Pancevo 1987, Grunfeld Defence, Russian Variation (D98), 1–0 Another young master experiences Bronstein&#x27;s aging yet potent chess powers.
*Stuart Conquest vs. Bronstein, London 1989, CaroKann Defence (B10), 0–1 A dazzling tactical display leaves White helpless in only 26 moves.
*Bronstein vs. Walter Browne, Reykjavik 1990, Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation (B99), 1–0 In a very deep theoretical variation, Bronstein comes up with some new ideas, and even Najdorf-guru Browne, a six-time U.S. champion, can&#x27;t find his way.

<text>The World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard used in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. The current version, WGS 84, defines an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system and a geodetic datum, and also describes the associated Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) and World Magnetic Model (WMM). The standard is published and maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

==History==
Efforts to supplement the various national surveying systems began in the 19th century with F.R. Helmert&#x27;s book (&quot;Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy&quot;). Austria and Germany founded the (Central Bureau of International Geodesy), and a series of global ellipsoids of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, Hayford 1910 and 1924).

A unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:
* International space science and the beginning of astronautics.
* The lack of inter-continental geodetic information.
* The inability of the large geodetic systems, such as European Datum (ED50), North American Datum (NAD), and Tokyo Datum (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis
* Need for global maps for navigation, aviation, and geography.
* Western Cold War preparedness necessitated a standardised, NATO-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO Standardisation Agreement

=== WGS 60===
In the late 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, together with scientists of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term &quot;datum&quot; as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor&#x27;s measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.
In accomplishing WGS 60, a combination of available surface gravity data, astro-geodetic data and results from HIRAN and Canadian SHORAN surveys were used to define a best-fitting ellipsoid and an earth-centered orientation for each initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.) The sole contribution of satellite data to the development of WGS 60 was a value for the ellipsoid flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.

Prior to WGS 60, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method. To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic deflections and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and gravimetric geoids. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS 60.

===WGS 66===
Improvements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of Irene Fischer and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy mapping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface gravity observations, results from the extension of triangulation and trilateration networks, and large amounts of Doppler and optical satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening ( determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis ( determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° × 5° mean free air gravity anomaly field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.

=== WGS 72===
After an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale least squares adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.

The largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy&#x27;s Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also used which included camera (Baker–Nunn) and some laser ranging.

The surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° × 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.

The astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.

The Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.

The value for the semimajor axis () of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is . The adoption of an -value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the committee, an -value of and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.

In the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.

===WGS 84===

In the early 1980s, the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community as well as within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. Observations from Doppler, satellite laser ranging and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced least squares method called collocation that allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth&#x27;s gravity field, measurements such as the geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, and dynamic Doppler.

The new world geodetic system was called WGS 84. It is the reference system used by the Global Positioning System. It is geocentric and globally consistent within . Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) maintained by the IERS are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS 84.

The WGS 84 reference ellipsoid was based on GRS 80, but it contains a very slight variation in the inverse flattening, as it was derived independently and the result was rounded to a different number of significant digits. This resulted in a tiny difference of in the semi-minor axis.
The following table compares the primary ellipsoid parameters.

==Definition==

The coordinate origin of WGS 84 is meant to be located at the Earth&#x27;s center of mass; the uncertainty is believed to be less than .
The WGS 84 meridian of zero longitude is the IERS Reference Meridian, 5.3 arc seconds or east of the Greenwich meridian at the latitude of the Royal Observatory. (This is related to the fact that the local gravity field at Greenwich does not point exactly through the Earth&#x27;s center of mass, but rather &quot;misses west&quot; of the center of mass by about 102 meters.) The longitude positions on WGS 84 agree with those on the older North American Datum 1927 at roughly 85° longitude west, in the east-central United States.

The WGS 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius = at the equator and flattening = . The refined value of the WGS 84 gravitational constant (mass of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere included) is = . The angular velocity of the Earth is defined to be = .

This leads to several computed parameters such as the polar semi-minor axis which equals = , and the first eccentricity squared, = .

==Updates and new standards==
The original standardization document for WGS 84 was Technical Report 8350.2, published in September 1987 by the Defense Mapping Agency (which later became the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). New editions were published in September 1991 and July 1997; the latter edition was amended twice, in January 2000 and June 2004. The standardization document was revised again and published in July 2014 by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency as NGA.STND.0036. These updates provide refined descriptions of the Earth and realizations of the system for higher precision.

The original WGS84 model had an absolute accuracy of 1–2 meters. WGS84 (G730) first incorporated GPS observations, taking the accuracy down to 10 cm/component rms. All following revisions including WGS84 (G873) and WGS84 (G1150) also used GPS.

WGS 84 (G1762) is the sixth update to the WGS reference frame.

WGS 84 has most recently been updated to use the reference frame G2296, which was released on 7 January 2024 as an update to G2139, now aligned to both the ITRF2020, the most recent ITRF realization, and the IGS20, the frame used by the International GNSS Service (IGS). G2139 was aligned with the IGb14 realization of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2014 and uses the new IGS Antex standard. 

Updates to the original geoid for WGS 84 are now published as a separate Earth Gravitational Model (EGM), with improved resolution and accuracy. Likewise, the World Magnetic Model (WMM) is updated separately. The current version of WGS 84 uses EGM2008 and WMM2020.

Solution for Earth orientation parameters consistent with ITRF2014 is also needed (IERS EOP 14C04).

<doc id="233656" wikidata="Q188906" url="?curid=233656" title="Chiton">
<text>Chitons () are marine molluscs of varying size in the class Polyplacophora ( ), formerly known as Amphineura. About 940 extant and 430 fossil species are recognized.

They are also sometimes known as sea cradles or coat-of-mail shells or suck-rocks, or more formally as loricates, polyplacophorans, and occasionally as polyplacophores.

Chitons have a shell composed of eight separate shell plates or valves. These plates overlap slightly at the front and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, the shell provides protection at the same time as permitting the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and even allows the animal to curl up into a ball when dislodged from rocks. The shell plates are encircled by a skirt known as a girdle.

==Habitat==

Chitons live worldwide, from cold waters through to the tropics. They live on hard surfaces, such as on or under rocks, or in rock crevices.

Some species live quite high in the intertidal zone and are exposed to the air and light for long periods. Most species inhabit intertidal or subtidal zones, and do not extend beyond the photic zone, but a few species live in deep water, as deep as .

Chitons are exclusively and fully marine, in contrast to the bivalves, which were able to adapt to brackish water and fresh water, and the gastropods which were able to make successful transitions to freshwater and terrestrial environments.

==Morphology==

===Shell===
All chitons bear a protective dorsal shell that is divided into eight articulating aragonite valves embedded in the tough muscular girdle that surrounds the chiton&#x27;s body. Compared with the single or two-piece shells of other molluscs, this arrangement allows chitons to roll into a protective ball when dislodged and to cling tightly to irregular surfaces. In some species the valves are reduced or covered by the girdle tissue. The valves are variously colored, patterned, smooth, or sculptured. 


The most anterior plate is crescent-shaped, and is known as the cephalic plate (sometimes called a head plate, despite the absence of a complete head). The most posterior plate is known as the anal plate (sometimes called the tail plate, although chitons do not have tails.)

The inner layer of each of the six intermediate plates is produced anteriorly as an articulating flange, called the articulamentum. This inner layer may also be produced laterally in the form of notched insertion plates. These function as an attachment of the valve plates to the soft body. A similar series of insertion plates may be attached to the convex anterior border of the cephalic plate or the convex posterior border of the anal plate.

The sculpture of the valves is one of the taxonomic characteristics, along with the granulation or spinulation of the girdle.

After a chiton dies, the individual valves which make up the eight-part shell come apart because the girdle is no longer holding them together, and then the plates sometimes wash up in beach drift. The individual shell plates from a chiton are sometimes known as butterfly shells due to their shape.

=== Girdle ornament ===
The girdle may be ornamented with scales or spicules which, like the shell plates, are mineralized with aragonite — although a different mineralization process operates in the spicules to that in the teeth or shells (implying an independent evolutionary innovation). This process seems quite simple in comparison to other shell tissue; in some taxa, the crystal structure of the deposited minerals closely resembles the disordered nature of crystals that form inorganically, although more order is visible in other taxa.

The protein component of the scales and sclerites is minuscule in comparison with other biomineralized structures, whereas the total proportion of matrix is &#x27;higher&#x27; than in mollusc shells. This implies that polysaccharides make up the bulk of the matrix. The girdle spines often bear length-parallel striations.

The wide form of girdle ornament suggests it serves a secondary role; chitons can survive perfectly well without them. Camouflage or defence are two likely functions. Certainly species such as some members of the genus &quot;Acanthochitona&quot; bear conspicuous paired tufts of spicules on the girdle. The spicules are sharp, and if carelessly handled, easily penetrate the human skin, where they detach and remain as a painful irritant.

Spicules are secreted by cells that do not express engrailed, but these cells are surrounded by engrailed-expressing cells. These neighbouring cells secrete an organic pellicle on the outside of the developing spicule, whose aragonite is deposited by the central cell; subsequent division of this central cell allows larger spines to be secreted in certain taxa.
The organic pellicule is found in most polyplacophora (but not basal chitons, such as &quot;Hanleya&quot;) but is unusual in aplacophora. Developmentally, sclerite-secreting cells arise from pretrochal and postrochal cells: the 1a, 1d, 2a, 2c, 3c and 3d cells. The shell plates arise primarily from the 2d micromere, although 2a, 2b, 2c and sometimes 3c cells also participate in its secretion.

===Internal anatomy===
The girdle is often ornamented with spicules, bristles, hairy tufts, spikes, or snake-like scales. The majority of the body is a snail-like foot, but no head or other soft parts beyond the girdle are visible from the dorsal side.
The mantle cavity consists of a narrow channel on each side, lying between the body and the girdle. Water enters the cavity through openings in either side of the mouth, then flows along the channel to a second, exhalant, opening close to the anus. Multiple gills hang down into the mantle cavity along part or all of the lateral pallial groove, each consisting of a central axis with a number of flattened filaments through which oxygen can be absorbed.

The three-chambered heart is located towards the animal&#x27;s hind end. Each of the two auricles collects blood from the gills on one side, while the muscular ventricle pumps blood through the aorta and round the body.

The excretory system consists of two nephridia, which connect to the pericardial cavity around the heart, and remove excreta through a pore that opens near the rear of the mantle cavity. The single gonad is located in front of the heart, and releases gametes through a pair of pores just in front of those used for excretion.
The mouth is located on the underside of the animal, and contains a tongue-like structure called a radula, which has numerous rows of 17 teeth each. The teeth are coated with magnetite, a hard ferric/ferrous oxide mineral. The radula is used to scrape microscopic algae off the substratum. The mouth cavity itself is lined with chitin and is associated with a pair of salivary glands. Two sacs open from the back of the mouth, one containing the radula, and the other containing a protrusible sensory subradular organ that is pressed against the substratum to taste for food.

Cilia pull the food through the mouth in a stream of mucus and through the oesophagus, where it is partially digested by enzymes from a pair of large pharyngeal glands. The oesophagus, in turn, opens into a stomach, where enzymes from a digestive gland complete the breakdown of the food. Nutrients are absorbed through the linings of the stomach and the first part of the intestine. The intestine is divided in two by a sphincter, with the latter part being highly coiled and functioning to compact the waste matter into faecal pellets. The anus opens just behind the foot.

Chitons lack a clearly demarcated head; their nervous system resembles a dispersed ladder. No true ganglia are present, as in other molluscs, although a ring of dense neural tissue occurs around the oesophagus. From this ring, nerves branch forwards to innervate the mouth and subradula, while two pairs of main nerve cords run back through the body. One pair, the pedal cords, innervate the foot, while the palliovisceral cords innervate the mantle and remaining internal organs.

Some species bear an array of tentacles in front of the head.

===Senses===
The primary sense organs of chitons are the subradular organ and a large number of unique organs called aesthetes. The aesthetes consist of light-sensitive cells just below the surface of the shell, although they are not capable of true vision. In some cases, however, they are modified to form ocelli, with a cluster of individual photoreceptor cells lying beneath a small aragonite-based lens. Each lens can form clear images, and is composed of relatively large, highly crystallographically aligned grains to minimize light scattering. An individual chiton may have thousands of such ocelli. These aragonite-based eyes make them capable of true vision, though research continues as to the extent of their visual acuity. It is known that they can differentiate between a predator&#x27;s shadow and changes in light caused by clouds. An evolutionary trade-off has led to a compromise between the eyes and the shell; as the size and complexity of the eyes increase, the mechanical performance of their shells decrease, and vice versa.

A relatively good fossil record of chiton shells exists, but ocelli are only present in those dating to or younger; this would make the ocelli, whose precise function is unclear, likely the most recent eyes to evolve.

Although chitons lack osphradia, statocysts, and other sensory organs common to other molluscs, they do have numerous tactile nerve endings, especially on the girdle and within the mantle cavity.

The order Lepidopleurida also have a pigmented sensory organ called the Schwabe organ. Its function remains largely unknown, and has been suggested to be related to that of a larval eye.

However, chitons lack a cerebral ganglion.

==Homing ability==
Similar to many species of saltwater limpets, several species of chiton are known to exhibit homing behaviours, journeying to feed and then returning to the exact spot they previously inhabited. The method they use to perform such behaviors has been investigated to some extent, but remains unknown. One theory has the chitons remembering the topographic profile of the region, thus being able to guide themselves back to their home scar by a physical knowledge of the rocks and visual input from their numerous primitive eyespots.
The sea snail &quot;Nerita textilis&quot; (like all gastropods) deposits a mucus trail as it moves, which a chemoreceptive organ is able to detect and guide the snail back to its home site. It is unclear if chiton homing functions in the same way, but they may leave chemical cues along the rock surface and at the home scar which their olfactory senses can detect and home in on. Furthermore, older trails may also be detected, providing further stimulus for the chiton to find its home.

The radular teeth of chitons are made of magnetite, and the iron crystals within these may be involved in magnetoreception, the ability to sense the polarity and the inclination of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Experimental work has suggested that chitons can detect and respond to magnetism.

==Culinary uses==
Chitons are eaten in several parts of the world. This includes islands in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad, Tobago, The Bahamas, St. Maarten, Aruba, Bonaire, Anguilla and Barbados, as well as in Bermuda. They are also traditionally eaten in certain parts of the Philippines, where it is called kibet if raw and chiton if fried. Indigenous people of the Pacific coasts of North America eat chitons. They are a common food on the Pacific coast of South America and in the Galápagos. The foot of the chiton is prepared in a manner similar to abalone. Some islanders living in South Korea also eat chiton, slightly boiled and mixed with vegetables and hot sauce. Aboriginal people in Australia also eat chiton; for example they are recorded in the Narungga Nation Traditional Fishing Agreement.

==Life habits==

A chiton creeps along slowly on a muscular foot. It has considerable power of adhesion and can cling to rocks very powerfully, like a limpet.

Chitons are generally herbivorous grazers, though some are omnivorous and some carnivorous. They eat algae, bryozoans, diatoms, barnacles, and sometimes bacteria by scraping the rocky substrate with their well-developed radulae.

A few species of chitons are predatory, such as the small western Pacific species &quot;Placiphorella velata&quot;. These predatory chitons have enlarged anterior girdles. They catch other small invertebrates, such as shrimp and possibly even small fish, by holding the enlarged, hood-like front end of the girdle up off the surface, and then clamping down on unsuspecting, shelter-seeking prey.
===Reproduction and life cycle===

Chitons have separate sexes, and fertilization is usually external. The male releases sperm into the water, while the female releases eggs either individually, or in a long string. In most cases, fertilization takes place either in the surrounding water, or in the mantle cavity of the female. Some species brood the eggs within the mantle cavity, and the species &quot;Callistochiton viviparus&quot; even retains them within the ovary and gives birth to live young, an example of ovoviviparity.

The egg has a tough spiny coat, and usually hatches to release a free-swimming trochophore larva, typical of many other mollusc groups. In a few cases, the trochophore remains within the egg (and is then called lecithotrophic – deriving nutrition from yolk), which hatches to produce a miniature adult. Unlike most other molluscs, there is no intermediate stage, or veliger, between the trochophore and the adult. Instead, a segmented shell gland forms on one side of the larva, and a foot forms on the opposite side. When the larva is ready to become an adult, the body elongates, and the shell gland secretes the plates of the shell. Unlike the fully grown adult, the larva has a pair of simple eyes, although these may remain for some time in the immature adult.

===Predators===
Animals which prey on chitons include humans, seagulls, sea stars, crabs, lobsters and fish.

==Evolutionary origins==
Chitons have a relatively good fossil record, stretching back to the Cambrian, with the genus &quot;Preacanthochiton&quot;, known from fossils found in Late Cambrian deposits in Missouri, being classified as the earliest known polyplacophoran. However, the exact phylogenetic position of supposed Cambrian chitons is highly controversial, and some authors have instead argued that the earliest confirmed polyplacophorans date back to the Early Ordovician. &quot;Kimberella&quot; and &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; of the Precambrian and Cambrian may be related to ancestral polyplacophorans. &quot;Matthevia&quot; is a Late Cambrian polyplacophoran preserved as individual pointed valves, and sometimes considered to be a chiton, although at the closest, it can only be a stem-group member of the group.
Based on this and co-occurring fossils, one plausible hypothesis for the origin of polyplacophora has that they formed when an aberrant monoplacophoran was born with multiple centres of calcification, rather than the usual one. Selection quickly acted on the resultant conical shells to form them to overlap into protective armour; their original cones are homologous to the tips of the plates of modern chitons.

The chitons evolved from multiplacophora during the Palaeozoic, with their relatively conserved modern-day body plan being fixed by the Mesozoic.

The earliest fossil evidence of aesthetes in chitons comes from around 400 Ma, during the Early Devonian.
==History of scientific investigation==
Chitons were first studied by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Since his description of the first four species, chitons have been variously classified. They were called Cyclobranchians (round arm) in the early 19th century, and then grouped with the aplacophorans in the subphylum Amphineura in 1876. The class Polyplacophora was named by de Blainville 1816.
==Etymology==
The name chiton is Neo-Latin derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;khitōn&quot;, meaning tunic (which also is the source of the word chitin). The Ancient Greek word &quot;khitōn&quot; can be traced to the Central Semitic word &quot;*kittan&quot;, which is from the Akkadian words &quot;kitû&quot; or &quot;kita&#x27;um&quot;, meaning flax or linen, and originally the Sumerian word &quot;gada&quot; or &quot;gida&quot;.

The Greek-derived name Polyplacophora comes from the words &quot;poly-&quot; (many), &quot;plako-&quot; (tablet), and &quot;-phoros&quot; (bearing), a reference to the chiton&#x27;s eight shell plates.

==Taxonomy==
Most classification schemes in use today are based, at least in part, on &quot;Pilsbry&#x27;s Manual of Conchology&quot; (1892–1894), extended and revised by Kaas and Van Belle (1985–1990).

Since chitons were first described by Linnaeus (1758), extensive taxonomic studies at the species level have been made. However, the taxonomic classification at higher levels in the group has remained somewhat unsettled.

The most recent classification, by Sirenko (2006), is based not only on shell morphology, as usual, but also other important features, including aesthetes, girdle, radula, gills, glands, egg hull projections, and spermatozoids. It includes all the living and extinct genera of chitons.

Further resolution within the Chitonida has been recovered through molecular analysis.

This system is now generally accepted.

==Phylogeny==
Chiton phylogeny has gone relatively underexplored compared to the more charismatic classes of molluscs, and as such is still somewhat poorly understood. The relationships between orders and superfamilies has been made clear thanks to phylogenomics, but interfamilial relationships are still largely unknown because of the lack of sampling from all families.
