<text>The Commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory, is the head of government of the British Antarctic Territory, a British Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. The commissioner is appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

== History ==
Prior to 1962, the area was a part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies and as such was administered by the Governor of the Falkland Islands. The British Antarctic Territory was established as a separate British overseas territory in 1962.

<doc id="238839" wikidata="Q379842" url="?curid=238839" title="Tetrodotoxin">
<text>Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin. Its name derives from Tetraodontiformes, an order that includes pufferfish, porcupinefish, ocean sunfish, and triggerfish; several of these species carry the toxin. Although tetrodotoxin was discovered in these fish, it is found in several other animals (e.g., in blue-ringed octopuses, rough-skinned newts, and moon snails). It is also produced by certain infectious or symbiotic bacteria like &quot;Pseudoalteromonas&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, and &quot;Vibrio&quot; as well as other species found in symbiotic relationships with animals and plants.

Although it produces thousands of intoxications annually and several deaths, it has shown efficacy for the treatment of cancer-related pain in phase II and III clinical trials.

Tetrodotoxin is a sodium channel blocker. It inhibits the firing of action potentials in neurons by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes and blocking the passage of sodium ions (responsible for the rising phase of an action potential) into the neuron. This prevents the nervous system from carrying messages and thus muscles from contracting in response to nervous stimulation.

Its mechanism of actionselective blocking of the sodium channelwas shown definitively in 1964 by Toshio Narahashi and John W. Moore at Duke University, using the sucrose gap voltage clamp technique.

== Sources in nature ==
Apart from their bacterial species of most likely ultimate biosynthetic origin (see below), tetrodotoxin has been isolated from widely differing animal species, including:

* all octopuses and cuttlefish in small amounts, but specifically several species of the blue-ringed octopus, including &quot;Hapalochlaena maculosa&quot; (where it was called &quot;maculotoxin&quot;),
* various pufferfish species,
* certain angelfish, 
* species of &quot;Nassarius&quot; gastropods,
* species of Naticidae (moon snails),
* several starfish, including &quot;Astropecten&quot; species,
* several species of xanthid crabs.
* species of Chaetognatha (arrow worms),
* species of Nemertea (ribbon worms),
* a polyclad flatworm,
* land planarians of the genus &quot;Bipalium&quot;,
* toads of the genus &quot;Atelopus&quot;,
* toads of the genus &quot;Brachycephalus&quot;,
* the eastern newt (&quot;Notophthalmus viridescens&quot;) 
* the western or rough-skinned newts (&quot;Taricha&quot;; wherein it was originally termed &quot;tarichatoxin&quot;),

Tarichatoxin was shown to be identical to TTX in 1964 by Mosher et al., and the identity of maculotoxin and TTX was reported in &quot;Science&quot; in 1978, and the synonymity of these two toxins is supported in modern reports (e.g., at &quot;Pubchem&quot; and in modern toxicology textbooks) though historic monographs questioning this continue in reprint.

The toxin is variously used by animals as a defensive biotoxin to ward off predation, or as both a defensive and predatory venom (e.g., in octopuses, chaetognaths, and ribbon worms). Even though the toxin acts as a defense mechanism, some predators such as the common garter snake have developed insensitivity to TTX, which allows them to prey upon toxic newts.

The association of TTX with consumed, infecting, or symbiotic bacterial populations within the animal species from which it is isolated is relatively clear; presence of TTX-producing bacteria within an animal&#x27;s microbiome is determined by culture methods, the presence of the toxin by chemical analysis, and the association of the bacteria with TTX production by toxicity assay of media in which suspected bacteria are grown. As Lago et al. note, &quot;there is good evidence that uptake of bacteria producing TTX is an important element of TTX toxicity in marine animals that present this toxin.&quot; TTX-producing bacteria include &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas&quot;, &quot;Alteromonas&quot;, &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, and &quot;Vibrio&quot; species; in the following animals, specific bacterial species have been implicated:


The association of bacterial species with the production of the toxin is unequivocal – Lago and coworkers state, &quot;[e]ndocellular symbiotic bacteria have been proposed as a possible source of eukaryotic TTX by means of an exogenous pathway&quot;, and Chau and coworkers note that the &quot;widespread occurrence of TTX in phylogenetically distinct organisms... strongly suggests that symbiotic bacteria play a role in TTX biosynthesis&quot; – although the correlation has been extended to most but not all animals in which the toxin has been identified. To the contrary, there has been a failure in a single case, that of newts (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;), to detect TTX-producing bacteria in the tissues with highest toxin levels (skin, ovaries, muscle), using PCR methods, although technical concerns about the approach have been raised. Critically for the general argument, &quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot; puffers captured and raised in laboratory on controlled, TTX-free diets &quot;lose toxicity over time&quot;, while cultured, TTX-free &quot;Takifugu niphobles&quot; puffers fed on TTX-containing diets saw TTX in the livers of the fishes increase to toxic levels. Hence, as bacterial species that produce TTX are broadly present in aquatic sediments, a strong case is made for ingestion of TTX and/or TTX-producing bacteria, with accumulation and possible subsequent colonization and production. Nevertheless, without clear biosynthetic pathways (not yet found in animals, but shown for bacteria), it remains uncertain whether it is simply via bacteria that each animal accumulates TTX; the question remains as to whether the quantities can be sufficiently explained by ingestion, ingestion plus colonization, or some other mechanism.

== Biochemistry ==
Tetrodotoxin binds to what is known as &quot;site 1&quot; of the fast voltage-gated sodium channel. Site 1 is located at the extracellular pore opening of the ion channel. Any molecule bound to this site will block sodium ions from going into the nerve cell through this channel (which is ultimately necessary for nerve conduction). Saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, and several of the conotoxins also bind the same site.

The use of this toxin as a biochemical probe has elucidated two distinct types of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) present in mammals: tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels (TTX-s Na+ channels) and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels (TTX-r Na+ channels). Tetrodotoxin inhibits TTX-s Na+ channels at concentrations of around 1–10 nM, whereas micromolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin are required to inhibit TTX-r Na+ channels. Nerve cells containing TTX-r Na+ channels are located primarily in cardiac tissue, while nerve cells containing TTX-s Na+ channels dominate the rest of the body.

TTX and its analogs have historically been important agents for use as chemical tool compounds, for use in channel characterization and in fundamental studies of channel function. The prevalence of TTX-s Na+ channels in the central nervous system makes tetrodotoxin a valuable agent for the silencing of neural activity within a cell culture.

=== Biosynthesis ===
The biosynthetic route to TTX is only partially understood. It is long known that the molecule is related to saxitoxin, and as of 2011 it is believed that there are separate routes for aquatic (bacterial) and terrestrial (newt) TTX. In 2020, new intermediates found in newts suggest that the synthesis starts with geranyl guanidine in the amphibian; these intermediates were not found in aquatic TTX-containing animals, supporting the separate-route theory. In 2021, the first genome of a TTX-producing bacterium was produced. This &quot;&quot;Bacillus&quot; sp. 1839&quot; was identified as &quot;Cytobacillus gottheilii&quot; using its rRNA sequence. The researcher responsible for this study has not yet identified a coherent pathway but hopes to do so in the future.

=== Resistance ===
Animals that accumulate TTX as a defense mechanism as well as their predators must evolve to be resistant to the effects of TTX. Mutations in the VGSC genes, especially the genes for Nav 1.4 (skeletal muscle VGSC, &quot;TTX-s&quot;), are found in many such animals. These mutations have independently arisen several times, even multiple times in different populations of the same species as seen in the garter snake. They consist of different amino acid substitutions in similar positions, a weak example of convergent evolution caused by how TTX binds to the unmutated VGSC.

Another path to TTX resistance is toxin-binding proteins that hold onto TTX tightly enough to prevent it reaching the vulnerable VGSCs. Various proteins that bind TTX have been found in pufferfish, crabs, and gastropods. There are also proteins that bind saxitoxin (STX), a toxin with a similar mode of action.

== Chemical synthesis ==

In 1964, a team of scientists led by Robert B. Woodward elucidated the structure of tetrodotoxin. The structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography in 1970. Yoshito Kishi and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of racemic tetrodotoxin in 1972. M. Isobe and coworkers and J. Du Bois reported the asymmetric total synthesis of tetrodotoxin in 2003. The two 2003 syntheses used very different strategies, with Isobe&#x27;s route based on a Diels-Alder approach and Du Bois&#x27;s work using C–H bond activation. Since then, methods have rapidly advanced, with several new strategies for the synthesis of tetrodotoxin having been developed.

== Poisoning ==

===Toxicity===
TTX is extremely toxic. The material safety data sheet for TTX lists the oral median lethal dose (LD50) for mice as 334 μg per kg. For comparison, the oral LD50 of potassium cyanide for mice is 8,500 μg per kg, demonstrating that even orally, TTX is more poisonous than cyanide. TTX is even more dangerous if administered intravenously; the amount needed to reach a lethal dose by injection is 8 μg per kg in mice.

The toxin can enter the body of a victim by ingestion, injection, or inhalation, or through abraded skin.

Poisoning occurring as a consequence of consumption of fish from the order Tetraodontiformes is extremely serious. The organs (e.g., liver) of the pufferfish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce the described paralysis of the diaphragm and corresponding death due to respiratory failure. Toxicity varies between species and at different seasons and geographic localities, and the flesh of many pufferfish may not be dangerously toxic.

The mechanism of toxicity is through the blockage of fast voltage-gated sodium channels, which are required for the normal transmission of signals between the body and brain. As a result, TTX causes loss of sensation, and paralysis of voluntary muscles including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, stopping breathing.

=== History ===
The therapeutic uses of puffer fish (tetraodon) eggs were mentioned in the first Chinese pharmacopoeia &quot;Pen-T’so Ching&quot; (The Book of Herbs, allegedly 2838–2698 BC by Shennong; but a later date is more likely), where they were classified as having &quot;medium&quot; toxicity, but could have a tonic effect when used at the correct dose. The principal use was &quot;to arrest convulsive diseases&quot;. In the &quot;Pen-T’so Kang Mu&quot; (Index Herbacea or The Great Herbal by Li Shih-Chen, 1596) some types of the fish Ho-Tun (the current Chinese name for tetraodon) were also recognized as both toxic yet, at the right dose, useful as part of a tonic. Increased toxicity in Ho-Tun was noted in fish caught at sea (rather than river) after the month of March. It was recognized that the most poisonous parts were the liver and eggs, but that toxicity could be reduced by soaking the eggs. (Tetrodotoxin is slightly water-soluble, and soluble at 1 mg/ml in slightly acidic solutions.)

The German physician Engelbert Kaempfer, in his &quot;A History of Japan&quot; (translated and published in English in 1727), described how well known the toxic effects of the fish were, to the extent that it would be used for suicide and that the Emperor specifically decreed that soldiers were not permitted to eat it. There is also evidence from other sources that knowledge of such toxicity was widespread throughout southeast Asia and India.

The first recorded cases of TTX poisoning affecting Westerners are from the logs of Captain James Cook from 7 September 1774. On that date Cook recorded his crew eating some local tropic fish (pufferfish), then feeding the remains to the pigs kept on board. The crew experienced numbness and shortness of breath, while the pigs were all found dead the next morning. In hindsight, it is clear that the crew survived a mild dose of tetrodotoxin, while the pigs ate the pufferfish body parts that contain most of the toxin, thus being fatally poisoned.

The toxin was first isolated and named in 1909 by Japanese scientist Dr. Yoshizumi Tahara. It was one of the agents studied by Japan&#x27;s Unit 731, which evaluated biological weapons on human subjects in the 1930s.

=== Symptoms and treatment ===
The diagnosis of pufferfish poisoning is based on the observed symptomatology and recent dietary history.

Symptoms typically develop within 30 minutes of ingestion, but may be delayed by up to four hours; however, if the dose is fatal, symptoms are usually present within 17 minutes of ingestion. Having pins and needles of the lips and tongue is followed by developing it in the extremities, hypersalivation, sweating, headache, weakness, lethargy, incoordination, tremor, paralysis, bluish skin, loss of voice, difficulty swallowing, and seizures. The gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain; death is usually secondary to respiratory failure. There is increasing respiratory distress, speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits shortness of breath, excess pupil dilation, and abnormally low blood pressure. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and irregular heartbeats may occur. The victim, although completely paralysed, may be conscious and in some cases completely understandable until shortly before death, which generally occurs within 4 to 6 hours (range ~20 minutes to ~8 hours). However, some victims enter a coma.

If the patient survives 24 hours, recovery without any aftereffects will usually occur over a few days.

Therapy is supportive and based on symptoms, with aggressive early airway management. If consumed, treatment can consist of emptying the stomach, feeding the victim activated charcoal to bind the toxin, and taking standard life-support measures to keep the victim alive until the effect of the poison has worn off. Alpha adrenergic agonists are recommended in addition to intravenous fluids to increase the blood pressure; anticholinesterase agents &quot;have been proposed as a treatment option but have not been tested adequately&quot;.

No antidote has been developed and approved for human use, but a primary research report (preliminary result) indicates that a monoclonal antibody specific to tetrodotoxin is in development by USAMRIID that was effective, in the one study, for reducing toxin lethality in tests on mice.

=== Worldwide distribution of toxicity ===

Poisonings from tetrodotoxin have been almost exclusively associated with the consumption of pufferfish from waters of the Indo-Pacific Ocean regions, primarily because equally toxic pufferfishes from other regions are much less commonly eaten. Several reported cases of poisonings, including fatalities, nonetheless involved pufferfish from the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Gulf of California. There have been no confirmed cases of tetrodotoxicity from the Atlantic pufferfish, &quot;Sphoeroides maculatus&quot;, but three studies found extracts from fish of this species highly toxic in mice. Several recent intoxications from these fishes in Florida were due to saxitoxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning with very similar symptoms and signs. The trumpet shell &quot;Charonia sauliae&quot; has been implicated in food poisonings, and evidence suggests it contains a tetrodotoxin derivative. There have been several reported poisonings from mislabelled pufferfish, and at least one report of a fatal episode in Oregon when an individual swallowed a rough-skinned newt &quot;Taricha granulosa&quot; on a dare.

In 2009, a major scare in the Auckland Region of New Zealand was sparked after several dogs died eating &quot;Pleurobranchaea maculata&quot; (grey side-gilled seaslug) on beaches. Children and pet owners were asked to avoid beaches, and recreational fishing was also interrupted for a time. After exhaustive analysis, it was found that the sea slugs must have ingested tetrodotoxin.

====Statistical factors====

Statistics from the Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health indicate 20–44 incidents of fugu poisoning per year between 1996 and 2006 in the entire country, leading to 34–64 hospitalizations and 0–6 deaths per year, for an average fatality rate of 6.8%. Of the 23 incidents recorded within Tokyo between 1993 and 2006, only one took place in a restaurant, while the others all involved fishermen eating their catch. From 2006 through 2009 in Japan there were 119 incidents involving 183 people but only seven people died.

Only a few cases have been reported in the United States, and outbreaks in countries outside the Indo-Pacific area are rare. In Haiti, tetrodotoxin was thought to have been used in voodoo preparations, in so-called zombie poisons. Subsequent careful analysis has however repeatedly called early studies into question on technical grounds, and failed to identify the toxin in any preparation. Discussion of the matter has therefore all but disappeared from the primary literature since the early 1990s. Kao and Yasumoto concluded in the first of their papers in 1986 that &quot;the widely circulated claim in the lay press to the effect that tetrodotoxin is the causal agent in the initial zombification process is without factual foundation.&quot;

Genetic background is not a factor in susceptibility to tetrodotoxin poisoning. This toxicosis may be avoided by not consuming animal species known to contain tetrodotoxin, principally pufferfish; other tetrodotoxic species are not usually consumed by humans.

====Fugu as a food====
Poisoning from tetrodotoxin is of particular public health concern in Japan, where &quot;fugu&quot; is a traditional delicacy. It is prepared and sold in special restaurants where trained and licensed chefs carefully remove the viscera to reduce the danger of poisoning. There is potential for misidentification and mislabelling, particularly of prepared, frozen fish products.

=== Food analysis ===
The mouse bioassay developed for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) can be used to monitor tetrodotoxin in pufferfish and is the current method of choice. An HPLC method with post-column reaction with alkali and fluorescence has been developed to determine tetrodotoxin and its associated toxins. The alkali degradation products can be confirmed as their trimethylsilyl derivatives by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Tetrodotoxin may be quantified in serum, whole blood or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Most analytical techniques involve mass spectrometric detection following gas or liquid chromatographic separation.

== Modern therapeutic research ==

Tetrodotoxin has been investigated as a possible treatment for cancer-associated pain. Early clinical trials demonstrate significant pain relief in some patients.

It has also been studied in relation to migraine headaches. Mutations in one particular TTX-sensitive Na+ channel are associated with some migraine headaches, although it is unclear as to whether this has any therapeutic relevance for most people with migraine.

Tetrodotoxin has been used clinically to relieve negative affects associated with heroin withdrawal.

== Regulation ==

In the U.S., tetrodotoxin appears on the select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services, and scientists must register with HHS to use tetrodotoxin in their research. However, investigators possessing less than 500 mg are exempt from regulation.

==Popular culture==
Tetrodotoxin serves as a plot device for characters to fake death, as in the films &quot;Hello Again&quot; (1987), &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; (1988), &quot;The A-Team&quot; (2010), &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), and War (2019), and in episodes of &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1985), &quot;Nikita&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot; (season 7, episode 6, where the antidote is &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; leaf), &quot;&quot; (season 4, episode 9, &quot;Boo&quot;), and &quot;Chuck&quot;. In &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot; (2009) and &quot;Alex Cross&quot; (2012), its paralysis is presented as a method of assisting torture. The toxin was also referenced in &quot;synthetic form&quot; in season 1, episode 2, of the series &quot;FBI&quot;. The toxin is used as a weapon in both the second season of &quot;Archer&quot;, in &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; and in the &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &quot;The Riddle of the Sphinx&quot;. In Columbo, episode 2 of season 7, fugu is used to kill the antagonists victim. In &quot;The Apothecary Diaries&quot; light novel, as well as the respective manga and anime adaptations, fugu toxin is encountered across multiple mystery arcs.

Based on the presumption that tetrodotoxin is not always fatal, but at near-lethal doses can leave a person extremely unwell with the person remaining conscious, tetrodotoxin has been alleged to result in zombieism, and has been suggested as an ingredient in Haitian Vodou preparations. This idea first appeared in the 1938 non-fiction book &quot;Tell My Horse&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston in which there were multiple accounts of purported tetrodotoxin poisoning in Haiti by a voodoo sorcerer called the bokor. These stories were later popularized by Harvard-trained ethnobotanist Wade Davis in his 1985 book and Wes Craven&#x27;s 1988 film, both titled &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot;. James Ellroy includes &quot;blowfish toxin&quot; as an ingredient in Haitian Vodou preparations to produce zombieism and poisoning deaths in his dark, disturbing, violent novel &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;. But this theory has been questioned by the scientific community since the 1990s based on analytical chemistry-based tests of multiple preparations and review of earlier reports (see above).

<doc id="238840" wikidata="Q4247132" url="?curid=238840" title="Shimer Great Books School">
<text>Shimer Great Books School (pronounced ) is a Great Books college that is part of North Central College in Naperville, Illinois. Prior to 2017, Shimer was an independent, accredited college on the south side of Chicago, originally founded in 1853. 

Originally founded as the Mount Carroll Seminary in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1853, it became affiliated with the University of Chicago in 1896 and was renamed the Frances Shimer Academy after founder Frances Wood Shimer. It was renamed Shimer College in 1950, when it began offering a four-year curriculum based on the Hutchins Plan of the University of Chicago. After the University of Chicago parted with both Shimer and the Hutchins Plan in 1958, Shimer continued to use a version of that curriculum. The college relocated to Waukegan in 1978 and to Chicago in 2006. In 2017, it was acquired by North Central College which established the Shimer Great Books School to continue offering its curriculum.

Shimer was, until joining North Central College, governed internally by an assembly in which all community members had a vote. In 2016, Shimer announced an agreement to be acquired by North Central College. The agreement came to fruition on June 1, 2017, when Shimer&#x27;s faculty and curriculum were subsumed into North Central as a department known as the Shimer Great Books School of North Central College.

== History ==
In 1852, the pioneer town of Mount Carroll, Illinois, lacking a public school, incorporated the Mount Carroll Seminary with no land, no teachers and no money. The town persuaded Frances Wood and Cindarella Gregory, two schoolteachers from Ballston Spa, New York, to come and teach. On May 11, 1853, the new seminary opened in a local church with eleven students.

Unable to raise sufficient funds locally, the seminary&#x27;s founders borrowed money to construct a building in 1854. They were discouraged by the school&#x27;s finances and sold it to Wood and Gregory, who borrowed money for the purchase. In 1857, Wood married Henry Shimer, a mason who was a creditor of the seminary. Henry left immediately after the nuptials for medical school, securing private lodging upon his return; the new Mrs. Shimer continued to cohabit with Miss Gregory. In 1864, the overcrowded school began accepting female students only.

To ensure the seminary&#x27;s long-term survival, in 1896 Frances Shimer reached an agreement with the University of Chicago in which the school became the Frances Shimer Academy of the University of Chicago and was loosely affiliated with the Baptist Church. She retired to Florida, never returning to the school, and died in 1901. University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper was the first to champion junior colleges in the United States, and in 1907 Shimer became one of the first schools to offer a junior-college program. The two-year junior-college program, operating with the original preparatory program, was accredited in 1920.
The college had a precipitous decline in enrollment and financial stability during and after the Great Depression, weathering the storm under five successive presidents. Its survival was due in part to the reorganization of the six-year preparatory program into a four-year junior college program and in part to steep salary reductions. In 1943, Shimer president Albin C. Bro invited the Department of Education at the University of Chicago to evaluate the college community; its 77 recommendations became the basis for Shimer&#x27;s transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.
The school was renamed Shimer College in 1950, adopting the great-books curriculum then in place at the University of Chicago. The university connection dissolved in 1958 after the latter&#x27;s decision to abandon the great-books plan, and Shimer narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1957. The great-books program at Shimer continued, and the school enjoyed national recognition and a rapid growth in enrollment during the 1960s. In 1963, a &quot;Harvard Educational Review&quot; article listed Shimer as one of 11 colleges with an &quot;ideal intellectual climate&quot;. According to a 1966 article in the education journal &quot;Phi Delta Kappan&quot;, Shimer &quot;present[ed] impressive statistical evidence that their students are better prepared for graduate work in the arts and sciences and in the professions than those who have specialized in particular areas&quot;.

During the late 1960s, Shimer experienced a period of internal unrest known as the Grotesque Internecine Struggle, with disputes over curriculum changes, the extent to which student behavior should be regulated and inadequate fundraising by president Francis Joseph Mullin. Half the faculty and a large portion of the student body left as a result. Its financial problems worsened, and the school&#x27;s survival was uncertain. Although Shimer&#x27;s trustees voted to close the college at the end of 1973, the school was saved by intense student and faculty fundraising. In the school&#x27;s 1977 bankruptcy filing, the trustees, in the words of board chair Barry Carroll, &quot;put responsibility for the school&#x27;s continuing on the shoulders of a very dedicated faculty of 12 and students who volunteered&quot;.
During the 1978 Christmas break, the faculty and 62 students borrowed trucks and moved the college into two &quot;run-down&quot; homes in Waukegan, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago.
Shimer emerged from bankruptcy in 1980. During the next 25 years, the college purchased 12 surrounding homes and the former YWCA facility at Genesee and Franklin Streets to form a makeshift campus and slowly progressed towards financial stability. By 1988 its enrollment had grown from a low of 40 to 114, and income exceeded expenses. In 1991, Shimer received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with the help of NEH chair and core-curriculum advocate Lynne Cheney; the grant revitalized the school&#x27;s fundraising, helping it raise $2 million.

In 2006, Shimer again moved to the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. Although the institutions operated independently, they cooperated closely under a long-term agreement.

Shimer received national attention in 2009, when it was embroiled in &quot;a battle over what some saw as a right-wing attempt to take over its board and administration&quot;. In February 2012 the college announced the appointment of Susan Henking, former professor of religious studies at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, as Shimer&#x27;s 14th president.

In September 2014 Shimer again received media attention when Ben Miller of &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked it as one of the worst colleges in America, according to a formula adjusting graduation rates to the percentage of minority and low-income students and factoring net expense to low-income students. In December 2014 Jon Ronson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; disputed Miller&#x27;s claim, citing Miller&#x27;s assertion that the ranking was &quot;at least partly due to small sample sizes&quot;.

== Academics ==

=== Curriculum history ===
Shimer follows the great-books tradition begun by John Erskine. Erskine&#x27;s Socratic seminar at Columbia University (begun in 1919) impacted his colleague, Mortimer J. Adler, who came to believe that the purpose of education was to engage student minds &quot;in the study of individual works of merit ... accompanied by a discussion of the ideas, the values, and the forms embodied in such products of human art&quot;. Robert Maynard Hutchins, head of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951, brought Adler to the university and implemented a program (known as the Chicago Program and, later, the Hutchins Plan) based on Adler&#x27;s ideas.
The Chicago program comprised sequences in the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences which were supposed to integrate past and present work within these divisions of knowledge. In addition, these sequences were capped by work in philosophy and history. The emphasis in teaching was on small classes with bright students, where discussion could supplant monologue as the dominant pedagogic technique... At the same time, in order to retain high academic standards and contact with the &quot;frontiers of knowledge&quot;, the College&#x27;s pedagogy emphasized reading originals (sometimes although not invariably, defined as Great Books).
Shimer, affiliated with the University of Chicago since 1896, adopted the Hutchins plan (including University of Chicago syllabi, comprehensive examinations and several university instructors) in 1950. When Hutchins left the university in 1951 and it abandoned the Hutchins Plan, Shimer continued to use it and it is still reflected in the college&#x27;s curriculum.

=== Degree program ===
Shimer was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Its core curriculum was a sequence of sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and interdisciplinary studies. Basic-studies courses are generally taken during the first two years, advanced-studies during the final two years and integrative-studies courses in the final year. In addition to core courses students take electives, which offer basic instruction or in-depth work in particular subjects. Students may also take tutorials, with one or two students per course, tailored to their interests and similar in structure to the Oxford tutorial system.

Shimer College students did not pursue traditional majors, instead having broad concentrations in the humanities, natural sciences or social sciences. Within these areas, students could specialize in literature, mathematics, philosophy, political science or psychology.

The school&#x27;s 200-book reading list remained largely faithful to the original Hutchins plan, with new works judiciously added to the core curriculum. These included voices originally overlooked in the formation of the canon, or not yet published when it originated, including Martin Luther King Jr., Carol Gilligan, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault and other contemporary authors. Readings were organized by broad historical and philosophical themes.

Small seminars were the sole form of instruction in all subjects, from mathematics to poetry. Classes were composed of no more than twelve students (the average class size was seven), who read and discussed only source material. In a process Shimer called &quot;shared inquiry&quot;, &quot;the text is the teacher, and thus the faculty member&#x27;s role is to facilitate interaction between the text and the students&quot;. According to a former Shimer professor:
At Shimer, the professor is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage on the stage – encouraging each student to contribute to the intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student was expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other&#x27;s insights, actively taking part in every discussion... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and to the life of the text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.

The curriculum emphasized writing; students were required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and were required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students needed to pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis was required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it could also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students were encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public was invited to the presentations.

=== Special programs ===

==== Early Entrance program ====
The Early Entrance program, which admitted students who had not yet graduated from high school, was pioneered by Hutchins at the University of Chicago in 1937 and adopted by Shimer in 1950. It continued with the support of the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation and the Surdna Foundation. In the past, up to 80 percent of Shimer&#x27;s student body was composed of Early Entrance students.

Early entrants were admitted after the 10th or 11th grade, and followed the regular curriculum. The college considered applications from any interested students, with motivation, willingness to learn and intellectual curiosity the most important qualifications. Shimer encouraged applications from home-schooled students, accommodating their lack of credentials such as transcripts. In 2008, 16 percent of new students were early entrants or home-schooled.

==== Joint programs ====

The Great Books + Law program, introduced in 2007, was offered in conjunction with the Chicago-Kent College of Law (the law school of the Illinois Institute of Technology) and the Vermont Law School and allowed students to complete undergraduate and law degrees in six (instead of seven) years. Shimer had a dual-enrollment program with Harold Washington College, one of the few community colleges in the U.S. with a great-books program. The program allowed HWC students to take a Shimer course, and was intended to encourage students to transfer to Shimer to complete their bachelor&#x27;s degree. Whether these programs will continue at North Central is unknown.

==== Study abroad ====
Shimer first offered a year of study abroad (in Paris) in 1961, and the college has had a biennial program in Oxford since 1963. The Shimer-in-Oxford program allowed third- or fourth-year students to study for one or two semesters in Oxford, supervised by a Shimer professor. Students took a core class each term with the supervising faculty; the rest of their work is completed in tutorials of self-selected subjects under the guidance of academics associated with the University of Oxford. Programs were also offered at least once each in Berlin and Köln during the late 1970s.

==== Teaching Fellows Program ====
The Teaching Fellows Program, now discontinued, was a graduate-level great-books course designed for kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers. Although Shimer does not award graduate degrees, teachers could then earn professional development credit with the program; it complements traditional education courses by providing background knowledge for teachers to impart more content-rich instruction. The program was developed in conjunction with the Core Knowledge Foundation, founded in 1986 by E. D. Hirsch (author of &quot;Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know&quot;) to promote a common core in U.S. elementary education.

=== Faculty ===

In 2014, Shimer had eleven full-time faculty and one part-time faculty member, and the student-faculty ratio was eight to one. All full-time faculty had doctoral degrees. Shimer instructors teach across disciplines; the &quot;ideal is that any faculty member can teach any one of the core courses&quot;.

In 2017, seven Shimer faculty joined the Shimer School of Great Books at North Central College.

=== Admission ===
Shimer applicants were evaluated according to their academic potential, and no minimum grade-point average or test score was required. Applicants were required to write essays analyzing their academic experience and demonstrating their creative talent. These essays and interviews were the primary criteria for admission. The college accepts students it believes will benefit from, and contribute to, its intellectual community. &quot;Barron&#x27;s Profiles of American Colleges&quot; rates Shimer &quot;very competitive plus&quot;. Candidates were counseled before applying, and nearly 90 percent of those who applied were admitted.

In 2010, the average GPA of incoming students was 3.29 out of 4.0. Average composite scores on standardized college-admissions tests were 28 on the ACT (the 92nd percentile) and 1917 on the SAT (the 90th percentile).

=== Tuition and fees ===
In 2014 full-time tuition was $27,491, and the total cost of attendance (including room, board and fees) was $41,615. All students received financial aid, with the average aid package $13,956. As of 2017, tuition and fees for the Shimer School will be identical to those of North Central College.

=== Recognition and rankings ===

Shimer had one of the highest rates of doctoral candidates in the U.S. In a 1998 University of Wisconsin–Madison study, the college had the highest rate of graduates receiving doctoral degrees of any liberal arts college and the third-highest rate of any undergraduate program in the nation. A 2009 report by &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Shimer third in graduate Ph.D. rate among U.S. liberal arts colleges. Studies based on Higher Education Data Sharing Consortium data found that Shimer had the seventh-highest alumni Ph.D. rate of U.S. colleges and universities, and the highest rate for Ph.D.s in linguistics.

Shimer students who took the Graduate Record Exam outscored three out of four potential graduate students, &quot;consistently rank[ing] among the best in the nation in scores on the verbal and analytical portions of the test&quot; with average analytic scores in the 91st percentile.

The conservative &quot;Insight&quot; magazine named Shimer one of its &quot;15 Most Politically-Incorrect Colleges&quot;: &quot;colleges that had strong and effective traditional curricula that were not &#x27;obsessed with the recent educational fads and fetishes such as multiculturalism and diversity. Barron&#x27;s called Shimer one of the 300 best buys in college education, noting that &quot;the success of the Shimer curriculum depends a great deal on the knowledge and skill of the faculty facilitators, who receive accolades ranging from &#x27;fantastic&#x27; to &#x27;brilliant. Shimer was one of the top 50 colleges in &quot;All-American Colleges: Top Schools for Conservatives, Old-Fashioned Liberals, and People of Faith&quot;, which highlights &quot;programs that connect in a special way with the core values of the American founding and the vibrant intellectual traditions of the West&quot;.

In 2007, Shimer joined a national effort by the Education Conservancy to boycott participation in college-ranking surveys. President William Craig Rice said, &quot;What Shimer does well – educating ourselves in on-going dialogue with the greatest minds of the past – can&#x27;t be captured in the &quot;U.S. News&quot; measurements&quot;. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranks Shimer 200th among liberal-arts colleges, based on social mobility, research and service. The college is unranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

== Campus ==
Through May 2017, Shimer was located on the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology. IIT&#x27;s campus is at the intersection of 33rd and State Streets, about south of the Chicago Loop, and borders the Bridgeport and Bronzeville neighborhoods of Chicago&#x27;s Near South Side. 

Shimer occupied on two floors of the former Institute of Gas Technology complex. The complex, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, consists of four buildings (the southernmost formerly hosting the first industrial nuclear reactor in the U.S.) The college had access to the Paul V. Galvin Library, IIT&#x27;s main research library, and Shimer&#x27;s collection of 15,000 books were also housed in the Galvin Library since the school relocated from Waukegan.

As of June 1, 2017, the Shimer School of Great Books of North Central College is located on the campus of North Central in Naperville, Illinois.

== Organization and administration ==

Until its move to become part of North Central College, &quot;As a function of its mission to promote active citizenship&quot; Shimer was &quot;devoted to internal self-governance to an extent that is rare among institutions of higher education&quot;. Since 1977, Shimer has been governed internally by a body known as the Assembly. Begun informally in the years before the move to Waukegan, the Assembly was formalized with a constitution in 1980. Voting members included students, faculty, administrators, staff and trustees; alumni were members, but do not vote. This inclusive model of governance was unique in American higher education.

The Assembly had no independent legal authority, but governed &quot;by virtue of the moral suasion established by communal deliberation&quot;. Its goal was to foster an environment in which &quot;all the top-down bureaucracy of traditional colleges and universities has been replaced by participatory democracy committed to dialogue.&quot; In Chicago, Shimer students participated in the IIT Student Government Association, a liaison between students and university administration and a forum for student opinion.

In addition, Shimer had a Board of Trustees who appointed its presidents – including long serving president Don Moon and Shimer&#x27;s last president Susan E. Henking, who successfully led the College to its new future at North Central College and was awarded an honorary doctorate in April 2017 in recognition of her service.

== Student life ==

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, calling Shimer &quot;one of the smallest liberal arts colleges in the United States&quot;, described its students as &quot;both valedictorians and high school dropouts. What the students share, besides a love of books, is a disdain for the conventional style of education. Many say they did not have a good high school experience.&quot; Shimer students tended to be individualistic, creative thinkers and are encouraged to be inquisitive. The college enrolled 97 students in 2014, about half from Illinois. Of these students 41 were women, 25 percent were students of color and 76 percent were age 24 or over. Forty percent were first-time, full-time college students. Of the full-time students attending for the first time in 2012, 86 percent returned for their second year. Sixty percent of students who entered in 2007 completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in six years.

The college has a tradition of community meals dating back to the Waukegan campus, when the community would meet for potluck meals and discuss matters of general interest. The Orange Horse, Shimer&#x27;s biennial talent show since the 1960s, invites students, faculty and alumni to read poetry, sing, play music or tell jokes, individually or in groups. The Shimer theater program produces plays complementing its curriculum, offering anyone who wants to participate the chance to do so. Recent productions have included Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

In addition to student services at the McCormick Tribune Campus Center and its health and athletic facilities, while located in Chicago Shimer students could participate in the more than 150 student organizations sponsored by IIT (including &quot;Liit Magazine&quot;, IIT&#x27;s student-run literary magazine and IIT&#x27;s on-campus radio station, WIIT, where students can host a show). As students at North Central, Shimerians will have access to the full range of student services and student organizations.

== Alumni ==

Many Shimer alumni continued to graduate school; 50 percent earn master&#x27;s degrees, and 21 percent earn doctorates. Another ten percent attend law school and five percent go to business school. As of 2008, Shimer had 5,615 living alumni. Nearly 25 percent of graduates are employed in education (elementary school through college), seven percent are attorneys and seven percent work in the computer-software industry.

<text>The Trifid Nebula (catalogued as Messier 20 or M20 and as NGC 6514) is an H II region in the north-west of Sagittarius in a star-forming region in the Milky Way&#x27;s Scutum–Centaurus Arm. It was discovered by Charles Messier on June 5, 1764. Its name means &#x27;three-lobe&#x27;. The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars, an emission nebula (the relatively dense, reddish-pink portion), a reflection nebula (the mainly NNE blue portion), and a dark nebula (the apparent &#x27;gaps&#x27; in the former that cause the trifurcated appearance, also designated Barnard 85). Viewed through a small telescope, the Trifid Nebula is a bright and peculiar object, and is thus a perennial favorite of amateur astronomers.

The most massive star that has formed in this region is HD 164492A, an O7.5III star with a mass more than 20 times the mass of the Sun.
This star is surrounded by a cluster of approximately 3100 young stars.

==Characteristics==
The Trifid Nebula was the subject of an investigation by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997, using filters that isolate emission from hydrogen atoms, ionized sulfur atoms, and doubly ionized oxygen atoms. The images were combined into a false-color composite picture to suggest how the nebula might look to the eye.

The close-up images show a dense cloud of dust and gas, which is a stellar nursery full of embryonic stars. This cloud is about
 away from the nebula&#x27;s central star. A stellar jet protrudes from the head of the cloud and is about long. The jet&#x27;s source is a young stellar object deep within the cloud. Jets are the exhaust gasses of star formation and radiation from the nebula&#x27;s central star makes the jet glow.

The images also showed a finger-like stalk to the right of the jet. It points from the head of the dense cloud directly toward the star that powers the Trifid nebula. This stalk is a prominent example of evaporating gaseous globules, or &#x27;EGGs&#x27;. The stalk has survived because its tip is a knot of gas that is dense enough to resist being eaten away by the powerful radiation from the star.

In January 2005, NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope discovered 30 embryonic stars and 120 newborn stars not seen in visible light images.

It is centered about from Earth. Its apparent magnitude is 6.3.

<text>William David Conn (October 8, 1917 – May 29, 1993) was an American professional boxer and Light Heavyweight Champion famed for his fights with Joe Louis. He had a professional boxing record of 63 wins, 11 losses and 1 draw, with 14 wins by knockout. His nickname, throughout most of his career, was &quot;The Pittsburgh Kid.&quot; He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.

==Early career==
Conn debuted as a professional boxer winning on July 20, 1934, against Johnny Lewis, via a knockout in round three.

Conn built a record of 47 wins, 9 losses and 1 draw (tie), with 7 knockouts, before challenging for the world Light Heavyweight title. Along the way, he beat former or future world champions Fritzie Zivic, Solly Krieger and Fred Apostoli, as well as Teddy Yarosz and Young Corbett III.

On July 13, 1939, he won the world light heavyweight championship by outpointing Melio Bettina in New York. Conn defended his title against Bettina and twice against another World Light Heavyweight Champion, Gus Lesnevich, winning each in 15-round decisions. Conn also beat former World Middleweight Champion Al McCoy and heavyweights Bob Pastor, Lee Savold, Gunnar Barlund and Buddy Knox in non-title bouts during his run as World Light Heavyweight Champion.

==Joe Louis Era==
In May 1941, Conn gave up his World Light Heavyweight title to challenge World Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis. Conn attempted to become the first World Light Heavyweight Champion in boxing history to win the World Heavyweight Championship when he and Louis met on June 18 of that year, and incredibly, to do so without going up in weight. The fight became part of boxing&#x27;s lore because Conn held a secure lead on the scorecards leading to round 13. According to many experts and fans who watched the fight, Conn was outmaneuvering Louis up to that point. In a move that Conn would regret for the rest of his life, he tried to go for the knockout in round 13, and instead wound up losing the fight by knockout in that same round himself.
Ten minutes after the fight, Conn told reporters, &quot;I lost my head and a million bucks.&quot; When asked by a reporter why he went for the knockout, Conn replied famously, &quot;What&#x27;s the use of being Irish if you can&#x27;t be thick [i.e. stupid]?&quot; In his long account in Sports Illustrated of the life and boxing career of Conn, sportswriter Frank Deford wrote that afterwards Conn would joke, &quot;I told Joe later, &#x27;Hey, Joe, why didn&#x27;t you just let me have the title for six months?&#x27; All I ever wanted was to be able to go around the corner where the guys are loafing and say, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;m the heavyweight champeen of the world.&#x27; &quot;And you know what Joe said back to me? He said, &#x27;I let you have it for twelve rounds, and you couldn&#x27;t keep it. How could I let you have it for six months?&#x27;&quot;

In 1942, Conn beat Tony Zale and had an exhibition with Louis. World War II was at one of its most important moments, however, and both Conn and Louis were called to serve in the Army. Conn went to war and was away from the ring until 1946.

By then, the public was clamoring for a rematch between him and the still World Heavyweight Champion Louis. This happened, and on June 19, 1946, Conn returned into the ring, straight into a World Heavyweight Championship bout. Before that fight, it was suggested to Louis that Conn might outpoint him because of his hand and foot speed. In a line that would be long-remembered, Louis replied: &quot;He can run, but he can&#x27;t hide.&quot; The fight, at Yankee Stadium, was the first televised World Heavyweight Championship bout ever, and 146,000 people watched it on TV, also setting a record for the most seen world heavyweight bout in history. Most people who saw it agreed that both Conn and Louis&#x27; abilities had eroded with their time spent serving in the armed forces, but Louis was able to retain the crown by a knockout in round eight. Conn&#x27;s career was basically over after this fight, but he still fought two more fights, winning both by knockout in round nine. On December 10, 1948, he and Louis met inside a ring for the last time, this time for a public exhibition in Chicago. Conn would never climb into a ring as a fighter again.

== Personal life ==

Billy married Mary Louise Smith, also from Pittsburgh. Billy did not get along with Mary&#x27;s father, former major league baseball player for the Cincinnati Reds, Jimmy &quot;Greenfield Jimmie&quot; Smith. A fight broke out between them and Conn punched his father-in-law in the head and broke his hand, resulting in postponing the fight with Joe Louis. Frank Deford wrote colorfully about the kitchen brawl in his Sports Illustrated story &quot;The Boxer and the Blonde&quot;.

==Retirement==
Conn appeared in a 1941 movie called &quot;The Pittsburgh Kid&quot;. He maintained his boxing skills into his later years, and at 73-year-old, he stepped into the middle of a robbery at a Pittsburgh convenience store in 1990 after the robber punched the store manager. Conn took a swing at the robber and ended up on the floor of the store, scuffling with him. &quot;You always go with your best punch—straight left,&quot; Conn told television station WTAE afterward. &quot;I think I interrupted his plans.&quot; The robber managed to get away, but not before Conn pulled off his coat, which contained his name and address, making the arrest an easy one. His wife said jumping into the fray was typical of her husband. &quot;My instinct was to get help,&quot; she said at the time. &quot;Billy&#x27;s instinct was to fight.&quot;

Conn was a great friend of Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney.

As he became an older citizen, he participated in a number of documentaries for HBO and was frequently seen at boxing-related activities until his death in 1993, at the age of 75.

Conn was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York.

In April 2017 Mary Louise Conn died, at 94.

==In popular culture==
* A portion of North Craig Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh is named Billy Conn Boulevard.
* Billy Conn is mentioned in the classic movie &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. In the famous scene in the back of the cab—&quot;I could have been a contender.&quot; Rod Steiger (playing Marlon Brando&#x27;s brother) reflects on Brando&#x27;s character Terry&#x27;s early promise as a boxer with the words &quot;You could have been another Billy Conn.&quot;
* Billy Conn is also mentioned in the 1966 Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau classic comedy movie &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;. In the apartment scene where Lemmon asks Boom Boom (Ron Rich) &quot;Where&#x27;d you learn that? Don&#x27;t tell me, your father was a Pullman porter&quot;, for which Boom Boom replies &quot;He was a fighter, light heavyweight. Once went rounds with Billy Conn.&quot;
* Conn played a character named Billy Conn in the 1941 film The Pittsburgh Kid, although it was not a biography.

<doc id="238846" wikidata="Q585983" url="?curid=238846" title="D.O.A. (1950 film)">
<text>D.O.A. is a 1950 American film noir directed by Rudolph Maté, starring Edmond O&#x27;Brien and Pamela Britton. It is considered a classic of the genre. A fatally poisoned man tries to find out who has poisoned him and why. It was the film debuts of Beverly Garland (as Beverly Campbell) and Laurette Luez. In 2004, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Leo C. Popkin produced &quot;D.O.A.&quot; for his short-lived Cardinal Pictures. Due to a filing error, the copyright to the film was not renewed on time, causing it to fall into the public domain: it was subsequently remade as &quot;Color Me Dead&quot; (1969), &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1988), &quot;Dead On Arrival&quot; (2017), and &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (2022).

==Plot==

An opening sequence features Frank Bigelow walking through the long hallway of a police station to report his own murder. From here to the end, the story is told in flashback. Bigelow is a hard-driving accountant and notary public in Banning, California, who decides to escape for a fun vacation in San Francisco. At the hotel, he is invited to join a group of conventioneers for a night out. He ends up at a nightclub, where unnoticed, a stranger swaps his drink for another one. The next morning, he feels extremely ill. Doctors determine that he had ingested poison, a &quot;luminous toxin&quot;, for which no antidote is known.

With only days to live, Bigelow embarks on a desperate search to discover the motive for his poisoning. A call to his secretary Paula provides a possible lead; a Eugene Philips has been urgently trying to contact him. Bigelow travels to Philips&#x27; import-export company in Los Angeles, meeting Halliday, the company comptroller, who says that Philips has committed suicide.

Bigelow locates Eugene Philips&#x27; widow and brother Stanley Philips. Months earlier, Eugene had purchased iridium, a rare, platinum-like metallic element, which had been stolen by a criminal named Majak. The seller was a George Reynolds (or Raymond Rakubian), Majak&#x27;s nephew. As a result of this illegal sale/purchase transaction, Eugene Philips faced criminal charges.

The bill of sale would have cleared Eugene, but has gone missing, and that document had been notarized by Bigelow himself. He learns that Reynolds/Rakubian is now dead. He realizes that someone seems intent on eliminating all evidence of this sale.

That someone turns out, in a plot twist, to be Halliday. Stanley Phillips, who has now been poisoned, reveals that Eugene discovered that his wife and Halliday were having an affair. Mrs. Philips affirms that during a confrontation that turned violent, Halliday threw Eugene over a balcony. To make it look like suicide, the pair insisted that Eugene had killed himself over his legal troubles. When they discovered that exonerating evidence of his innocence existed in the notarized iridium bill of sale, Halliday began disposing of anyone knowing about the document, and that led to Bigelow.

In the final scene, Bigelow tracks Halliday to the Philips company and finds him wearing the same distinctive coat and scarf as the man who switched the drinks. Halliday draws a gun and fires first, but Bigelow fatally shoots him.

Bigelow finishes telling his story and dies. The police detective taking down the report instructs that his file be marked &quot;dead on arrival&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on reviews from 25 critics.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its May 1950 review, described it as a &quot;fairly obvious and plodding recital, involving crime, passion, stolen iridium, gangland beatings and one man&#x27;s innocent bewilderment upon being caught up in a web of circumstance that marks him for death&quot;. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s performance had a &quot;good deal of drive&quot;, while Britton adds a &quot;pleasant touch of blonde attractiveness&quot;.

In 1981 Foster Hirsch carried on a trend of more positive reviews, calling Bigelow&#x27;s search for his own killer &quot;noir&quot; irony at its blackest. He wrote, &quot;One of the film&#x27;s many ironies is that his last desperate search involves him in his life more forcefully than he has ever been before... Tracking down his killer just before he dies — discovering the reason for his death — turns out to be the triumph of his life.&quot; Critic A. K. Rode notes Rudolph Maté&#x27;s technical background, writing:

 D.O.A. reflects the photographic roots of director Rudolph Maté. He compiled an impressive resume as a cinematographer in Hollywood from 1935 (&quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, &quot;Pride of the Yankees&quot;, and &quot;Gilda&quot;, among others) until turning to directing in 1947. The lighting, locations, and atmosphere of brooding darkness were captured expertly by Mate and director of photography Ernest Lazlo.

David Wood of the BBC described the opening as &quot;perhaps one of cinema&#x27;s most innovative opening sequences.&quot; 
Michael Sragow, in a &quot;Salon&quot; web review (2000) of a DVD release of the film, characterized it as a &quot;high-concept movie before its time.&quot; &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; (2008) gave &quot;D.O.A.&quot; 3½ stars (out of 4).

===Accolades===
In 2004, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

The film was nominated for two American Film Institute lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 mystery

==Production==
The shot of Edmond O&#x27;Brien running down Market Street (between 4th and 6th Streets) in San Francisco was a &quot;stolen shot,&quot; taken without city permits, with some pedestrians visibly confused as O&#x27;Brien bumps into them.

&quot;D.O.A.&quot; producer Harry Popkin owned the Million Dollar Theater at the southwest corner of Broadway and Third Street in downtown Los Angeles, directly across the street from the Bradbury Building at 304 South Broadway, where O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s character confronted his murderer. Director Rudolph Maté liberally used Broadway and the Bradbury Building during location shooting and included the Million Dollar Theater&#x27;s blazing marquee in the background. The theater would later serve the same function when Ridley Scott filmed &quot;Blade Runner&quot; at the Bradbury Building.

After &quot;The End&quot; and before the listing of the cast, a credit states the medical aspects of this film are based on scientific fact, and that &quot;luminous toxin is a descriptive term for an actual poison.&quot;

The bop jazz band playing at the Fisherman&#x27;s Club while O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s glass is being spiked was filmed on a Los Angeles soundstage after principal photography was completed. According to Jim Dawson in his 1995 book &quot;Nervous Man Nervous: Big Jay McNeely and the Rise of the Honking Tenor Sax&quot;, the sweating tenor saxophone player was James Streeter, also known as James Von Streeter. Other band members were Shifty Henry (bass), Al &quot;Cake&quot; Wichard (drums), Ray LaRue (piano), and Teddy Buckner (trumpet). However, rather than use the live performance, the music director went back and rerecorded the soundtrack with a big band, not a quintet as seen in the film, led by saxophonist Maxwell Davis. Film score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin.

==Remakes and influence==
The March 16, 1951, radio episode of &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; features a victim reporting his own murder at police headquarters. &quot;D.O.A.&quot; was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the June 21, 1951, broadcast of &quot;Screen Director&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, starring Edmond O&#x27;Brien in his original role.

The film has been remade five times: 
* In Australia in 1969 as &quot;Color Me Dead&quot;, directed by Eddie Davis. Because copyright had lapsed, &quot;Color Me Dead&quot; was basically an exact copy of &quot;D.O.A.&quot;
* In 1988, a new version was released as &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton, with Dennis Quaid as the protagonist.
* In 2006, a modernised action thriller version was released as &quot;Crank&quot;
* In 2017, a new version was released as &quot;Dead On Arrival&quot;.
* In 2022, a new version was released as &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, directed by Kurt St. Thomas with John Doe as the protagonist.

In 2011, the Overtime Theater staged a world-premiere musical based on the classic film noir. &quot;D.O.A. a Noir Musical&quot; was written and adapted by Jon Gillespie and Matthew Byron Cassi, directed by Cassi, with original jazz and blues music composed by Jaime Ramirez and lyrics by Ramirez and Gillespie. The new musical played to sold-out audiences during its five-week run, and received two ATAC Globe Awards in 2012 for &quot;Best Adapted Script&quot; and &quot;Best Original Score.&quot;

<doc id="238849" wikidata="Q851512" url="?curid=238849" title="Permutation matrix">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in matrix theory, a permutation matrix is a square binary matrix that has exactly one entry of 1 in each row and each column with all other entries 0. An permutation matrix can represent a permutation of elements. Pre-multiplying an -row matrix by a permutation matrix , forming , results in permuting the rows of , while post-multiplying an -column matrix , forming , permutes the columns of .

Every permutation matrix &quot;P&quot; is orthogonal, with its inverse equal to its transpose: formula_1. Indeed, permutation matrices can be characterized as the orthogonal matrices whose entries are all non-negative.
== The two permutation/matrix correspondences ==

There are two natural one-to-one correspondences between permutations and permutation matrices, one of which works along the rows of the matrix, the other along its columns. Here is an example, starting with a permutation in two-line form at the upper left:
:formula_2
The row-based correspondence takes the permutation to the matrix formula_3 at the upper right. The first row of formula_3 has its 1 in the third column because formula_5. More generally, we have formula_6 where formula_7 when formula_8 and formula_9 otherwise.

The column-based correspondence takes to the matrix formula_10 at the lower left. The first column of formula_10 has its 1 in the third row because formula_5. More generally, we have formula_13 where formula_14 is 1 when formula_15 and 0 otherwise. Since the two recipes differ only by swapping &quot;i&quot; with &quot;j&quot;, the matrix formula_10 is the transpose of formula_3; and, since formula_3 is a permutation matrix, we have formula_19. Tracing the other two sides of the big square, we have formula_20 and formula_21.

== Permutation matrices permute rows or columns ==
Multiplying a matrix &quot;M&quot; by either formula_3 or formula_10 on either the left or the right will permute either the rows or columns of &quot;M&quot; by either or −1. The details are a bit tricky.

To begin with, when we permute the entries of a vector formula_24 by some permutation , we move the formula_25 entry formula_26 of the input vector into the formula_27 slot of the output vector. Which entry then ends up in, say, the first slot of the output? Answer: The entry formula_28 for which formula_29, and hence formula_30. Arguing similarly about each of the slots, we find that the output vector is
:formula_31
even though we are permuting by formula_32, not by formula_33. Thus, in order to permute the entries by formula_32, we must permute the indices by formula_33. (Permuting the entries by formula_32 is sometimes called taking the &quot;alibi viewpoint&quot;, while permuting the indices by formula_32 would take the &quot;alias viewpoint&quot;.)

Now, suppose that we pre-multiply some &quot;n&quot;-row matrix formula_38 by the permutation matrix formula_10. By the rule for matrix multiplication, the formula_40 entry in the product formula_41 is
:formula_42
where formula_43 is 0 except when formula_44, when it is 1. Thus, the only term in the sum that survives is the term in which formula_45, and the sum reduces to formula_46. Since we have permuted the row index by formula_33, we have permuted the rows of &quot;M&quot; themselves by . A similar argument shows that post-multiplying an &quot;n&quot;-column matrix &quot;M&quot; by formula_3 permutes its columns by .

The other two options are pre-multiplying by formula_3 or post-multiplying by formula_10, and they permute the rows or columns respectively by −1, instead of by .

== The transpose is also the inverse ==
A related argument proves that, as we claimed above, the transpose of any permutation matrix &quot;P&quot; also acts as its inverse, which implies that &quot;P&quot; is invertible. (Artin leaves that proof as an exercise, which we here solve.) If formula_51, then the formula_40 entry of its transpose formula_53 is formula_54. The formula_40 entry of the product formula_56 is then
:formula_57
Whenever formula_58, the formula_59 term in this sum is the product of two different entries in the formula_59 column of &quot;P&quot;; so all terms are 0, and the sum is 0. When formula_61, we are summing the squares of the entries in the formula_25 row of &quot;P&quot;, so the sum is 1. The product formula_56 is thus the identity matrix. A symmetric argument shows the same for formula_64, implying that &quot;P&quot; is invertible with formula_1.

== Multiplying permutation matrices ==
Given two permutations of elements and , the product of the corresponding column-based permutation matrices and is given, as you might expect, by
formula_66
where the composed permutation formula_67 applies first and then , working from right to left:
formula_68
This follows because pre-multiplying some matrix by and then pre-multiplying the resulting product by gives the same result as pre-multiplying just once by the combined formula_69.

For the row-based matrices, there is a twist: The product of and is given by
:formula_70
with applied before in the composed permutation. This happens because we must post-multiply to avoid inversions under the row-based option, so we would post-multiply first by and then by .

Some people, when applying a function to an argument, write the function after the argument (postfix notation), rather than before it. When doing linear algebra, they work with linear spaces of row vectors, and they apply a linear map to an argument by using the map&#x27;s matrix to post-multiply the argument&#x27;s row vector. They often use a left-to-right composition operator, which we here denote using a semicolon; so the composition formula_71 is defined either by
:formula_72
or, more elegantly, by
:formula_73
with applied first. That notation gives us a simpler rule for multiplying row-based permutation matrices:
:formula_74

== Matrix group ==
When is the identity permutation, which has formula_75 for all &quot;i&quot;, both and are the identity matrix.

There are permutation matrices, since there are permutations and the map formula_76 is a one-to-one correspondence between permutations and permutation matrices. (The map formula_77 is another such correspondence.) By the formulas above, those permutation matrices form a group of order under matrix multiplication, with the identity matrix as its identity element, a group that we denote formula_78. The group formula_78 is a subgroup of the general linear group formula_80 of invertible matrices of real numbers. Indeed, for any field &quot;F&quot;, the group formula_78 is also a subgroup of the group formula_82, where the matrix entries belong to &quot;F&quot;. (Every field contains 0 and 1 with formula_83 formula_84 formula_85 formula_86 and formula_87 and that&#x27;s all we need to multiply permutation matrices. Different fields disagree about whether formula_88, but that sum doesn&#x27;t arise.)

Let formula_89 denote the symmetric group, or group of permutations, on {1,2...,} where the group operation is the standard, right-to-left composition &quot;formula_90&quot;; and let formula_91 denote the opposite group, which uses the left-to-right composition &quot;formula_92&quot;. The map formula_93 that takes to its column-based matrix formula_10 is a faithful representation, and similarly for the map formula_95 that takes to formula_3.

==Doubly stochastic matrices==

Every permutation matrix is doubly stochastic. The set of all doubly stochastic matrices is called the Birkhoff polytope, and the permutation matrices play a special role in that polytope. The Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem says that every doubly stochastic real matrix is a convex combination of permutation matrices of the same order, with the permutation matrices being precisely the extreme points (the vertices) of the Birkhoff polytope. The Birkhoff polytope is thus the convex hull of the permutation matrices.

==Linear-algebraic properties==

Just as each permutation is associated with two permutation matrices, each permutation matrix is associated with two permutations, as we can see by relabeling the example in the big square above starting with the matrix &quot;P&quot; at the upper right:
:formula_97
So we are here denoting the inverse of &quot;C&quot; as formula_98 and the inverse of &quot;R&quot; as formula_99. We can then compute the linear-algebraic properties of &quot;P&quot; from some combinatorial properties that are shared by the two permutations formula_100 and formula_101.

A point is fixed by formula_100 just when it is fixed by formula_103, and the trace of &quot;P&quot; is the number of such shared fixed points. If the integer &quot;k&quot; is one of them, then the standard basis vector is an eigenvector of &quot;P&quot;.

To calculate the complex eigenvalues of &quot;P&quot;, write the permutation formula_100 as a composition of disjoint cycles, say formula_105. (Permutations of disjoint subsets commute, so it doesn&#x27;t matter here whether we are composing right-to-left or left-to-right.) For formula_106, let the length of the cycle formula_107 be formula_108, and let formula_109 be the set of complex solutions of formula_110, those solutions being the formula_111 roots of unity. The multiset union of the formula_109 is then the multiset of eigenvalues of &quot;P&quot;. Since writing formula_103 as a product of cycles would give the same number of cycles of the same lengths, analyzing formula_114 would give the same result. The multiplicity of any eigenvalue &quot;v&quot; is the number of &quot;i&quot; for which formula_115 contains &quot;v&quot;. (Since any permutation matrix is normal and any normal matrix is diagonalizable over the complex numbers, the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue &quot;v&quot; are the same.)
From group theory we know that any permutation may be written as a composition of transpositions. Therefore, any permutation matrix factors as a product of row-switching elementary matrices, each of which has determinant −1. Thus, the determinant of the permutation matrix &quot;P&quot; is the sign of the permutation formula_100, which is also the sign of formula_103.

<doc id="238850" wikidata="Q612345" url="?curid=238850" title="Lymphocytosis">
<text>Lymphocytosis is an increase in the number or proportion of lymphocytes in the blood. Absolute lymphocytosis is the condition where there is an increase in the lymphocyte count beyond the normal range while relative lymphocytosis refers to the condition where the proportion of lymphocytes relative to white blood cell count is above the normal range. In adults, absolute lymphocytosis is present when the lymphocyte count is greater than 5000 per microliter (5.0 x 109/L), in older children greater than 7000 per microliter and in infants greater than 9000 per microliter. Lymphocytes normally represent 20% to 40% of circulating white blood cells. When the percentage of lymphocytes exceeds 40%, it is recognized as relative lymphocytosis.

==Causes==

Lymphocytosis is a feature of infection, particularly in children. In the elderly, lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas, often present with lymphadenopathy and a lymphocytosis.

Causes of absolute lymphocytosis include:
* acute viral infections, such as infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis and cytomegalovirus infection
* other acute infections such as pertussis
* some protozoal infections, such as toxoplasmosis and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)
* chronic intracellular bacterial infections such as tuberculosis or brucellosis
* chronic lymphocytic leukemia
* acute lymphoblastic leukemia
* lymphoma
* post-splenectomy state
* CARD11-related congenital B cell lymphocytosis (rare, also known as BENTA disease)

Causes of relative lymphocytosis include:
* age less than 2 years;
* acute viral infections;
* connective tissue diseases,
* thyrotoxicosis,
* Addison&#x27;s disease,
* splenomegaly with splenic sequestration of granulocytes.

==Diagnosis==
Lymphocytosis is usually detected when a complete blood count is obtained. If not provided the lymphocyte count can be calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell (WBC) count by the percentage of lymphocytes found in the differential count. The lymphocyte count can also be directly measured by flow cytometry.

<text>A or (pl. &#x27;) is an [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] [[taboo]], whether of obligation or prohibition, similar to being under a [[vow]] or [[curse]], yet the observance of which can also bring power and blessings. It is also used to mean specifically a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] prohibiting some action.&#x27; are common in Irish and Scottish folklore and mythology, as well as in modern English-language fantasy fiction.

The word originates in Old Irish, also known as Old Gaelic, and retains the same form in Modern Irish (nominative singular &#x27; , nom. plural &quot; &quot;; [[genitive]] sg.&#x27; , gen. pl. &#x27; ). In modern [[Scottish Gaelic]], the spelling has evolved in a slightly different direction (nom. sg.&#x27; , nom. pl. &#x27;, gen. sg.&#x27; or &quot;&quot;). It has also been borrowed into English in both forms (sg. &quot;geas&quot; or &quot;geis&quot; or , pl. &quot;geasa&quot;)).

==In Irish mythology==
A &#x27; can be compared with a curse or paradoxically a gift. If someone under a &#x27; violates the associated taboo, the infractor will suffer dishonor or even death. Conversely, the observing of one&#x27;s &#x27; is believed to bring power. Often, women place &#x27; upon men; in some cases, the woman turns out to be a goddess or other sovereignty figure.

The &#x27; is often a key device in hero tales, such as that of Cú Chulainn in Irish mythology. Traditionally, the doom of heroes comes about due to their violation of their &#x27; either by accident or by having multiple &#x27;, which then come into conflict. For instance, Cú Chulainn has a &#x27; to never eat dog meat, and he is also bound by a &quot;&quot; to eat any food offered to him by a woman. When a hag offers him dog meat, he has no way to emerge from the situation unscathed; this leads to his death.

In some cases, the placing of a &#x27; can lead to tragedy even when it is not violated. &#x27; imposed three &#x27; on Connla, her son with Cú Chulainn: he cannot turn back once he starts his journey; he must not refuse a challenge; and he must never tell anyone his name. She then sent Connla, aged seven, to seek out his father, but he was a child of such extraordinary skill that he was seen as a threat after having defeated all Ulster heroes who met him. Because of the &#x27; placed on him by his mother, he refuses to identify himself, which leads to his own father, Cú Chulainn, killing him in single combat using the Gáe Bulg before recognising too late who he is. He then introduces his dying son to the men of Ulster as a fitting hero.

A &#x27; might appear beneficial by involving a prophecy that a person would die in a particular way so bizarre that they could then avoid their fate for many years. As with Conaire Mór, though, in the tale of &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot;, who strictly observed a number of &#x27;, a small unconnected infraction can escalate to one&#x27;s undoing. By initially making exceptions to crimes of stealing by his foster-brothers contravening &quot;fír flathemon&quot;, the king&#x27;s upholding of true judgement, things proceed until they deliberately contravene a &#x27; of Conaire&#x27;s against marauding in his reign. Though he tries to rectify the situation by exiling them, his fate intervenes, so the remaining &#x27; are involuntarily and accidentally broken one after the other with a sense of gathering doom that cannot be checked.

In the Irish saga of Conchobar mac Nessa, the king is said to have the right to the first night with any marriageable woman and the right to sleep with the wife of anyone who hosted him. This is called the Geis of the king. Whether this right actually existed and was exercised by the Celts is not attested outside the sagas. It is similar to the &quot;&quot; of feudal Europe.

==Welsh mythology==
Considerable similarity exists between the Goidelic &#x27; and the Brythonic &#x27;. This is not surprising given the close origins of many of the variants of Celtic mythology.

For example, the Welsh hero (in one version of his story) was destined to die neither &quot;during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made.&quot; He was safe until his wife, , learning of these foretold conditions, convinced him to show her how he could theoretically be stepping out of a river onto a riverbank sheltered by a roof and put one foot on a goat, and so on, thus enabling the conditions that allowed him to be wounded.

==In popular culture==

&#x27;, &#x27; and derivative words and concepts have appeared in a variety of forms in popular culture.

In &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Governor Weatherby Swann was going to stab the heart of Davy Jones, only for Jones to reveal that he cast a terrible geis upon his heart when he carved it from his body, that if someone stabs the heart then theirs will take its place. The line was cut from the film, but the geis remains in place as the curse of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. With the help of Jack Sparrow, Will Turner stabs the heart and becomes the new captain of the &quot;Dutchman&quot;.

Geasa are widely used in Charles Stross&#x27;s Laundry Files series, especially employed by The Laundry (Britain&#x27;s secret government agency tasked with protecting the realm from supernatural threats) to enforce the loyalty and duty of its agents.

===Parallels in English literature===
Prohibitions and taboos similar to &#x27; are also found in more recent English literature, though they are not described as &#x27; in those texts. For example, in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the title character believes he is safe because &quot;no man of woman born shall harm Macbeth&quot;. However, his nemesis Macduff was &quot;from his mother&#x27;s womb untimely ripp&#x27;d&quot; (i.e., born by Caesarean section), and was therefore not &quot;of woman born&quot;.

Another example is the Witch-King of Angmar from Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, who has a &quot;&quot;-like prophecy described by the Elven hero, Glorfindel: &quot;Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall.&quot; The meaning is then quite literal, for the Witch-king eventually falls at the hands of Éowyn and Meriadoc, one a shieldmaiden of Rohan, and thus not a man but a woman, and the other a hobbit, and thus not a Man as in species.

<text>Rocket Power is an American animated television series created by Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó and produced by Klasky Csupo and Nickelodeon Animation Studio for Nickelodeon. The show centers on the daily lives of Otto, Reggie, Twister and Sam, four pre-adolescent children with an interest in extreme sports such as skateboarding and surfing while also getting into various situations. 

The series aired on Nickelodeon from August 16, 1999 to July 30, 2004.

==Premise==
&quot;Rocket Power&quot; revolves around the day-to-day zany hijinks of a gang of four young and loyal friends; the adventurous and vain sports enthusiast and perfectionist: Oswald &quot;Otto&quot; Rocket; his tomboyish and kind-hearted older sister: Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Rocket; Otto&#x27;s dim-witted but loyal best friend and videographer: Maurice &quot;Twister&quot; Rodriguez; and the brainy techno whiz kid and relative newcomer: Sam &quot;Squid&quot; Dullard — who live in the fictional Southern California beach community of Ocean Shores where they spend their free time playing varied extreme sports (such as Skateboarding, Surfing, Snowboarding, Biking, Street Hockey, etc.), getting into a wide variety of situations and overcoming the trials and challenges of growing up.

Otto and Reggie live with their widowed strict but loving father and veteran surfer, Ray &quot;Raymundo&quot; Rocket, who along with his best friend and business partner, Tito Makani, owns and operates the Shore Shack, a combination burger joint and rental shop where the gang usually hang out. In most episodes, they get involved in competitions, but end up learning their friendship is more important than winning.

==Characters ==
===Main Characters ===

* Oswald &quot;Otto&quot; Rocket (voiced by Joseph Ashton): The self-appointed and brazen leader of the gang. Otto is a skilled, courageous, egotistical and highly competitive extreme-sports enthusiast who is dedicated to the pursuit of athletic perfection in the hopes of achieving his ambition of becoming a world-famous athlete and in turn becoming one of the world&#x27;s greatest action-sports superstars of all time. While he can be short-tempered and selfish at times, Otto is a kind and loyal person at heart and will always help his friends and family when they need it most. Although nothing was confirmed or denied, it has been implied that Otto had developed mutually romantic feelings with Lars and Twister&#x27;s ladylike cousin, Clio.
* Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Rocket (voiced by Shayna Fox): Otto&#x27;s tomboyish and sassy older sister. Reggie is an aspiring publisher and author who writes and owns &quot;The &#x27;Zine&quot;, a blog-type magazine that covers everything from extreme sports to &quot;kid politics.&quot; Reggie is also an all-star athlete like her talented brother and while she is no less skillful and competitive as him, she has a calmer disposition and possesses greater maturity. Reggie tends to be the most sensible and sympathetic member of the gang and she also tends to be the voice of reason within the gang.
* Maurice &quot;Twister&quot; Rodriguez (voiced by Ulysses Cuadra in Seasons 1-3; Gilbert Leal in Season 4): Otto&#x27;s best friend and right-hand man. Twister is not exactly known for his intelligence as not only is he somewhat dim-witted and oblivious, but he also has quite a gullibility streak. But despite his lack of intelligence, Twister has proven that he can be quite clever at times, can keep up with Otto and Reggie in sports and has a real knack for videography and art. He hates being called by his real name and is constantly tormented by his older brother and local bully, Lars.
* Sam &quot;Squid&quot; Dullard (voiced by Sam Saletta in Season 1; Gary LeRoi Gray in Season 2-3; Sean Marquette in Season 4): A Hutchinson, Kansas native and relative newcomer. Sam is nowhere near as athletically gifted as Otto, Reggie and Twister and is usually the most clumsy and timid member of the gang. But what Sam lacks in athletic abilities and self-confidence, he makes up for with his vastly superior intellect, his expert computer programming and electrical engineering skills, and by being a very impressive goaltender whenever he plays street hockey.
* Ray &quot;Raymundo&quot; Rocket (voiced by John Kassir): Raymundo is Otto and Reggie&#x27;s strict but loving forty-something father, legendary surfer and is the owner and operator of a combination burger joint and rental shop called the Shore Shack. He drives a 1962 Mercury Woodie wagon and has developed a fear of dogs after watching the movie &quot;Attack of the 50 Ft. Poodles&quot; back when he was just a kid.
* Tito Makani (voiced by Ray Bumatai): Tito is a retired Hawaiian surfer and self-designed philosopher who not only works side by side with Raymundo to help him run the Shore Shack, but he also provides the gang with helpful advice and valuable life lessons with his own unique brand of wisdom. He usually starts his advice with &quot;Like the ancient Hawaiians say...&quot; Tito has a young nephew named Keoni who occasionally visits Ocean Shores from the Hawaiian Islands to see him.

===Recurring Characters ===
* Lars Rodriguez (voiced by Lombardo Boyar): Lars is Twister&#x27;s delinquent teenage brother who harasses the gang from time to time, bullies Twister on a regular basis and generally spends his free time being up to no good. He is also an extremely competitive athlete and is Otto&#x27;s biggest competitive and social rival. Even though he makes Twister&#x27;s life miserable, Lars has shown that he really does care about him deep down and would never want anything bad to happen to him. Lars is often accompanied by his three goons: Pi Piston, Sputz Ringley and Animal.
* Pi Piston (voiced by Jason Spisak), Sputz Ringley (voiced by Dominic Armato and Jason Spisak) and Animal (voiced by Sam Saletta and John Kassir): Pi Piston, Sputz Ringley and Animal are Lars&#x27; friends and loyal henchmen. Pi is often the voice of reason of the group while Sputz is known for having a speech impediment and speaking in an incomprehensible language. Animal does not officially join the group until the second season and is usually silent.
* Eddie Valentine (voiced by Jordan Blake Warkol): The mysterious and self-proclaimed &quot;Prince of the Netherworld&quot; is an occasional participant in the gang&#x27;s activities and a frequent target of Lars&#x27; bullying.
* Oliver Van Rossum (voiced by David Gallagher): Oliver is a highly intelligent kid who at first is Sam&#x27;s rival in smarts, but eventually becomes a close friend of the gang along with Eddie.
* Officer Shirley (voiced by CCH Pounder in Season 1; Denise Dowse in Seasons 2-4): A seldom-seen police officer who does what she can in order to try to keep the peace. Not so much the long arm of the law but rather the harsh word of the law as Officer Shirley keeps the kids of Ocean Shores in line with equal amounts of tough talk and niceness. She enjoys a slightly flirtatious friendship with Raymundo to whom she often refers to as &quot;Big Ray.&quot;
* Trish and Sherry (both voiced by Lauren Tom): Trish and Sherry are Reggie&#x27;s female friends and are members of the California All-State Girls&#x27; Beach Volleyball Team. They occasionally appear to join in on the gang&#x27;s activities and have played important roles in several episodes.
* Mackenzie Benders (voiced by Rosslynn Taylor-Jordan): A tough-as-nails five-year-old girl.
* Conroy Blanc (voiced by Obba Babatundé): The park manager of the Madtown Skate Park.
* Merv (voiced by Henry Gibson) and Violet Stimpleton (voiced by Edie McClurg): The Rockets&#x27; next-door neighbors.
* Lieutenant Tice Ryan (voiced by Dale Dye): Lieutenant Tice is an Ocean Shores lifeguard who also works as an emergency services coordinator. He is skilled at his job and can often be seen with a megaphone barking orders. While he is shown to be nice and fair, Lieutenant Tice takes his job very seriously.
* Keoni Makani (voiced by Matthew Stephen Liu): Tito&#x27;s young nephew who occasionally visits Ocean Shores from the Hawaiian Islands to spend time with his uncle. Keoni first arrives in Ocean Shores to visit Tito where Otto is originally jealous of him, but Keoni eventually become good friends with Otto and the gang. He is a good school student and is shown to be a capable athlete.
* Clio Rodriguez (voiced by Jamie Maria Cronin): Twister&#x27;s older cousin who is about Reggie&#x27;s age. Clio is the exact opposite of Reggie in the sense that she is more &quot;girly.&quot; Because she openly imposed on Reggie with her beliefs on how girls should act, Reggie goes on the defense. In the first episode where they interact, Clio and Reggie challenge each other to switch their respective competitions and by the end, the girls realize they are not so different from each other and form a strong friendship after Clio proved herself to be surprisingly good at ice hockey and Reggie proved herself to be surprisingly good at figure skating. At the end of the last episode where Clio appears, there is a scene implying the start of a budding romance between her and Otto.
* Raoul (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) and Sandy Rodriguez (voiced by Dyana Ortelli): The mother and father of Twister and Lars Rodriguez and the uncle and aunt of Clio and Scotty.
* Paula Dullard (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The mother of Sam Dullard and the ex-wife of Sam&#x27;s father, Doug Dullard.
* Bree &quot;Breezy&quot; Copeley (voiced by Jane Krakowski): A traveling journalist who works as a representative of the Sunset Surf sporting goods company. Breezy first arrives in Ocean Shores to conduct business with the shop below the Shore Shack where Raymundo immediately becomes infatuated with her and it is implied there would have been a relationship if she wasn&#x27;t constantly traveling.
* Trent (voiced by Greg Coolidge): A brand-new resident who moved into Ocean Shores from Gisborne, New Zealand with his family. Trent is a new student in Reggie and Sam&#x27;s class where Reggie along with Trish, Sherry and all of the other girls in their classroom quickly grow a crush on him. He is shown to be a talented surfer and after Trent and Reggie spend time hanging out together, it is revealed that Trent has also grown a crush on Reggie.
* Danielle (voiced by Shayna Fox): Danielle is Otto and Reggie&#x27;s deceased mother and Raymundo&#x27;s first wife when she was still alive.
* Noelani Makani (voiced by Kim Mai Guest): Noelani is Tito&#x27;s cousin from Oahu, Hawaii who becomes Otto and Reggie&#x27;s stepmother and Raymundo&#x27;s second wife in the final episode of the series.

#&quot;&quot;Rocket Power&quot; Theme Song&quot; by The Wipeouters

==Reception==
Common Sense Media give the series a three out of five stars, writing &quot;Parents need to know that watching this show just might inspire future X-games participation. The kids – never without a skateboard, bike, hockey stick, or surfboard – perform incredible stunts, seemingly without risk of injury. A boy with less sports ability than the others shows kids that it&#x27;s OK to need a lot of practice and only take the risks you&#x27;re personally comfortable with.&quot;

<text>A labialized velar or labiovelar is a velar consonant that is labialized, with a -like secondary articulation. Examples are , which are pronounced like a , with rounded lips, such as the labialized voiceless velar plosive and labialized voiced velar plosive , obstruents being common among the sounds that undergo labialization.

==Labialized velar approximants==
The most common labiovelar consonant is the voiced approximant . It is normally a labialized velar, as is its vocalic cousin . (Labialization is called rounding in vowels, and a velar place is called back.)

 and its voiceless equivalent are the only labialized velars with dedicated IPA symbols:

* 1 - In dialects that distinguish between &quot;which&quot; and &quot;witch&quot;.

The voiceless approximant is traditionally called a &quot;voiceless labial–velar fricative&quot;, but true doubly articulated fricatives are not known to be used in any language, as they are quite difficult to pronounce and even more difficult to distinguish.

==Historical development==
Labialized velars frequently derive from a plain velar followed by a rounded (labialized) vowel, such as or . In turn, they may sometimes develop into simple bilabial consonants. An example of this is the development of Proto-Indo-European *kʷ, *gʷ before *a or *o into Greek /p, b/, producing cognates as different as English &quot;come&quot; and &quot;basis&quot;. The full sequence is demonstrated by the Satsuma dialect of Japanese: in northern Satsuma, Standard Japanese &#x27;eat!&#x27; has contracted to ; in southern Satsuma, it has proceeded further to .

A notable development is the initial *kʷ in Proto-Indo-European interrogative words. In English, it developed into &quot;wh&quot; or &quot;h&quot; (&quot;how&quot;), pronounced /w/ in most dialects and /h/, respectively, via Grimm&#x27;s law followed by &quot;wh&quot;-cluster reductions. By contrast, in Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages, that developed into &quot;qu&quot; (later Spanish &quot;cu&quot; (&quot;cuando&quot;) and &quot;c&quot; (&quot;como&quot;)), pronounced as /kʷ/ in Latin and variously as /kw/ or /k/ in the Romance languages. See etymology of English interrogative words for details. The English phonemic spelling &quot;kw&quot; for &quot;qu&quot; (as in &quot;&quot;) echoes its origin.

<text>The Battle of Wörth, also known as the Battle of Reichshoffen or as the Battle of Frœschwiller, refers to the second battle of Wörth, which took place on 6 August 1870 in the opening stages of the Franco-Prussian War (the first Battle of Wörth occurred on 23 December 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars). In the second battle, troops from Germany commanded by Crown Prince Frederick William and directed by his chief of staff, General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal, defeated the French under Marshal MacMahon near the village of Wœrth in Alsace, on the Sauer River, north of Haguenau.

==Prelude==
During 5 August 1870, the French were concentrated in a selected position running nearly north and south along the western banks of the Sauer on the left front of the German Third Army, which was moving south in an attempt to find them. The French position was marked from right to left by Morsbronn, the Niederwald, the heights west of Wœrth and the woods northeast of Frœschwiller.

East of the Sauer the German Third Army was moving south towards Haguenau, when their cavalry found the French position about noon. Thereafter the German vedettes held the French under close observation, while the latter moved about within their lines and as far as the village of Wœrth as if in peace, notwithstanding the defeat of a portion of the French army at the Battle of Wissembourg on the previous day. The remnant of the force which had been engaged there, with many of its wounded still in the ranks, marched in about noon with so soldierly a bearing that, so far from their depressing the morale of the rest, their appearance actually raised it.

About 17:00 the French watered some horses at the Sauer as if in peace, without escort, though hostile scouts were in sight. A sudden swoop of German hussars drove the party back to camp. The alarm sounded, tents were struck and the troops fell in all along the line and remained under arms until the confusion died down when orders were sent to fall out, but not to pitch tents. The army therefore bivouacked; but for this incident, the battle of the next day would probably not have been fought. A sudden and violent storm broke over the bivouacs, and when it was over, the men, wet and restless, began to move about, light fires, etc. Many of them broke camp and went into Wœrth, which was unoccupied, though Prussians were only 300 meters from the sentries. These fired, and the officer commanding the Prussian outposts, hearing the confused murmur of voices, ordered up a battery which, as soon as there was enough light, fired several shells into Wœrth. The stragglers rushed back, the French lines were again alarmed, and several batteries on the French side took up the challenge.

==Battle==
===Bavarian II Corps===
The Prussian guns, strict orders having been given to avoid all engagement that day, soon withdrew and were about to return to camp, when renewed artillery fire was heard from the south, and presently also from the north. In the latter direction, the II Bavarian Corps, led by Jakob von Hartmann, had bivouacked along the Mattstall–Langen–Sulzbach road with orders to continue the march if artillery were heard to the south. This order was contrary to the spirit of the Third Army orders; moreover, the V Prussian Corps to the south was in ignorance of its having been given.

The outpost battery near Wörth was heard and the Bavarians at once moved forward. Soon the leading troops were on the crest of the ridge between the Sauer and the Sulzbach, and the Bavarian divisional commander, anxious to prove his loyalty to his new allies—his enemies in 1866–ordered his troops to attack, giving the spire of Frœschwiller, which was visible over the woods, as the point of direction.

===Prussian V Corps===
The French, however, were quite ready and a furious fusillade broke out, the sound being multiplied out of proportion to the numbers engaged by the echoes of the forest-clad hills. The Prussian officers of the V Corps near Dieffenbach, knowing nothing of the orders the Bavarians had received, were amazed; but at length, at about 10:30 h, when their comrades were seen retiring, in some cases in great disorder, the corps commander, General Hugo von Kirchbach, decided that an effort must at once be made to relieve the Bavarians. His chief of staff had already ordered up the divisional and corps artillery (84 guns in all), and he himself communicated his intention of attacking to the XI Corps (General Julius von Bose) on his left and asked for all available assistance. A report was also dispatched to the crown prince at Sulz, away.

Meanwhile, the Prussian XI Corps had become involved in an engagement. The left of the V Corps&#x27; outposts had overnight occupied Gunstett and the bank of the Sauer, and the French, shortly after daylight on 6 August 1870, sent down an unarmed party to fetch water. As this appeared through the mist, the Prussians naturally fired upon it, and the French General Lartigue (to whose division the party belonged), puzzled to account for the firing, brought up some batteries in readiness to repel an attack. These fired a few rounds only, but remained in position as a precaution.

===Prussian XI Corps===

Hearing the firing, the XI Corps advanced guard, which had marched up behind in accordance with the general movement of the corps in changing front to the west, and had halted on reaching the Kreuzhecke Wood, promptly came up to Spachbach and Gunstett. In this movement across the country to Spachbach some bodies appear to have exposed themselves, for French artillery at Elsasshausen suddenly opened fire, and the shrapnel bursting high sent showers of bullets on the house roofs of Spachbach, in which village a French battalion had just halted. As the falling tiles made the position undesirable, the major in command ordered the march to be resumed, and as he gave the order, his horse ran away with him towards the Sauer. The leading company, seeing the battalion commander gallop, moved off at the double, and the others of course followed. Coming within sight of the enemy, they drew heavy shellfire, and, still under the impression that they were intended to attack, deployed into a line of columns and doubled down to the river, which they crossed. One or two companies in the neighborhood had already begun to do so, and the stream is too wide for the mounted officers to jump, presently eight or ten companies were across the river and out of superior control. By this time the French outposts (some 1500 rifles), lining the edge of the Niederwald, were firing heavily. The line of smoke was naturally accepted by all as the objective, and the German companies with a wild rush reached the edge of the wood.

The same thing had happened at Gunstett. A most obstinate struggle ensued and both sides brought up reinforcements. The Prussians, with all their attention, concentrated on the wood in their front, and having as yet no superior commanders, soon exhibited signs of confusion, and thereupon General Lartigue ordered a counterattack towards the heights of Gunstett, before which all the Prussians between the Niederwald and the Sauer gave way. The French followed with a rush, and, fording the Sauer opposite Gunstett, for a moment put the long line of German guns upon the heights in considerable danger. At this crisis, a fresh battalion of the Prussian XI corps arrived by the road from Surbourg to Gunstett and attacked the French on one flank whilst the guns swept the other. The momentum of the charge died out, and the French drifted backward. The French effort compelled the admiration of both sides.

===Prussian V Corps===

In the center, the fight had been going badly for the V corps. As soon as the 84 guns between Dieffenbach and Spachbach opened fire, the French disappeared from sight. There was no longer a target, and, perhaps to compel his adversary to show himself, von Kirchbach ordered four battalions to cross the river. These battalions, however, were widely separated and came under fire as soon as they appeared. They attacked in two groups, one from Wœrth towards Frœschwiller, the other from near Spachbach towards the Calvary spur, east of Elsasshausen. Both were overpowered by French infantry fire. A fraction of the southern party maintained itself all day in the elbow of the Hagenau &quot;Chaussee&quot;, which formed a starting point for subsequent attacks. But the rest were driven back in great confusion. Once more the dashing counter-attack of the French was thrown into confusion by Prussian shell fire, and as the French fell back, the Prussian infantry, now reinforced, followed them up (about 13:00 h). The commander in chief of the German Third Army (Crown Prince Frederick William) now appeared on the field and ordered Kirchbach to stand fast until the pressure of the XI corps and of the Württemberg division could take effect against the French right-wing. The majority of these troops had not yet reached the field. Von Bose, however, seeing the retreat of the troops of the V Corps, had independently determined to renew the attack against the Niederwald with much of his forces as had arrived, and had ordered General von Schkopp&#x27;s brigade, which was then approaching, to join the troops collecting to the east of Gunstett. Schkopp, however, seeing that his present line of advance led him directly onto the French right about Morsbronn and kept him clear of the confusion to be seen around Gunstett, disregarded the order and continued to advance on Morsbronn. This deliberate acceptance of responsibility really decided the battle, for Schkopp&#x27;s brigade quietly deployed as a unit and compelled the French right-wing to fall back.

===French cavalry===

To cover the French retreat General Michel&#x27;s brigade of cavalry was ordered to charge. The order was somewhat vague, and in his position under cover near Eberbach-Seltz, General Michel had no knowledge of the actual situation. Thus it came about that, without reconnoitering or manoeuvering for position, the French cavalry rode straight at the first objective which offered itself, and struck the victorious Prussians as they were crossing the hills between the Albrechtshäuserhof and Morsbronn. Hence the charge was costly and only partly successful. However, the Prussians were ridden down here and there, and their attention was sufficiently absorbed while the French infantry rallied for a fresh counterstrike. This was made about 13:20 h. The Prussians were driven off the hillsides between the Albrechtshäuserhof and Morsbronn which they had already won. But the counter-attack turned into disaster when 700 French cuirassiers were trapped inside Morsbronn and massacred within a few minutes by rapid close-range fire. The rest of the French cavalry eventually came under fire from the great artillery mass above Gunstett; von Bose having at length concentrated the main body of the XI corps in the meadows between the Niederwald and the Sauer, the French had to withdraw. Their withdrawal involved the retreat of the troops who had fought all day in defence of the Niederwald.

===French counter-attack===

By 15:00 h the Prussians were masters of the Niederwald and the ground south of it on which the French right-wing had originally stood, but they were in indescribable confusion after the prolonged fighting in the dense undergrowth. Before order could be restored the French launched another fierce counterstroke. As the Prussians emerged from the north edge of the wood, the French reserves suddenly emerged from behind the Elsasshausen heights and striking due south drove the Prussians back. It was a grave crisis, but at this moment von Schkopp, who throughout all this had kept two of his battalions intact, came around the northwest corner of the Wald, and these fresh battalions again brought the French to a standstill. Meanwhile, von Kirchbach, seeing the progress of the XI Corps, had ordered the whole of his command forward to assault the French center; away to the right the two Bavarian corps moved against the French left, which still maintained its original position in the woods northeast of Frœschwiller.

MacMahon, however, was not beaten yet. Ordering Bonnemains&#x27;s cavalry division to charge by squadrons to gain time, he brought up his reserve artillery, and sent it forward to case-shot range to cover a final counter-stroke by his last intact battalions. But from his position near Frœschwiller he could not see into the hollow between Elsasshausen and the Niederwald. The order came too late, and the artillery unlimbered just as the aforementioned counter-attack on the Niederwald gave way before von Schkopp&#x27;s reserve. The guns were submerged in a flood of fugitives and pursuers. Elsasshausen passed into the hands of the Germans. To rescue the guns, the nearest French infantry attacked in a succession of groups, charging at bayonet-point with the utmost determination. The Prussians immediately in front gave way to each attack, but those on the flanks swung inwards and under this converging fire each French attempt died out, the Prussians following up the French retreat. In this manner, step by step, in confusion which almost defies analysis, the Prussians conquered the whole of the ground to the south of the Frœschwiller-Wœrth road, but the French still held on in the village of Frœschwiller itself and in the woods to the north of the road, where throughout the day they had held the two Bavarian corps in check with little difficulty. To break down this last stronghold, the guns of the Prussian V and XI Corps, which had now come forward to the captured ridge of Elsasshausen, took the village as their target; the great mass of infantry, now flushed with victory but in the direst confusion, encouraged by the example of two horse artillery batteries which galloped boldly forward to case-shot range, delivered one final rush which swept all resistance before it.

===French retreat===
The battle was won, and cavalry only were needed to reap its consequences, but the Prussian cavalry division had been left behind without orders and did not reach the battlefield until late at night. The divisional cavalry squadrons did their best, but each pursued on its own account, and the results in prisoners and guns taken fell far short of what the opportunity offered. The French, under cover of darkness, escaped, and on the following day the Prussian cavalry division was quite unable to discover the direction of the retreat.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
MacMahon received no support from the neighbouring French troops. The battle was won by overpowering weight of numbers: the Prussian general staff were able to field no fewer than 75,000 infantry, 6000 cavalry, and 300 guns, of which 71,000 rifles, 4250 sabers, and 234 guns came into action, against 32,000 rifles, 4850 sabers and 101 guns on the French side. The superiority of the French &quot;chassepot&quot; over the Prussian needle guns was canceled by the higher number of rifles on the German side; although the Prussians could generally use their numerical superiority to bring a converging fire upon the French, the latter made nearly twice the number of hits for about the same weight of ammunition fired. The French, however, had no answer to the superior German artillery, and in almost every instance it was the terrible shellfire that broke up French counterattacks. All of these attacks were in the highest degree honorable to the French army, and many came closer to foiling the ultimate success of the Germans than was supposed.

===Casualties===
The Germans lost 103 officers and 1,483 men killed, 383 officers and 7,207 men wounded and 1,373 men missing. Horse casualties amounted to 341. The French lost 5,884 men killed and wounded, and perhaps 9,212 captured, representing a total loss of about 32%. Some French regiments retained a semblance of discipline after suffering enormous losses. The 2nd Turcos lost 93%, 13th Hussars 87%, 3rd Zouaves 80%, and thirteen regiments in all lost over 50% of their strength. Frederick William&#x27;s army captured 200 officers, 9,000 enlisted men, 1 eagle, 4 Turco standards, 28 guns, 5 mitrailleuses, 91 limbers, 23 wagons of rifles and side arms, 158 other carriages and 1,193 horses.

<text>Göppingen is a (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are Rems-Murr, Ostalbkreis, Heidenheim, Alb-Donau, Reutlingen and Esslingen.

==History==
In 1817, Württemberg was divided into four kreise (districts), the southeastern one of which was named Donaukreis. The four kreise were in turn divided into oberämter. In Donaukreis, the most northern of the oberämter were Göppingen and to its east Geislingen. In 1938, the four kreise were abolished, and being was merged with Göppingen. During the communal reform of 1973 the district was not changed much, with only a few municipalities from the districts Schwäbisch Gmünd and Ulm were added.

The district is sometimes called &quot;Stauferkreis&quot; because the Staufen family had their roots in the area. However, when the family had no more heirs, it became part of Württemberg in the 14th century.

==Partnerships==
In 1990 a partnership with the district Löbau (now merged into the district of Görlitz) in Saxony was started, to help to build the administration according to western German standards. The municipality Boll already had a partnership with Herrnhut in Löbau before. After the districts started their partnership, several other municipalities of the two districts started partnership as well.

==Geography==
The district is located in the northern foothills of the Swabian Jura (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;). It is crossed by the Fils, a tributary of the Neckar.

==Coat of arms==
The lion is the symbol of the Staufen family, which had its roots in the district. The deer antler above is the symbol of Württemberg and symbolizes the change of ownership after the Staufer family died out.

<text>Prothrombin (coagulation factor II) is encoded in the human by the F2-gene. It is proteolytically cleaved during the clotting process by the prothrombinase enzyme complex to form thrombin. 

Thrombin (Factor IIa) (, fibrose, thrombase, thrombofort, topical, thrombin-C, tropostasin, activated blood-coagulation factor II, E thrombin, beta-thrombin, gamma-thrombin) is a serine protease, that converts fibrinogen into strands of insoluble fibrin, as well as catalyzing many other coagulation-related reactions.

==History==
After the description of fibrinogen and fibrin, Alexander Schmidt hypothesised the existence of an enzyme that converts fibrinogen into fibrin in 1872.

Prothrombin was discovered by Pekelharing in 1894.

==Physiology==

===Synthesis===
Thrombin is produced by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated Factor X (Xa). The activity of factor Xa is greatly enhanced by binding to activated Factor V (Va), termed the prothrombinase complex. Prothrombin is produced in the liver and is co-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent reaction that converts 10-12 glutamic acids in the N terminus of the molecule to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). In the presence of calcium, the Gla residues promote the binding of prothrombin to phospholipid bilayers. Deficiency of vitamin K or administration of the anticoagulant warfarin inhibits the production of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, slowing the activation of the coagulation cascade.

In human adults, the normal blood level of antithrombin activity has been measured to be around 1.1 units/mL. Newborn levels of thrombin steadily increase after birth to reach normal adult levels, from a level of around 0.5 units/mL 1 day after birth, to a level of around 0.9 units/mL after 6 months of life.

===Mechanism of action===
In the blood coagulation pathway, thrombin acts to convert factor XI to XIa, VIII to VIIIa, V to Va, fibrinogen to fibrin, and XIII to XIIIa. In the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, thrombin catalyzes the cleavage of fibrinopeptides A and B from the respective Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers.

Factor XIIIa is a transglutaminase that catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between lysine and glutamine residues in fibrin. The covalent bonds increase the stability of the fibrin clot. Thrombin interacts with thrombomodulin.

As part of its activity in the coagulation cascade, thrombin also promotes platelet activation and aggregation via activation of protease-activated receptors on the cell membrane of the platelet.

===Negative feedback===
Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin activates protein C, an inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. The activation of protein C is greatly enhanced following the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin, an integral membrane protein expressed by endothelial cells. Activated protein C inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. Binding of activated protein C to protein S leads to a modest increase in its activity. Thrombin is also inactivated by antithrombin, a serine protease inhibitor.

==Structure==
The molecular weight of prothrombin is approximately 72,000 Da. The catalytic domain is released from prothrombin fragment 1.2 to create the active enzyme thrombin, which has a molecular weight of 36,000 Da. Structurally, it is a member of the large PA clan of proteases.

Prothrombin is composed of four domains; an N-terminal Gla domain, two kringle domains and a C-terminal trypsin-like serine protease domain.
Factor Xa with factor V as a cofactor leads to cleavage of the Gla and two Kringle domains (forming together a fragment called fragment 1.2) and leave thrombin, consisting solely of the serine protease domain.

As is the case for all serine proteases, prothrombin is converted to active thrombin by proteolysis of an internal peptide bond, exposing a new N-terminal Ile-NH3. The historic model of activation of serine proteases involves insertion of this newly formed N-terminus of the heavy chain into the β-barrel promoting the correct conformation of the catalytic residues. Contrary to crystal structures of active thrombin, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry studies indicate that this N-terminal Ile-NH3 does not become inserted into the β-barrel in the apo form of thrombin. However, binding of the active fragment of thrombomodulin appears to allosterically promote the active conformation of thrombin by inserting this N-terminal region.

==Gene==
There are an estimated 30 people in the world that have been diagnosed with the congenital form of Factor II deficiency, which should not be confused with the prothrombin G20210A mutation, which is also called the factor II mutation. Prothrombin G20210A is congenital.

Prothrombin G20210A is not usually accompanied by other factor mutations (i.e., the most common is factor V Leiden). The gene may be inherited heterozygous (1 pair), or much more rarely, homozygous (2 pairs), and is not related to gender or blood type. Homozygous mutations increase the risk of thrombosis more than heterozygous mutations, but the relative increased risk is not well documented. Other potential risks for thrombosis, such as oral contraceptives may be additive. The previously reported relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis) and prothrombin G20210A or factor V Leiden mutation have been contradicted by research.

==Role in disease==
Activation of prothrombin is crucial in physiological and pathological coagulation. Various rare diseases involving prothrombin have been described (e.g., hypoprothrombinemia). Anti-prothrombin antibodies in autoimmune disease may be a factor in the formation of the lupus anticoagulant (also known as antiphospholipid syndrome). Hyperprothrombinemia can be caused by the G20210A mutation.

Thrombin, a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen, is implicated as a major factor in vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Blood from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm clots around a cerebral artery, releasing thrombin. This can induce an acute and prolonged narrowing of the blood vessel, potentially resulting in cerebral ischemia and infarction (stroke).

Beyond its key role in the dynamic process of thrombus formation, thrombin has a pronounced pro-inflammatory character, which may influence the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Acting via its specific cell membrane receptors (protease activated receptors: PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4), which are abundantly expressed in all arterial vessel wall constituents, thrombin has the potential to exert pro-atherogenic actions such as inflammation, leukocyte recruitment into the atherosclerotic plaque, enhanced oxidative stress, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, apoptosis and angiogenesis.

Thrombin is implicated in the physiology of blood clots. Its presence indicates the existence of a clot. In 2013 a system for detecting the presence of thrombin was developed in mice. It combines peptide-coated iron oxide attached to &quot;reporter chemicals&quot;. When a peptide binds to a thrombin molecule, the report is released and appears in the urine where it can be detected. Human testing has not been conducted.

==Applications==

===Research tool===
Due to its high proteolytic specificity, thrombin is a valuable biochemical tool. The thrombin cleavage site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) is commonly included in linker regions of recombinant fusion protein constructs. Following purification of the fusion protein, thrombin can be used to selectively cleave between the arginine and glycine residues of the cleavage site, effectively removing the purification tag from the protein of interest with a high degree of specificity.

===Medicine and surgery===
Prothrombin complex concentrate and fresh frozen plasma are prothrombin-rich coagulation factor preparations that can be used to correct deficiencies (usually due to medication) of prothrombin. Indications include intractable bleeding due to warfarin.

Manipulation of prothrombin is central to the mode of action of most anticoagulants. Warfarin and related drugs inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of several coagulation factors, including prothrombin. Heparin increases the affinity of antithrombin to thrombin (as well as factor Xa). The direct thrombin inhibitors, a newer class of medication, directly inhibit thrombin by binding to its active site.

Recombinant thrombin is available as a powder for reconstitution into aqueous solution. It can be applied topically during surgery, as an aid to hemostasis. It can be useful for controlling minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules, but ineffective and not indicated for massive or brisk arterial bleeding.

===Food production===
Thrombin, combined with fibrinogen, is sold under the brand name Fibrimex for use as a binding agent for meat. Both proteins in Fibrimex derives from porcine or bovine blood. According to the manufacturer it can be used to produce new kinds of mixed meats (for example combining beef and fish seamlessly). The manufacturer also states that it can be used to combine whole muscle meat, form and portion these, thus cutting down on production costs without a loss in quality.

General secretary Jan Bertoft of Swedish Consumers&#x27; Association has stated that &quot;there is danger of misleading the consumers since there is no way to tell this reconstituted meat from real meat&quot;.

<doc id="238867" wikidata="Q798554" url="?curid=238867" title="Backtracking">
<text>Backtracking is a class of algorithms for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (&quot;backtracks&quot;) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

The classic textbook example of the use of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle, that asks for all arrangements of eight chess queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other. In the common backtracking approach, the partial candidates are arrangements of &quot;k&quot; queens in the first &quot;k&quot; rows of the board, all in different rows and columns. Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be abandoned.

Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a &quot;partial candidate solution&quot; and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution. It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute-force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate many candidates with a single test.

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems. It is also the program execution strategy used in the programming languages Icon, Planner and Prolog.

Backtracking depends on user-given &quot;black box procedures&quot; that define the problem to be solved, the nature of the partial candidates, and how they are extended into complete candidates. It is therefore a metaheuristic rather than a specific algorithm – although, unlike many other meta-heuristics, it is guaranteed to find all solutions to a finite problem in a bounded amount of time.

The term &quot;backtrack&quot; was coined by American mathematician D. H. Lehmer in the 1950s. The pioneer string-processing language SNOBOL (1962) may have been the first to provide a built-in general backtracking facility.

==Description of the method==

The backtracking algorithm enumerates a set of &quot;partial candidates&quot; that, in principle, could be &quot;completed&quot; in various ways to give all the possible solutions to the given problem. The completion is done incrementally, by a sequence of &quot;candidate extension steps.&quot;

Conceptually, the partial candidates are represented as the nodes of a tree structure, the &quot;potential search tree.&quot; Each partial candidate is the parent of the candidates that differ from it by a single extension step; the leaves of the tree are the partial candidates that cannot be extended any further.

The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively, from the root down, in depth-first order. At each node &quot;c&quot;, the algorithm checks whether &quot;c&quot; can be completed to a valid solution. If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at &quot;c&quot; is skipped (&quot;pruned&quot;). Otherwise, the algorithm (1) checks whether &quot;c&quot; itself is a valid solution, and if so reports it to the user; and (2) recursively enumerates all sub-trees of &quot;c&quot;. The two tests and the children of each node are defined by user-given procedures.

Therefore, the &quot;actual search tree&quot; that is traversed by the algorithm is only a part of the potential tree. The total cost of the algorithm is the number of nodes of the actual tree times the cost of obtaining and processing each node. This fact should be considered when choosing the potential search tree and implementing the pruning test.

===Pseudocode===
In order to apply backtracking to a specific class of problems, one must provide the data &quot;P&quot; for the particular instance of the problem that is to be solved, and six procedural parameters, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;, &quot;accept&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;next&quot;, and &quot;output&quot;. These procedures should take the instance data &quot;P&quot; as a parameter and should do the following:
# &quot;root&quot;(&quot;P&quot;): return the partial candidate at the root of the search tree.
# &quot;reject&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;): return &quot;true&quot; only if the partial candidate &quot;c&quot; is not worth completing.
# &quot;accept&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;): return &quot;true&quot; if &quot;c&quot; is a solution of &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;false&quot; otherwise.
# &quot;first&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;): generate the first extension of candidate &quot;c&quot;.
# &quot;next&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;s&quot;): generate the next alternative extension of a candidate, after the extension &quot;s&quot;.
# &quot;output&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;): use the solution &quot;c&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, as appropriate to the application.

The backtracking algorithm reduces the problem to the call &quot;backtrack&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;root&quot;(&quot;P&quot;)), where &quot;backtrack&quot; is the following recursive procedure:

 procedure backtrack(P, c) is
 if reject(P, c) then return
 if accept(P, c) then output(P, c)
 s ← first(P, c)
 while s ≠ NULL do
 backtrack(P, s)
 s ← next(P, s)

===Usage considerations===
The &quot;reject&quot; procedure should be a Boolean-valued function that returns &quot;true&quot; only if it is certain that no possible extension of &quot;c&quot; is a valid solution for &quot;P&quot;. If the procedure cannot reach a definite conclusion, it should return &quot;false&quot;. An incorrect &quot;true&quot; result may cause the &quot;backtrack&quot; procedure to miss some valid solutions. The procedure may assume that &quot;reject&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) returned &quot;false&quot; for every ancestor &quot;t&quot; of &quot;c&quot; in the search tree.

On the other hand, the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm depends on &quot;reject&quot; returning &quot;true&quot; for candidates that are as close to the root as possible. If &quot;reject&quot; always returns &quot;false&quot;, the algorithm will still find all solutions, but it will be equivalent to a brute-force search.

The &quot;accept&quot; procedure should return &quot;true&quot; if &quot;c&quot; is a complete and valid solution for the problem instance &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;false&quot; otherwise. It may assume that the partial candidate &quot;c&quot; and all its ancestors in the tree have passed the &quot;reject&quot; test.

The general pseudo-code above does not assume that the valid solutions are always leaves of the potential search tree. In other words, it admits the possibility that a valid solution for &quot;P&quot; can be further extended to yield other valid solutions.

The &quot;first&quot; and &quot;next&quot; procedures are used by the backtracking algorithm to enumerate the children of a node &quot;c&quot; of the tree, that is, the candidates that differ from &quot;c&quot; by a single extension step. The call &quot;first&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) should yield the first child of &quot;c&quot;, in some order; and the call &quot;next&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) should return the next sibling of node &quot;s&quot;, in that order. Both functions should return a distinctive &quot;NULL&quot; candidate, if the requested child does not exist.

Together, the &quot;root&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, and &quot;next&quot; functions define the set of partial candidates and the potential search tree. They should be chosen so that every solution of &quot;P&quot; occurs somewhere in the tree, and no partial candidate occurs more than once. Moreover, they should admit an efficient and effective &quot;reject&quot; predicate.

===Early stopping variants===
The pseudo-code above will call &quot;output&quot; for all candidates that are a solution to the given instance &quot;P&quot;. The algorithm can be modified to stop after finding the first solution, or a specified number of solutions; or after testing a specified number of partial candidates, or after spending a given amount of CPU time.

==Examples==

Examples where backtracking can be used to solve puzzles or problems include:
* Puzzles such as eight queens puzzle, crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and Peg Solitaire.
* Combinatorial optimization problems such as parsing and the knapsack problem.
* Goal-directed programming languages such as Icon, Planner and Prolog, which use backtracking internally to generate answers.
* The DPLL algorithm for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem.

The following is an example where backtracking is used for the constraint satisfaction problem:

===Constraint satisfaction===
The general constraint satisfaction problem consists in finding a list of integers , each in some range }, that satisfies some arbitrary constraint (Boolean function) &quot;F&quot;.

For this class of problems, the instance data &quot;P&quot; would be the integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, and the predicate &quot;F&quot;. In a typical backtracking solution to this problem, one could define a partial candidate as a list of integers , for any &quot;k&quot; between 0 and &quot;n&quot;, that are to be assigned to the first &quot;k&quot; variables . The root candidate would then be the empty list (). The &quot;first&quot; and &quot;next&quot; procedures would then be

 function first(P, c) is
 k ← length(c)
 if k = n then
 return NULL
 else
 return (c[1], c[2], ..., c[k], 1)

 function next(P, s) is
 k ← length(s)
 if s[k] = m then
 return NULL
 else
 return (s[1], s[2], ..., s[k − 1], 1 + s[k])

Here &quot;length&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) is the number of elements in the list &quot;c&quot;.

The call &quot;reject&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) should return &quot;true&quot; if the constraint &quot;F&quot; cannot be satisfied by any list of &quot;n&quot; integers that begins with the &quot;k&quot; elements of &quot;c&quot;. For backtracking to be effective, there must be a way to detect this situation, at least for some candidates &quot;c&quot;, without enumerating all those &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; &quot;n&quot;-tuples.

For example, if &quot;F&quot; is the conjunction of several Boolean predicates, , and each &quot;F&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] depends only on a small subset of the variables , then the &quot;reject&quot; procedure could simply check the terms &quot;F&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] that depend only on variables , and return &quot;true&quot; if any of those terms returns &quot;false&quot;. In fact, &quot;reject&quot; needs only check those terms that do depend on &quot;x&quot;[&quot;k&quot;], since the terms that depend only on will have been tested further up in the search tree.

Assuming that &quot;reject&quot; is implemented as above, then &quot;accept&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) needs only check whether &quot;c&quot; is complete, that is, whether it has &quot;n&quot; elements.

It is generally better to order the list of variables so that it begins with the most critical ones (i.e. the ones with fewest value options, or which have a greater impact on subsequent choices).

One could also allow the &quot;next&quot; function to choose which variable should be assigned when extending a partial candidate, based on the values of the variables already assigned by it. Further improvements can be obtained by the technique of constraint propagation.

In addition to retaining minimal recovery values used in backing up, backtracking implementations commonly keep a variable trail, to record value change history. An efficient implementation will avoid creating a variable trail entry between two successive changes when there is no choice point, as the backtracking will erase all of the changes as a single operation.

An alternative to the variable trail is to keep a timestamp of when the last change was made to the variable. The timestamp is compared to the timestamp of a choice point. If the choice point has an associated time later than that of the variable, it is unnecessary to revert the variable when the choice point is backtracked, as it was changed before the choice point occurred.

<doc id="238871" wikidata="Q432319" url="?curid=238871" title="Speed Racer">
<text>Speed Racer, also known as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuo Yoshida. It was originally serialized in print in Shueisha&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Shōnen Book&quot;. It was released in form by Sun Wide Comics and later re-released in Japan by Fusosha. Adapted into anime by Tatsunoko Production, its 52 episodes aired on Fuji Television from April 1967 to March 1968. In the US, the show aired in syndication at approximately the same time. The anime was later re-broadcast on Tokyo MX from July 1 to September 25, 2008.

Selected chapters of the manga were released by NOW Comics in the 1990s under the title &quot;Speed Racer Classics&quot;. These were later released by Wildstorm Productions, a division of DC Comics, as &quot;Speed Racer: The Original Manga&quot;. In 2008, under its Americanized title, &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; was republished in its entirety in the United States by Digital Manga Publishing and was released as a box set to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 40th anniversary, as well as serving as a tie-in with the 2008 film. The television series was very successful in the United States and is said to have defined anime in that country until the 1990s, being watched by a total estimated audience of viewers during the 1960s1970s.

==Media==

===Manga===
&quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; was first created and designed by anime pioneer Tatsuo Yoshida (1932–1977) as a manga series in the 1960s and made the jump to TV as an anime series in 1967. The actual manga was inspired by Yoshida&#x27;s earlier and more popular automobile racing comics, Pilot Ace. &quot;Pilot Ace&quot;&#x27;s main storyline formed the structure for &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot;, which followed the adventures of an ambitious young man, who soon became a professional racer.

The characters&#x27; designs in &quot;Pilot Ace&quot; set the main ground for the character design in &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot;. Yoshida got his idea for the story after seeing two films that were very popular in Japan at the time, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. By combining the look of Elvis Presley&#x27;s race-car driving image, complete with neckerchief and black pompadour, and James Bond&#x27;s gadget-filled Aston Martin DB5, Yoshida had the inspiration for his creation. Soon enough, &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; hit shelves in the early 1960s. The central character in the anime and manga was a young race car driver named Gō Mifune (&quot;Mifune Gō&quot;).

The name of the series, &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot;, has a triple meaning: is the name of the car; the name of the main character is Gō Mifune; and finally, it contains the English word &quot;go&quot;. In the American adaptation, Mach 5 stems from the number 5 on the door. Although, in Japanese, is the word for the number 5, the Kanji character which is used in the car name actually means &quot;item number&quot; (i.e. it is an ordinal suffix). In addition, gogogo, is used as a general Japanese sound effect for rumble. Taken together, the program&#x27;s title means, &quot;Mach Number Five, Go!&quot;

The manga (compiled into two deluxe volumes for Fusosha&#x27;s re-release) has several storylines, such as &quot;The Great Plan&quot;, &quot;Challenge of the Masked Racer&quot;, &quot;The Fire Race&quot;, &quot;The Secret Engine&quot; and &quot;Race for Revenge&quot;, that were adapted to the anime. However, minor changes occur between both the original manga and the anime series, such as differences between back stories of several characters and places.

A few years after the volumes were released, Yoshida decided to release his manga series as an anime program, adding additional plots. Fifty-two episodes aired in Japan, each one emulating the fast-paced action of the manga.

Selected chapters of the original &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; manga series were reprinted by NOW Comics as two volumes of &quot;Speed Racer Classics&quot; (1988–1989), and by DC Comics/Wildstorm Productions as &quot;Speed Racer: The Original Manga&quot; (2000). In 2008, a hardcover box set of the complete manga series was released by Digital Manga Publishing as the two volume &quot;Speed Racer: Mach Go Go Go&quot;.

===Anime===

The manga spawned an anime adaptation that actually became a bigger success. Fifty-two episodes were produced from 1967 to 1968. In 1997, Tatsunoko produced a modernized version of &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; that aired on TV Tokyo, lasting for 34 episodes. An English-language adaptation of this remake was produced by DiC titled Speed Racer X, which aired in 2002 on Nickelodeon. Only the first 13 episodes were adapted due to licensing disputes between DiC and Speed Racer Enterprises. &quot;Mach Girl&quot; was a web-based series by Tatsunoko Productions, created by Tatsuo Yoshida&#x27;s daughter, Suzuka.

====English-language adaptation====
The English-language rights to &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; were acquired by syndicator Trans-Lux and &quot;Speed Racer&quot; premiered on American television in the summer of 1967. In the series, Speed&#x27;s full name was Go Mifune, in homage to Japanese film star Toshiro Mifune. His name, Americanized, became Speed Racer. His adventures centered on his powerful Mach 5 car, his girlfriend Trixie, his little brother Spritle, Spritle&#x27;s pet chimpanzee Chim-Chim, his father &quot;Pops&quot; Racer, and his mysterious older brother, Racer X, whose real name was Rex Racer.

For American consumption, major editing and dubbing efforts were undertaken by producer Peter Fernandez, who likewise not only wrote and directed the English-language dialogue but also provided the voices of many of the characters, most notably Racer X and Speed Racer himself. Fernandez was also responsible for a rearrangement of the theme song&#x27;s melody, written and composed by Nobuyoshi Koshibe, and he subsequently also wrote its English lyrics.

A &quot;Speed Racer&quot; daily comic strip written and drawn by Mort Todd ran in the &quot;New York Post&quot; from 2000–2001. IGN ranked the original Speed Racer series at #29 on its &quot;Best 100 Animated Series&quot; list.

At Otakon 2015, Funimation announced that it had acquired the license to &quot;Speed Racer&quot; from Tatsunoko and would release it on Blu-ray for the first time. Funimation gave &quot;Speed Racer&quot; two separate home video releases: a standard release for the English version on May 30, 2017, and a collector&#x27;s edition for the Japanese version with English subtitles on November 7, 2017, the first such North American release.

===Names===

The large red M on the hood of the Mach 5, as well as on Gō&#x27;s helmet, is the emblem of Mifune Motors, the family business, and an homage to Japanese film star Toshiro Mifune. In North America it was assumed to stand for Mach 5 and in the Latin American version for Meteoro. His given name, Gō, is a Japanese homophone for the number 5 (the number on his race car) which is also represented by the yellow letter G embroidered on his short-sleeve blue shirt. The tradition of symbolism on characters&#x27; shirts was also used on Michi (Trixie) and Sabu (Sparky), who had the letter &quot;M&quot; and &quot;S&quot; on their shirts, respectively.

===Audience===
The overall purpose of the anime was to please a growing fan base worldwide with exciting stories that involved facing adversity on the race track and beyond. Review of the episodes in the &quot;Speed Racer: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of Japanese and English-language episodes reveals frequent changes to the sound-track (dialogue and the addition of an off-screen narrator) but very little editing of the image-track. Most significantly, the names of villains are often changed to be more cartoony, e.g. Professor Anarchy in episode 31 (&quot;Lightning-Quick Ninja Cars&quot; in Japanese, &quot;Gang of Assassins&quot; in English).

==Characters==

===Racer family===
Speed Racer / 

:The protagonist of both the anime and the manga is Speed Racer, originally Gō Mifune. He is known for his love of racing and valuing his family. He drives the Mach 5 (as well as other cars, such as the Mach 6 in the movie) and always manages to wind up in extreme danger with either his younger brother or his girlfriend Trixie. Speed is shown to miss his older brother, Rex (secretly disguised as Racer X), in both versions. He is portrayed by Emile Hirsch in the 2008 film, while his younger self is portrayed by Nicholas Elia.

:Off the track, he wears a blue shirt with an orange &quot;G&quot; (standing for his Japanese first name, Gō) with a white collar, a red racing bandanna around his neck, white pants, red socks, brown loafers, and yellow gloves. He is 18 years old, has a brown, almost black, pompadour, and his eyes are brown (in the anime version they are blue). In racing, he sports a white open-face helmet with an M (representing Mifune Motors) on top. In the anime, on special occasions, Speed wears a red blazer with a yellow &quot;G&quot; embroidered on it. In the live-action film, he wears a white leather racing jacket unzipped over his classic outfit. He wears his classic outfit (without the embroidered &quot;G&quot;) in the first half of the Casa Cristo 5000. To strengthen the character&#x27;s back-story continuity between Speed and his older brother Rex, Speed&#x27;s red socks were considered &quot;lucky socks&quot;.

Spritle Racer / and 
:Speed Racer has a younger brother named Spritle (&quot;Kurio Mifune&quot; in the Japanese original). Spritle has a pet chimpanzee, who responded to the name of Chim-Chim in the American version (Sanpei in the Japanese original). Their rebellious attitudes often lead them to trouble. Often in Speed&#x27;s way, their mischief somehow aids Speed away from danger. Spritle and Chim-Chim dress in identical jumpsuits and striped hats and often perform identical physical actions. They both have an extreme appetite for candy and they are usually bribed with dessert or other presents. Spritle and Chim-Chim often use a slingshot to combat any threats that come to both themselves and/or Speed. 

:According Peter Fernandez&#x27;s introduction in the American release of the &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; manga, Spritle got his name for being an energetic &quot;sprite.&quot; Chim-Chim got his name because he was considered a chimpanzee. In the live-action film, they are portrayed faithfully to their characterizations in both the anime and manga. Spritle was portrayed by Paulie Litt in the film.

Pops Racer / 
:Speed&#x27;s father, Pops, (Daisuke Mifune) is a former wrestler-turned race car owner and builder. After quitting his job in a corporate car manufacturing company, he founded his own company, Mifune Motors. (In America, the company was changed to Racer Motors.) He is portrayed as a hothead who is overprotective of his family. His eldest son, Rex, ran away (although he would return as Racer X). In addition to Spritle and Chim-Chim, Pops&#x27; attitude is a running gag in the anime series as well as the live-action film. Overweight, he wears an athletic red shirt and a beige mechanic&#x27;s cap. Despite his build, Pops is nearly unmatched in combat, as he was once a champion heavyweight wrestler. His design skills allow him to create powerful engines, especially his (in the film) prized &quot;Mach&quot; Series, giving the car the ability to travel at high speeds while sustaining maximum performance. He is portrayed by actor John Goodman in the 2008 film.

Mom Racer / 
:Speed&#x27;s mother, Mom Racer (originally Aya Mifune), is a side character in the series. She rarely appears in the anime or manga, having limited dialogue, and many episodes of the anime did not feature her at all. In the live-action film, however, she is portrayed by Susan Sarandon as an encouraging parental figure.

 / Rex Racer / 

:The enigmatic Racer X (Fukumen Racer in the Japanese version) is a frequent recurring character, driving car number 9, the &quot;Shooting Star&quot;. Racer X is a mysterious, selfless, sympathetic, and often brooding soldier of fortune whose secret identity is that of Rex Racer (Kenichi Mifune in Japan), Speed&#x27;s older brother. Six years prior, Rex had a falling out with Pops after wrecking a race car that Pops had built. Pops had told Rex prior to the race that he was not prepared to compete at the professional racing level. With less than one lap to go, Rex was leading and cruising toward victory, but lost control of the car, wrecking it. Pops exploded with anger and berated Rex, and in response, Rex exiled himself, vowing to become the world&#x27;s greatest race car driver. In both &quot;Speed Racer X&quot; and in the 2008 movie, Rex is thought to have died in that accident. In the film, he is portrayed by Matthew Fox, while his younger self is portrayed by Scott Porter.

:Pops and Speed always acknowledged that Racer X was the superior driver, and the greatest driver that they had ever seen; however, Speed still vowed to defeat Racer X. In the anime, Speed was often suspicious of Racer X&#x27;s identity and motives, because Racer X would sacrifice winning races to protect Speed from drivers who tried to harm him. The assistance from Racer X nearly always led to Speed winning races, while Racer X came in second place. Racer X always left the scene unnoticed, receding into his secret life.

===Supporting characters===

Trixie / 
: Trixie, or Michi Shimura (named after actor Takashi Shimura, who collaborated with Toshiro Mifune on several films), is Speed&#x27;s girlfriend. The &quot;M&quot; adorning her blouse stands for Michi. Trixie often flies around in a helicopter during a race, acting as Speed&#x27;s spotter, a function she also serves in the live-action film during the Casa Cristo 5000. In the manga, it is mentioned that her father is the president of Shimura Aviation, which explains why she has her own helicopter. To add comic relief in the anime, Trixie becomes jealous if Speed pays too much attention to another girl or if she feels ignored. In the 2008 live-action film, she is portrayed by actress Christina Ricci, while her younger self was played by Ariel Winter. She had an auburn bob cut with bangs; in the anime, her hair was dark brunette.

:Unlike most female characters in cartoons at that time, Trixie is not portrayed as a helpless perpetual victim. Trixie often proves herself the equal of Speed when forced into physical altercations. While Trixie has been captured on occasion by the villains, she refuses to cower or plead for her release, more often giving the bad guy a serious tongue-lashing until she is either rescued or escapes on her own. On some occasions, Trixie has even been the one to rescue Speed or other male characters from their predicaments. In the spin-off &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot;, she is assumed to be the mother of X and Speed Jr.

:Casually, Trixie wears a pink blouse with the aforementioned &quot;M&quot; on her left side. She also wears red pants. In racing events, she wears a white long-sleeve shirt underneath pink overalls, which also have the embroidered &quot;M&quot;. During races, she also wears a pink cap with racing goggles. On special occasions, Trixie wears a blue hat and dress.
:
:Other regular characters included Sparky, whose full name in the movie and in &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot; is Wilson Sparkolemew (in the manga and anime, he is only called Sparky). In the Japanese original, he was Sabu, and he was Bujía in the Latin American version. He is the company mechanic, a quirky young man who is a best friend of Speed and knows everything about cars. In the live-action movie, he is portrayed as older than Speed, but is still his close friend. He wears a yellow shirt bearing the letter S. He is portrayed by actor Kick Gurry in the live-action film. He makes a cameo in &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot;.

The Car Acrobatic Team
:The Car Acrobatic Team (or Car Acrobats) is one of the original set of characters appearing in both the manga and anime. The 16 racers&#x27; uniforms are embroidered with a letter from the English alphabet. All of the cars in the team (automobiles numbered 11 through 26), except for number 11, look and act the same. The cars sprout wings from both sides, making them capable of jumping large gaps and gorges. The most notable of the team are Captain Terror and Snake Oiler (the latter being a character exclusive to the anime).

:Captain Terror, the leader of the Car Acrobatic Team, is shown as an arrogant driver in the manga, sabotaging races for his own benefit. His arrogance gets the best of him, and he gets severely injured in an explosion after not heeding Speed&#x27;s warning about his car leaking oil. He has a &quot;Z&quot; embroidered on his racing uniform, a face of skeletal features, and a lone feather atop his helmet. He drives the number 11 car, the only car different in appearance to the rest of the Car Acrobatic team.

:In the anime, Captain Terror&#x27;s character exists, but many of his appearances are played by a new character, Snake Oiler. He replaces Captain Terror in terms of hotheaded attitude. Embroidered with an &quot;S&quot; on his uniform and tinted visor on his striped helmet, Snake Oiler drives the number 12 car, similar in appearance to the other cars in the Car Acrobatic Team. The role Captain Terror had in the manga was lifted onto the Snake Oiler character, therefore Captain Terror&#x27;s role in the Alpine Race (and injuries from a crash related to an oil leak) was replaced by Snake. Although Snake did not exist in the original manga, he was notable in the West due to his appearance in the anime. Snake Oiler&#x27;s name and acrobatic skills are an homage to Haro Bora.

:In the live-action movie, Snake has completely changed in appearance. Since the Car Acrobatic Team didn&#x27;t exist in the film, he is instead leader of his own racing team, named &quot;Hydra-Cell&quot;. He wears large sunglasses and sports a black pompadour. His racing uniform is made entirely of snake skin (complete with a yellow snake on his helmet) and his car is completely orange. Despite the change in appearance, Snake&#x27;s car number and attitude are still intact in the film. He is portrayed by Christian Oliver.

:In the next-to-last episode of the original series, the Car Acrobatic Team and Speed are tricked into racing against each other in a grudge race by a terrorist organization hoping to use the race as a means to kill Speed and Racer X. After the two sides learn of the deception (which involved planting time bombs in the Car Acrobatic Team&#x27;s cars), they agree to a truce in order to foil the plan. The Car Acrobatic Team park their cars around the terrorists&#x27; secret headquarters and the explosion destroys the building and kills the leaders. After that, Speed and Captain Terror part amicably, with Terror wishing Speed the best of luck next time they meet. Snake Oiler does not appear in the episode.

:In &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot;, Zile Zazic was seen wearing a racing outfit similar to Captain Terror&#x27;s during the &quot;Comet Run&quot; episodes, implying that Zile was Captain Terror. Stan, Zile&#x27;s main henchman, also noted that Speed Racer had raced against Zile&#x27;s racing team at one point.

==Vehicles==

Many of the show&#x27;s cars have special abilities in the series. *Note: The names of the cars that have appeared in both the manga and the original anime have been fitted with &quot;Italics&quot;.

===The &quot;Mach 5&quot;===
The Mach 5, Speed Racer&#x27;s car (&quot;Mahha Gō,&quot; or &quot;Mahha,&quot; in the Japanese version), is a technological marvel, containing useful pieces of equipment. Gō Mifune/Speed Racer easily deployed these gadgets by pressing buttons marked &quot;A&quot; through &quot;G&quot; on the steering wheel hub (although there are buttons on the steering wheel in the manga, the letter designations are exclusive to the anime and the 2008 live action film). This uniquely designed car, built with a sleek Coke bottle bodystyle, has a white exterior with a large &quot;M&quot; on its hood, the logo for the family business, Mifune Motors (changed to Pops Motors in the anime and Racer Motors in the live action film). The two-seat car had a mostly red-colored interior. The number 5 is emblazoned on both side doors of the car. In the manga and anime this is the car&#x27;s racing number; in the film, it is because it is the fifth car built in Pops&#x27; &quot;Mach&quot; series of racing vehicles. Although technically inferior to other racing vehicles such as the Mammoth Car and the GRX, the Mach 5 manages to win most races because of Speed&#x27;s superior driving skills.

The Mach 5 has been stolen from Speed a few times, once when Cornpone Blotch took the car to add it to his car collection in the &quot;Girl Daredevil&quot; saga. However, Speed always gets it back at the end of the episode. At one point, the car was replicated, functions and all, by Dr. Nightcall. However, this replica included other new abilities that inspired later functions of the car in remakes of the show, one of which were the Aero-Jacks, used as a replacement for the Auto Jacks in &quot;Speed Racer X&quot;. In manga continuity, the Mach 5 was destroyed and rebuilt. See &quot;Manga and Anime Differences&quot; for more information on the Mach 5&#x27;s manga continuity.

In both American comic and movie continuity, Pops is portrayed as having built a &quot;Mach&quot; Series consisting of other variants, such as the Mach 4 and Mach 6, in addition to Rex Racer&#x27;s Mach 1 and the Mach 5.

===The &quot;Shooting Star&quot;===

The Shooting Star is Racer X&#x27;s car, colored bright yellow with a black front bumper and numbered 9 on the hood and sides. The car&#x27;s engine is located in the back, and it is a very agile machine, often displaying abilities akin to and even above those of the Mach Five. Many of its high-tech features allowed Racer X to keep an eye on Speed Racer, who is his younger brother.

In later comics written by Tommy Yune, Rex acquires the car that he names the &quot;Shooting Star&quot; from Prince Kabala of Kapetapek. During his time training with the royal leader, Rex is informed that he is the ninth student of Kabala, hence the number 9. Rex also builds other cars numbered 9 with similar paint schemes and names them with variants like the &quot;Falling Star.&quot;

In the 2008 film adaptation, the car makes an appearance but is not named. The car was the only car built in addition to the Mach Five for the movie, and it features weapons like machine guns mounted above the cockpit and under the chassis. In addition to this car, Racer X also drives a car built for the competitions in the film, a T180. This car was titled the &quot;Augury&quot; in the film&#x27;s video game counterpart. Like Racer X&#x27;s unnamed street car, it features a number 9 and has the black and yellow color scheme, with a large black &quot;X&quot; on the front bumper. The T180 only makes one appearance in the film, when Racer X competes to protect Speed in the Fuji race after he has rejected Royalton&#x27;s offer.

===The Mammoth Car===
Appearing only in the anime, it is supposedly the largest racing vehicle in the world. Similar in design to an extremely long trailer truck, the Mammoth Car is mostly red and is built by &quot;Speed Racer&quot; villain Cruncher Block. The Mammoth Car was built almost entirely of $50,000,000 in stolen gold bars. This amount of gold, however, would actually occupy only 74 cubic feet, based on the then price of gold of $35 per ounce. By entering it in &quot;The No Limit World Race&quot;, Cruncher wished to smuggle the gold out of the country. The Mammoth Car&#x27;s main engine has . Each wheel also has an engine with , giving it a total of . It can travel at , on any kind of road or terrain. It makes screeching sounds reminiscent of Godzilla. It has magnetic brakes and is over long, making the Mammoth Car one of the most interesting cars in the series. It was destroyed after it crashed into an oil refinery and melted into its original gold form by the intense heat.

The Mammoth Car makes a small cameo in the 2008 film in the scene where Cruncher Block interrogates Taejo Togokhan (a character created for the movie) after he resists Royalton Industries in the race-fixing business. They were interrupted by Racer X, who battles the Mammoth and saves Taejo. The Mammoth Car in this movie is shown to have view ports for its drivers to shoot out of, just like in the original series, and it is shown to fire missiles from its grill.

The Mammoth Car also makes an appearance along with Flash Marker Jr.&#x27;s X3 in &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot; in the second and third episodes of &quot;The Fast Track&quot; saga, as an enemy program of the show&#x27;s virtual racing track. Although the Mammoth Car is rendered in CGI after its original anime design, the car is missing its grill and many other details that had appeared in the original anime. The Mammoth Car in this episode makes the same sound as it did in the anime. It pays homage to the original series by using its signature attack of surrounding and circling a rival.

===The &quot;Melange&quot; and the &quot;X3&quot;===
The Melange was a roofless racing car numbered with a &quot;3,&quot; driven by Flash Marker. When investigating the mysterious car, Speed recalls the name Melange was the name of Napoleon&#x27;s horse, who saved his life several times in battles. (The name was actually Marengo but became Melange due to an erroneous transliteration from Japanese to English.) When Speed recalls his knowledge of French history, a rendition of Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s painting of &quot;Napoleon Crossing the Alps&quot;, which depicts Napoleon riding Marengo, is drawn in the episode. Pops Racer, however, identified the name &quot;Melange&quot; as a car driven 15 years earlier by a young driver named Flash Marker. The Melange&#x27;s chassis was colored with two shades of purple and had an exposed engine on its hood. During the &quot;Race at Danger Pass&quot;, the Melange, along with Marker, was finally destroyed in a crash caused by the Three Roses Club.

Since then, Flash&#x27;s son, Flash Marker Jr., had plotted revenge on the Three Roses Club by building a car with a sleek, black body marked &quot;X3.&quot; The car was driven through remote control and a robot dummy was placed in the driver&#x27;s seat, broadcasting the phrases &quot;Melange still races&quot; and &quot;Melange is alive&quot; to haunt the Three Roses Club. The X3 was used primarily to deliberately crash into and kill those affiliated with the Three Roses Club, leaving behind a card marked X3 to taunt the remaining members. Speed, who had volunteered to help the police, was chasing down the X3 when it narrowly avoided colliding with a train, leaving the robot dummy hanging over the level crossing&#x27;s boom gate.

Speed noticed its robot &quot;driver&quot; and brought it back to the police for further investigation. Meanwhile, Flash Marker Jr. secretly brought back the damaged car and replaced its body with a replica of the original Melange, placing it over the X3 chassis in his secret underground car factory, to prepare for the next Race at Danger Pass. Since it is the same car with the chassis of the Melange, the car can still be controlled remotely. While the new Melange is still numbered &quot;3&quot;, it has the ability to be changed through remote control to X3, which makes the drivers of the Three Roses Club realize that the &quot;new Melange&quot; is actually the X3. The car, controlled by Flash Jr. in his helicopter, was used to fatally crash into two Three Roses drivers before it was destroyed when it lost control and crashed into the final member of the Three Roses Club.

The first episode has been translated into Armenian, using the Western Armenian dialect.

===The GRX===
The GRX was technically an engine, but it has become more identified with the gold-colored car that housed the engine in the series episode &quot;The Fastest Car on Earth.&quot; The engine was designed by Ben Cranem, and it was responsible for the crashes and deaths of four test drivers and its inventor due to the impossible speeds it could attain. Cranem died and the GRX engine was buried with him, but Oriana Flub and her men exhumed the engine and placed it into the car with a sleek, golden, and markless body.

Oriana convinced Speed to test drive the car with the GRX and Speed was sprayed with a special serum known as the V-gas to artificially sharpen his reflexes. The V-gas causes its driver to become extremely thirsty and if the driver consumed any compound containing water, they would develop a strong phobia of speed. The car got a new driver, Cranem&#x27;s son, Curly. Curly was given the V-gas and soon experienced its side effects. The GRX and its engine were destroyed when he fatally crashed the car due to Curly drinking water during a pit stop.

The GRX episodes mark one of the few continuity errors introduced by the English dubbing. In the first episode the GRX&#x27;s speedometer with a maximum speed of on it is shown in the beginning of the episode, however, due to a continuity error in the Japanese animation, as Speed drives it, the speedometer tops out at This would make the GRX &quot;slower&quot; than the Mammoth Car by the English dialogue.

In the 2008 film adaptation, the name makes an appearance as a car developed by Royalton Industries and driven by Jack &quot;Cannonball&quot; Taylor. The car retains none of the back story from its anime counterpart. It is numbered 66 and colored purple and gold and was transformed from a two-seater to a single-seater. In the Grand Prix race that closes the film, the GRX is the main competitor for Speed in the Mach 6 and features a secret weapon called a &quot;spear-hook&quot; that is illegal in professional racing. After Taylor deploys the device against Speed during the Grand Prix, Speed uses the Mach 6&#x27;s auto-jacks to flip the cars and reveal the hook to the track cameras, automatically disqualifying Taylor and aiding the case built by Inspector Detector against Royalton.

==Speed Racer Enterprises==

The show&#x27;s mainstream success in the United States spawned an ongoing &quot;Speed Racer&quot; franchise. This ranged from comics, video releases, merchandise, a live-action film, and newer series either rebooting or continuing the original series . The franchise began in the early 1990s when a company, Speed Racer Enterprises, acquired rights to the original series. At the time when the series was originally released, very little merchandise was released in the United States. However, during the series&#x27; re-airing during the 1990s, Speed Racer Enterprises was responsible for the creation of actual &quot;Speed Racer&quot; merchandise, ranging from small collectible die-cast cars, to action figures, to home video releases of episodes from the original series. Speed Racer Enterprises was also involved in creating original American takes on the Japanese series such as &quot;The New Adventures of Speed Racer&quot; and &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot;.

Due to Speed Racer Enterprises, the original 1967 series made a comeback through reruns on MTV, broadcast in the early morning hours. In 1993, the series was rebroadcast in syndication concurrently with a new American-created remake. Since all the rights were then under Speed Racer Enterprises, all references to the original rights holder, Trans-Lux, were removed. Therefore, the opening sequence included an entirely recreated logo, which most people are familiar with today; however when Speed Racer Enterprises authorized Volkswagen to use Speed Racer in a July 1996 GTI commercial, J.J. Sedelmaier faithfully replicated the look of the original episode title cards, including the original logo. In October 2002, DIC Entertainment acquired worldwide entertainment rights for the series, consisting of broadcast, merchandising and licensing.

This is the version that later aired on the Cartoon Network in the late afternoon (and later on in late night/overnight) programming, and it was also the version of the series that was first released on Region 1 DVD. 

In December 2013, Tatsunoko gained all rights to the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; franchise, retroactively as to May 2011, as part of a settlement of lawsuits between Speed Racer Enterprises and the animation studio. Tatsunoko had claimed that SRE had exceeded its contractual rights in continuing to license the property after 2011.

===American comic adaptations===
NOW Comics launched an American &quot;Speed Racer&quot; comic book series in 1987. The series became a hit with the high production values of airbrush artist Ken Steacy. The comics continued for 38 issues and included a spin-off &quot;Racer X&quot; series and crossovers. A miniseries adapting &quot;The New Adventures of Speed Racer&quot; was also released, which included art by Oscar González Loyo. In 1993, NOW Comics and Antarctic Press also published a four-issue intercompany crossover between Speed Racer and the characters of Ben Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Ninja High School&quot;.

In 1999, DC Comics/Wildstorm Productions released a new &quot;Speed Racer&quot; limited series, which became the #1 pick of industry publication &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. The manga style of writer/artist Tommy Yune recaptured the look of the original anime, which was soon followed by an industry-wide revival of comic adaptations of other classic animated series. The limited series was collected as the trade paperback &quot;Speed Racer: Born to Race&quot; , and a &quot;Racer X&quot; limited series featuring the artwork of Chinese manga artist Jo Chen.

In 2008, IDW Productions re-released the Wildstorm series as &quot;Speed Racer/Racer X: The Origins Collection&quot;, and previously published issues from NOW Comics as &quot;Speed Racer Vol. 1–5&quot;. A new limited series, &quot;Speed Racer: Chronicles of the Racer&quot;, was also produced.

Seven Seas published an adaptation by Dwayne Alexander Smith in 2007 with art by Elmer Damaso.

===Latin American comic adaptation===

Editorial Abril, an Argentine company established by César Civita, published a Spanish-language comic book in the 1970s. Soon after, his brother, Victor Civita, published a magazine in Brazil through Editora Abril. In 2000, Editora Abril published a series by Tommy Yune.

===American TV series===
In 1993, &quot;The New Adventures of Speed Racer&quot;, an American-produced series, had a much more contemporary art style. It was not a direct continuation of the original series; therefore, it is considered a reboot. While the original series had more realistic themes, such as gang violence and family ties, this series introduced science fiction themes, like robots and mutants. Tatsunoko did not authorize the production of this series, and it was off the air after only 13 episodes.

For the original series&#x27; 40th anniversary in 2006, a Flash-based series of &quot;webisodes&quot; titled &quot;Speed Racer Lives&quot; was released. This series was depicted as a continuation of the original series, taking place many years after it. The series was made available on the Internet solely to promote a new line of toys made by Art Asylum.

In 2008, &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot;, a new series, was released on Nicktoons. Like &quot;Speed Racer Lives&quot;, this series was conceived as taking place years after the original. It focuses on the sons of the original Speed Racer. Its premiere coincided with the live-action feature film in May 2008. Peter Fernandez voices a middle-aged version of Spritle, Speed&#x27;s younger brother from the original Japanese series. The show&#x27;s protagonist, also named Speed, and one of Spritle&#x27;s nephews, is voiced by New Jersey native Kurt Csolak. Larry Schwarz is the creator of the TV series, which is produced by Animation Collective, the creators of &quot;Kappa Mikey&quot; and &quot;Three Delivery&quot;. Like the 1993 remake, this series was not authorized by Tatsunoko. Pangea Corporation has been working with Speed Racer Enterprises for over 20 years and has created several new show iterations.

The original series was also revived on MTV for a short period of time in 1993, moved to Cartoon Network in 1996, and again to its sister network Boomerang until 2005.

In May 2022, Apple TV+ announced that a live action television series from J. J. Abrams is in development with his company Bad Robot. The series will be based on an unproduced script that Abrams had written in the 1990s.

===&quot;Speed Racer: The Movie&quot; (1993 film)===
In 1993, the episodes &quot;The Car Hater&quot; and &quot;Race Against the Mammoth Car&quot; were combined into a feature-length film and briefly released in theaters. It was later released on VHS and DVD and has been available on Hulu. The film also featured old commercials for Bondex ready-mix cementing, National Forest Service (featuring Smokey Bear), Flit insecticide spray, and Pure-Pak milk cartons (featuring Old King Cole), and a bonus cartoon, the Colonel Bleep episode &quot;The Treacherous Pirate&quot;.

===Live-action film===
The Wachowskis wrote and directed a live-action adaptation of &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, released on May 9, 2008. It was poorly received by most critics and was a box office failure, making just under $93 million worldwide against a production budget of at least $120 million (before prints and advertising).

===One-act play===
In 1994, Pangea Corporation wrote and produced a one-act play titled &quot;Spridle: A One Man Show&quot; [sic], which debuted at San Diego Comic-Con and was a huge success. It chronicled what happened to all the Speed Racer characters after the show was canceled, following the concept that the characters were real and had private lives. Spritle, Speed&#x27;s younger brother, relates the tell-all confessional piece as a disgruntled grown-up who is now sour that his career floundered after his celebrity status on the show. It was cited by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine as one of the top 10 best sessions at Comic-Con 1994. The show was written by John Schulte and John Besmehn, produced, directed and moderated by Cheryl Ann Wong.

===Other appearances===
Sequences from the original TV show were used for the entirety of Ghostface Killah&#x27;s music video for &quot;Daytona 500&quot;.

===Merchandise===

====Toys====
The first major toy line of Speed Racer was developed in 1992 by Pangea Corporation for Ace Novelty Toy Company. Products focused on both the classic Speed Racer anime program from Tatsunoko, plus a whole new line based on the Fred Wolf series, &quot;The New Adventures of Speed Racer.&quot; Lego released new Speed Racer construction sets to coincide with the release of the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; film. These include a 242 piece Speed and Snake Oiler set, a 237 piece Racer X and Taejo Togokhan set, a 367 piece Racer X and Cruncher Block set, and a 595 piece Grand Prix set, which includes Trixie, Pops, Speed, Spritle, Chim-Chim, 2 racers, and a racing announcer. Mattel had the master toy license for the 2008 &quot;Speed Racer&quot; film, including action figures, related vehicles, and accessories. Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels division produced miniature replicas of the Mach 5 called the Second Wind, and their Barbie Collector division released a collector doll set featuring Trixie and Speed as they appeared in the film. Also, a Mattel product called UB FunKeys got a new patch, which included a Speed Racer zone.

Jada Toys held the rights to produce die-cast replicas of the Mach 5 from the original animated series.

Playing Mantis released a wide range of the Speed Racer die-cast miniatures, including replicas of the villains&#x27; cars and mini-dioramas under their &quot;Johnny Lightning&quot; line. A limited-edition release of the Mach Four from the Wildstorm comic series remains one of the hardest-to-find collectibles to this day. In 1998 Playing Mantis acquired the rights to the &quot;Captain Action&quot; action figure line, a vintage line about a crusading adventurer who disguises himself as famous super-heroes. Playing Mantis had planned to produce new costumes of Speed Racer, Racer X, and Captain Terror for the revamp of the line, but they were never produced. Control art for the Speed Racer costume appears on the packaging of some figures, and pictures of the prototypes are available online.

Resaurus produced two series of five-inch (127 mm) action figures, rich with articulation and accessories; as well as a full-sized Mach V in 1999. A third series of figures and a full-sized Shooting Star were planned, but the line folded before this could happen. Toynami is currently releasing a large-scale version of the Speed Racer vehicles, including a Mach Five playset complete with all of its gadgets. The company Polar Lights is currently manufacturing two 1/25-scale (according to the box) model kits in standard &quot;glue&quot; and snap-together variations (though the scale of the model inside is closer to 1/32). These can be built with or without the waterproof bubble canopy at the modeler&#x27;s discretion. The kits feature a homing robot and separate jacks; and a rear engine (possibly a tip to NOW comics, which illustrated the engine in the rear).

RC ERTL has produced Speed Racer&#x27;s Mach 5 in 1:18 Die Cast Form with many features of the animated car, including pop out saw blades, ion jacks, opening doors, hood and trunk. It includes Spritle Racer and Chim-Chim figures. Special variants were made with decals celebrating Racer X and other characters from the series as part of the 35th Anniversary Edition in 2001. A similar die-cast version of Racer X&#x27;s Shooting Star was produced as well. It has now been retired from production and is a sought-after collectible.

Art Asylum made a line of toys consisting primarily of their block-figure Minimates in 2006.

====Video games====
In 1992, Accolade published &quot;Speed Racer in The Challenge of Racer X&quot; for MS-DOS. Two years later, Accolade published &quot;Speed Racer in My Most Dangerous Adventures&quot; for Super NES, which was developed by Radical Entertainment.

In 1993, Pangea Corporation created and authored a CD-ROM title that featured game elements, a video clip creator that allowed players to make a classic Speed Racer mash-up moment, along with other themed interactive content. It was marketed under the name &quot;The Compleat Speed Racer.&quot;

Namco released a &quot;Speed Racer&quot; arcade video game in 1995.

&quot;Speed Racer&quot; was released for the PlayStation. It was published in Japan by Tomy (1996) and in North America by Jaleco (1998).

A video game based on the 1997 series, simply titled &quot;Mach Go Go Go&quot;, was released by TOSE and Tomy for the Game Boy (with Super Game Boy support) in Japan.

In 2006, a joint production of enterthemonkey.com and blitinteractive.com, titled &quot;Speed Racer — The Great Plan&quot;, was released as a Web browser game to Shockwave.com. The game has all the original voices, sounds, and Mach 5 controls from the original television show. The game features the operational steering wheel buttons from the original animated series. Each button activates a customized accessory to avoid obstacles and take on rough terrains.

&quot;Speed Racer: The Videogame&quot;, a game based on the movie, was released for the Wii, Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2 platforms. Stars Emile Hirsch (Speed), Christina Ricci (Trixie) and Matthew Fox (Racer X) reprised their roles.

During an interview with &quot;Siliconera&quot;, Capcom producer Ryota Niitsuma commented that Speed Racer was considered for the roster of &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot;, but since he was purely a race car driver, making him fit in in a fighting game was unfeasible.

====DVD releases====
Artisan Home Entertainment/Lionsgate Entertainment (through Family Home Entertainment) released episodes 1 through 11 of the original series in DVD format in the U.S. and Canada on April 22, 2003. This turned out to be the first in a series of five DVD re-releases of the show. The second volume, containing episodes 12 through 23, went on sale on May 18, 2004. The DVD came in a special package where one could push a button on the cover and the Mach 5&#x27;s headlights would light up, while a portion of the show&#x27;s English theme song played. Volumes 1 and 2 were re-released as a two-disc set on April 20, 2010. The third volume came out on May 24, 2005, with the discs packaged in a round metal box made to resemble the steering wheel of the Mach 5. It contains episodes 24 through 36. This volume was later released to promote the live-action film in a standard keep case. Lionsgate Family Entertainment released the fourth volume, which featured episodes 37 through 44, on March 14, 2006; this volume included a die-cast toy Mach 5. The last episode, &quot;Race the Laser Tank&quot;, was time-compressed (in other words, sped up), similar to when Cartoon Network aired the series in the mid-1990s. Although nothing was removed from the episode, the higher-pitched voices of the characters and the diminished quality of the episode due to the time compression upset some fans. The fifth and last volume was released on October 31, 2006. This volume included episodes 45 through 52 and for a limited time it came with a miniature license plate with the inscription, &quot;Go-Speed Racer-Go!&quot;

The entire anime series was released in Australia on April 30, 2008, and in the United States later that year, on October 7. The U.S. release of the entire anime series is a repackaging of all five individually released volumes into a comic book-style box set, in homage to the &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; manga. In addition, a bonus disc containing special features and an episode of &quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot; is included. These six discs were packaged in an exclusive die-cast casing modeled after the Mach 5.

All previous DVD releases went out of print after Tatsunoko gained worldwide rights to the franchise.

After Funimation garnered the rights, they released the English version on separate DVD and Blu-ray sets on May 30, 2017. On November 7, they released a Blu-ray + DVD Combo Collector&#x27;s Edition of both the English and Japanese versions, as well as the Japanese version of &quot;Speed Racer X&quot;, known as &quot;Mach Go Go Go: Restart&quot; on DVD. It has a bust of Speed Racer with sound effects, as well as a key chain and an exclusive interview with the voice actress of Trixie and Spritle, Corinne Orr.

In 2024, it was announced that Shout! Studios had acquired the distribution rights to the series and the original Japanese series, which was released on digital streaming on June 1, 2024.

<text>Desmidiales, commonly called the desmids (&quot;Gr.&quot; &quot;desmos&quot;, bond or chain), are an order in the Charophyta, a division of green algae in which the land plants (Embryophyta) emerged. Desmids consist of single-celled (sometimes filamentous or colonial) microscopic green algae. Because desmids are highly symmetrical, attractive, and come in a diversity of forms, they are popular subjects for microscopists, both amateur and professional.

The desmids belong to the class Zygnematophyceae. Although they are sometimes grouped together as a single family Desmidiaceae, most classifications recognize three to five families, usually within their own order, Desmidiales.

The Desmidiales comprise around 40 genera and 5,000 to 6,000 species, found mostly but not exclusively in fresh water. In general, desmids prefer acidic waters (pH between 4.8 and 7.0), so many species may be found in the fissures between patches of sphagnum moss in marshes. As desmids are sensitive to changes in their environments, they are useful as bioindicators for water and habitat quality.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;desmid&quot; typically refers to a group of microscopic, mostly single-celled algae in the class Zygnematophyceae. Within the desmids, a distinction is typically made between &quot;saccoderm&quot; and &quot;placoderm&quot; desmids. Saccoderm desmids, corresponding to the family Mesotaeniaceae in the order Zygnematales, consist of cells that are unconstricted at the middle, lack median suture lines, and do not have mucilage-secreting pores in the cell wall. Meanwhile, placoderm desmids, corresponding to the order Desmidiales, consist of cells with two symmetrical halves, and mucilage-secreting pores in the cell wall. Here, the term &quot;desmids&quot; and &quot;placoderm desmids&quot; will be used interchangeably to refer to the Desmidiales.

==Morphology==

The structure of these algae is unicellular, and lacks flagella. Although most desmid species are unicellular, some genera form chains of cells, called filaments. A few genera form non-filamentous colonies, with individual cells connected by threads or remnants of parent cell walls.

The cell of a desmid is often divided into two symmetrical compartments separated by a narrow bridge or isthmus, wherein the spherical nucleus is located. Each semi-cell houses a large, often folded chloroplast for photosynthesizing. One or more pyrenoids can be found. These form carbohydrates for energy storage. The cell-wall, of two halves (termed semicells), which, in a few species of &quot;Closterium&quot; and &quot;Penium&quot;, are of more than one piece, has two distinct layers, the inner composed mainly of cellulose, the outer is stronger and thicker, often furnished with spines, granules, warts et cetera. It is made up of a base of cellulose impregnated with other substances including iron compounds, which are especially prominent in some species of &quot;Closterium&quot; and &quot;Penium&quot; and is not soluble in an ammoniacal solution of copper oxide.

Desmids assume a variety of highly symmetrical and generally attractive shapes, among those elongated, star-shaped and rotund configurations, which provide the basis for their classification. The largest among them may be visible to the unaided eye.

Desmids possess characteristic crystals of barium sulphate at either end of the cell which exhibit continuous Brownian motion. The function of these crystals is completely unknown.

Many desmids also secrete translucent, gelatinous mucilage from pores in the cell wall that acts as a protecting agent. These pores are either, as in &quot;Micrasterias&quot;, uniformly distributed across the cell-wall but always appear to be absent in the region of the isthmus, or, in highly ornamented forms, as many genera of &quot;Cosmarium&quot;, grouped symmetrically around the bases of the spines, warts and so on with which the cell is provided.

In the inner layer of the wall the pore is a simple canal, but in the outer, except in &quot;Closterium&quot;, the canal is surrounded by a specially differentiated cylindrical zone, not composed of cellulose, through which the canal passes. This is termed the pore-organ. The canals are no doubt in all cases occupied by threads of mucilage in process of excretion. At the inner surface of the wall they terminate in lens- or button-shaped swellings, while from the outer end of the pore-organ there sometimes arise delicate radiating or club-shaped masses of mucilage through which the canal passes and which appear to be more or less permanent in character. In most cases, however, these are absent or only represented by small perforated buttons.

==Reproduction==
Desmids most commonly reproduce by asexual fission. During cell division, the two halves of a cell separate, and each half develops into a new cell. After division, a cell may be asymmetric since the recently formed half is smaller than the original half.

In adverse conditions, desmids may reproduce sexually through a process of conjugation, which are also found among other closely related taxa in the Zygnematophyceae. Sexual reproduction is rare, and many species have never been observed sexually reproducing.

The family Gonatozygaceae is sometimes included within the Peniaceae, reducing the number of families from four to three. A fifth family Mesotaeniaceae was formerly included in the Desmidiales, but analysis of cell wall structure and DNA sequences show that the group is more closely related to the Zygnemataceae, and so is now placed together with that family in the order Zygnematales. However, the Zygnemataceae may have emerged in the Mesotaeniaceae.

==Habitat and distribution==

Desmids are found in freshwater habitats all over the world, but strongly prefer bogs, mires, and other nutrient-poor wetlands. They generally have strict ecological requirements: most species prefer waters with low amounts of dissolved calcium and magnesium, low salinity levels, and somewhat acidic pH. In waters with higher amounts of nutrients, desmids rapidly become outcompeted. Desmid species are generally found attached to aquatic vegetation, such as &quot;Utricularia&quot;, or tychoplanktonic; that is, free-floating in the water column after being disturbed.

Although the Desmidiales are cosmopolitan, a number of species appear to be restricted to continents or biogeographical realms; this is likely because desmids have strict ecological requirements and do not produce resting spores, making successful dispersal less likely. Therefore, they can be grouped into several regions each with their own characteristic desmid floras. The Indo-Malayan to North Australian realm, for example, is characterized by species such as &quot;Micrasterias ceratofera&quot;, while equatorial Africa is characterized by species such as &quot;Allorgeia incredibilis&quot;.

==Ecology==
Although desmids are incredibly diverse, with up to hundreds of them being found in a single site, their interactions with the environment are relatively unknown.
Desmids are host to a wide array of parasites, particularly fungal parasites called chytrids. They are also grazed by microscopic aquatic heterotrophs, such as crustaceans, rotifers, and ciliates.

<doc id="238882" wikidata="Q375760" url="?curid=238882" title="List of rivers of Switzerland">
<text>The following is a list of rivers of Switzerland (and tributaries thereof). Included rivers flow either entirely or partly through Switzerland or along its international borders. Swiss rivers belong to five drainage basins, i.e. of the Rhine, the Rhône, the Po, the Danube or the Adige. Of these, only the Rhine and Rhône flow through Switzerland (and also originate there). The waters therefore drain into either the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea or the Black Sea.

Below, rivers are grouped by length, drainage area, orography and in alphabetical order. A list of border rivers is also given.

==Rivers by length==
Rivers with over in Switzerland
==Rivers by drainage area==

Basins covering more than , counting only the area in Switzerland.
==Rivers by orography==






Switzerland is drained into four directions: 
*North Sea, via the Rhine.
*Mediterranean Sea:
**Gulf of Lion, via the Rhône.
**Adriatic Sea, via the Po and the Adige.
*Black Sea, via the Danube.

===Drainage basins===
Witenwasserenstock mountain is the triple divide of the drainage basins between the Rhine, Rhône and Po. Lunghin Pass is the triple divide between the Rhine, Danube and Po.

Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea (the lower in the list, the more upstream). Some rivers (e.g. Danube) do not flow through Switzerland themselves, but they are mentioned for having Swiss tributaries. They are given in &quot;italics&quot;. The five drainage basins are highlighted in bold.

<text>The Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA) is a student organisation formed in 1927 at the University of Glasgow which supports Scottish independence.

==History==
GUSNA is important historically as it predated many pro-independence organisations including the Scottish National Party itself. It is the forerunner of the National Party of Scotland (NPS) which is itself a forerunner of the modern Scottish National Party. One of the three founding members of GUSNA was John MacCormick who had previously been involved in the Glasgow University Labour Club.

GUSNA was thrown into prominence in the early 1950s when a group of its members (including Ian Hamilton who would later become a well known Queen&#x27;s Counsel) took the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1950. This caused a huge scandal among the British establishment and it was not until April 1951 that the stone was found by the authorities.

GUSNA has, almost since its inception, tried to play an active part in the life of Glasgow University with its members regularly being involved in the Students&#x27; Representative Council as well as regularly nominating candidates for the election of the Rectorship of the university.
Notable GUSNA Rectorial candidates of the past have included Robert Cunninghame-Graham and John MacCormick (who with Ian Hamilton as his campaign manager was successful in being elected). More recent candidates have been Ian Hamilton, Alasdair Gray and Alan Bissett; with the most recent being Aamer Anwar, who was elected in 2017.
GUSNA is affiliated to SNP Students, the student wing of the Scottish National Party, and played a leading role in its formation in the 1960s.

Prominent former members of GUSNA have included Winnie Ewing, Neil MacCormick (son of John MacCormick), Mhairi Black, and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The current president is Sam Parker.

<text>Marbleizing (also spelt marbleising) or faux marbling is the preparation and finishing of a surface to imitate the appearance of polished marble. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.


==History==
Faux stone painting was widely used in Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.

The sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including Baroque, Palladian, neoclassical and historical Revival styles as well as Art Nouveau and Art Deco buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.

The art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was Thomas Kershaw.

==Practitioners==
===Thomas Kershaw===
Kershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire, England, in April 1819.
He achieved international fame, winning a number of prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.

Kershaw&#x27;s work was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout England and Wales and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in St Petersburg. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in Buckingham Palace where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.

===William Holgate===
In modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, Lancashire, was possibly the finest grainer and marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before. His achievements include the prestigious award known as the &quot;Freedom of the City and Guilds of London&quot; and was made “Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London,&quot; in 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon.

==Techniques==

Other techniques for producing faux marble include Scagliola, a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and terrazzo. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.

Some professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colours, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.

<doc id="238894" wikidata="Q1517005" url="?curid=238894" title="McDonaldization">
<text>McDonaldization is the process of a society adopting the characteristics of a fast-food restaurant. The McWord concept was proposed by sociologist George Ritzer in his 1993 book &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot;. McDonaldization is a reconceptualization of rationalization and scientific management. Where Max Weber used the model of the bureaucracy to represent the direction of this changing society, Ritzer sees the fast-food restaurant as a more representative contemporary paradigm.

==Aspects==
Ritzer highlighted four primary components of McDonaldization:

* – the optimal method for accomplishing a task. In this context, Ritzer has a very specific meaning of &quot;efficiency&quot;. In the example of McDonald&#x27;s customers, it is the fastest way to get from being hungry to being full. Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time.
* Calculability – objective should be quantifiable (e.g., sales) rather than subjective (e.g. taste). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product. This allows people to quantify how much they are getting versus how much they are paying. Organizations want consumers to believe that they are getting a large amount of product for not a lot of money. Workers in these organizations are judged by how fast they are instead of the quality of work they do.
* Predictability – standardized and uniform services. &quot;Predictability&quot; means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product every time when interacting with the McDonaldized organization. This also applies to the workers in those organizations. Their tasks are highly repetitive, highly routine, and predictable.
* Control – standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies

With these four principles of the fast food industry, a strategy which is rational within a narrow scope can lead to outcomes that are harmful or irrational. As these processes spread to other parts of society, modern society&#x27;s new social and cultural characteristics are created. For example, as McDonald&#x27;s enters a country and consumer patterns are unified, cultural hybridization occurs.

==De-McDonaldization==
Organizations have been making an effort to deny the rationalization of McDonaldization. Efforts are related to focusing on quality instead of quantity, enjoying the unpredictability of service and product and employing more skilled workers without any outside control.
Protests have also been rising in nation-states in order to slow down the process of McDonaldization and to protect their localization and traditional value.

Some local case studies show how adjusting the rational model of McDonald&#x27;s to suit local cultural preferences results in a diminution of the original McDonald&#x27;s product. The more the company adjusts to local conditions, the more appeal the scientific calculations of the specifically American product may be lost. This can be used to justify McDonald&#x27;s uniform approach. The ubiquity of McDonald&#x27;s and the uniformity of its practices is a contributing factor to globalization.

==Examples==
Junk food news, defined here as inoffensive and trivial news served up in palatable portions, is an example of McDonaldization. Another example could be McUniversities, which features modularized curricula, delivering degrees in a fast-track pick-and-mix fashion to satisfy all tastes. The diminished quality of these products can only be disguised by extensive advertising which constantly repackages them to look new.

In penology, there has been a shift from punishments and treatment tailored to individual offenders, to attempting to control classes of offenders who are considered to be at high risk of recidivism through standardized penalties, such as those specified by three-strikes laws or sentencing guidelines. Offenders are classified by security level and sent to facilities deemed capable of adequately incapacitating prisoners in their risk category. Technology such as electronic surveillance, electronic monitoring, urinalysis, and computer-based offender tracking systems are often used in place of humans in the penal system.

==Response of McDonald&#x27;s==
The response from McDonald&#x27;s, expressed by its representatives in the United Kingdom, is that Ritzer, like other commentators, uses the company&#x27;s size and brand recognition to promote ideas that do not necessarily relate to the company&#x27;s business practices.

==Education==
It has been argued by a westerner that an example of the phenomenon of McDonaldization can be seen in education, where there is seen to be increasing similarity between that of Western classrooms and the rest of the world. Slater argues that the class size, layout and pedagogy in Peru closely resemble that of America, with clear examples of Western culture focused on efficiency of transfer of knowledge in other parts of the world. Furthermore, Slater goes on to demonstrate that the McDonaldization of education could have many negative side effects; particularly that it does not promote inquiry or creativity. Therefore, schools will become less effective at educating children as they will fail to develop critical and creative thinkers.

According to Wong, the influence of McDonaldization has also affected Higher Education classrooms.
* Efficiency – Computer graded exams limit the amount of time necessary for instructors to grade their students.
* Calculability – Letter Grades and Grade Point Averages are used and calculated to measure a student&#x27;s success over the course of their academic career.
* Predictability – Course availability and requirements have become more standardized amongst universities, making it easier to find similar courses and content at different locations.
* Control – Courses are structured very specifically and must meet certain requirements and follow certain guidelines. Courses begin and end at the same time on the same predetermined days and last for a specific number of weeks.

A study by Carroll (2013) describes how e-learning has become one of the biggest phenomena of educational literature in recent years. Although the potential promise of e-learning is often expected within the process of learning, much of the emphasis is in fact on the electronic issues to facilitate learning, with little regard for its consequences on the learning process. Consequently, this often erodes the human factor in learning – making the learning process a more isolated experience. This article suggests that academics should become more cautious with their acceptance of facilitating learning through e-learning platforms without fully understanding the impact on students learning experiences. It also explores the changing role of students in discovering, questioning, and seeking knowledge into that of ‘consumers of pre-packed education.

The McDonaldization of Education is not only limited to physical classroom settings. It is predicted by George Ritzer that MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) will make future education even more McDonaldized. While it is possible to create a new original MOOC every semester, it is more likely a basic structure will be created and subsequently altered each time in order to make their creation more efficient. Over time as the interest and quality of MOOCs increases, the same pre recorded MOOCs may be used by many different universities, creating predictable content for MOOC students. Computer graded exams will be used more frequently than written essay exams to make it more efficient for the instructors. Yet since MOOCs limit the amount of contact between student and teacher, it will be difficult to engage the course on a deeper and more meaningful level.

<text>Lake Saint Francis (, ) is a lake which borders southeastern Ontario, southwestern Quebec and northern New York State. It is located on the Saint Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. The lake forms part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

The city of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield is located at the east end of the lake.

Lac Saint-François National Wildlife Area, located on the south shore of the lake, protects wetlands located on the shores of the lake. This area provides important habitat for Redhead ducks and other waterfowl. Thousands of migrating waterfowl stop over in this region. In 1987, it was recognized as a wetland of international significance under the Ramsar Convention.

The Charlottenburgh Marsh, including Cooper Marsh, is an important wetland area located on the north shore of the lake.

<doc id="238901" wikidata="Q182767" url="?curid=238901" title="Echo">
<text>In audio signal processing and acoustics, an echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. The delay is directly proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, a building, or the walls of enclosed and empty rooms.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;echo&quot; derives from the Greek ἠχώ (&quot;ēchō&quot;), itself from ἦχος (&quot;ēchos&quot;), &#x27;sound&#x27;. Echo in Greek mythology was a mountain nymph whose ability to speak was cursed, leaving her able only to repeat the last words spoken to her. 

==Nature==
Some animals, such as cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats, use echo for location sensing and navigation, a process known as echolocation. Echoes are also the basis of sonar technology.

==Acoustic phenomenon==
Walls or other hard surfaces, such as mountains and privacy fences, reflect acoustic waves. The reason for reflection may be explained as a discontinuity in the propagation medium. This can be heard when the reflection returns with sufficient magnitude and delay to be perceived distinctly. When sound, or the echo itself, is reflected multiple times from multiple surfaces, it is characterized as a reverberation.
The human ear cannot distinguish echo from the original direct sound if the delay is less than 1/10 a second. The speed of sound in dry air is approximately 341m/s at a temperature of 25°C. Therefore, the reflecting object must be more than from the sound source for the echo to be perceived by a person at the source. When a sound produces an echo in two seconds, the reflecting object is away. In nature, canyon walls or rock cliffs facing water are the most common natural settings for hearing echoes. The echo strength is frequently measured in sound pressure level (SPL) relative to the directly transmitted wave. Echoes may be desirable (as in systems).

== Use of echo == 
In sonar, ultrasonic waves are more energetic than audible sounds. They can travel undeviated through a long distance, confined to a narrow beam, and are not easily absorbed in the medium. Hence, sound ranging and echo depth sounding uses ultrasonic waves. Ultrasonic waves are sent in all directions from the ship and are received at the receiver after the reflection from an obstacle (enemy ship, iceberg, or sunken ship). The distance from the obstacle is found using the formula d = (V*t)/2. Echo depth sounding is the process of finding the depth of the sea using this process. In the medical field, ultrasonic waves of sound are used in ultrasonography and echo cardiography. 

== Echo in music==
Electric echo effects have been used since the 1950s in music performance and recording. The Echoplex is a tape delay effect, first made in 1959, that recreates the sound of an acoustic echo. Designed by Mike Battle, the Echoplex set a standard for the effect in the 1960s and was used by most of the notable guitar players of the era; original Echoplexes are highly sought after. While Echoplexes were used heavily by guitar players (and the occasional bass player, such as Chuck Rainey, or trumpeter, such as Don Ellis), many recording studios also used the Echoplex. Beginning in the 1970s, Market built the solid-state Echoplex for Maestro. In the 2000s, most echo effects units used electronic or digital circuitry to recreate the echo effect.

<text>The Semmering railway () in Austria, which starts at Gloggnitz and leads over the Semmering to Mürzzuschlag, was the first mountain railway in Europe built with a standard gauge track. It is commonly referred to as the world&#x27;s first true mountain railway, given the very difficult terrain and the considerable altitude difference that was mastered during its construction. It is still fully functional as a part of the Southern Railway which is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways.

==History==

The Semmering railway was constructed between 1848 and 1854 by some 20,000 workers under the project&#x27;s designer and director Carl von Ghega born in Venice as Carlo Ghega in an Albanian family. The construction features 14 tunnels (among them the 1,431 m summit tunnel), 16 viaducts (several two-storey) and over 100 stone arch bridges and 11 small iron bridges. The stations and the buildings for the supervisors were often built directly from the waste rock dug out when making the tunnels.

Across an overall track length of 41 km the Semmering railway overcomes an altitude difference of 460 m; on 60% of its length the gradient is 2.0-2.5% (equivalent to a 1-meter difference in altitude on a 40 m route distance) and 16% exhibit a curvature radius of only 190 m. This was an entirely new technical dimension of railway construction, and new instruments and methods of surveying had to be developed to handle the resulting challenges. Also, new technologies were employed for the Engerth locomotives because the types in general use at this time could not handle the extreme gradients and turning radii.

Even while being built, the Semmering railway was perceived as an effort of &quot;landscape gardening&quot;, i.e. it attempted a harmonious combination of technology and nature. The unique travel experience which the Semmering railway offered contributed significantly to the original opening of the Semmering region for tourism. Numerous hotels and mansions are witnesses of this epoch. This enormous upswing to the turn of the century and the re-evaluation of the region as a winter sports area in the first third of the 20th Century were interrupted first by World War I and then by the changed recreational needs of the population. Therefore, this unique culture landscape could be preserved with little change. A trip on the Semmering railway, which is in full use 160 years after its building, still impresses the traveller as a special experience by its varied landscape, the typical style of its mansions and the characteristic sequence of viaducts and tunnels.

In 1998 the Semmering railway was added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage sites.

==Locomotives==

===The Semmering trials===
A competition was held in 1851 to decide which locomotives would be bought for operation on the Semmering Railway. One stretch of the line had gradients of 1 in 40 (2.5%) and curves with a minimum radius of and a maximum radius of . A speed of was required to be maintained and a maximum axle loading of , with a boiler pressure not exceeding .

===Entrants===
There were four entrants, &quot;Bavaria&quot;, built by Maffei; &quot;Neustadt&quot; built by Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik; &quot;Seraing&quot; built by Société anonyme John Cockerill in Belgium; and &quot;Vindobona&quot; built by the Locomotive Factory of Wien-Gloggnitzer Bahn in Vienna. All four locomotives fulfilled the conditions of the trial, but did not prove reliable in practice.

===Developments===
The Semmering Trials led to a number of developments in locomotive design: Fairlie&#x27;s Patent of 1863, the Meyer locomotive and the Mallet locomotive.

===Engerth design===

The Engerth design articulated the tender with the main locomotive frame, allowing some of the weight of the fuel and water to be carried on the driving wheels to improve adhesion. Because the tender was articulated, rather than directly attached to the frame, the locomotive could traverse relatively sharp curves, while still enjoying the advantage of the additional adhesive weight gain. The original design also included an indirect drive from the main driving wheels to the wheels under the tender. This arrangement proved too complex to maintain and was dropped from the design.

Sixteen locomotives were supplied to the Semmering Railway between November 1853 and May 1854. They proved capable of uphill on gradients of 1 in 40 (2.5%). An Engerth locomotive was featured on an Austrian stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Semmering Railway in 2004. The Engerth locomotive also appeared on a 25 Euro coin issued by Austria in 2004.

===Present day===

Currently, the Semmering railway uses the well-known Siemens ES64U2 locomotives for this route as the main workhorse of the ÖBB. Starting with 1963 it also uses ÖBB class 1142 locomotives, now used as banking engines on the line, and also the ÖBB Class 1144 since 1977 as banking engines and also freight/passenger engines. In 1971 this is where a SJ Rc locomotive conducted trials that put the basis of the ÖBB Class 1043.

For local trains the Bombardier Talent (ÖBB Class 4024) and  Siemens Desiro ML (ÖBB Class 4744) are used.

==Semmering Base Tunnel==

On April 25, 2012, ground was broken for the construction of the 27.3 km Semmering base tunnel. This tunnel will bypass 41 km of the Semmeringbahn. The tunnel is expected to open in 2030, with a total cost of €3.9b.

==The Railway in numismatics==
The Semmering alpine railway has been the main motive for many collector coins and medals. One of the most famous and recent ones is the 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway Coin. The obverse shows two locomotives: a historical and a modern one. The reverse of the coin shows a typical Semmering view. An Engerth steam locomotive just emerged from a tunnel crossing one of the distinctive viaducts.
The 1967 Austrian schilling note features the engineer on one side, and a Semmering scene (including one of the distinctive two-tier bridges) on the other.

<doc id="238906" wikidata="Q832515" url="?curid=238906" title="Blues Brothers 2000">
<text>Blues Brothers 2000 is a 1998 American musical action comedy film directed by John Landis from a screenplay written by Landis and Dan Aykroyd, both of whom were also producers, and starring Aykroyd and John Goodman. The film serves as a sequel to the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; It also includes cameo appearances by various musicians.

The film was released on February 6, 1998, to mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. It grossed $32.1 million on a budget of $30 million. The film is dedicated to John Belushi, Cab Calloway and John Candy, cast members from the original film who had died prior to its production, in addition to Junior Wells, who died one month before it was released.

==Plot==
Elwood Blues is released from prison after serving eighteen years for the events of the previous film and is informed that his brother, &quot;Joliet&quot; Jake Blues, has died. He is picked up by Matara, a friend who works for his former drummer Willie Hall, who wants to help him get back on his feet.

Before meeting up with Willie, Elwood asks to be dropped off to see Mother Mary Stigmata who is now working at a hospital after the orphanage was closed. She informs him that Curtis has also died but fathered an illegitimate son named Cabel Chamberlain, who is an Illinois State Police commander, and introduces him to an orphan named Buster to suggest mentoring him.

Against Stigmata&#x27;s advice, Elwood tracks Cabel down at his police headquarters to inform him of his real father and asks him to join The Blues Brothers Band, which he plans on reforming. Cabel, upset by the news and offended by the suggestion to join him after seeing Elwood&#x27;s and Jake&#x27;s criminal histories, throws him out of the building, where Buster steals his wallet; it contains enough money for Elwood to purchase a new Bluesmobile.

Elwood and Buster begin tracking down members of the former band to recruit them from their current jobs. Willie runs a strip club and joins after it is burned down by the Russian mafia because Elwood enlisted the help of Willie&#x27;s barman, &quot;Mighty&quot; Mack McTeer, to try and convince them to leave the club alone, by getting two of the mobsters drunk and leaving them bound and gagged in an alley. Mack also joins the band as well, along with former members Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy who joins again at the advice of his wife, with whom he now runs a Mercedes-Benz dealership, as well as saxophonist &quot;Blue Lou&quot; Marini. Three members work at a radio station and quickly agree to join, and finally, Murphy Dunne joins after his boss at a call center gives him permission.

The newly reformed band uses their old agent to book them a show. On the way to it, they are followed by Cabel and the Illinois state police, who are now looking for Elwood for stealing Cabel&#x27;s wallet earlier, and believing that he has kidnapped Buster. While avoiding the police, Elwood interrupts a militia group meeting, unintentionally destroying their boat full of explosives they planned to use.

The band arrives at the show to find they have been mistakenly booked as a Bluegrass band, but perform anyway. Afterwards, they evade capture by the police, but they catch up with them at a tent revival where Reverend Cleophus James is preaching. Before Cabel can arrest them, he has an epiphany brought on by Reverend Cleophus that he should join the band instead of being a police officer. The band evades capture once more, now with Cabel joining them, who the police believe is brainwashed.

The band continues on to their next booking, an audition for a Battle of the Bands put on by Queen Mousette who Mack informs is allegedly a 130-year-old voodoo witch. Queen Mousette requests the band play something Caribbean; when Elwood explains they don&#x27;t play Caribbean music, she casts a spell on them to play anyway. She accepts the band into the battle, however, Elwood, Mack, and Cabel are turned into statues.

At the show, Queen Mousette undoes the spell to allow the Blues Brothers to play against the Louisiana Gator Boys, a supergroup of blues musicians who win the battle. After the battle, the show is interrupted by the arrival of the Russian mafia and militia group from earlier; they are turned into rats by Queen Mousette. The Illinois state police arrive, but stand down after Cabel informs them that he is okay. Elwood suggests that the two bands jam together on stage. When Mother Mary Stigmata arrives, Elwood uses the performance as cover to say goodbye to Cabel and Mack and escape with Buster, with the police giving chase.

==Production==
Shortly before John Belushi&#x27;s death, a sequel to &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; had been considered. John Landis revealed in an interview:&quot;We&#x27;d always intended for a sequel with John, but of course when he passed away, it was obvious we weren&#x27;t going to do it. But Danny had been performing with John Goodman and Jimmy Belushi and the band, and he said, &quot;You know, this is great, because this music is recognized now—let&#x27;s do a movie.&quot; I said, &quot;Great, sure, okay,&quot; and we wrote what I thought was a terrific script. Then Universal Studios eviscerated it. That was a strange experience, because the first thing they said was that it had to be PG, which meant they couldn&#x27;t use profanity, which is basically cutting the Blues Brothers&#x27; nuts off. The first movie is an R-rated film, but there&#x27;s no nudity or violence in it. It&#x27;s just the language. Then they said, &quot;You have to have a child, you have to have…&quot; The bottom line was, the only way that movie was going to get made was to agree with everything they said. You know the difference between a brown-nose and a shithead? Depth perception. That&#x27;s the only time I never really fought with the studio, because they didn&#x27;t really want to make it. So we did every single thing they said. By the time we&#x27;d done that, the script was kind of homogenized and uninteresting. Danny said, &quot;It&#x27;s about the music. It&#x27;s just about the music, John, so don&#x27;t worry about it. We&#x27;ll get the best people, and we&#x27;ll make a great album, and get these people on film. We have to document these people.&quot; It&#x27;s interesting, because, as much as I make fun of Danny, three or four of those guys have passed away since we made that movie. People say, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;ve got Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway, and John Lee Hooker in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;—who&#x27;s in &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;?&quot; The answer? Everyone else. The first movie has five musical numbers, and the second movie has 18.&quot;

The film made it into the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for the biggest car pile-up, a record previously held by the original film. 63 cars were used in the scene after Elwood says to the band, &quot;Don&#x27;t look back.&quot; Inevitably, everyone looks back and sees the massive pile-up. Portions of this scene were filmed in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

===Casting===

The film was originally intended to include Brother Zee Blues (Jim Belushi). But due to an already existing television deal (he had been cast in the ABC drama &quot;Total Security&quot;), he was unable to appear and the script was altered to include Cab Blues (Joe Morton). This character was named Cabel as an homage to Cab Calloway, who died four years prior to the film&#x27;s release. (His character Curtis was revealed to have died in the film along with Jake.)

The Blues Brothers&#x27; original keyboardist, Paul Shaffer, had been committed to Gilda Radner&#x27;s one-woman show on Broadway &quot;Gilda Live&quot; and was therefore unable to appear in the original film. He was replaced by actor-musician Murphy Dunne. Shaffer does appear in this one, taking a week off from &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to film his role as Queen Moussette&#x27;s majordomo and emcee of the Battle of the Bands (Warren Zevon took his place that week on Letterman&#x27;s show). Shaffer shaved his head for the role, a change in appearance he chose to retain permanently.

During the &quot;Funky Nassau&quot; number, Shaffer in his character of &quot;Marco,&quot; asks to cut in on keyboards, which Murph allows. This marks the first time on-screen that the Blues Brothers Band played with their original keyboardist.

Several cast members from the original film reprised their roles, including Frank Oz, Jeff Morris, Steve Lawrence, Kathleen Freeman, Aretha Franklin, and James Brown.

==Release==
The film was screened out of competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

===Box office===
The film grossed a little over $14 million in box office sales in North America.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. 

It earned a D score from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it two out of four stars, writing, &quot;&quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; has a lot of good music in it. It would have had more if they&#x27;d left out the story, which would have been an excellent idea. The film is lame comedy surrounded by high-energy blues (and some pop, rock and country music).&quot;

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Despite the poor reception, Aykroyd remained proud of the film, saying in a 2024 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;the second movie’s a small-g good accompaniment to the first. Erykah Badu’s song was worth the price of admission. I’m glad we did that story, and I wish Jimmy [Belushi] had been in it, but everybody was good in it, and it was fun.&quot;

==Video game==

A &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; video game was released for the Nintendo 64 on November 17, 2000, two years after the film&#x27;s release. The plot involves Elwood as the main character going through different chapters and levels while trying to save the kidnapped members of the band one by one. Like the film on which it based and the video game based on the original film, it was poorly received.

==Soundtrack==
== Future ==
In a 2023 interview, Jim Belushi stated that Aykroyd had kept pitching him several ideas for a third film, such as a female-centric film where Elwood mentors a group called the Blues Sisters, and a film where Elwood finds Jake&#x27;s long-lost biological brother in Albania.

<text>The Battle of Callinicum took place on Easter Saturday, 19 April 531 AD, between an army of the Byzantine Empire under Belisarius and a Sasanian cavalry force commanded by Azarethes. After being defeated at the Battle of Dara, the Sasanians moved to invade Roman Syria in an attempt to turn the tide of the war. Belisarius&#x27; rapid response foiled the plan, and his troops pushed the Persians to the Syrian border through maneuvering before forcing a battle in which the Sasanians won a Pyrrhic victory.

== Prelude ==
In April 531 AD, the Persian king Kavadh I sent an army under Azarethes, consisting of a cavalry force numbering about 15,000 Aswaran with an additional 5,000 Lakhmid Arab cavalry under Al-Mundhir, to invade Syria, not through the heavily fortified frontier cities of Roman Mesopotamia, but through the less conventional but also less-defended route in Commagene in order to capture Syrian cities such as Antioch.

The Persian army crossed the frontier at Circesium on the Euphrates and marched north. As they neared Callinicum, Belisarius set out to follow them as they advanced westwards. Belisarius&#x27; forces consisted of about 5,000 men and another 3,000 Ghassanid Arab allies, for the remainder of his army had been left to secure Dara. The Byzantines blocked the Persian advance at Chalcis, where reinforcements under Hermogenes also arrived, bringing the Byzantine force to some 20,000 men. The Persians were forced to withdraw to the east, followed by the Byzantines.

The battle would occur on Easter Sunday, and the convention at the time was to fast on the day and well into the night. Due to this, if Belisarius were to give battle he would have to fight using hungry troops. Azarethes sent a message to Belisarius asking him to honor the fast for the sake of the Christians and Jews in his army, as well as the Christian forces of Belisarius himself. Belisarius was willing to agree and originally intended to drive off the Persians without a risky battle. The Byzantine troops, however, were over-confident after their recent victories at Dara and Satala and clamored for battle. After failing to convince his men, and realizing they would possibly mutiny unless he agreed, Belisarius prepared his force for battle.

== Deployment ==

The two armies met outside Callinicum on 19 April 531. Belisarius anchored his left flank on the Euphrates, composed of the Byzantine heavy infantry under the command of the emperor Justinian&#x27;s bodyguard Petrus. The Byzantine cavalry was stationed in the center, many of which were cataphracts under the command of Ascan. Next were the Lycaonian and/or Isaurian infantry under Stephanacius and Longinus, positioned such that their right was anchored on a rising slope occupied by the army&#x27;s right wing, which consisted of the 5,000 allied Ghassanid cavalry. Belisarius himself took up a position in the center of his army. Unlike his deployment at Dara, he concentrated his best cavalry in the center and the infantry and allied cavalry on the wings, possibly because he anticipated the infantry and Ghassanid cavalry could flee.

Azarethes, who was an &quot;exceptionally able warrior&quot; according to Byzantine historian and chronicler Procopius, chose a more conventional deployment by dividing his army into three equal parts: the allied Lakhmid cavalry under Al-Mundhir forming the Sasanian left wing, opposing the Ghassanids, while his own cavalry formed the center and right flank. It is possible that he also held a reserve of elite Aswaran behind his center.

== Battle ==


The battle began with extensive exchange of arrow shots, with Procopius noting the rapidness of the Persian archery. This difference in archery is also mentioned in the &quot;Strategikon&quot; of Maurice, who had advised closing in with the Persians without any delay. This, combined with a westerly wind, caused the Byzantine side to suffer more casualties at this stage. According to Ian Hughes, however, the casualties were balanced due to the greater penetrative force of Byzantine archery.

Later, after &quot;two-thirds of the day&quot; had elapsed, Azarethes found a weak spot in the Byzantine force and redeployed some of his cavalry to his left wing; this was a similar tactic used at Dara, where the Persians tried to find a weak spot and overwhelm it by creating local numerical superiority. This maneuver was not observed by Belisarius and proved to be a turning point. The Ghassanids were routed off the field with such ease as to later inspire accusations of treachery. This exposed the right flank of the Lycaonian infantry, who were no match for the Persian cavalry and were also routed, while their commanders were killed. The right flank of Ascan&#x27;s heavy cavalry was now exposed; they fought as best they could, but Ascan was killed and his force defeated.

The Persian cavalry and their Lakhmid allies now controlled the rising ground looking down on the rest of the Byzantine force. As the remainder of the Byzantine cavalry fled and Belisarius was unable to reform his line, the Byzantine infantrymen found themselves pressed against the river. They formed a U-shaped &quot;phoulkon&quot; (&quot;fulcum&quot;) formation to defend against the missile attacks, with the top of the &quot;U&quot; being closed by the river and foot-archers in the center of the &quot;U&quot; loosing arrows at the attacking Persians. They withstood the Persian attacks until nightfall, when they safely escaped across the Euphrates to Callinicum. Apparently, the repeated charges by the Persian cavalry against the Byzantine infantry did not achieve anything more than increasing the casualties on both sides.

The primary sources reporting this phase of the battle are confusing. According to Procopius, Belisarius dismounted and fought alongside the infantry until nightfall, while Malalas reports that Belisarius had fled earlier across the Euphrates on a boat, while his subordinates Sunnicas and Simmas dismounted and fought alongside the infantry. Hughes argues this latter scenario is more probable.

Zacharias of Mytilene said of the battle: &quot;[The Romans] turned and fled before the Persian attack. Many fell into the Euphrates and were drowned, and others were killed.&quot; However, it is unknown what stage of the battle Zachariah was referring to.

The factuality of Procopius&#x27;s description of the events in this battle has been questioned. Both Procopius and Malalas provide a detailed description of the events, but their emphasis is different: Procopius emphasizes Belisarius&#x27; success in preventing a complete rout and the Sasanian losses, while Malalas emphasizes Belisarius&#x27; early flight from the battlefield, noting that the successful prevention of the rout was led by the &quot;doukes&quot; Sunicas and Simmas. Both accounts agree on the poor performance of the Lycaonian infantry and possible treachery by the Ghassanids.

== Aftermath ==

The Byzantine defeat wiped out the benefits of the victory at Dara and gave the initiative once again to the Persians. The strategic outcome of the battle was something of a stalemate; the Byzantine army had lost many soldiers and would not be in fighting condition again for months, but the Persian army had also taken such heavy losses that it was useless for its original purpose of the invasion of Syria.

Following the battle, an inquiry headed by Constantoilus was made against Belisarius due to the defeat at Callinicum and his earlier loss at Thannuris. Belisarius blamed the troops for their impetuous urge to engage in battle at Callinicum and was cleared by the inquiry; however he was relieved of his position as &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot; and was recalled to Constantinople by Justinian.

The Sasanian emperor Kavadh I removed Āzārethes from command and stripped him of his honors, due to the very high Persian casualties.

The mutual disaster of Callinicum ended the first of Justinian&#x27;s series of relatively unsuccessful wars against the Sassanids, leading Byzantium to pay heavy tributes in exchange for the Perpetual Peace treaty signed in the summer of 532.

<text>A water balloon or water bomb is a balloon, often made of latex rubber, filled with water. Water balloons are used in a summer pastime of cooling off through water balloon fights. Water balloons are also popular for celebrations, including celebrating Holi and Carnival in India, Nepal, and several other countries.

==Types==

Water balloons are common in sizes from though larger sizes are available. Typically water balloons are sold in quantity and often include a filling nozzle in the packaging. Many of the low cost brands use small water balloons and generic nozzles which both tend to be difficult to use.
Another form of water bomb is a sheet of paper folded to form a container capable of holding water. These are then filled and used in a similar way to latex versions.

Gas balloons (air or helium types) may be used as water balloons, but are not typically preferred because the balloon wall thickness is different. A water balloon is designed to be filled up to the approximate size of a baseball in a pear shape (so as to be thrown more easily), whereas some gas balloons, when filled with water, may reach the size of a basketball; this is disadvantageous because those balloons are harder to handle, usually requiring two hands. Mainly for safety reasons, water balloon walls are designed to be thick enough to be held without bursting yet thin enough to burst upon impact.

In a similar process to gas balloons, water balloons may be molded into various shapes at manufacturing. One process involves a patented mandrel for making elastomeric articles.

Reusable water balloons are an alternative to the traditional single use balloons. These minimize environmental impact and clean up and tend to be easier and more efficient to fill. However, they are typically more expensive than rubber balloons. There are a multitude of types, including magnetically locking spheres and absorbent fabric balls. 

==Risks==
Water balloons thrown by hand in person-to-person fights pose little risk of injury. There are, however, multiple accounts of injury to the eyes from water balloons launched by slingshot, which can increase the impact energy into the same range as a rifle bullet. Injuries and property damage have also been reported when a balloon is thrown from or at a moving vehicle.

==Filling and tying devices==
Water balloons are typically filled at an indoor faucet, an outside tap, or at the end of a garden hose. Multiple types of filling nozzles are available on the consumer market and come in threaded ( standard in the U.S.) and non-threaded types. Non-threaded nozzles are called filling funnels and may be difficult to use. Some brands of nozzles are called loader instead of nozzle, but no differentiation exists between other types of nozzles. Nozzles may include a valve feature for turning the water source on or off as needed.

Homemade water balloon filling stations may incorporate water balloon nozzles or valves that are on the market or use common plumbing fixtures. These stations may have one or more nozzles or valves. Portable and fixed station designs each have distinct pros and cons depending on the location of use, number of system users, and the quantity of filled water balloons needed. Multi-nozzle stations not only enable more water balloons to be filled for adults planning upcoming youth events or for preventing boredom in children upset with how challenging it may be to fill a balloon at a hose spigot, but greatly enhance group social interactions which is very important in toys for children and adult volunteers that work with children.

Multiple toy companies have created balloon tying and filling devices, enabling the user to easily fill and tie water balloons.

== Environmental impact ==

Water balloons, like air balloons, are generally made from latex, which naturally decomposes. While there still could be some environmental impact if burst water balloons are left behind in the wild where animals might ingest them, that impact would be low. However, some air balloons are made from mylar, which does not decompose (or only extremely slowly). If mylar balloons are used as water bombs, then littering or leaving behind mylar balloons will have a much bigger environmental impact.

==Yo-yo balloon==

Yo-yo balloons, also known as Yo-yo Tsuris, are a common type of water balloon found at matsuri festivals in Japan. Typically small, round, and colourful, the balloons are filled to a diameter of about with air and roughly of water. The balloon is clipped or tied closed and hung from an elastic string with a finger loop tied at the end. This gives them enough weight and bounce to function as a yo-yo, earning them their name. The balloons are often won in a game (&quot;Yo-yo Tsuri&quot; or just &quot;yo-yo&quot;) where they are set floating in a tub of water. Players &quot;fish&quot; for the balloons with a hook at the end of a twisted paper string. As the wet paper line breaks easily, the game is often likened to goldfish scooping in terms of difficulty.

The Wii video game &quot;Ennichi no Tatsujin&quot; includes a virtual Yo-yo Tsuri game.

== World record ==
Guinness World Records maintains a record category for largest water balloon fight. The current holder is the University of Kentucky Christian Student Fellowship, a campus ministry of the Christian churches and churches of Christ.

<doc id="238911" wikidata="Q303826" url="?curid=238911" title="Crimson">
<text>Crimsonis a rich, deep red color, inclining to purple.
It originally meant the color of the kermes dye produced from a scale insect, &quot;Kermes vermilio&quot;, but the name is now sometimes also used as a generic term for slightly bluish-red colors that are between red and rose. It is the national color of Nepal.

==History==
Crimson (NR4) is produced using the dried bodies of a scale insect, &quot;Kermes&quot;, which were gathered commercially in Mediterranean countries, where they live on the kermes oak, and sold throughout Europe. Kermes dyes have been found in burial wrappings in Anglo-Scandinavian York. They fell out of use with the introduction of cochineal, also made from scale insects, because although the dyes were comparable in quality and color intensity, ten to twelve times as much kermes is needed to produce the same effect as cochineal.

Carmine is the name given to the dye made from the dried bodies of the female cochineal, although the name crimson is sometimes applied to these dyes too. Cochineal appears to have been brought to Europe by the Spaniard Hernán Cortés during the conquest of the Aztec Empire and the name &#x27;carmine&#x27; is derived from the French &quot;carmin&quot;. It was first described by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1549. The pigment is also called &quot;cochineal&quot; after the insect from which it is made.

Alizarin (PR83) is a pigment that was first synthesized in 1868 by the German chemists Carl Gräbe and Carl Liebermann and replaced the natural pigment madder lake. Alizarin crimson is a dye bonded onto alum which is then used as a pigment and mixed with ochre, sienna and umber. It is not totally colorfast.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;crimson&quot; has been recorded in English since 1400, and its earlier forms include &quot;cremesin&quot;, &quot;crymysyn&quot; and &quot;cramoysin&quot; (cf. cramoisy, a crimson cloth). These were adapted via Old Spanish from the Medieval Latin &quot;cremesinus&quot; (also &quot;kermesinus&quot; or &quot;carmesinus&quot;), the dye produced from &quot;Kermes&quot; scale insects, and can be traced back to Arabic &quot;qirmizi (قرمزي)&quot; (&quot;red&quot;) (), also borrowed in Turkic languages &quot;kırmız&quot;&#x27; and many other languages, e.g. German &quot;Karmesin&quot;, Italian &quot;cremisi&quot;, French &quot;cramoisi&quot;, Portuguese &quot;carmesim&quot;, Dutch “karmozijn”, etc. (via Latin). The ultimate source may be Sanskrit कृमिज &quot;kṛmi-jā&quot; meaning &quot;worm-made&quot;.

A shortened form of &quot;carmesinus&quot; also gave the Latin &quot;carminus&quot;, from which comes carmine.

Other cognates include the Persian &quot;ghermez&quot; &quot;red&quot; derived from &quot;kermest&quot; the red worm, Old Church Slavonic &quot;чрьвл҄ѥнъ&quot; (&quot;črьvl&#x27;enъ&quot;), archaic Russian чермный (&quot;čermnyj&quot;), Bulgarian &quot;червен&quot; (&quot;cherven&quot;), and Serbo-Croatian &quot;crven&quot; &quot;red&quot;. Cf. also vermilion.

==Dyes==

Carmine dyes, which give crimson and related red and purple colors, are based on an aluminium and calcium salt of carminic acid. Carmine lake is an aluminium or aluminium-tin lake of cochineal extract, and crimson lake is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 percent solution of alum and cream of tartar. Purple lake is prepared like carmine lake with the addition of lime to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.

Carmine dyes were once widely prized in both the Americas and in Europe. They were used in paints by Michelangelo and for the crimson fabrics of the Hussars, the Turks, the British Redcoats, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Nowadays carmine dyes are used for coloring foodstuffs, medicines and cosmetics. As a food additive in the European Union, carmine dyes are designated E120, and are also called cochineal and Natural Red 4. Carmine dyes are also used in some oil paints and watercolors used by artists.

<text>SNP Students (also known as theFederation of Student Nationalists) is the student wing of the Scottish National Party (SNP), representing students in Scottish higher education. It was formed in 1961 when various student organisations supportive of Scottish independence and the SNP in particular decided to join forces into a new constituent body.

Unlike Young Scots for Independence, which is the youth wing of the SNP, the group is for those in higher education and membership is not restricted by age.

The organisation has branches at most of Scotland&#x27;s universities, and regularly campaigns for independence and a host of other policies across the country.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1961 and key figures were Neil MacCormick and Allan Macartney who would both later become SNP members of the European Parliament. By 1975 the group had around 1,500 members in Scotland.

It has played an active part in the affairs of the SNP and is represented on the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee, in the past with a representative position shared with the Young Scots for Independence, but now each organisation has its own representative. The SNP Students can send up to 15 delegates to the SNP Annual National Conference and 6 delegates to meetings of its National Council.

In the 2000 SNP leadership election the organisation supported Alex Neil who lost to John Swinney. In all subsequent leadership campaigns the organisation did not officially endorse any candidate.

It has informal links with Plaid Ifanc, the youth wing of Plaid Cymru. Until its September 2019 conference, it was also a part of the European Free Alliance Youth.

As of November 2021, they had a membership of 5,800 people who were at colleges and universities across Scotland.

==Activity==
SNP students is officially a one-issue organisation, that being campaigning for Scottish Independence, and position themselves neutral on inner-party affairs in order to encompass the broad church of Scottish Nationalism. However, SNP Students&#x27; campaigns often centre towards the liberalism and civic nationalism of Humza Yousaf and Stephen Flynn, rather than the &quot;Tartan Tories&quot;, fiscal and social conservatives, such as Kate Forbes, Fergus Ewing and Joanna Cherry.

SNP Students has been very active in recent years, organising high-profile campaigns on issues such as Equal Marriage, zero-hour contracts and the stripping of charitable status from fee-paying schools.

In September 2008, during a debate at the University of Edinburgh, a student member stated that the SNP Students executive was opposed to the proposals from the SNP-led Scottish Government to raise the minimum purchase age for alcohol in off-sales from 18 to 21.

In 2012, during the SNP&#x27;s policy change on NATO membership of an independent Scotland, SNP Students publicly came out in favour of retaining the anti-NATO policy, however at SNP conference the vote was lost despite SNP Students delegates voting against, and as a result the SNP is now pro-NATO.

At the SNP Students conference in 2015, they voted in favour of reintroducing rent controls in Scotland.

At the SNP Students conference in September 2019, SNP Students voted to disaffiliate from the European Free Alliance Youth, citing a fundamental disagreement with the ethos of the organisation and expressing the desire to build relationships with mainstream social democratic forces in Europe instead.

In 2019, SNP Students successfully campaigned for an end to graduation fees in Scotland, passing a resolution at the October 2019 SNP Conference calling on all universities in Scotland to abolish graduation fees.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020, SNP Students campaigned with others for the introduction of a Summer SAAS, and a No Detriment Policy at Scotland&#x27;s universities.

On 31 December 2020, the day the Brexit transition period ended, SNP Students published a co-authored statement with the Scottish Young Liberals, Scottish Labour Students, and the Scottish Young Greens, condemning the UK Government for Brexit and calling for Scotland to continue as a member of the Erasmus+ scheme. 

In the SNP&#x27;s manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood Election, the SNP committed to abolishing all core curriculum charges, implementing an SNP Students policy, pushed for at the 2020 National Conference. This came into effect on the 14 July 2021.

At its 2021 National Conference on 25 September 2021, SNP Students unanimously passed a motion calling for the extension of free bus travel to all students at colleges and universities in Scotland.

==Organisation==
The organisation is run by a National Executive Committee (NEC) elected each year at the SNP Students&#x27; Annual Conference. The Committee currently comprises a Convener, Vice Convener, Secretary, Treasurer, Organiser, Equalities Officer and Communications Officer.

Affiliated Nationalist Associations in Scottish Universities are
*Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association
*SNP Strathclyde University
*Dundee University Scottish Nationalist Association
*Glasgow Caledonian University Scottish Nationalist Association 
*Edinburgh University SNP
*Stirling University Scottish Nationalist Association
*Aberdeen University Scottish Nationalist Association
*University of the West of Scotland Scottish Nationalist Association
*University of the Highlands and Islands SNP Students Society
*St Andrews University Students For Independence

The organisation&#x27;s main opponent among universities across Scotland is the democratic socialist Scottish Labour Students, which comprises nine university student organisations.

<doc id="238914" wikidata="Q181348" url="?curid=238914" title="Viaduct">
<text>A viaduct is a specific type of bridge that consists of a series of arches, piers or columns supporting a long elevated railway or road. Typically a viaduct connects two points of roughly equal elevation, allowing direct overpass across a wide valley, road, river, or other low-lying terrain features and obstacles. The term &quot;viaduct&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;via&quot; meaning &quot;road&quot;, and &quot;ducere&quot; meaning &quot;to lead&quot;. It is a 19th-century derivation from an analogy with ancient Roman aqueducts. Like the Roman aqueducts, many early viaducts comprised a series of arches of roughly equal length.

==Over land==
The longest viaduct in antiquity may have been the Pont Serme which crossed wide marshes in southern France. At its longest point, it measured 2,679 meters with a width of 22 meters.

Viaducts are commonly used in many cities that are railroad hubs, such as Chicago, Birmingham, London and Manchester. These viaducts cross the large railroad yards that are needed for freight trains there, and also cross the multi-track railroad lines that are needed for heavy rail traffic. These viaducts provide grade separation and keep highway and city street traffic from having to be continually interrupted by the train traffic. Likewise, some viaducts carry railroads over large valleys, or they carry railroads over cities with many cross-streets and avenues.

Many viaducts over land connect points of similar height in a landscape, usually by bridging a river valley or other eroded opening in an otherwise flat area. Often such valleys had roads descending either side (with a small bridge over the river, where necessary) that become inadequate for the traffic load, necessitating a viaduct for &quot;through&quot; traffic. Such bridges also lend themselves for use by rail traffic, which requires straighter and flatter routes. Some viaducts have more than one deck, such that one deck has vehicular traffic and another deck carries rail traffic. One example of this is the Prince Edward Viaduct in Toronto, Canada, that carries motor traffic on the top deck as Bloor Street, and metro as the Bloor-Danforth subway line on the lower deck, over the steep Don River valley. Others were built to span settled areas, crossing over roads beneath—the reason for many viaducts in London.

==Over water==
Viaducts over water make use of islands or successive arches. They are often combined with other types of bridges or tunnels to cross navigable waters as viaduct sections, while less expensive to design and build than tunnels or bridges with larger spans, typically lack sufficient horizontal and vertical clearance for large ships. See the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.

The Millau Viaduct is a cable-stayed road-bridge that spans the valley of the river Tarn near Millau in southern France. It opened in 2004 and is the tallest vehicular bridge in the world, with one pier&#x27;s summit at 343 metres (1,125 ft). The viaduct Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge in China was the longest bridge in the world .

==Land use below viaducts==
Where a viaduct is built across land rather than water, the space below the arches may be used for businesses such as car parking, vehicle repairs, light industry, bars and nightclubs. In the United Kingdom, many railway lines in urban areas have been constructed on viaducts, and so the infrastructure owner Network Rail has an extensive property portfolio in arches under viaducts. In Berlin the space under the arches of elevated subway lines (S-Bahn) is used for several different purposes, including small eateries or bars.

==Past and future==
Elevated expressways were built in major cities such as Boston (Central Artery), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo and Toronto (Gardiner Expressway). Some were demolished because they were unappealing and divided the city. In other cases, viaducts were demolished because they were structurally unsafe, such as the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco, which was damaged by an earthquake in 1989. However, in developing nations such as Thailand (Bang Na Expressway, the world&#x27;s longest road bridge), India (Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway), China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nicaragua, elevated expressways have been built and more are under construction to improve traffic flow, particularly as a workaround of land shortage when built atop surface roads.

Other uses have been found for some viaducts. In Paris, France, a repurposed rail viaduct provides a garden promenade on top and workspace for artisans below. The garden promenade is called the Coulée verte René-Dumont while the workspaces in the arches below are the Viaduc des Arts. The project was inaugurated in 1993. Manhattan&#x27;s High Line, inaugurated in 2009, also uses an elevated train line as a linear urban park. 

In Indonesia viaducts are used for railways in Java and also for highways such as the Jakarta Inner Ring Road. In January 2019, the Alaskan Way Viaduct in Seattle was closed and replaced with a tunnel after several decades of use because it was seismically unsafe.

<text>The Programming Research Group (PRG) was part of the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (OUCL) in Oxford, England, along with the Numerical Analysis Group, until OUCL became the Department of Computer Science in 2011.

The PRG was founded by Christopher Strachey (1916–1975) in 1965. It was originally located at 45 Banbury Road.
After Strachey&#x27;s untimely death, C.A.R. Hoare, FRS took over the leadership in 1977. The PRG ethos is summed up by the following quotation from Strachey, found and promulgated by Tony Hoare after he arrived at the PRG:

The PRG moved to 8–11 Keble Road in 1984. During the later 1980s and early 1990s, some members of the PRG were housed at 2 South Parks Road, including Joseph Goguen (who was at the PRG during 1988–1996). Tony Hoare retired in 1999 and the PRG was led by Samson Abramsky from 2000. The PRG continued until the renaming of the Oxford University Computing Laboratory to the Department of Computer Science on 1 June 2011, under the leadership of Bill Roscoe, a former member of the PRG.

The PRG was a centre of excellence in the field of formal methods, playing a leading role in the development of the Z notation (initiated by a visit of Jean-Raymond Abrial) and CSP (together with the associated Occam programming language). It won Queen&#x27;s Awards with IBM and Inmos for work in this area.

<text>The Geatish Society (&quot;Götiska Förbundet&quot;, also Gothic Union, Gothic League) was created by a number of Swedish poets and authors in 1811, as a social club for literary studies among academics in Sweden, with a view to raising the moral tone of society through contemplating Scandinavian antiquity. The society was formally dissolved in 1844, being dormant for more than 10 years.

==History==
In the context of contentious debate over the suitability of Norse mythology as subjects of high art, in which the strong neoclassical training of northern academies, both Swedish and Danish, furnished powerful prejudices in favor of Biblical and Classical subjects, the members of the &quot;Götiska Förbundet&quot; sought to revive &quot;Viking spirit&quot; and related matters. When in 1800 the University of Copenhagen had made the debate the subject of a competition, the Danish Romantic Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger expressed himself in favor of Norse mythology. Not only was it native, but because it had not become hackneyed and characteristically for the direction Northern European Romanticism nationalism was to take, because it was considered morally superior to Greek mythology. In 1817 &quot;Förbundet&quot; announced a competition for sculpture on Nordic themes.

The club published a magazine, &quot;Iduna&quot;, in which it printed a great deal of poetry, and expounded its views, particularly as regards the study of old Icelandic literature and history. 
Swedish antiquarian Jakob Adlerbeth (1785–1844) was a leader in this organization and one of its most active members. He wrote several essays which were published in &quot;Iduna&quot; including translations of &quot;Edda&quot; and &quot;Vaulundurs saga&quot;.

The members wrote extensively on the Æsir and other parts of Norse mythology. The historical writings of Olaus Rudbeck were also revived and used for creating vivid imagery. In their poems, especially the rich illustrations, actual Norse elements would be mixed with, for instance Nordic Bronze Age, Anglo-Saxon and Viking Age elements in order to create a modern mythology of the past.

Among the most famous members were Esaias Tegnér and Erik Gustaf Geijer, both editors of &quot;Iduna&quot;. Some of their most famous poems were composed under the influence of the ideas and sentiments of the Geatish Society, notably the &quot;Frithiofs saga&quot; i form of epic verse and the shorter poem &quot;Skidbladner&quot; by Tegnér, as well as Geijer&#x27;s poems &quot;Vikingen&quot; and &quot;Odalbonden&quot;. All were at least in part published in &quot;Iduna&quot;. Other well-known members were Arvid Afzelius, an editor of the ground-breaking anthology of Swedish folksong, &quot;Svenska visor från forntiden&quot;, the lyric poet Karl August Nicander, Swedish teacher Pehr Henrik Ling and Gustaf Vilhelm Gumaelius (1789–1877) author of the historical novel, &quot;Tord Bonde&quot;.

Members of the society would write extensively on the Vikings, often in a romanticized manner which described a largely heroic and noble ancient people. Members of the Geatish Society would occasionally wear horned helmets, which is the source of the myth that Vikings would have worn such helmets. In actuality, there is not evidence to suggest they ever did.

In 1844, following the death of Jakob Adlerbeth and the dissolution of the Society, part of the library accumulated by the &quot;Götiska förbundet&quot;, together with its archive, was given to the library of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities (&quot;Vitterhetsakademiens bibliotek&quot;); there the materials are maintained among the special collections.

The mythology and imagery of this movement was also very popular in the German Empire, where comparable societies were part of the &quot;Völkisch movement&quot;. In the next century, similar themes would be taken up in Nazi Germany. To some extent they remain popular among Neo-Nazis to this day. Ideologically there seems no obvious connection, save the common concerns with sentimental patriotic interest in ethnic folklore, local history and a &quot;back-to-the-land&quot; anti-urbanism that are commonplaces of National Romanticism, employed as critiques of modern urban industrialism and its degenerative impact; however, Viking imagery alludes to conceptions of pristine Germanic tribes unaltered either culturally or racially by contact with non-Germanic tribes and cultures like Judaeo-Christianity. It thus provides an artistic ideal that was easily interpreted in terms of Nazi biological, cultural and political ideals. The idealized Vikings were associated with a warrior manliness that is transgressive of modern values; thus the imagery alludes to radical Nazi or pan-Germanic militarism.

<text>The Boston and Maine Railroad was a U.S. Class I railroad in northern New England. It was chartered in 1835, and became part of what was the Pan Am Railways network in 1983 (most of which was purchased by CSX in 2022).

At the end of 1970, B&amp;M operated on of track, not including Springfield Terminal. That year it reported 2,744 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 92 million passenger-miles.

==History==
The Andover and Wilmington Railroad was incorporated March 15, 1833, to build a branch from the Boston and Lowell Railroad at Wilmington, Massachusetts, north to Andover, Massachusetts. The line opened to Andover on August 8, 1836. The name was changed to the Andover and Haverhill Railroad on April 18, 1837, reflecting plans to build further to Haverhill, Massachusetts (opened later that year), and yet further to Portland, Maine, with renaming to the Boston and Portland Railroad on April 3, 1839, opening to the New Hampshire state line in 1840.

The Boston and Maine Railroad was chartered in New Hampshire on June 27, 1835, and the Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts Railroad was incorporated March 12, 1839, in Maine, both companies continuing the proposed line to South Berwick, Maine. The railroad opened in 1840 to Exeter, New Hampshire, and on January 1, 1842, the two companies merged with the Boston and Portland to form a new Boston and Maine Railroad.


On February 23, 1843, the B&amp;M opened to Agamenticus, on the line of the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad in South Berwick. On January 28 of that year, the B&amp;M and Eastern Railroad came to an agreement to both lease the PS&amp;P as a joint line to Portland.

The Boston and Maine Railroad Extension was incorporated on March 16, 1844, due to a dispute with the Boston and Lowell Railroad over trackage rights rates between Wilmington and Boston. That company was merged into the main B&amp;M on March 19, 1845, and opened on July 1, leading to the abandonment of the old connection to the B&amp;L (later reused by the B&amp;L for its Wildcat Branch). In 1848, another original section was abandoned, as a new alignment was built from Wilmington north to North Andover, Massachusetts in order to better serve Lawrence, Massachusetts.

A new alignment to Portland opened in 1873, splitting from the old route at South Berwick, Maine. The old route remained a part of the Eastern Railroad&#x27;s Main Line (described below). This completed the B&amp;M &quot;main line&quot;, which would become known as the Western Route Main Line.

===Acquisitions===
As the B&amp;M grew, it also gained control of former rivals, including:

====Eastern====
On March 28, 1883, the boards of directors of B&amp;M and the Eastern Railroad Company voted to ratify the proposition that Eastern Railroad would be leased by B&amp;M. However, a disagreement about the wording of the contract delayed its execution until December 2, 1884. On May 9, 1890, B&amp;M purchased Eastern Railroad outright. This provided a second route to Maine, ending competition along the immediate route between Boston and Portland. Along with the Eastern, the B&amp;M also acquired many branch lines, including the Conway Branch, the Saugus Branch, the South Reading Branch, and branches to Marblehead and Rockport, Massachusetts.

====Worcester, Nashua and Portland====
The Worcester and Nashua Railroad was organized in 1845 (opened 1848) and the Nashua and Rochester Railroad in 1847, forming a line between Worcester, Massachusetts, and Rochester, New Hampshire, via Nashua. The W&amp;N leased the N&amp;R in 1874, and the two companies merged into the Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad in 1883. The B&amp;M leased the line on January 1, 1886. This acquisition also included the continuation from Rochester to Portland, Maine, incorporated in 1846 as the York and Cumberland Railroad. It opened partially in 1851 and 1853, was reorganized as the Portland and Rochester Railroad in 1867, and opened the rest of the way in 1871. It was again reorganized in 1881 and then operated in conjunction with the line to Worcester.

====Boston and Lowell====
On April 1, 1887, the B&amp;M leased the Boston and Lowell Railroad, adding not only trackage in the Boston area, but also the Central Massachusetts Railroad west to Northampton, the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad into northern New Hampshire, the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad to northwestern Vermont, and the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad from White River Junction into Quebec. However, the BC&amp;M was separated in 1889 and merged with the Concord Railroad to form the Concord and Montreal Railroad, which the B&amp;M leased on April 1, 1895, gaining the Concord Railroad&#x27;s direct line between Nashua and Concord. Additionally, the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad, owned by the B&amp;M through stock, was leased to the Maine Central Railroad by 1912. The Central Massachusetts Railroad stayed a part of the B&amp;M, as did the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad (as the Passumpsic Division).

====Northern====
The Northern Railroad was leased to the Boston and Lowell in 1884, but that lease was canceled and the Northern was on its own until 1890, when it was re-leased to the B&amp;L, then part of the B&amp;M. The Northern owned a number of lines running west from Concord.

====Connecticut River====
On January 1, 1893, the B&amp;M leased the Connecticut River Railroad, with the main line from Springfield, Massachusetts north along the Connecticut River to White River Junction, Vermont, where the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad (acquired in 1887) continued north. Along with this railroad came the Ashuelot Railroad, which had been acquired in 1877.

====Concord and Montreal====
The B&amp;M acquired the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad in 1887, but gave it up in 1889, allowing it to merge with the Concord Railroad to form the Concord and Montreal Railroad. That company did poorly on its own and was leased by the B&amp;M on April 1, 1895, giving the B&amp;M the majority of lines in New Hampshire.

====Fitchburg====

The B&amp;M leased the Fitchburg Railroad on July 1, 1900. This was primarily the main line from Boston west via the Hoosac Tunnel to the Albany, New York, area, with various branches. On December 1, 1919, the B&amp;M purchased the Fitchburg Railroad.

At one point, the B&amp;M also owned a majority of stock of the Maine Central Railroad, stretching from Quebec via northern New Hampshire to southern and eastern Maine.

===20th century===

The B&amp;M flourished with the growth of New England&#x27;s mill towns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but still faced financial struggles. It came under the control of J. P. Morgan and his New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad around 1910, but anti-trust forces wrested control back. Later, it faced heavy debt problems from track construction and from the cost of acquiring the Fitchburg Railroad, causing a corporate reorganization in 1919.

Beginning in the 1930s, freight business was hurt by the leveling-off of New England manufacturing growth and by new competition from trucking. In 1925, B&amp;M reported 2956 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 740 million passenger-miles; at the end of the year it operated 2291 route-miles, including &quot;42.85 miles of electric street railway&quot;. (Those totals do not include B&amp;C, M&amp;WR, StJ&amp;LC or YH&amp;B.)

The B&amp;M&#x27;s most traveled and well known passenger trains included the &quot;Alouette&quot;, &quot;Ambassador&quot;, &quot;Cheshire&quot;, &quot;Day White Mountains&quot;, &quot;East Wind&quot;, &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot;, &quot;Gull&quot;, &quot;Kennebec&quot;, &quot;Minute Man&quot;, &quot;Montrealer&quot;/&quot;Washingtonian&quot;, &quot;Mountaineer&quot;, &quot;Pine Tree&quot;, &quot;Red Wing&quot;, and &quot;State of Maine&quot;. The B&amp;M even promoted its passenger trains with the &quot;Timetable Marble&quot; radio advertisement. However, the popularization of the automobile doomed B&amp;M as a passenger carrier.

====Passenger service cuts====
After steady growth from 1901 to 1913, passenger rail ridership around Boston peaked in 1920 and began to decline due to competition from private automobiles and service cuts during World War I. In the mid-1920s, after several difficult years, the B&amp;M discontinued service on some marginal lines and began using small self-propelled railcars on others. A second round of discontinuances occurred from 1931 to 1936 as the Great Depression reduced traffic. Ridership sharply increased during World War II; the B&amp;M had a slower postwar decline than its contemporaries, though major frequency reductions occurred in 1949–1950. The B&amp;M began testing Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) in 1952; in 1954, the railroad decided to switch all commuter service to RDCs to cut costs.

Discontinuances in the 1920s and 1930s primarily affected minor branches and rural intercity routes, but the 1950s saw the loss of more significant intercity routes. September, 1952 saw the first cut to the four main intercity mainlines, as Eastern Route service was cut from Portland, Maine to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. (Portland continued to see service to Boston on the Western Route through Dover, New Hampshire.) The New York–Montreal &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot;/&quot;Mount Royal&quot;, which had Boston sections running on the B&amp;M via Bellows Falls, ended when the Rutland Railroad discontinued all passenger service, in 1953. The northern section of the Boston–Wells River, Vermont route ended in 1954 (thus ending connections to Quebec City), as did Manchester–Portsmouth service. Concord–Claremont Junction service ended in 1955, and the Boston section of the &quot;Ambassador&quot; was reduced to a Boston–White River Junction RDC connecting train in 1956. Fitchburg mainline service was trimmed from Troy, New York, to Williamstown, Massachusetts, in January 1958, and discontinued soon afterward.

The B&amp;M became unprofitable in 1958 and moved to shed its money-losing passenger operations. On May 18, 1958, the B&amp;M severely reduced Boston commuter service. The Maynard Branch, Saugus Branch, Essex Branch, and Stoneham Branch were cut, and the Central Mass Branch was cut from Clinton to Hudson. Almost all inner-suburb commuter stations within the MTA transit district were closed. Intercity service to Bellows Falls, Vermont and Brattleboro, Vermont (the &quot;Cheshire&quot;) via the Cheshire Branch was also cut. Service was trimmed again from Williamstown to Greenfield on December 30, 1958, and cut to on April 23, 1960. Further cuts on June 14, 1959, terminated the Swampscott Branch, Marblehead Branch, Danvers Branch, and the north half of the Woburn Loop. The &quot;State of Maine Express&quot; - the last through service between New York City and Maine - and the Boston–Halifax &quot;Gull&quot; were discontinued in 1960. Long rural lines to North Conway and Berlin, New Hampshire were cut on December 3, 1961. By 1962, the B&amp;M was preparing ICC applications to discontinue all remaining service.

After the major cuts by the B&amp;M and the New Haven Railroad in the late 1950s, public opinion in Massachusetts began to favor supporting Boston commuter service to prevent it from being cut entirely. From January 1963 to March 1964, the state Mass Transportation Commission funded an experiment testing various fares and service levels on the two railroads. On August 3, 1964, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed (as an expansion of the MTA funding district) to subsidize suburban commuter rail operations. In December 1964, the MBTA and B&amp;M reached an agreement for the MBTA to subsidize in-district service (within about of Boston) should the ICC applications be approved. Municipalities outside the MBTA district could directly subsidize continued service.

After approval of the applications, the B&amp;M discontinued most interstate service on January 4, 1965. Service via Concord to Laconia, New Hampshire and to Montreal via White River Junction ended, though a single Boston–Concord round trip remained. Western Route service to Portland and Eastern Route service to Portsmouth were discontinued; single Boston–Dover and Boston– round trips were retained. On January 18, 1965, commuter service was cut to the MBTA district and subsidies began. Fitchburg Route service was cut to West Concord; New Hampshire Route and Western Route service to Wilmington, save for the Concord and Dover trip; Eastern Route service to and Wenham except for the Newburyport trip; and Central Mass service to . After out-of-district communities agreed to subsidies, service was re-extended to , , , and on June 28.

The &quot;Montrealer&quot; was discontinued in September, 1966; local service on the Connecticut River Line lasted until the end of that year. On June 30, 1967, the Concord trip was cut to Lowell, and the Dover trip to . The four routes with single daily round-trips slowly ended: South Sudbury on November 26, 1971; Newburyport in April 1976; Haverhill in June 1976; and Bedford on January 10, 1977. (However, Haverhill service was restored by MVRTA subsidy in 1979.) On December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought all B&amp;M commuter equipment, as well as most of the B&amp;M&#x27;s trackage on Boston&#x27;s northside (including several abandoned lines). On March 12, 1977, the B&amp;M also won the contract for the southside commuter rail lines that had once been part of the New Haven and B&amp;A: the first time that Boston&#x27;s commuter rail system had been operated by a single entity. The B&amp;M operated the whole MBTA Commuter Rail system under contract to the MBTA until 1987. The final B&amp;M line to lose passenger service was the Woburn Branch (former Woburn Loop), which was cut on January 30, 1981, due to poor track quality. Under public control, commuter rail service has returned to several lines cut by the B&amp;M, and Portland intercity service returned with the Amtrak &quot;Downeaster&quot;, in 2001.

====Regrowth====
The B&amp;M filed for bankruptcy in December 1970. During bankruptcy the B&amp;M reorganized. It rebuilt its existing fleet of locomotives, leased new locomotives and rolling stock and secured funds for upgrading its track and signal systems.

For much of the 1970s, the Boston and Maine limped along. In 1973 and 1974 the B&amp;M was on the brink of liquidation. The B&amp;M was offered the opportunity to merge its properties into the new Conrail in 1976, but opted out. 

By 1980, though still a sick company, the B&amp;M started turning around thanks to aggressive marketing and its purchase of a cluster of branch lines in Connecticut. The addition of coal traffic and piggyback service also helped. In 1983, the B&amp;M emerged from bankruptcy when it was purchased by Timothy Mellon&#x27;s Guilford Transportation Industries for $24 million. This was the beginning of the end of the Boston &amp; Maine corporate image, and the start of major changes, such as new labor issues which caused the strikes of 1986 and 1987, and drastic cost-cutting such as the 1990 closure of B&amp;M&#x27;s Mechanicville, New York, site: the largest rail yard and shop facilities on the B&amp;M system.

===21st century===
 Guilford Rail System changed its name to Pan Am Railways in 2006. Up until CSX Transportation acquired Pan Am Railways on June 1, 2022, Boston &amp; Maine Corporation continued to exist, but only as a non-operating ward of PAR. Boston &amp; Maine owned the property (and also employed its own railroad police), while Springfield Terminal Railway, a B&amp;M subsidiary created by owner Timothy Mellon to break the unions&#x27; higher wage scales, operated the trains and performed maintenance. Pan Am Railways and all its subsidiaries are now owned by CSX.

Pan Am entered a joint venture with Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) in April, 2009 to form Pan Am Southern (PAS). PAR transferred to the PAS assets that included its main line track between Mechanicville, New York, and Ayer, Massachusetts, including the Hoosac Tunnel and Fitchburg line as far as Littleton, Massachusetts, and of secondary and branch lines, plus trackage rights, in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. NS transferred cash and other property valued at $140 million to the joint venture, $87.5 million of which was expected to be invested within a three-year period in capital improvements on the Patriot Corridor, such as terminal expansions, track and signal upgrades. Springfield Terminal provides all railroad services for the joint venture.

Service at B&amp;M&#x27;s former yard in Mechanicville, New York, was restored as an intermodal and automotive terminal in January 2012, under PAS.

==Named passenger trains==
The B&amp;M operated a number of named passenger trains, which were often the premier intercity service on their routes. Most were through service that were shared between the B&amp;M and other railroads, including the Canadian National Railway (CN), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), Central Vermont Railway (CV), Maine Central Railroad (MEC), New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH), Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), Quebec Central Railway (QC), and Rutland Railroad (RUT). Trains originating in New York City or Washington, D.C., ran through Springfield (using the Connecticut River Line) or Worcester (using the Worcester Branch) and bypassed Boston. Certain commuter trains with wealthy clientele were also named; several of these lasted into the MBTA era. These tables list major named intercity trains operated by the B&amp;M.

==Surviving equipment==
The 1935 three-car trainset known as the Flying Yankee, virtually identical to the streamlined equipment the Budd Company built for the Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Pioneer Zephyr, was retired in 1957 and was then displayed at the Railroad for another 36 years. The equipment was relocated and eventually purchased by the State of Maine, but both public and private restoration efforts were unsuccessful. In November 2023, the state of New Hampshire put the equipment up for sale, with a focus on &quot;the relocation and encouraged restoration&quot; of the trainset.In April 2024, the trainset was sold to the Flying Yankee Association, who hopes to restore and operate the set in the Mt. Washington Valley, with a possibility of running it on the Conway Scenic Railroad. The trainset was moved to North Conway where it regained its trucks.

<doc id="238928" wikidata="Q4008777" url="?curid=238928" title="Cosmic variance">
<text>The term cosmic variance is the statistical uncertainty inherent in observations of the universe at extreme distances. It has three different but closely related meanings:
* It is sometimes used, incorrectly, to mean sample variance – the difference between different finite samples of the same parent population. Such differences follow a Poisson distribution, and in this case the term sample variance should be used instead.
* It is sometimes used, mainly by cosmologists, to mean the uncertainty because we can only observe one realization of all the possible observable universes. For example, we can only observe one Cosmic Microwave Background, so the measured positions of the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum, integrated over the visible sky, are limited by the fact that only one spectrum is observable from Earth. The observable universe viewed from another galaxy will have the peaks in slightly different places, while remaining consistent with the same physical laws, inflation, etc. This second meaning may be regarded as a special case of the third meaning.
* The most widespread use, to which the rest of this article refers, reflects the fact that measurements are affected by cosmic large-scale structure, so a measurement of any region of sky (viewed from Earth) may differ from a measurement of a different region of sky (also viewed from Earth) by an amount that may be much greater than the sample variance.

This most widespread use of the term is based on the idea that it is only possible to observe part of the universe at one particular time, so it is difficult to make statistical statements about cosmology on the scale of the entire universe, as the number of observations (sample size) must be not too small.

== Background ==
The standard Big Bang model is usually supplemented with cosmic inflation. In inflationary models, the observer only sees a tiny fraction of the whole universe, much less than a billionth (1/109) of the volume of the universe postulated in inflation. So the observable universe (the so-called particle horizon of the universe) is the result of processes that follow some general physical laws, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Some of these processes are random: for example, the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe can only be described statistically and cannot be derived from first principles.

== Philosophical issues ==
This raises philosophical problems: suppose that random physical processes happen on length scales both smaller than and bigger than the particle horizon. A physical process (such as an amplitude of a primordial in density) that happens on the horizon scale only gives us one observable realization. A physical process on a larger scale gives us zero observable realizations. A physical process on a slightly smaller scale gives us a small number of realizations.

In the case of only one realization it is difficult to draw statistical conclusions about its significance. For example, if the underlying model of a physical process implies that the observed property should occur only 1% of the time, does that really mean that the model is excluded? Consider the physical model of the citizenship of human beings in the early 21st century, where about 30% are Indian and Chinese citizens, about 5% are American citizens, about 1% are French citizens, and so on. For an observer who has only one observation (of his/her own citizenship) and who happens to be French and cannot make any external observations, the model can be rejected at the 99% significance level. Yet the external observers with more information unavailable to the first observer, know that the model is correct.

In other words, even if the bit of the universe observed is the result of a statistical process, the observer can only view one realization of that process, so our observation is statistically insignificant for saying much about the model, unless the observer is careful to include the variance. This variance is called the &quot;cosmic variance&quot; and is separate from other sources of experimental error: a very accurate measurement of only one value drawn from a distribution still leaves considerable uncertainty about the underlying model. Variance is normally plotted separately from other sources of uncertainty. Because it is necessarily a large fraction of the signal, workers must be very careful in interpreting the statistical significance of measurements on scales close to the particle horizon.

In physical cosmology, the common way of dealing with this on the horizon scale and on slightly sub-horizon scales (where the number of occurrences is greater than one but still quite small), is to explicitly include the variance of very small statistical samples (Poisson distribution) when calculating uncertainties. This is important in describing the low multipoles of the cosmic microwave background and has been the source of much controversy in the cosmology community since the COBE and WMAP measurements.

== Similar problems ==
A similar problem is faced by evolutionary biologists. Just as cosmologists have a sample size of one universe, biologists have a sample size of one fossil record. The problem is closely related to the anthropic principle.

Another problem of limited sample sizes in astronomy, here practical rather than essential, is in the Titius–Bode law on spacing of satellites in an orbital system. Originally observed for the Solar System, the difficulty in observing other solar systems has limited data to test this.

<text>Partick (, Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Partaig&quot;) is an area of Glasgow on the north bank of the River Clyde, just across from Govan. To the west lies Whiteinch, to the east Yorkhill and Kelvingrove Park (across the River Kelvin), and to the north Broomhill, Hyndland, Dowanhill, Hillhead, areas which form part of the West End of Glasgow. Partick was a Police burgh from 1852 until 1912 when it was incorporated into the city. Partick is the area of the city most connected with the Highlands, and several Gaelic agencies, such as the Gaelic Books Council (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Comhairle nan Leabhraichean&quot;) are located in the area. Some ATMs in the area display Gaelic.

==Etymology==
The modern name derives from the ancient Cumbric &quot;Peartoc&quot; (as in the modern Welsh word &quot;perth&quot;, meaning &quot;bush or thicket&quot;).

This was adopted into Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Peart(h)aig&quot;, giving modern Gaelic &quot;Pearraig&quot; or &quot;Partaig&quot; (the latter is used on signs at Partick railway station). Older anglicised forms include &quot;Perdyc&quot; and &quot;Perthick&quot;. Partick, of old Perdyec, from the Gaelic &quot;aper dhu ec&quot;, meaning the place at the confluence or mouth of the dark river.

==History==
Although Partick remained a village until the middle of the 18th century, it is an ancient place. The Kings of Strathclyde had a residence there, and in 1136 David I (1124–1153) granted the lands of &quot;Perdyc&quot; to the see of Glasgow. The Bishops of Glasgow had a country seat in Partick. It was later the site of Partick Castle, a country home of George Hutcheson (demolished 1836). The burgh, which had its headquarters at Partick Burgh Hall, was annexed by Glasgow in 1912.

==Areas==
It is historically divided into three social areas; south of Dumbarton Road, north of Dumbarton Road and the Partick Hill grand villas. Being within the sphere of influence of the University of Glasgow and neighbouring Glasgow&#x27;s salubrious &quot;West End&quot; it has a high student population. Traditional industries for the area were shipbuilding and the huge Meadowside Granary (recently demolished to make way for the new Glasgow Harbour residential development) employed many residents also. The main street in Partick, Dumbarton Road, has a number of services for residents to use.

==Community==
Partick Burgh Hall is a venue (much like a community centre) located within Partick. It regularly holds community events and is owned and managed by Culture &amp; Sport Glasgow (part of Glasgow City Council). The hall was originally built in 1872 and has multiple rooms. The hall is staffed in order to accommodate events and to handle security. Private events are also held in the hall.

Partick Community Council is an organization which exists in the area to deal with issues within the community. It is the oldest community group in Partick and consists of around twenty elected members. The boundary of this council runs from Byres Road to Crow Road and from the River Clyde to Highburgh Road. The council is funded by Glasgow City Council by way of an annual grant.

Examples of activities of the Community Council include:
* Neighbourhood Watch coordination.
* Lobbying of Glasgow City Council
* Promoting cleanliness and security in the area

==Sport==

Partick is home to the West of Scotland Cricket Club&#x27;s Hamilton Crescent ground, which was the site of the first ever international football match (between Scotland and England) on 30 November 1872.

Partick Thistle Football Club were formed in the area in 1876, but left to play in the Maryhill area of Glasgow in 1909. Partick F.C. were also active in the 1870s and 1880s.

==Transport==

Partick station is a trunk station serving as an interchange between the local rail, Glasgow Subway and local bus systems. It replaced the former Partickhill railway station in 1979. There were previously three other stations in the area, Partick Central railway station (renamed Kelvin Hall station in 1959), Merkland Street and Partick West railway station.

The Partick interchange was redeveloped in 2012 due to its immense potential as a top-class interchange not only between Rail, Bus and Subway but also as the main interchange station between the Argyle and North Clyde rail lines.

==Religion==

There is an old Quaker burial ground, the &#x27;Quakers Graveyard&#x27;, situated at the bottom of Keith Street. Now a visitors&#x27; attraction the graveyard was given over to the city of Glasgow. It was last used in 1857. Purdon Street, which runs parallel with Keith Street, was named after John Purdon, a prominent Quaker who lived in Partick in the 17th century. His wife is buried in the graveyard.

The local Church of Scotland congregation is served by Partick South Parish Church and Partick Trinity Church.

Partick&#x27;s Catholic community is served by St Peter&#x27;s church situated in Hyndland Street. St Simon&#x27;s church, located in Bridge Street, was built in 1858 and is the third oldest Catholic church in Glasgow. An arson attack in 2021 left it a ruin with only the external walls remaining. The arsonist, Ryan Haggerty, was sentenced for five years and three months in October 2022.

<text>Bacton is a small village in a rural area of south-west Herefordshire, England, from Hereford.

==History==

One mile to the north are some earthwork remains of a small motte and bailey castle known as Newcourt Tump – &quot;Tump&quot; is a dialect word for a rounded hill or tumulus. The castle seems to have fallen out of use by the 14th century.

According to Domesday Book in 1086, Bacton, then in the hundred of Stradel, had only two households. The Lord of the Manor was Gilbert of Eskecot, whose tenant-in-chief was Roger of Lacy. The manor&#x27;s history becomes clearer from the 13th century onwards.

===Parish church===
The parish church of St Faith&#x27;s dates from 13th century and has a lengthy entry in Pevsner&#x27;s survey of the county&#x27;s buildings.

Inside is a memorial to Blanche Parry. It is possible that an altar cloth belonging to the church was made from a dress once worn by Queen Elizabeth I of England and given to Blanche Parry. The material of the cloth appears to form part of the clothing of the Queen in the early 17th-century &quot;Rainbow Portrait&quot;, attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.

The church belongs to the Ewyas Harold group of parishes and has a service about once a month. Next to it is a village hall.

===Listed buildings===
Bacton parish church is listed Grade II*. A further 16 buildings, barns and monuments from the 17th to 20th centuries are listed as Grade II, several of them in the churchyard.

==Transport==
Bacton has a single, daytime bus service to Hereford on Wednesdays. The nearest railway station is at Hereford (). Bacton is on the secondary B4347 road from the main A465 road between Hereford and Abergavenny.

<text>Carl Graebe (; 24 February 1841 – 19 January 1927) was a German industrial and academic chemist from Frankfurt am Main who held professorships in his field at Leipzig, Königsberg, and Geneva. He is known for the first synthesis of the economically important dye, alizarin, with Liebermann, and for contributing to the fundamental nomenclature of organic chemistry.

==Biography==
Graebe was born in Frankfurt in 1841. He studied at a vocational high school in Frankfurt and Karlsruhe Polytechnic and in Heidelberg. Later he worked for the chemical company &quot;Meister Lucius und Brüning&quot; (today Hoechst AG). He supervised the production of Fuchsine and researched violet colorants made using iodine. The work with iodine resulted in eye problems, so he returned to academia.

Carl Graebe received his Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg in 1862 under the supervision of Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. In 1868 he wrote his habilitation, and became a professor in University of Leipzig. Graebe was Professor of Chemistry at the University of Königsberg from 1870 until 1877, and at the University of Geneva from 1878 until 1906. This was a period rich in the development of structural theory and nomenclature, and Graebe is known for introducing the &quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;meta&quot; and &quot;para&quot; nomenclature for naphthalene ring substitution.

Amongst Graebe&#x27;s students was Vera Bogdanovskaia, an early victim of the inherent risks of chemical research (dying as a result of later independent research on methylidynephosphane); her doctoral dissertation under Graebe was on dibenzyl ketone (1892).

Graebe synthesized the dye alizarin in 1868 with Carl Theodore Liebermann. Alizarin had been isolated from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet. Its chemical synthesis was a milestone in the development of the German and international dye industry, and foreshadowed collapse of the French agricultural sector that produced madder root (after synthesis became the more economical means of producing alizarin).

Graebe died in Frankfurt in 1927.

<text>Sailing the Seas of Cheese is the second studio album and major label debut by the American rock band Primus. It was released on May 14, 1991, through Interscope Records. It spawned three singles: &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot;, &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot;, and &quot;Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers&quot;.

==Album information==
The album has been described as funk metal. Similar to its predecessor &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;, founding guitarist Todd Huth received writing credits on the songs &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Baker&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; is known for its intricate bassline that Les Claypool played on a fretless six-string bass using the tapping technique. It also contains a sample from the movie &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; in which the character Chop Top exclaims &quot;Dog will hunt!&quot; The track &quot;Los Bastardos&quot; contains samples from the BBC television series &quot;The Young Ones&quot; including Vyvyan shouting, &quot;Shut up, you bastards!&quot;, Vyvyan&#x27;s mother saying, &quot;He is a bastard isn&#x27;t he?&quot;, as well as Rick saying, &quot;You just called me a bastard, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; and &quot;Mike, you bastard!&quot;

The single &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; is also characterised by its highly complex bassline that mixes strumming and slapping; there is not a clear consensus on exactly what notes are being played, and as a result, numerous different interpretations exist on the Internet. The song features spoken word by Tom Waits providing the voice of the titular character; in live performances Claypool does these parts himself. Another example of the album&#x27;s musical complexity is the song &quot;Eleven&quot;, which is named after its unusual time signature of 11/8.

The song and album title &quot;Seas of Cheese&quot; would later be referenced in the song &quot;DMV&quot; on their next album &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Dirty Drowning Man&quot; on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Antipop&quot;.

==Live performance==
The album was performed live in its entirety in 2003 and 2004 on their Tour De Fromage, on December 30, 2010 and once more during a two night show at Royal Albert Hall in April 2012.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot wrote that Primus &quot;explore funk &#x27;n&#x27; rock with bemused brilliance&quot; and that &quot;its musicianship, blending velocity with virtuosity, continues to set it apart from the crowded pool of punk-funk bands.&quot; Mike Gitter of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called the album &quot;as viciously strange an offering as any to come from a major label all year&quot; and commented that Primus were &quot;working without the shackles of genre&quot; and &quot;immersing the listener in the mire of their own hyper-reality.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; critic Stephen Dalton credited Primus for avoiding self-indulgence and &quot;avant-wank fusion&quot;, while in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Simon Reynolds said that the band are &quot;too self-consciously goofy for their own good, but their rubber-boned thrash-funk can be cartoonish fun.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Steve Huey contends that &quot;&quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; completely redefined the possibilities of the electric bass in rock music for those who&#x27;d never heard the group before.&quot; He describes the album as &quot;mostly riff-driven, fleshing out their heavy metal roots with prog rock tricks from Rush and Frank Zappa, as well as the novelty side of Zappa&#x27;s sense of humor.&quot; He notes that &quot;the willful goofiness may alienate some listeners, but... it never detracts from the band&#x27;s frequently stunning musicianship&quot; and concludes that the album is &quot;the tightest, most song-oriented representation of their jaw-dropping, one-of-a-kind style.&quot;

In a 2015 Noisey interview, Les Claypool ranked &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; as his second favorite Primus album behind &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;, believing the work to be &quot;probably [Primus&#x27;] most respected album&quot;. In addition, Claypool also outlined the experience of releasing the record on a major label, and the consequent inspiration for the album&#x27;s title, when he remarked:

But [&quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot;] was also that record like &#x27;Here we are, about to release something on a major label,&#x27; and we&#x27;re right alongside the other bands that were popular at the time, which were these hairball bands—the Poisons, and the Guns N&#x27; Roses, and these different things that we just did not fit in with. That was the impetus of the title, because we just knew all of a sudden we were going to be thrust into this world where we weren&#x27;t sure anyone thought we belonged.

==Release history==
&quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; reached gold status in March 1993. It was certified platinum in December 2001.

===2009===
Plain Recordings released a 180 gram version of the LP.

===2013 reissue===
A deluxe edition of the album was released on May 21, 2013. It is available in two six-panel Digipak configurations, each featuring the album’s new stereo mix on CD and the new 5.1 surround mix on Blu-ray or DVD, plus three exclusive, previously unreleased bonus tracks, and liner notes by music journalist Greg Prato. Claypool stated, “Musically, it holds up incredibly well. Sonically, it holds up fairly well. There’s some old-style reverbs that are a little bit syrupy. With modern technology, we can fix some of that stuff. But we don’t want to mess with it too much, because it is what it is. We want to fatten it up a little bit.”

<text>A warrior is a guardian specializing in combat or warfare, especially within the context of a tribal or clan-based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior aristocracy, class, or caste.

==History==
Warriors seem to have been present in the earliest pre-state societies. Scholars have argued that horse-riding Yamnaya warriors from the Pontic–Caspian steppe played a key role during the Indo-European migrations and the diffusion of Indo-European languages across Eurasia. Most of the basic weapons used by warriors appeared before the rise of most hierarchical systems. Bows and arrows, clubs, spears, swords, and other edged weapons were in widespread use. However, with the new findings of metallurgy, the aforementioned weapons had grown in effectiveness.

When the first hierarchical systems evolved 5000 years ago, the gap between the rulers and the ruled had increased. Making war to extend the outreach of their territories, rulers often forced men from lower orders of society into the military role. That had been the first use of professional soldiers, a distinct difference from the warrior communities.

The warrior ethic in many societies later became the preserve of the ruling class. Egyptian pharaohs would depict themselves in war chariots, shooting at enemies, or smashing others with clubs. Fighting was considered a prestigious activity but only when associated with status and power. European mounted knights would often feel contempt for the foot soldiers recruited from lower classes. In Mesoamerican societies of pre-Columbian America, the elite aristocratic soldiers remained separated from the lower classes of stone-throwers. The samurai were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of Japan from the 12th to the late 19th century.

In contrast to the beliefs of the caste and clan-based warrior, who saw war as a place to attain valor and glory, warfare was a practical matter that could change the course of history. That was the approach of the Roman legions, which had only the incentive of promotion, as well as a strict level of discipline. When Europe&#x27;s standing armies of the 17th and the 18th centuries developed, discipline was at the core of their training. Officers had the role of transforming men that they viewed as lower class to become reliable fighting men.

Inspired by the Ancient Greek ideals of the &#x27;citizen soldier&#x27;, many European societies during the Renaissance began to incorporate conscription and raise armies from the general populace. A change in attitude was noted as well, as officers were told to treat their soldiers with moderation and respect. For example, men who fought in the American Civil War often elected their own officers. With the mobilization of citizens in the armies sometimes reaching the millions, societies often made efforts in order to maintain or revive the warrior spirit. That trend continues to the modern day. Due to the heroic connotations of the term &quot;warrior&quot;, this metaphor is especially popular in publications advocating or recruiting for a country&#x27;s military.

<doc id="238967" wikidata="Q152873" url="?curid=238967" title="The Joshua Tree">
<text>The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987 by Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, the band aimed for a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music, and through sociopolitically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery, it contrasts the group&#x27;s antipathy for the &quot;real America&quot; with their fascination with the &quot;mythical America&quot;.

Inspired by American experiences, literature, and politics, U2 chose America as a theme for the album. Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group primarily recorded in two houses. Several events during the sessions helped shape the conscious tone of the album, including the band&#x27;s participation in the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concerts for Amnesty International, the death of roadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono&#x27;s travels to Central America. Recording was completed in November 1986; additional production continued into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a &quot;cinematic&quot; quality for the record, one that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of the United States. They represented this in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes.

&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; received critical acclaim, topped the charts in over 20 countries, and became the fastest-selling album in British history. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the album increased the band&#x27;s stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;. It produced the hit singles &quot;With or Without You&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;, and &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, the first two of which became the group&#x27;s only number-one singles in the US. The album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 1988 ceremony. The group supported the record with the Joshua Tree Tour throughout 1987, during which they began to perform in stadiums for the first time in their career.

Frequently listed among the greatest albums of all time, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums, with over 25 million copies sold. U2 commemorated the record&#x27;s 20th anniversary with a remastered re-release, and its 30th anniversary with concert tours and a reissue. In 2014, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and was selected for preservation in the US National Recording Registry, having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress.

==Background==
Prior to &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, U2 had released four studio albums and were an internationally successful band, particularly as a live act having toured every year in the 1980s. The group&#x27;s stature and the public&#x27;s anticipation for a new album grew following their 1984 record &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, their subsequent tour, and their participation in Live Aid in 1985. U2 began writing new material in mid-1985 following the Unforgettable Fire Tour.

U2&#x27;s manager Paul McGuinness recounted that &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; originated from the band&#x27;s &quot;great romance&quot; with the United States, as the group had toured the country for up to five months per year in the first half of the 1980s. Leading up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono read the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of &quot;Hot Press&quot; editor Niall Stokes, &quot;those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream&quot;. Following a September–October 1985 humanitarian visit to Egypt and Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said: &quot;Spending time in Africa and seeing people in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn&#x27;t see when I came home... I saw the spoiled child of the Western world. I started thinking, &#x27;They may have a physical desert, but we&#x27;ve got other kinds of deserts.&#x27; And that&#x27;s what attracted me to the desert as a symbol of some sort.&quot;

After recording vocals for Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s anti-apartheid project &quot;Sun City&quot; in August 1985, Bono made an additional contribution to the album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2&#x27;s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 &quot;had no tradition&quot; and felt as if they &quot;were from outer space&quot;. This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to &quot;Sun City&quot;. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock&#x27;s roots and to focus on building his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained: &quot;I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, I felt the time had come to write words that meant something, out of my experience.&quot; Dylan told Bono about his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track &quot;In a Lifetime&quot;.
U2 wanted to build on the textures of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, but in contrast to that record&#x27;s often out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitations of conventional song structures. The group referred to this approach as working within the &quot;primary colours&quot; of rock music—guitar, bass, and drums. Guitarist the Edge was more interested in the European atmospherics of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and was initially reluctant to follow Bono&#x27;s lead to seek a more American sound. The Edge was eventually convinced otherwise after discovering blues and country artists such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, and Lefty Frizzell on American public radio stations during the Unforgettable Fire Tour. Despite lacking a consensus on their musical direction, the group members agreed that they felt disconnected from the dominant synthpop and new wave music of the time, and they wanted to continue making music that contrasted with these genres.

In November 1985, U2 moved into drummer Larry Mullen Jr.&#x27;s newly purchased home to work on material written during the Unforgettable Fire Tour. This included demos that would evolve into &quot;With or Without You&quot;, &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, and &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot;, as well as a song called &quot;Womanfish&quot;. The Edge recalled it as a difficult period with a sense of &quot;going nowhere&quot;, although Bono was set on America as a theme for the album. Supplementary recording sessions at STS Studios in Dublin with producer Paul Barrett saw the development of &quot;With or Without You&quot; and the genesis of &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;.

==Recording and production==

Based on their success with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, U2 wanted the duo to produce their new album. Mullen was excited about working with them again, as he felt the pair, Lanois in particular, were the band&#x27;s first producers who &quot;really [took] an interest in the rhythm section&quot;. Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis was selected to be the recording engineer for the sessions, marking the first time he worked with U2. The band were impressed by his work with Nick Cave, and Bono&#x27;s friend Gavin Friday recommended Flood based on their work experiences together when Friday was a member of the Virgin Prunes. U2 asked Flood for a sound that was &quot;very open... ambient... with a real sense of space of the environment you were in&quot;, which he thought was a very unusual request at that time.

Intending to release an album in late 1986, U2 set up a studio in January of that year in Danesmoate House, a Georgian house in Rathfarnham, Ireland, in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains. The Edge had viewed the residence months prior while househunting with his wife and convinced the owner to rent it to the band. Their plan was to find inspiration from the converted recording space and use it to musically create atmosphere, much like they did with Slane Castle for &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; sessions in 1984.

A makeshift control room with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment was set up in Danesmoate&#x27;s dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed &quot;non-studio&quot; atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the &quot;lyric room&quot; and the recording space was called the &quot;band room&quot;. Lanois&#x27; strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of the essence of a live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing on which to fall back. This was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in sound isolation, gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, &quot;you have to make a commitment to what you put down and either use it or throw it all away.&quot; This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.

U2&#x27;s initial time at Danesmoate was spent recording and refining &quot;extensive demos&quot; that the Edge anticipated could turn into final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono&#x27;s lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group&#x27;s songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, but rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno&#x27;s involvement: &quot;Usually he was in first every morning and he&#x27;d start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 [synthesiser]—it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when they walked into the room.&quot; One of the first songs worked on was &quot;Heartland&quot;, which originated during &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; sessions and was later released on the band&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. The arrangements for &quot;With or Without You&quot; and &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer for a week or two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band&#x27;s musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.

The band found Danesmoate to have a very creative atmosphere, but according to the Edge, they &quot;just couldn&#x27;t settle in&quot;. The large drawing room, with a tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an &quot;ear-splitting&quot; drum sound that caused issues for the group. Lanois had a higher opinion of the house, saying: &quot;It was loud, but it was really good loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot.&quot; According to him, &quot;the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record—we got a lot of the drums done in there.&quot; He thought that the house sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the drawing room&#x27;s &quot;low mid-range ... where the music lives&quot;, a property that he believes was a major factor in the success of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;.
Over the course of recording &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, the band twice paused to participate in benefit concerts. On 17 May 1986, U2 performed at Self Aid in Dublin. Intended to help alleviate Ireland&#x27;s unemployment crisis by raising funds and job pledges, the event was harshly criticised in the media for taking pressure off the Irish government to resist Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies. The band in particular were labelled hypocrites for their participation. Their appearance included a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;, reinterpreted as a criticism of Thatcher. &quot;Hot Press&quot;″ Niall Stokes called their performance &quot;the blackest and most ferocious set of their entire career&quot;. In June 1986, U2 embarked on the six-show Conspiracy of Hope tour for Amnesty International, halting the album&#x27;s recording sessions for about two months. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new music and provided extra focus on what they wanted to say. For Clayton, the tour validated the &quot;rawness of content&quot; and their attempts to capture the &quot;bleakness and greed of America under Ronald Reagan&quot;. The band used soundchecks on the tour to test out various guitar compositions they had. Meegan believed that U2&#x27;s time with the other artists on the tour affected their own sound: &quot;Their musical heroes were bleeding into the music and they weren&#x27;t embarrassed by it, which gave them a lot of space to work in.&quot;

On 3 July, the band experienced a tragedy when Greg Carroll, their roadie and Bono&#x27;s personal assistant, was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. The 26-year-old&#x27;s death overwhelmed the U2 organisation, and the band travelled to his native New Zealand to attend his traditional Māori funeral; the experience inspired the lyrics to &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. After the funeral, Bono and his wife visited Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention, experiences which formed the basis of the lyrics for &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;.

On 1 August 1986, U2 regrouped in Dublin to resume work on the album and begin the recording stage proper. During this more intense phase of the sessions, the group began to work at the Edge&#x27;s newly purchased house, Melbeach, in seaside Monkstown. Lanois said of Melbeach, &quot;That was less of a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll room but we made it work. I think there were a lot of headaches, isolating people and having to build baffles around the place.&quot; The Edge called the house &quot;more sombre&quot; but said it had a &quot;solid unpretentious quality that seemed to hold the energy in&quot;. &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said that most of the record was done there, and that it was the preferred location for mixing. Writing and recording alternated between the two houses and Windmill Lane Studios. In late August during Hurricane Charley, U2 were visited at Danesmoate by Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist of the Band. Robertson was in Ireland to complete his self-titled debut solo album that he had begun with Lanois. Together, U2 and Robertson recorded the tracks &quot;Sweet Fire of Love&quot; and &quot;Testimony&quot;, both of which appear on Robertson&#x27;s album.

As the sessions progressed, U2 attempted to record a suitable take of the song &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, which began as a demo that the Edge had composed by himself. However, the group struggled with the chord and time signature shifts, forcing significant &quot;screwdriver work&quot; to fix a recorded version of the song. Eno estimated approximately 40% of the time spent on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was dedicated to that song alone. During takes, Lanois used a pointer and a chalkboard to help walk the band through the song&#x27;s changes. In an attempt to force the group to start anew, Eno intended to &quot;stage an accident&quot; whereby the song&#x27;s tapes would be erased. According to Flood, engineer Pat McCarthy had to restrain Eno to prevent this from happening. Ultimately, the erasure never occurred. Another aspect of the album that required re-work was Bono&#x27;s lyrics. The vocalist had another set of lyrics for most of the record, but the other group members were dissatisfied with them, forcing rewrites. Lanois said the production team extensively screened Bono&#x27;s lyrics and offered suggestions, as many lines did not sound as good when sang against a backing track as they did when written down. Bono&#x27;s revised lyrics were described as &quot;absolutely stunning&quot; by Meegan, who believed that the insecurity the singer felt from having his work critiqued further motivated him.

After a creative spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono proposed that the group release a double album. The Edge said: &quot;There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the &#x27;blues&#x27; album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more &#x27;European&#x27;, which is kind of the way I was led.&quot; Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: &quot;I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we&#x27;ll still be here in three months time.&quot; U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois&#x27; words, take &quot;snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far&quot;. The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to &quot;sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion&quot;.
The final weeks were a frantic rush to finish, with the band and production crew all suffering from exhaustion. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes, as they had other commitments. Facing understaffing, in late December, U2 hired Steve Lillywhite, producer of their first three albums, to remix the potential singles and make them more appealing to commercial radio. His eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Of the approximately 30 songs that were created during the album&#x27;s sessions, 11 were selected for the final track listing. Lillywhite mixed four songs with engineer Mark Wallis on an SSL desk at Windmill Lane Studios. At the same time, Lanois, McCarthy, and Meegan mixed seven songs at Melbeach on a 24-track AMEK 2500 mixing desk; all three were required to operate the console due to the lack of mix automation.

On the night before the 15 January 1987 deadline set by Island Records to complete the record, the band and the crew completed mixing. As they worked at Melbeach, Lillywhite&#x27;s wife, singer Kirsty MacColl, volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; first and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl&#x27;s contribution, &quot;Your hope for your album is that it will always be greater than the sum of its parts. It wasn&#x27;t happening for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and she came in and she organized it and it worked as an old-fashioned album: a beginning, middle and end.&quot; Around 2am, just seven hours before the album was due to Island for mastering, the Edge tried to convince Lillywhite to allow him to add backing vocals to &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, but he was denied. In the morning, Meegan and Lillywhite flew with the album&#x27;s tapes to Island&#x27;s offices in Hammersmith, London.

Following the completion of the album proper, U2 returned to the studio with Meegan and McCarthy to complete the new material they had shelved in October. These tracks, which included &quot;Walk to the Water&quot;, &quot;Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, were completed as B-sides for the planned singles. The Edge said that with no producers around and &quot;without the sense of significance that imbued the album sessions&quot;, the group worked quickly and productively, preventing the songs from, in his opinion, sounding overworked. The song &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; was left off the album and released as a B-side, as the band felt it was incomplete and did not fit with the other songs. They later expressed regret that it had not been completed for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. The track was re-recorded as a single for the group&#x27;s 1998 compilation &quot;The Best of 1980–1990&quot;. U2 agreed that one track, &quot;Birdland&quot;, was too strong for a B-side and they withheld it for a future album release. In 2007, a re-recorded version of the song, retitled &quot;Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)&quot;, was included with the 20th anniversary edition of the album.

After completing &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, Bono said that he was &quot;as pleased with the record as I can ever be pleased with a record&quot;, calling &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; their most complete album since their debut. Clayton bought Danesmoate House in 1987 and made it his home.

==Composition==

===Music===

U2 is credited with composing all of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s music. The album&#x27;s sound draws from American and Irish roots music more than the group&#x27;s previous albums, following the counsel and influence of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards. &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; has strong gospel influences, with Bono singing of spiritual doubt in an upper register and Eno, Lanois, and the Edge providing choir-like backing vocals. The slow piano-based ballad &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; exhibits traits of folk music and acoustic blues in the track&#x27;s slide acoustic guitar and harmonica. &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot;, another song on which Bono plays harmonica, was described by Niall Stokes as a &quot;bluesy romp&quot;. Summarising the stylistic direction, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Joshua Klein writes that the album &quot;showed how U2&#x27;s obsession with American roots flavored its art-rock&quot;.

The Edge&#x27;s guitar playing on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is characteristic of what came to be his trademark sound. His minimalist style sharply contrasted with the emphasis placed on virtuosity and speed by heavy metal in the 1980s. The Edge views musical notes as &quot;expensive&quot;, preferring to play as few of them as possible and to instead focus on simpler parts that serve the moods of the songs. Much of this was achieved with a delay effect, contributing to a chiming, echo-laden sound. For example, the riff in the introduction of the opening track &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; is a repeated six-note arpeggio, with delay used to repeat notes. The riffs to &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; and &quot;With or Without You&quot; also prominently use delay, with Bono likening the guitar hook from the former track to &quot;chrome bells&quot;.

The Edge continued to employ the ambient techniques of guitar playing that he used on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;; for &quot;With or Without You&quot;, he used a prototype of the Infinite Guitar to add layers of sustained notes, an approach he first took on his 1986 solo album, the &quot;Captive&quot; soundtrack. On other songs, his guitar playing is more aggressive; &quot;Exit&quot; was described by Colin Hogg as a &quot;decidedly scary... guitar-driven barrage&quot;, while Andrew Mueller said the guitar sounds from &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; evoke images of fighter planes. The Edge developed the harsh, feedback-charged guitar part for the latter song at Bono&#x27;s instruction to &quot;put El Salvador through an amplifier&quot;, after Bono returned angry from a visit to the war-torn country. Bono also contributed to songwriting on guitar; the Spanish guitar melody in &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; originated from a song that he wrote in Ethiopia to teach children about basic hygiene.

Much like on , Bono exhibits an expressive, open-throated vocal delivery, which many critics described as &quot;passionate&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; found that the group&#x27;s exploration of roots music resulted in Bono&#x27;s style expanding, saying that he &quot;commands the full whisper-to-shout range of blues mannerisms&quot;. Bono attributes this maturation to &quot;loosening up&quot;, &quot;discover[ing] other voices&quot;, and employing more restraint in his singing. His vocals became, in the words of Thom Duffy, more &quot;dynamic&quot; than they had been on previous records. On &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, his voice varies greatly in its timbre (as writer Mark Butler describes, &quot;he sighs; he moans; he grunts; he exhales audibly; he allows his voice to crack&quot;) and its timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the sung notes from the beat. For author Susan Fast, &quot;With or Without You&quot; marks the first track on which he &quot;extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way&quot;.

===Lyrics===

Bono is credited as the album&#x27;s sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band&#x27;s deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, &quot;I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America&quot;, hence the album&#x27;s working title, &quot;The Two Americas&quot;. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country&#x27;s geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert is used as a metaphor for &quot;spiritual drought&quot;. One track that chiefly represents these themes is &quot;In God&#x27;s Country&quot;, which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America&#x27;s role as the &quot;promised land&quot;. Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: &quot;The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it&#x27;s some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it&#x27;s also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is.&quot;
Political and social concerns were the basis for several tracks. Bono wrote the lyrics for &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; after visiting El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessing how the conflict between rebels and the US-backed government affected local civilians. During the mid-song spoken passage, he talks of a man with a &quot;face red like a rose on a thorn bush&quot;, a reference to Reagan. Bono&#x27;s trip also inspired &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;, after he met members of COMADRES—the Mothers of the Disappeared—a group of women whose children were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the civil war at the hands of the local government. The 1984 UK mining strike inspired the lyrics for &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, which Bono wrote from the perspective of a couple affected by the strike. The story of a heroin-addicted couple was the basis for &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;, which Bono set in the Ballymun Flats residential towers in Dublin near which he was raised. The buildings are referenced in the lyric &quot;I see seven towers / But I only see one way out&quot;. For &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, he wrote the lyrics in response to the idea that, in Belfast, a person&#x27;s religion and income can be deduced based on the street they live on. &quot;Exit&quot; portrays the thoughts of a psychotic killer, although Clayton suggested that the line &quot;He saw the hands that build could also pull down&quot; is also a jab at the US government&#x27;s conflicting roles in international relations.

Bono described 1986 as &quot;an incredibly bad year&quot; for him, which was reflected in the lyrics. His marriage was under strain, in part due to the album&#x27;s long gestation period, the band were criticised by the Irish media for their involvement in Self Aid, and his personal assistant Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident. Bono said, &quot;That&#x27;s why the desert attracted me as an image. That year was really a desert for us.&quot; &quot;With or Without You&quot; was written while he was struggling to reconcile his wanderlust as a musician with his domestic responsibilities. &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, named after a volcanic peak in Carroll&#x27;s native New Zealand, describes how Bono felt at Carroll&#x27;s funeral. The album is dedicated to his memory.

The group&#x27;s religious faith was a source of inspiration for many lyrics. On &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;, Bono affirms this faith but sings of spiritual doubt (&quot;I believe in Kingdom Come&quot;... &quot;But I still haven&#x27;t found what I&#x27;m looking for&quot;). Some critics surmised that the place Bono is referring to on &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; is Heaven. These two songs were singled out by some critics as demonstrating that the band was on a &quot;spiritual quest&quot;. &quot;Hot Press&quot; editor Niall Stokes and Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interpreted &quot;With or Without You&quot; in both romantic and spiritual manners. Biblical references are made on other songs like &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; (&quot;Jacob wrestled the angel&quot;, images of fire and brimstone) and &quot;In God&#x27;s Country&quot; (&quot;I stand with the sons of Cain&quot;). Thom Duffy interpreted the album as an exploration of the &quot;uncertainty and pain of a spiritual pilgrimage through a bleak and harsh world&quot;.
==Packaging and title==

Designed by Steve Averill, the album sleeve was based on U2&#x27;s request to depict the record&#x27;s &quot;imagery, and cinematic location&quot; in the desert. Since the album&#x27;s provisional titles were &quot;The Desert Songs&quot; and &quot;The Two Americas&quot;, the initial concept for the sleeve was to represent where the desert met civilisation. The group decided early in the creative process to photograph in the US, contrasting with all of their previous albums, which had been shot in Ireland. They asked their photographer Anton Corbijn to search for locations in the US that would capture their ideas. A week prior to the photo shoot, he travelled to the US to compile a list of locations.

Over several days in December 1986, U2 travelled with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert for a photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at Reno, Nevada, before moving to locations in California such as the ghost town of Bodie, the Harmony Motel in Twentynine Palms, Zabriskie Point, Death Valley Junction, and other sites in Death Valley. Corbijn rented a panoramic camera to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, &quot;Fortunately there was a lot of light.&quot; Averill filmed portions of the trip with an 8 mm film camera. The photo shoots took place in the mornings and evenings, with mid-days spent travelling and on preparation. Corbijn later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose &quot;man and environment, the Irish in America&quot;. Averill said of their photographic approach, &quot;What I was trying to do with the way we shot the pictures and framed the cover was to suggest the landscape vision and cinematic approach that was taken to the recording.&quot;
On the evening after the first day&#x27;s shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (&quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot;), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he suggested their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant&#x27;s etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree&#x27;s stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been hoping to find a single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called &quot;fairly spontaneous&quot;. Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, &quot;it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least &quot;look&quot; like a desert. That&#x27;s one of the reasons we look so grim.&quot; Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, &quot;I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn&#x27;t go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves.&quot;
For the vinyl record release, Corbijn originally wanted to have a shot of the Joshua tree on the front of the sleeve, with U2 in a continuation of the photograph on the back. Averill tried out a concept with just the landscape on the front that he said resembled a &quot;jazz ECM record&quot;. Ultimately, separate photographs were used for each side of the sleeve; an image of the group at Zabriskie Point was placed on the front, while an image of them with the tree appears on the back cover. For the front cover, Averill said that the framing of the band in the left half of the photo was meant to evoke the cinematography of film directors John Ford and Sergio Leone. The centre gatefold showed an image of U2 with the Joshua tree in the middle; a mirror used by them to check their appearance was mistakenly left in frame. Since the compact disc was a relatively new format at the time, the creative team decided to experiment with the album cover, selecting different cover images for each format on which the album was released; the original compact disc release used a blurry, distorted photo of the band, while the cassette used a clear, but alternate photo. Later CD reissues used the LP photo. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the album&#x27;s title and the images of the tree befit a record concerned with &quot;resilience in the face of utter social and political desolation, a record steeped in religious imagery&quot;. In 1991, the magazine ranked &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; at number 97 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Album Covers of All Time&quot;. Cartoonist Berkeley Breathed created a parody of the album cover for the back of his book &quot;Billy and the Boingers Bootleg&quot;, released in August 1987.

The tree photographed for the sleeve fell around 2000, yet the site remains a popular tourist attraction for U2 fans. One person inserted a plaque into the ground reading, &quot;Have you found what you&#x27;re looking for?&quot;, in reference to the album&#x27;s track &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;. It is a common misconception that the site is within Joshua Tree National Park, when in fact it is over away from the park. 
==Release==
Just prior to the release of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, Bono was stricken with a sudden panic about the quality of the completed album. He said that he contemplated calling the production plants to order a halt of the record&#x27;s pressing, but he ultimately held off. Island Records spent over $100,000 on store displays advertising the album; president Lou Maglia called it &quot;the most complete merchandising effort ever assembled&quot;. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was released on 9 March 1987, with an initial shipment of 300,000 copies in the US. It was the first new release to be made available on the compact disc, vinyl record, and cassette tape formats on the same date. Record stores in Britain and Ireland opened at midnight to accommodate the large number of fans who had queued outside to buy the album.

&quot;With or Without You&quot; was released as the lead single on 21 March 1987, with the B-sides &quot;Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)&quot; and &quot;Walk to the Water&quot;. The single quickly topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s first number-one hit in America. The song topped the singles chart in Canada, while reaching number four in the UK and number two in the Netherlands. The group originally planned to use &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; as the second single. However, the group were unhappy with the music video filmed by Neil Jordan, and Bono had difficulty singing the song. Ultimately, the group canceled the single. Instead, &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; was chosen as the second single, and it was released in May 1987 with the tracks &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; and &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot; as B-sides. Like its predecessor, it topped the Hot 100, giving U2 consecutive number-one singles in the US. The single peaked at number six in the UK, Canada, and the Netherlands.

&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; was released in August 1987 as the third single, with &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot;, &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, and &quot;Race Against Time&quot; as B-sides. The single reached number seven in the Netherlands, number four on the UK Singles Chart, and number 13 in the US. The album&#x27;s first three singles all topped the Irish Singles Charts, while charting within the top 20 of the singles charts in the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. &quot;In God&#x27;s Country&quot; was released as a fourth single exclusively in North America in November 1987, peaking at number 44 on the Hot 100 and number 48 as an import single in the UK. &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand in March 1988, and having been written for the New Zealand-native Carroll, it reached number one in his home country.

In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab remastered the album and released it as a special gold CD. This edition rectified the incorrect track splitting between &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; that affected some CD releases; the quiet coda that concludes &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; had previously been included in the same track as &quot;Exit&quot;.

Following its 30th anniversary reissue, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart the week of 8 June 2017, climbing to number 16—its highest position on the chart since 13 February 1988. That week, it shifted 27,000 album-equivalent units, 23,000 of which were sales, making it the album&#x27;s highest-selling week in the US since 3 January 1993.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; received critical acclaim, and the best reviews of U2&#x27;s career to that point. Steve Pond of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;For a band that&#x27;s always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures—a band utterly determined to be Important—&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; could be the big one, and that&#x27;s precisely what it sounds like.&quot; The review described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;wed[ding] the diverse textures of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on &quot;War&quot;&quot;. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; echoed these sentiments in his review, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, and the more volcanic rock of their early years.&quot; Morse called it &quot;their most challenging work to date&quot; and the &quot;most rewarding rock record of the new year&quot;. John McCready of &quot;NME&quot; praised the album as &quot;a better and braver record than anything else that&#x27;s likely to appear in 1987... It&#x27;s the sound of people still trying, still looking...&quot; Thom Duffy of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said the songs have &quot;exultant power&quot; that, &quot;like the Joshua Tree&#x27;s branches, stretch upward in stark contrast to their barren musical surroundings on rock radio&quot;. He praised the musicianship of the group members, calling Bono&#x27;s vocals &quot;wrenching&quot;, the rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton &quot;razor-sharp&quot;, and the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing &quot;never... better&quot;. Colin Hogg of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; called &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; &quot;the most compelling collection of music yet from a band that has cut its career with passionate, exciting slashes&quot;. It judged that the record&#x27;s &quot;power lies in its restraint&quot; and that there is an &quot;urgency underlying virtually all of the 11 songs&quot;. Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the album &quot;epic&quot;, saying &quot;what U2 have achieved is an exhilarating and varied blend of controlled power and subtelty&quot;. The review praised U2 for maturing and expanding their musical range, yet &quot;retain[ing] their sense of power&quot; and the &quot;brave passion and emotion&quot; of Bono&#x27;s vocals.

&quot;Q&quot;″s Paul Du Noyer said that the source of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s &quot;potency lies in a kind of spiritual frustration – a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives.&quot; He concluded his review by writing that the music &quot;has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a thing so often absent: the urge to exist&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; hailed the record as U2&#x27;s &quot;first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material&quot;. The review stated, &quot;There isn&#x27;t a bad song on the record&quot; and that &quot;every one has a hook&quot;. The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the album &quot;confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world&quot;. Hilburn noted that the band showed &quot;sometimes breathtaking signs of growth&quot; and played more &quot;tailored and assured&quot; music. &quot;Hot Press&quot; editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill Graham said that &quot;&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions,&quot; and that U2 &quot;must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock&quot;. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono&#x27;s vocals were &quot;marred throughout by sobbing affectation&quot; and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a &quot;curious loss of individuality&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Marty Racine felt it has &quot;music that both soothes and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style&quot;. Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is &quot;not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious&quot;, which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found the lyrics tasteful and the music &quot;mournful and passionate, stately and involved&quot;, but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it &quot;one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said &quot;their focus has never been clearer, nor has their music been catchier&quot;. His review concluded, &quot;Never before have U2&#x27;s big messages sounded so direct and personal.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Bill Wyman wrote that the album combined &quot;easy-to-grasp themes – alienation and an outsider’s ambivalent view of America – with an extremely focused musical attack&quot;. A 2008 retrospective by &quot;Q&quot; said &quot;their reinvention of stadium rock sounds as impassioned as ever&quot; and that the album strikes &quot;a finely balanced mix of intimacy and power&quot;. Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the album to Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, stating that both records &quot;lifted a populist artist to mega-stardom&quot;, and that the musicians&#x27; uplifting live shows and the &quot;sheer aural pleasure&quot; of the two records obscured their foreboding nature. DeCurtis summarized &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s examination of America both lyrically and musically as such:
===Accolades===
In voting for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 1987 end-of-year readers&#x27; polls, U2 won in the categories &quot;Best Album&quot;, &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Band&quot;, &quot;Best Single (&quot;With or Without You)&quot;, and &quot;Best Male Singer&quot; (Bono). The album placed fourth on the &quot;Best Albums&quot; list from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1987 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, and sixth on &quot;NME&quot;″s list. In 1988, U2 received four Grammy Award nominations for the album and its songs, winning honours for Album of the Year (to beat artists such as Michael Jackson, Prince, and Whitney Houston) and Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year, but lost in both categories. U2 were the only act that year to be nominated in each of the &quot;Big Three&quot; categories (Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year).

==Commercial performance==

&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; debuted on the UK Albums Chart on 21 March 1987 at number one with 235,000 copies sold in its opening week, making it the fastest-selling album in UK history to that point. It received a platinum certification in the UK within 48 hours of being released. The album spent two weeks atop the UK Albums Chart and spent its first 28 weeks within the top ten. In total, it charted in the UK for 201 weeks, ranking it among the longest-charting albums in the nation&#x27;s history. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, the album debuted on 4 April 1987 at number seven, the highest debut for a studio album in the US in almost seven years. Three weeks later, it reached number one, becoming the group&#x27;s first album to top the charts in the US. It remained at that position for nine consecutive weeks, the band&#x27;s longest number-one reign on the chart and the second-longest reign in the US that year. The album spent a total of 120 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums, 35 of them in the top ten. On 13 May 1987, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album double-platinum. All of the group&#x27;s previous albums re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart in 1987.

In Canada, the album debuted at number 51 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 Albums chart on 21 March 1987, and climbed to number one just two weeks later. Within 14 days of release, it sold 300,000 units in Canada and was certified triple-platinum. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; also topped the charts in Austria, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Sweden. In total, the album reached number one in over 20 countries.

By May 1987, sales of the album surpassed 7 million copies worldwide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the album increased the band&#x27;s stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;. It was the first album by any artist to sell one million copies on CD in the US. U2 were featured on the cover of the 27 April 1987 issue of &quot;Time&quot;, which declared them &quot;Rock&#x27;s Hottest Ticket&quot;; they were just the fourth rock band to appear on the magazine&#x27;s cover, following the Beatles, the Band, and the Who. By the end of 1988, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; had sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. It was the ninth-best-selling album in the UK during the 1980s.

&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is the band&#x27;s highest-selling album, and with 25 million copies sold worldwide, it is among the highest-selling albums of all time. It ranks as one of the best-selling albums in the US; in 1995, the RIAA certified it 10× platinum for shipping 10 million units. Similarly, the Canadian Recording Industry Association certified the album diamond in Canada. In the UK, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; ranked among the 40 highest-selling records as of October 2018, with 2.88 million copies sold, and in 2023 it was certified 10× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. In the Pacific, it is certified 5× platinum and 14× platinum in Australia and New Zealand, respectively.

==The Joshua Tree Tour==

Following the album&#x27;s release, U2 embarked on a worldwide concert tour, the Joshua Tree Tour. Lasting from April to December 1987, it comprised 109 shows over three legs. The first and third legs visited the US, while the second leg toured Europe. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; elevated the group to a new level of popularity; the tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world—the first time they consistently performed at venues of that size. Songs from the album became staples of the tour&#x27;s set lists, as the group regularly performed eight of the record&#x27;s eleven tracks, and the only song not to be played was &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;.

Like their previous tours, the Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this outlet for addressing political and social concerns. One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham&#x27;s canceling the state&#x27;s observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem&#x27;s New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studio in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band&#x27;s experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.

The Joshua Tree Tour was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1987, grossing $35.1 million from 2.04 million tickets sold to 79 shows. Overall, the tour grossed $40 million and drew 3 million attendees, but despite its commercial success and positive reviews, U2 were dissatisfied creatively, and Bono believed they were musically unprepared for their success. Mullen said, &quot;We were the biggest, but we weren&#x27;t the best&quot;, and for Bono the tour was &quot;one of the worst times of [their] musical life&quot;. On the road, the group dealt with death threats, along with injuries that Bono sustained from performing. The band hinted that the stresses of touring led them to enjoy the &quot;rock and roll lifestyle&quot; they previously avoided.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; has been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; collated worldwide data from a range of renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, who placed the record at number 57 on the list of the &quot;100 Best Albums Ever&quot;. It was ranked 25th in Colin Larkin&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In a poll of VH1 viewers the following year, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was voted the greatest pop album of all time, based on responses from over 250,000 people. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 26 on their 2003 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Subsequent updates to the list re-ranked the album; the 2012 version ranked it 27th, writing that the album &quot;turn[ed] spiritual quests and political struggles into uplifting stadium singalongs&quot;, and the 2020 version of the list ranked it 135th. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; one of the magazine&#x27;s 100 best albums, while &quot;Hot Press&quot; ranked it 11th on a similar list. &quot;Q&quot; named it the best record of the 1980s, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included the album on its list of the 100 best records released between 1983 and 2008.

In 2010, the album appeared at number 62 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s list of the 125 most influential albums in the 25 years since the magazine launched. The publication said, &quot;The band&#x27;s fifth album spit out hits like crazy, and they were unusually searching hits, each with a pointed political edge.&quot; The same year, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; 34th on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;Arguably the biggest album of the 1980s&quot; and &quot;proof that lightning can be captured in a bottle&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked it 24th on its list of the &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;, saying that &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s opening trio of songs helped &quot;the band became lords and emperors of anthemic &#x27;80s rock&quot; and that &quot;U2 no longer belonged to Dublin, but the world.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the record 47th on its list of &quot;The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;, writing that the album&#x27;s &quot;brilliant tension&quot; and continued resonance was the result of Eno and Lanois &quot;steer[ing] U2 toward a moody impressionism where slide guitars and three chord progressions sound cavernous, even ominous&quot;. In 2024, Apple Music ranked &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; 49th on its 100 Best Albums list. &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; said the record &quot;made [U2] the first mainstream band since the Beatles to capture the spirit of the age in a manner that was both populist and artistically, politically and socially incisive&quot;, while humanities scholar Henry Vyverberg considered it among the minority of attempts at &quot;serious art&quot; during a decade in which the rock genre largely &quot;remained musical junk-food&quot;. From Josh Tyrangiel&#x27;s perspective, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; began a &quot;towering period&quot; of U2&#x27;s history lasting through 1993&#x27;s &quot;Zooropa&quot; when they &quot;made stadium-size art rock with huge melodies that allowed Bono to throw his arms around the world while bending its ear about social justice&quot;. WYMS journalist Mitchell Kreitzman credited it with exposing &quot;alternative music to the masses&quot;, and Kevin J. H. Dettmar cited it as the most commercially and critically successful album &quot;yet to emerge from alternative or college rock&quot;. In 2014, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for becoming &quot;part of our musical, social, and cultural history&quot;. That same year, the album was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the US Library of Congress for being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is the only Irish work to be so honoured.

The band&#x27;s penchant for addressing political and social issues, as well as their staid depiction in Corbijn&#x27;s black-and-white sleeve photographs, contributed to the group&#x27;s earnest and serious image as &quot;stone-faced pilgrim[s]&quot;. This image became a target for derision after the band&#x27;s critically maligned &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; project in 1988. Various critics called them &quot;po-faced&quot;, &quot;pompous bores&quot;, and &quot;humourless&quot;. The group&#x27;s continued exploration of American music for the project was labelled &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;misguided and bombastic&quot;. After Bono told fans on the 1989 Lovetown Tour that U2 would &quot;dream it all up again&quot;, the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s. They incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the &quot;rock star&quot; identity they struggled with in the 1980s. Bono referred to their 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; as &quot;the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree&quot;. Author Bill Flanagan summarised the impact of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; on the group&#x27;s career in his liner notes for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary release: &quot;&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; made U2 into international rock stars and established both a standard they would always have to live up to and an image they would forever try to live down.&quot;

==20th anniversary remastered edition==
On 20 November 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was released. The album was remastered from the original analogue recordings under the direction of the Edge, with the original vinyl album artwork restored. The release was made available in four formats: a single CD; a two-disc deluxe edition with a bonus audio CD of B-sides, rarities, and demos; a three-disc box set with the bonus audio CD and DVD, photograph prints, and hardcover book; and a double vinyl edition. All editions included liner notes by author Bill Flanagan and previously unseen photographs by Anton Corbijn. Manager Paul McGuinness explained, &quot;There has been continuous demand from U2 fans to have &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; properly re-mastered. As always, the band had to make sure it was right, and now it is.&quot; Some formats include expanded liner notes from the band members, the production team, and Anton Corbijn. In an otherwise favourable review of the remastered album, Andrew Mueller of &quot;Uncut&quot; said that &quot;any casual listener who can perceive a meaningful difference between this and the original has i) ears like a bat and/or ii) needs to get out more&quot;.

The bonus audio CD contains 14 additional tracks, including the B-sides &quot;Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)&quot;, &quot;Walk to the Water&quot;, &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot;, &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot;, and &quot;Race Against Time&quot;. Two versions of &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; are included—U2&#x27;s version, and the original recording from the &quot;Sun City&quot; album by Bono, Keith Richards, and others. The edited single version of &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; appears on the bonus CD. &quot;Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience&quot; contains lyrics from the introduction to William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;, while &quot;Drunk Chicken/America&quot; contains an excerpt of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s recitation of his poem, &quot;America&quot;. &quot;Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)&quot;, &quot;Desert of Our Love&quot;, &quot;Rise Up&quot;, and &quot;Drunk Chicken/America&quot; are all previously unreleased recordings from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; sessions.

The bonus DVD includes live concert footage, a documentary, and two music videos. The disc includes &quot;Live from Paris&quot;, an 85-minute concert from 4 July 1987 that was originally broadcast on British television in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Island Records. The documentary, titled &quot;Outside It&#x27;s America&quot;, was a 1987 MTV production about The Joshua Tree Tour. The two music videos are an alternate version &quot;With or Without You&quot; and the previously unreleased video for &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;. Footage of U2&#x27;s alter ego country band, the Dalton Brothers, is included on the disc as an Easter egg.

==30th anniversary tour and reissue==
For the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, on which they played the album in its entirety at each show. It was the first time the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s subject matter: &quot;That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners&#x27; strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we&#x27;re right back there in a way... It just felt like, &#x27;Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn&#x27;t have three years ago, four years ago. The 2017 tour grossed more than $316 million from over 2.7 million tickets sold, making it the highest-grossing tour of the year. Additional tour dates were added for Oceania and Asia in 2019, which included the band&#x27;s first ever performances in South Korea, Singapore, India, and the Philippines. The 2019 shows grossed $73.8 million and sold 567,000 tickets, bringing the cumulative totals for the group&#x27;s &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; anniversary tours to $390.8 million grossed and 3.3 million tickets sold.

On 2 June 2017, the album was reissued in several formats in commemoration of its 30th anniversary. Standard editions of the album were released on CD, vinyl record, and via digital download. Deluxe editions, available on CD and digitally, include a concert recording of a 1987 show at Madison Square Garden from the Joshua Tree Tour. In addition to the concert, the super deluxe editions, available on CD, vinyl record, and digitally, include: B-sides and rarities; and remixes of the album&#x27;s songs made in 2017 by Daniel Lanois, St Francis Hotel, Jacknife Lee, Steve Lillywhite, and Flood. The physical copies of the super deluxe edition include eight folio prints and an 84-page book of photography shot by the Edge during the album cover&#x27;s 1986 photoshoot in the Mojave Desert. The 2017 remix of &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; was released as a single on vinyl picture disc for Record Store Day in April 2017.

<text>Spirit of America is the trademarked name used by Craig Breedlove for his land speed record-setting vehicles.

==First &quot;Spirit of America&quot;==
&quot;Spirit of America&quot; was the first of the modern record breaking jet-propelled cars, built with a narrow streamlined fuselage, three-wheel chassis, and, most significantly, turbojet engine. Like most of the other competing vehicles, the engine was ex-military. The first &quot;Spirit&quot; had a General Electric J47 engine from an F-86 and was tested at Bonneville Salt Flats in 1962, where difficult handling resulted in failure. Before trying again, a new stabilizer and steerable front wheel were added.

Breedlove set his first record on August 5, 1963, at Bonneville, the first man to set an average speed of over during a land speed record attempt. (John Cobb had already exceeded this 400 mph mark in 1947, but had not sustained it as an average over both runs.)

At the time of &quot;Spirit of America&quot;″s construction the &quot;Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&quot; (FIA) rules for a land speed record required four wheels. &quot;Spirit&quot;″s record was thus not recognised by the FIA. The &quot;Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme&quot; (FIM) did recognise it, however, classing &quot;Spirit&quot; as a motorcycle. Although this controversy has been widely reported since as being due to the use of a jet engine, FIA rules describing a qualifying car as being &quot;driven through its wheels&quot;, the only issue raised seriously at the time was over the number of wheels, hence the FIM acceptance.

For a period there were thus &quot;two&quot; simultaneous land speed records, the 1947 &quot;Railton Mobil Special&quot; record remaining as the FIA four-wheel Class A record, which from July 1964 went to Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Bluebird&quot;. Although &quot;Bluebird&quot; also used a &quot;jet engine&quot;, it was a turboshaft that drove the wheels.

Both FIA &amp; FIM records were broken in October 1964 by Tom Green and further extended by Art Arfons. Breedlove returned to Bonneville with &quot;Spirit&quot; and pushed the record over , setting it at on October 15, a record that stood for almost two weeks. In setting the new record, at the end of his second run, the &quot;Spirit&quot; lost its braking parachutes, skidding for five miles (8 km), through a row of telephone poles and crashing into a brine pond at around . Drenched but uninjured, Breedlove climbed out of the cockpit and declared, &quot;And now for my next act I&#x27;m going to set myself on fire.&quot; This feat earned a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for &quot;longest skid marks&quot;. &quot;Spirit&quot; was recovered and taken to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago as an exhibit. &quot;Spirit of America&quot; also left the ground for the longest distance ever recorded for a ground-based vehicle, when it hit rough ground at the end of the run.. The vehicle is no longer on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

==&quot;Spirit of America – Sonic 1&quot;==
A new &quot;Spirit&quot; was built over 1964–1965 to attempt to beat Arfons, dubbed &quot;Spirit of America – Sonic I&quot; a four-wheel design with a much higher rated GE J79 engine originally from an F-4 Phantom II, the same type as that used by Arfons&#x27; Green Monster. Another tit-for-tat with Arfons ended with Breedlove setting the record at 600.601 mph (966.574 km/h) on November 15, 1965, a record that stood until 1970, broken by Gary Gabelich&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Flame&quot; land speed record rocket car. The &quot;Sonic I&quot; vehicle is currently on display at the Museum of American Speed in Lincoln, Nebraska.

==&quot;Spirit of America – Formula Shell LSRV&quot;==
After a lengthy break from world records Breedlove began work on a new &quot;Spirit&quot; in 1992, eventually named the &quot;Spirit of America Formula Shell LSRV&quot;. The vehicle is 44 ft 10 in long, 8 ft 4 in wide, and 5 ft 10 in high (13.67 m by 2.54 m by 1.78 m) and weighs 9,000 lb (4 t), construction is on a steel tube frame with an aluminium skin body. The engine is the same as in the second &quot;Spirit&quot;, a GE J79, but it is modified to burn unleaded gasoline and generates a maximum thrust of 22,650 lbf (100.8 kN).

The first run of the vehicle on October 28, 1996, in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada ended in a crash at around 675 mph (1,086 km/h). Returning in 1997 the vehicle badly damaged the engine on an early run. The British &quot;ThrustSSC&quot; twin-Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan-engined LSR car upped the record to 763 mph (1,228 km/h) on 15 October 1997, and became the first car to officially break the sound barrier. The re-engined &quot;Spirit&quot; could do no better than 676 mph (1088 km/h).

Breedlove sold the &quot;Spirit of America Formula Shell LSRV&quot; to Steve Fossett, holder of many sailing, ballooning and other aviation records, and the car was undergoing rebuilding in hopes of some preliminary shakedown runs in late September 2007 at Bonneville. However, Steve Fossett disappeared in early September 2007 while scouting for alternative land speed record venues in Nevada; his body and aircraft were later located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.
The &quot;Spirit of America Sonic Arrow&quot;, as it was rechristened by Fossett, was rolled out on the Black Rock Desert for a photo opportunity on October 15, 2007. The effort to run the car continued.

<doc id="238972" wikidata="Q14524284" url="?curid=238972" title="Dip pen">
<text>A dip pen is a writing instrument used to apply ink to paper. It usually consists of a metal nib with a central slit that acts as a capillary channel like those of fountain pen nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials can be used for the holder, including bone, metal and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass.

Generally dip pens have no ink reservoir, so the user must refill the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue drawing or writing. Sometimes a simple tubular reservoir can be clipped to the top of the pen, allowing for several minutes of uninterrupted use. Refilling can be done by dipping into an inkwell, but it is also possible to charge the pen with an eyedropper, a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, &quot;dip pens&quot; are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them nib pens.

Dip pens with replaceable metal nibs emerged in the early 19th century, when they replaced quill pens and, in some parts of the world, reed pens. Dip pens were widely used well into the 20th century, only gradually being displaced with the development of fountain pens in the later 19th century, and are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics.

While a fountain pen offers the convenience of less frequent refills, the dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof, pigmented, iron gall ink, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic inks with ease; while fountain pens generally must use water based inks, require thorough and frequent cleaning to prevent clogging when used with pigmented or waterproof inks and may corrode when used with iron gall ink. Steel and brass dip pen nibs may also corrode when used with iron gall ink but this is not as likely nor as problematic as the nib of a dip pen is often cleaned after each use, and is easily replaced. Flexible dip pen nibs allow for the production of a line that naturally varies in thickness.

There is a wide range of exchangeable nibs for dip pens, so different types of lines and effects can be created. The nibs and handles are far cheaper than most fountain pens, and allow color changes much more easily.

== History ==
The earliest known split-nib metal dip pen is a surviving copper-alloy pen found in Roman Britain (AD 43 to 410). Several other surviving all-metal and removable-nib pens from the Middle Ages and Renaissance have been found, suggesting they were used alongside quill pens.

The steel pen is first attested in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s book &quot;A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain – 1724–26&quot;. In Letter VII Defoe wrote: &quot;the plaster of the ceilings and walls in some rooms is so fine, so firm, so entire, that they break it off in large flakes, and it will bear writing on it with a pencil or steel pen.&quot; In Newhall Street, John Mitchell pioneered mass production of steel pens in 1822; prior to that the quill pen had been the most common form of writing instrument. His brother William Mitchell later set up his own pen making business in St Paul&#x27;s square. The Mitchell family is credited as being the first manufacturers to use machines to cut pen nibs, which greatly sped up the process.

The Jewellery Quarter and surrounding area of Birmingham, England was home to many of the first dip pen manufacturers, which some companies establishing there to produce pens. Some of those companies were Joseph Gillott&#x27;s (established in 1827), Sir Josiah Mason (1827), Hink Wells &amp; Co. (1836), Baker and Finnemore (1850), C. Brandauer &amp; Co. (1850), D. Leonardt &amp; Co. (1856).

Baker and Finnemore operated in James Street, near St Paul&#x27;s Square. C Brandauer &amp; Co Ltd., founded as Ash &amp; Petit, traded at 70 Navigation Street. Joseph Gillott &amp; Sons Ltd. made pen nibs in Bread Street, now Cornwall Street. Hinks Wells &amp; Co. traded in Buckingham Street, Geo W Hughes traded in St Paul&#x27;s Square, D. Leonardt &amp; Co./Leonardt &amp; Catwinkle traded in George Street and Charlotte Street, and M Myers &amp; Son. were based at 8 Newhall Street. By 1830 John and William Mitchell, Joseph Gillott and Josiah Mason were the major manufacturers in Birmingham.
In Germany the industrial production of dip pens started in 1842 at the factory of Heintze &amp; Blanckertz in Berlin.

By the 1850s, Birmingham was a world centre for steel pen and steel nib manufacture. More than half the steel nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen and women were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected in Birmingham, enabling the city&#x27;s factories to mass produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, which encouraged the development of education and literacy. By 1860 there were about 100 companies making steel nibs in Birmingham, but 12 large firms dominated the trade. In 1870 Mason, Sommerville, Wiley, and Perry, merged to form Perry &amp; Co. Ltd. which later became one of the largest manufacturers in the world, with near 2,000 employees.
Richard Esterbrook manufactured quill pens in Cornwall. In the 19th century, he saw a gap in the American market for steel nib pens. Esterbrook approached five craftsmen who worked for John Mitchell in Navigation Street with a view to setting up business in Camden, New Jersey, US. Esterbrook founded his company in 1858, and it grew to become one of the largest steel pen manufacturers in the world. In 1971 it went out of business.

The oblique dip pen was designed for writing the pointed pen styles of the mid 19th to the early 20th century such as Spencerian Script, although oblique pen holders can be used for earlier styles of pointed penmanship such as the copperplate scripts of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the name suggests, the nib holder holds the nib at an oblique angle of around 55° pointing to the right hand side of the penman. This feature helps greatly in achieving the steep angle required for writing certain scripts, but more importantly, it prevents the right hand nib tine from dragging on the paper as can be experienced when using a straight nib holder with a straight nib for this purpose.

The decreasing production of dip pens and the subsequent demise of the industry in Birmingham is often blamed on the invention of the ballpoint pen in 1938 by the Hungarian Laszlo Biro.

One improved version of the dip pen, known as the original &quot;ballpoint&quot;, was the addition of a curved point (instead of a sharp point) which allows the user to have slightly more control on upward and sideways strokes. This feature, however, produces a thicker line rather than the sharp line produced by a sharp point.

== Pen makers ==
The following is a list of some of the most prominent dip pen manufacturers (in past and present times):

==Uses==

Dip pens continued in use in schools into the 1950s and 1960s, mainly on grounds of cost, since fountain pens were expensive to buy. Even when ballpoint pens became cheaply available, some schools banned their use, perhaps because writing with a dip pen had to be done with greater care. School desks were made with a socket for a small ceramic inkwell which had to be refilled on a daily basis, a task often delegated to one of the pupils.

Dip pens are rarely used now for regular writing, most commonly having been replaced by fountain pens, rollerball pens, or ballpoint pens. However, dip pens are still appreciated by artists, as they can make great differences between thick and thin lines, and generally write more smoothly than other types of pens. Dip pens are also preferred by calligraphers for fine writing. Dip pens are still in use for nib paintings, mostly round tip ones with a slit in the centre.

Although most of the factories ceased manufacturing dip pens, some companies are still active, such as Speedball, Brause (currently owned by French company Exacompta Clairefontaine), William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott&#x27;s.

<text>Hubert Horatio &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey III (born June 26, 1942) is an American retired politician who served as attorney general of the state of Minnesota (1983–1999) and State Senator (1973–1983). Humphrey led the Office of Older Americans as the assistant director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

A Democrat, Humphrey is a son of Vice President Hubert Humphrey and U.S. Senator Muriel Humphrey. He was the Democratic nominee for governor in the hotly contested three-way election of 1998.

==Early life==
Hubert Horatio Humphrey III was born on June 26, 1942, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Humphrey graduated from American University, where he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi, Beta Chi chapter, and is a graduate of the University of Minnesota Law School.

==Political career==
Humphrey was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1972 and served as a state senator from 1973 to 1983. He was elected Minnesota Attorney General in 1982, one of the DFL Party&#x27;s most popular candidates ever in terms of popular vote. He served in the office for four consecutive terms, from 1983 to 1999.

On January 13, 1978, his father died of bladder cancer at the age of 66.

In 1988, he ran for the same U.S. Senate seat that his father and his mother previously held, but was defeated by incumbent Independent-Republican Senator David Durenberger. After this loss he served as president of the National Association of Attorneys General, and in 1996 he was state chair of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s reelection campaign.

By 1998, he was again encouraged to run for higher office, and entered the DFL gubernatorial primary, winning handily in a crowded field (which included another scion of an eminent Minnesota political family, Ted Mondale). In the general election, both Humphrey and Republican candidate Norm Coleman lost to the third-party candidacy of Jesse Ventura in a tumultuous race.
On September 20, his mother died at the age of 86.

==Political legacy==
Humphrey was an enthusiastic successor of his father&#x27;s New Deal-inspired political philosophy, and throughout his career he remained devoted to traditional progressive ideals as well as their more modern manifestations: &quot;If you think that being too liberal means raising the minimum wage, advocating health care for everyone, protecting the environment, taking on the tobacco industry, enacting campaign finance reform, and putting more cops on the streets, then guess what? That&#x27;s what Minnesotans want.&quot; One of his most passionately held principles was his opposition to tobacco and its powerful political lobby: in 1999, the World Health Organization awarded him the Director-General&#x27;s Prize for outstanding global contribution to tobacco control.

==Personal life==
While a student at American University, Humphrey met Nancy Lee Jeffery, the daughter of a U.S. Navy captain. The two were married while spending the summer of 1963 in Europe. The Humphreys are the parents of three children, including Hubert H. &quot;Buck&quot; Humphrey IV, who ran for Minnesota Secretary of State in 2002, losing by three percentage points to Republican nominee Mary Kiffmeyer.

Humphrey was a senior fellow at the University of Minnesota, where he taught public health policy and law, and was also Senior Vice President at Tunheim Partners, a Minnesota-based communications and public affairs firm. Beginning in 2004, Humphrey served as the president of the Minnesota chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), and later was a member of the Board of Directors of the National AARP. In October 2011, Humphrey was appointed the assistant director of the Office of Older Americans at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

<text>Indigo Girls is the second studio album and first major label release by American folk rock duo the Indigo Girls. It was originally released in 1989 by Epic Records, and reissued and remastered in 2000 with two bonus tracks.

Upon its release, the album received mostly positive reviews from critics, went gold after six months and eventually went platinum. The duo was nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy (losing to Milli Vanilli, who later vacated the award), and won one for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.

Michael Stipe sang on &quot;Kid Fears&quot;, and the other members of R.E.M. performed on &quot;Tried to Be True&quot;. In addition, the Irish band Hothouse Flowers contributed background vocals on several tracks, notably &quot;Closer to Fine&quot;.

<doc id="238978" wikidata="Q845281" url="?curid=238978" title="Pyromania (album)">
<text>Pyromania is the third studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 20 January 1983 through Vertigo Records in UK and Europe and through Mercury Records in the US. The first album to feature guitarist Phil Collen who replaced founding member Pete Willis, &quot;Pyromania&quot; was produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. The album was a shift away from the band&#x27;s traditional heavy metal roots toward a more radio-friendly sound, finding massive mainstream success. &quot;Pyromania&quot; charted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 4 on the Canadian RPM Album chart and No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart. Selling over ten million copies in the US, it has been certified diamond by the RIAA.

==Recording==
The album followed a relatively unconventional method of recording: the bass parts followed by guitars were recorded to a click track provided by a Linn LM-1 drum machine, with the drums being added last in the process. This gave the flexibility to re-record and re-write parts of a song as they went along in the studio. The album was partially recorded with original guitarist Pete Willis, whose rhythm guitar tracks appear on all songs. On 11 July 1982, Willis was fired for alcohol abuse and replaced by guitarist Phil Collen, who contributed solos and guitar parts not yet recorded by Willis. &quot;I had all the fun stuff, none of the heavy lifting...&quot; Collen remembered. &quot;Pete and Steve [Clark] had done these amazing rhythm guitar beds, and it was a joy to whizz around and play solos over the top... Mutt [Lange] was going, &#x27;Just have fun: be a lead guitarist, go nuts. On the original LP release, Willis is visible in the background of the photograph of singer Joe Elliott, while Collen has his own photo as a new full-time member.

The album can be seen as a transitional one between the heavy metal sound of Leppard&#x27;s first two albums and the radio-friendly direction of later releases. It featured rockers such as &quot;Rock! Rock! (Till You Drop)&quot;, &quot;Stagefright&quot; and &quot;Die Hard the Hunter&quot; as well as the Top 40 hits &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot;.

== Release ==
With its melodic hooks and heavy MTV exposure, &quot;Pyromania&quot; became a massive success, and was a major catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement. The album sold six million copies in the US in its original release (about 100,000 copies per week for much of the year). It has since sold over ten million there and been certified diamond. In 1989, it was re-released by audio fidelity company Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs as part of their Ultradisc series.

&quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot; became top 40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, with &quot;Photograph&quot; peaking at No. 13 and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; at No. 16. &quot;Photograph&quot; (6 weeks) and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (1 week) both topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Tracks while &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Too Late for Love&quot; made the Top 10. &quot;Comin&#x27; Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Billy&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; and &quot;Action! Not Words&quot; made the top 40 of the Top Rock Tracks chart.

In Canada, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; charted highest at No. 24, while &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot; reached No. 32 and No. 39, respectively. At CHUM-AM in Toronto, one of Canada&#x27;s largest audience Top 40 stations at the time, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; never reached its Top 30 countdown; whereas 70 km away in Hamilton, at the CKOC-AM Top 40 radio station, it peaked at No. 2. It also topped the chart at many album-oriented rock stations such as Q107 in Toronto. &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; also charted the highest in the UK at No. 41 compared to No. 66 for &quot;Photograph&quot;.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Pyromania&quot; has received mostly positive reviews, being commonly considered, along with its follow-up, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s finest efforts to date, and one of &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange&#x27;s best productions. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Leppard for putting &quot;much-needed fire back on the radio&quot;, producing sophisticated music &quot;more emotionally charged than most of the synthesized disco that passes for &#x27;modern music&#x27;&quot; over the airwaves; adding that the band &quot;may not be highly original, but they mean what they play&quot; and &quot;Lange&#x27;s artfully busy mix&quot; easily covers up any fault.

AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey stated that &quot;Pyromania&quot; was &quot;where the band&#x27;s vision coalesced and gelled into something more.&quot; He described the songs as &quot;driven by catchy, shiny melodic hooks instead of heavy guitar riffs, although the latter do pop up once in a while&quot;, and added that &quot;transcendent hard rock perfection on &quot;Pyromania&quot; was surprisingly successful; their reach never exceeded their grasp, which makes the album an enduring (and massively influential) classic.&quot; &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; staff reviewer, equally enthusiastic, thoroughly recommended the album, &quot;filled with tight musicianship, infectious melodies and anthemic choruses&quot; &quot;to pretty much anyone... No matter what their taste in music is.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described the album as a “set of slick, hi-fi rockers ornamented with poppy synthesizers and towering vocal harmonies”, in which Def Leppard was “laying the groundwork for their world domination and inspiring a wave of copycats.&quot;

In contrast, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considers &quot;Pyromania&quot; the beginning of Leppard&#x27;s &quot;creative degeneration&quot; and criticizes Lange&#x27;s &quot;painstaking approach to detail&quot; that strips the album &quot;of its sweat and grit&quot;, making it sound &quot;phony&quot;.

&quot;I remember meeting Phil Lynott...&quot; recalled Joe Elliott. &quot;We&#x27;d delivered &quot;Pyromania&quot; and, with us sharing a label with Lizzy, he&#x27;d heard it. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, &#x27;I heard your album – it&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve split the band. I can&#x27;t compete with that.&#x27; &quot;The&quot; crappiest backhand compliment I&#x27;ve ever had. I wish I had been brave enough to shove him up against the wall and say, &#x27;Well, make a better album then!&#x27; But I just said, &#x27;Oh,&#x27; and scuttled off.&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked No. 384 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at No. 35 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Pyromania&quot; at No. 17 among the 50 Greatest Hair Metal Albums of All Time, and in 2017, the same magazine listed the album at No. 52 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

<text>The honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), also known as the thorny locust or thorny honeylocust, is a deciduous tree in the family Fabaceae, native to central North America where it is mostly found in the moist soil of river valleys. Honey locust trees are highly adaptable to different environments, and the species has been introduced worldwide. Outside its natural range it can be an aggressive, damaging invasive species.

==Description==
The honey locust, &quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot;, can reach a height of . They exhibit fast growth, but live a medium life span, as long as 125 years. The leaves are pinnately compound on older trees but bipinnately compound on vigorous young trees. The leaflets are long when compound and very slightly smaller when bipinnate. The leaves are green in summer and turn yellow in autumn in shades ranging from cream and tan to golden yellow. Honey locusts leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;).

The strongly scented flowers appear in late spring. Each cluster is a raceme 3–7 centimeters long with many tiny greenish-yellow to greenish-white flowers. The trees are polygamous-dioecious: many trees have only pollen producing flowers or seed producing flowers (strictly dioecious), but some will have both types of flowers in separate clusters, though usually one type will predominate.

The fruit of the honey locust is a flat pod (a legume) that matures in early autumn and is often twisted or curved. The average size of the pods is long and wide. Once ripe the pod will contain as many as twenty dark brown oval seeds, each about long. Surrounding the seeds is a soft, gooey pulp with a slightly sweet flavor. Pods may be produced from mid-September through mid-October in its native habitat.

Honey locusts commonly have thorns long growing out of the branches and trunk, some reaching lengths of ; these may be single, or branched into several points, and commonly form dense clusters. The thorns are modified branches and occasionally sprout leaves. Thornless forms are occasionally found growing wild and are commonly available as nursery plants.

==Taxonomy==
Honey locust was given its scientific name of &quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in his book Species Plantarum. Its taxonomic history is quite complex with a total of names that are taxonomic synonyms as of 2024 including five botanical forms, fourteen varieties, and twenty-two species. Included in its synonyms by Plants of the World Online, World Flora Online, and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database is the subordinate taxon &quot;Gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis&quot;. However, this scientific name is still found in gardening websites and books to distinguish thornless trees.

Hybridization of honey locust with water locust (&quot;Gleditsia aquatica&quot;) has been reported.

===Names===
The genus &quot;Gleditsia&quot; is named in honor of Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch, the director of what has become the Berlin Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum. The species name is derived from Greek and means &quot;three thorns&quot;. The common name most often used for the species is &quot;honey locust&quot;. This name comes from the slightly sweet pulp that surrounds the seeds in the tree&#x27;s pods and their resemblance to the pods of the carob or &quot;locust tree&quot; from the middle east. Honey locust is also used for the genus as a whole or for other species in it. The first recorded use of the name was in 1709 by John Lawson in his account &quot;A New Voyage to Carolina&quot;. In the late 1800s honey locust was sometimes used as an alternate name in localized areas for other species such as for mesquit (&quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;) in Texas and New Mexico, for black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;) in Minnesota, and for clammy locust (&quot;Robinia viscosa&quot;) in New York and New Jersey. Variants on this name include &quot;common honey locust&quot;, &quot;honeylocust&quot;, and &quot;thornless honey locust&quot;.

Though honey locust is the most commonly used name for the species in English, it has a variety of other names. Some of these many names include &quot;honey shucks locust&quot;, &quot;sweet bean tree&quot;, &quot;sweet locust&quot;, &quot;thorny locust&quot;, and &quot;green locust tree&quot;. In South Africa it is called &quot;driedoringboom&quot;, driedoring-gleditsia&quot;, soetpeulboom&quot;, &quot;springkaanboom&quot;, or &quot;leoka&quot;.

In the late 1800s it was known by additional local names including &quot;black locust&quot; (MS, TX, AR, KS, NB), &quot;three-thorned acacia&quot; (MA, RI, LA, TX, MI, NB, Onterio), &quot;thorntree&quot; (NY, IN, LA), &quot;thorny acacia&quot; (TN), and &quot;piquant amourette&quot; (LA).

==Range and habitat==
The native range of the honey locust is widely agreed to be from northern Mexico through the Gulf Coast of the United States, northwards into the Midwest, parts of the US East Coast, and the southernmost parts of Canada. In Canada it is a rare forest species found in southern Ontario near Lake Huron, Ontario, or Erie. However, Plants of the World Online (POWO) lists it as introduced to Ontario while NatureServe and World Plants list it as native. It is listed as native to Nova Scotia by World Plants, but as introduced by POWO and not recorded by NatureServe. It is also recorded by NatureServe as growing as an introduced plant on Prince Edward Island.

In the midwest it grows in very widely in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri and is much rarer and scattered in Wisconsin and Minnesota, North Dakota. In Kansas it grows naturally in the eastern half of the state, and at the eastern and northern edge of Nebraska along the Missouri River, a small area of South Dakota, and the southern portion of Michigan.

In the eastern United States honey locust trees are regarded as native to Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York. Though the botanist Elbert Luther Little showed the range as extending naturally into Pennsylvania, NatureServe list it as introduced to that state. They likewise list it as introduced to Maine, Vermont, and New Jersey, while both POWO and World Plants list it as native to all of them.

In the American South, only NatureServe lists it as introduced to Delaware and the District of Columbia, while World Plants lists it as native to both. Plants of the World Online does not list it as growing wild in Washington, D.C. It is listed as growing natively through all the rest of the south, though Elbert Luther Little&#x27;s range map does not show it growing east of the Appalachian Mountains. Also, in Florida it is only shown as growing in a few isolated areas of the Florida Panhandle.

To the west it grows throughout eastern Texas and Oklahoma, while becoming scattered and isolated to the west. It is listed as introduced to New Mexico by POWO, but native in Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. Contradicting this, NatureServe list it as native to New Mexico, while introduced in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. Only World Plants lists it as native to many western states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.

In Mexico it grows in four states; Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, and Tamaulipas. Trees in Mexico are much smaller than those in the center of its range, reaching a maximum size of just and less than in some populations. They are also found in isolated locations growing on south facing slopes at elevations of .

Worldwide it has become established outside of cultivation in Europe, southern Asia, Australia, southern Africa, and in Argentina and Uruguay.

In its native range the honey locust grows in humid or subhumid climates. It grows best in soils that are organically rich and moist, but well-drained. However, it is tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions. It is intolerant of shade and is a minor component of forests.

==Ecology==
The sweet pulp in honey locust seed pods is attractive as a food for many animals including cattle, deer, rabbits, squirrels, and hares. White-tailed deer are known to disperse the seeds of honey locust by consuming the pods and passing the seeds in their dung. It is likely that deer move the seeds over one kilometer from where they are eaten, though probably not more than three kilometers and aid the tree in reaching new habitats and maintaining its wild population even in fragmented habitats. The seeds themselves are consumed by crows in the winter.

The size and number of thorns on the honey locust are thought to have evolved to protect the trees from browsing Pleistocene megafauna, including mastodons, which may also have been involved in seed dispersal.

The seeds of the honey locust are resistant to sprouting without damage to the seed coat. In controlled experiments only 5% of the seeds sprout without treatment. In comparison, seeds soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid for one and a half hours increased germination to 68% and two and a half hours increases it to 98%.

The honey locust moth (&quot;Syssphinx bicolor&quot;) feeds on honey locust and Kentucky coffee trees while a caterpillar. The first brood of the moths emerge from hibernation in the ground in the late spring. The green larvae have several horns on the backs and reach full size in about three weeks. When they reach full size they pupate in the soil. There may be two or three broods in a year.

Honey locust trees are a frequent host for the parasitic plant American mistletoe (&quot;Phoradendron leucarpum&quot;), but usually is not infected by large numbers of them and without suffering obvious damage.

===Invasiveness===
Honey locust is one of the most successful of the trees and shrubs in the pea family at invading new habitats worldwide. The species is a major invasive environmental and economic weed in agricultural regions of Australia. The plant forms thickets and destroys the pasture required for livestock to survive. The thickets choke waterways and prevent both domestic and native animals from drinking and also harbour vermin. The spines cause damage to both people and domestic and native wildlife and puncture vehicle tires. In Argentina the trees were introduced in the early 1800s to be used as a landscape ornamental, as a forest tree, and in windbreaks. It escaped from cultivation and has invaded native grasslands, subtropical montane forest (yungas), and woodlands of the Gran Chaco. In much of the Midwest of the United States the honey locust is also considered a weed tree and a pest that establishes itself in farm fields. In other regions of the world, ranchers and farmers who employ monocropping deem honey locust a nuisance weed; its fast growth allows it to out-compete grasses and other crops.

==Notable trees==
The oldest known tree is one growing in the Kozia Brana Cemetery in Bratislava, Slovakia. It was planted sometime between 1773 and 1793, making it approximately years old. When last measured in 2021 it had a diameter of and a height of .

The largest recorded in the American National Register of Champion Trees is one growing in Botetourt County, Virginia. It was last reported as healthy in 2019. It has a diameter at breast height of about , a height of , and a crown spread of .

==Cultivation==
Due to the honey locust&#x27;s tolerance of urban problems such as salt spray, compacted soils, poor aeration, constrained planting areas, and pollution, it has been widely planted in cities. In addition it will adapt to relatively dry conditions and either alkaline or acidic soils. Once established it is also drought tolerant, though it grows best with good moisture. It was very widely planted as a replacement for American elm trees killed by Dutch elm disease, becoming somewhat overplanted in 1970s.

However, due to its wide planting many problems have been discovered. Like maples and oaks, honey locust is particularly vulnerable to Ganoderma root rots, a fungal infection of the roots and lower trunk of the tree. Three insects are the main pests that attack the honey locusts in urban areas, honeylocust plant bug (&quot;Blepharidopterus chlorionis&quot;), mimosa webworm (&quot;Homadaula anisocentra&quot;), and honeylocust spider mite (&quot;Platytetranychus multidigituli&quot;). Thornless cultivars are especially subsceptable to damage by the Asian mimosa webworm. Though healthy trees are able to withstand one or two years of complete defoliation, stressed trees may be killed. The number of honey locust trees within increases attacks by the webworms as does the amount of impermeable hardscape surfaces out to from a tree.

===Cultivars===
Almost all cultivated varieties do not have thorns.

====&#x27;Beatrice&#x27;====
A cultivar that has been nearly or wholy unavailable in the plant trade since the 1980s. It was sourced from a then 50-year-old tree in Beatrice, Nebraska by the Inter-State Nursery of Hamburg, Iowa in 1955. This cultivar is shaped similarly to an American elm with a wide, spreading top and is also thornless and nearly pod free.

====&#x27;Continental&#x27;====
The &#x27;Continental&#x27; cultivar has especially large leaves of a darker blue-green shade during the summer. It is a large and vigorous selection with a narrow crown that is thornless and nearly seedless. It was introduced to plant commerce by Princeton Nursery of New Jersey in 1973 and patented in 1958.

====&#x27;Elegantissima&#x27;====
Also known as &#x27;Compacta&#x27;, &quot;Gleditsia sinensis&quot; &#x27;Inermis&#x27;, &quot;Gleditsia aquatica&quot; &#x27;Elegantissima&#x27;, &#x27;Globe Honey Locust&#x27; and &#x27;Bushy Honey Locust&#x27;, this cultivar had become very rare by 1996. It is a bushy tree with smaller leaflets with slow growth, only reaching about when 25 years old. It has a narrow vase shaped crown and is thornless. It is propagated on its own roots, from ground budding, and also top grafted. It was raised by the nurseryman Charles Breton of Orléans in France around 1880. It has, in some cases, reached large sizes of or .

====&#x27;Emerald Kascade&#x27;====
This cultivar has a weeping form, with branches that cascade downward. Because it does not produce a leader it must be grafted onto a standard, an upright section of trunk, or be staked. It is reported to be both thornless and fruitless. The leaves are dark green in the summer and bright yellow in the autumn. It was introduced to the horticultural trade by the Duncan &amp; Davies nursery in New Zealand in 1992. It is hardy to USDA zone 3. It is alternatively spelled &#x27;Emerald Cascade&#x27; by some sources.

====&#x27;Imperial&#x27;====
It is a popular cultivar that grows to only about in height. It is of very regular growth habit with branches that emerge at right angles to the trunk and a symmetrical arrangement around it. It is noted for its rounded crown. Due to the lower emergence of main branches it requires significant amounts of pruning to be used as a street tree where clearance above vehicles is required. It is used where a somewhat smaller shade tree is required.

====&#x27;Shademaster&#x27;====
This is a very popular cultivar of the honey locust. Trees have a straight trunk and branches that grow outward and then curve upward to create a symmetrical crown. Very often, without trimming, they will have three or four leaders. At 15 years of age the top of the tree is relatively flat, creating a vase like shape. Compared with &#x27;Skyline&#x27; it has a finer branch structure and wider angles where branches attach to the trunk. Sources disagree on the maximum height obtained by this cultivar, Purdue lists it as while the University of Florida lists it as . Trees will produces a few pods when mature and are thornless with dark green foliage in summer.

====&#x27;Skyline&#x27;====
This is a very common cultivar that has a more pyramidal or slightly squared shape to its canopy. Full grown trees may reach a height of or more. Of five standard cultivars including &#x27;Imperial, &#x27;Moraine&#x27;, &#x27;Shademaster&#x27;, and &#x27;Sunburst&#x27; it showed the greatest height after 15 years of growth. Trees tend to have one or two larger leaders and evenly spaced branches with somewhat narrower crotch angles. Trees can be trimmed to develop one strong central leader with little pruning, because of this lower branches can be removed without distoring the even shape of the crown. This habits make it appropriate as a street tree where lower branches must be removed. The leaflets have a redish to bronze tone when emerging and a dark green and leathery appearance for most of the season. It was introduced by the Cole Nursery in Painesville, Ohio in 1957.

== Uses ==

=== Food ===
The pulp on the inside of the pods is edible (unlike the black locust, which is toxic) and consumed by wildlife and livestock.

Despite its name, the honey locust is not a significant honey plant. The name derives from the sweet taste of the legume pulp, which was used for food and traditional medicine by Native American people, and can also be used to make tea. The long pods, which eventually dry and ripen to brown or maroon, are surrounded in a tough, leathery skin that adheres strongly to the pulp within. The pulp—bright green in unripe pods—is strongly sweet, crisp and succulent in ripe pods. Dark brown tannin-rich beans are found in slots within the pulp. Likewise, its edible seed has nutritional potential, and the flour made from its cotyledons constitutes a food source with various potential uses for pastry and bakery, among other gastronomic uses.

===Timber===

Honey locusts produce a high quality, durable wood that polishes well, but the tree does not grow in sufficient numbers to support a bulk industry. However, a niche market exists for honey locust furniture. It is also used for posts and rails because of the dense, rot-resistant nature of the wood. The heartwood of honey locust is reddish brown while the sapwood is pale yellow. It is strong, but has a coarse grain texture.

== Nitrogen fixation ==
The ability of &quot;Gleditsia&quot; to fix nitrogen is disputed. Many scientific sources state that &quot;Gleditsia&quot; does not fix nitrogen. Some support this statement with the fact that &quot;Gleditsia&quot; does not form root nodules with symbiotic bacteria, the assumption being that without nodulation, no nitrogen fixation can occur. In contrast, many popular sources, permaculture publications in particular, claim that &quot;Gleditsia&quot; does fix nitrogen but by some other mechanism.

There are anatomical, ecological, and taxonomic indications of nitrogen fixation in non-nodulating legumes. Both nodulating and non-nodulating species have been observed to grow well in nitrogen-poor soil with non-nodulating legumes even dominating some sites. The litter and seeds of non-nodulating species contain levels of nitrogen higher than non-legumes and sometimes even higher than nodulating legumes growing on the same site. How this happens is not yet well understood but there have been some observations of nitrogenase activity in non-nodulating leguminous plants, including honey locust. Electron microscopy indicates the presence of clusters around the inner cortex of roots, just outside the xylem, that resemble colonies of rhizobial bacterioids. These may well constitute the evolutionary precursors in legumes for nitrogen fixation through nodulation. It is not known whether the non-nodulating nitrogen fixation, if it exists, benefits neighboring plants as is said to be the case with nodulating legumes.

==Research==
In research using databases, more than 60 phytochemicals were identified from honey locust, including polyphenols, triterpenes, sterols, and saponins, with in vitro studies assessing for possible biological activity.

<doc id="238982" wikidata="Q478266" url="?curid=238982" title="The Real Thing (Faith No More album)">
<text>The Real Thing is the third studio album by American rock band Faith No More, released on June 20, 1989, by Slash and Reprise Records. It is the first album to feature singer Mike Patton, following the dismissal of previous vocalist Chuck Mosley. On this album, Faith No More continued to advance their sound range, combining alternative metal, funk metal, and rap metal.

==Background==
Faith No More underwent several lineup changes before recording their first album, &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, released in 1985 and distributed through San Francisco-based label Mordam Records. On the original vinyl release, the band is credited as &quot;Faith. No More&quot; on the album&#x27;s liner notes, back cover, and on the record itself. Within a year the band signed up with Slash Records. The debut album&#x27;s title track &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; was later re-recorded, for their follow-up album &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot; in 1987, and released as their first single. Membership remained stable until vocalist Chuck Mosley was replaced by Mike Patton in 1988.

===Production===
The writing for the majority of the music for &quot;The Real Thing&quot; took place after the tour for &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;. A demo version of &quot;The Morning After&quot;, under the moniker &quot;New Improved Song&quot;, with alternate lyrics written and sung by Chuck Mosley was released on the &quot;Sounds·Waves 2&quot; extended play with the &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. &quot;Surprise! You&#x27;re Dead!&quot; was composed by Jim Martin in the 1970s, while he was guitarist for Agents of Misfortune, which also featured Cliff Burton in their line up. The recording of the song took place in December 1988 after Chuck Mosley was fired from the band, and was completed prior to the hiring of Mike Patton, who then wrote all the lyrics for the songs, and recorded them the following month over the music.

Producer Matt Wallace said:
All the music was written before Mike joined the band, which had gotten rid of the original singer, Chuck Mosley, and the tracks were either in preproduction or being recorded when Mike came in. And when he&#x27;d ask if he could make a section longer or different, the band would say &quot;No, this is it, so you have to do it this way&quot;. So Mike Patton wrote every lyric and melody to that record over a ten to twelve day period. And it is stunning, because he was nineteen or twenty, and pulled all that out of the air, and put together an incredible record. The only thing we did was spend a couple of days at this coffee shop in San Francisco, because a lot of the songs were really dark and heavy lyrically, crazily so, and I would sit there and go, &quot;Mike, these are some great lyrics, but we need to at least use some metaphor, or couch some of the concepts, but I think you&#x27;ve got some great ideas here&quot;. In the end, they really pulled some great songs together.

The recording sessions yielded several songs that did not appear on the album. Two of them, &quot;The Grade&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;, later appeared on the singles and on the UK edition of &quot;Live at the Brixton Academy&quot;. A third song, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, was later re-recorded with different lyrics as &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; for the soundtrack to the film that also starred a cameo appearance from guitarist Jim Martin, &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;. The original version was released on &quot;Flexible Fiend 3&quot; with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine issue 258 and on &quot;The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection&quot;, the 2009 greatest hits compilation released to coincide with the band&#x27;s reunion tour.

==Touring and support==
===Tours===

The tour in support of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; was the first Faith No More tour conducted with Mike Patton. The band had begun to be marketed as metal by the media after the album&#x27;s release, and they were now primarily playing with other bands from the heavy metal genre. Notable artists Faith No More performed with during the touring cycle include Metallica, Billy Idol, Soundgarden, Voivod, Sacred Reich, Forbidden, Primus, Babes in Toyland and Poison. They managed to attract controversy for mocking the party/sex-filled lifestyles of glam metal tourmates such as Poison at several shows in Europe during 1990. The second show of the tour was filmed for the music video to &quot;From out of Nowhere&quot; in the I-Beam nightclub. During the show, Patton had a beer bottle smashed over his right hand, causing lacerations to some tendons. He regained use of his hand after it healed, but he no longer has feeling in it. The band&#x27;s August, 28 1990 concert at Burgherrenhalle in Kaiserslautern, Germany is notable for featuring the only ever performance of the song &quot;Faster Disco&quot; with Patton on vocals. The concert also featured several other Chuck Mosley-era songs which have almost never been performed live with Patton, including &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot; and &quot;The Jungle&quot;. At that time, the band&#x27;s first independent album &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; was not in circulation. &quot;As the Worm Turns&quot; and &quot;Why Do You Bother&quot; were the only songs from the album to be regularly worked into the band&#x27;s setlists on the tour (aside from the title track, which was re-recorded for their major label debut &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;). Regarding the decision to still perform material from &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, Gould said to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in May 1990 that, &quot;we&#x27;d feel weird cutting that part of ourselves off. We&#x27;d be ignoring a root of the tree, if you will.&quot; During the tour, they covered parts of the Milli Vanilli songs &quot;Girl I&#x27;m Gonna Miss You&quot; and &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Forget my Number&quot;. Faith No More had earlier met Milli Vanilli at the album launch party for &quot;The Real Thing&quot; in mid-1989. Faith No More greeted Milli Vanilli at the launch party and told them that they were fans, but Milli Vanilli were unaware of who Faith No More were at that time.

Touring in support of the album lasted from 1989 to 1991. Due to their small catalog at the time, the band eventually grew tired of playing songs from &quot;The Real Thing&quot; towards the end of the tour. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the change in sound on their next album &quot;Angel Dust&quot;.

===Singles===

The first single to be released from the album was &quot;From Out of Nowhere&quot; on August 30, 1989, which failed to make the UK Singles Chart. It was re-released on April 2, 1990, and made number twenty-three on the UK Singles Chart. In between these releases was &quot;Epic&quot; on January 30, 1990, the music video for which received extensive airplay on MTV throughout the year, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists for a slow motion shot of a fish flopping out of water. &quot;Falling to Pieces&quot; then saw release on July 2, 1990, and made it to number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 before the reissue of &quot;Epic&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first number one hit single, on the ARIA Charts, as well their only top ten single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it reached ninth position.

&quot;Surprise! You&#x27;re Dead!&quot; had a music video produced for it, directed by bassist Billy Gould, featuring footage shot in Chile during a South American tour in 1991. However, the song never saw release as an official single, and the video was not released until its appearance on &quot;Video Croissant&quot;. &quot;Edge of the World&quot; saw limited release as a two track promo single in Brazil on CD and 12&quot; vinyl, with the album version as track one and the Brixton Academy live version as the second track, in a yellow slipcase with basic black text.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Real Thing&quot; is one of Faith No More&#x27;s most successful albums to date. It is now considered a classic metal album by fans and critics alike. Although released in mid-1989, &quot;The Real Thing&quot; did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until February 1990, after the release of the second single from the album, &quot;Epic&quot;. The album eventually peaked at number eleven on the chart in October 1990, following the reissue of &quot;Epic&quot; almost a year and half after the initial release of the album. It was eventually certified platinum in U.S. and Canada as well as being certified Silver in the United Kingdom.

Jonathan Gold, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, referred to Faith No More as &quot;the kings of neo metal&quot; in 1990, while &quot;The Real Thing&quot; had &quot;been on the sales charts for eight months&quot;, writing:
Faith No More is a band with a punk-rock bassist, a classically trained keyboardist, a punk-funk singer and a drummer who would probably rather be playing Ghanaian tribal music, which goes a long way toward explaining the band&#x27;s diversity. And, of course, there&#x27;s heavy-metal Jim. Call what they do neo-metal.

The genre of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; has been variously described as having a predominant &quot;funk-metal groove&quot; by Chris Morris for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1992 and containing &quot;funk, metal, traditional rock, instrumental, and even a little &#x27;easy listening by Travis Lowell for &quot;Toxic Universe&quot; in 2001.

Tom Breihan wrote for &quot;Stereogum&quot; in 2012 that the album
gets a ton of credit and blame for helping to popularize rap-metal, but it was a lot more than that ... veered from quasi-Middle-Eastern orchestral churn (&quot;Woodpecker From Mars&quot;) to dementedly creepy lounge-singer irony (&quot;Edge Of The World&quot;) to all-out blitzkrieg (&quot;Surprise! You&#x27;re Dead&quot;), but the whole thing felt cohesive because the band remained in a thunderous groove throughout and because they always tossed in triumphant hooks like the synth-line on &quot;Falling To Pieces.&quot;

Following the 2015 remastered re-release of the album, several sources retrospectively reviewed it; Brandon Geist for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that it was then &quot;considered to be an alterna-metal classic&quot;, and Joseph Schafer for &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked it as the second best Faith No More album, commenting that it was &quot;more cohesive [and] lovable&quot; than &quot;Angel Dust&quot;. They called it &quot;sublime funk metal&quot; and wrote that &quot;the amount of diversity Faith No More crammed into 1989&#x27;s The Real Thing seemed to be a middle finger to arena rock&quot;. Stuart Berman for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it had a &quot;reputation as an alt-rock trailblazer&quot; and &quot;connection to a long-past funk-metal zeitgeist&quot; continuing to state that the album track &quot;Epic&quot; &quot;was perfectly timed to satiate the then-burgeoning appetite for rap-rock&quot;.

Chris Conaton for &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote in 2015 that the album &quot;made a minor splash in the alternative metal community&quot; and featured &quot;a fascinating and entertaining smorgasbord of styles&quot;, and Ian Gittins wrote in their book &quot;The Periodic Table of Heavy Rock&quot;:when Mike Patton replaced [Chuck Mosley] ... FNM had all the standard hard-rock assault weapons of seizure-like rhythms, chugging guitar detonations and seismic drumming in their arsenal, but accessorized them with wildly eclectic influences from hip hop to synth pop and a brutally sarcastic sense of black humour.

==Legacy==
The album was highly praised by The Dillinger Escape Plan frontman Greg Puciato as well as most members of Korn, including Jonathan Davis, Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch and James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer.

&quot;Epic&quot; was ranked number thirty on VH1&#x27;s 40 Greatest Metal Songs, and number sixty-seven on their 100 Greatest One-hit Wonders list.

<doc id="238988" wikidata="Q7188080" url="?curid=238988" title="Phrasing (DJ)">
<text>In DJing, phrasing, also called stage matching, refers to alignment of phrases of two tracks in a mix. This allows the transition between the tracks to be done without breaking the musical structure.

Phrasing is an aspect of beatmixing, not a separate technique. Because most music has a 4/4 time signature and a simple structure of 16-bar phrases, to align the phrases of two tracks it is often enough to start the track to be mixed in at a phrase boundary in the track currently playing. Careful phrasing can produce a seamless mix by making the breaks in two tracks coincide, or aligning the break in one track with the start of the beat in the other.

<doc id="238996" wikidata="Q2144598" url="?curid=238996" title="Love Park">
<text>LOVE Park, officially known as John F. Kennedy Plaza, is a public park located in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The park is across from the Philadelphia City Hall and serves as a visual terminus for the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The park is nicknamed LOVE Park for its reproduction of Robert Indiana&#x27;s 1970 &quot;LOVE&quot; sculpture which overlooks the plaza, one of three located in Philadelphia.

Despite municipal bans and renovations designed to limit the activity, LOVE Park became one of the most famous and recognizable skateboarding spots in the world in the 1990s and 2000s.

==History==
Former Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon and architect Vincent G. Kling planned and designed the original LOVE Park. The park was first proposed as part of Bacon’s Cornell architecture thesis in 1932 as a feature of a new city plan for Philadelphia. Once Bacon became Executive Director of the City Planning Commission, the architectural design of the park itself was completed by Kling.

The park was built in 1965 and covered an underground parking garage. The main feature of the plaza became a centrally-located single spout fountain added in 1969. The city&#x27;s visitor center (built in 1960, before LOVE Park) was closed for five years, but re-opened in 2006 as The Fairmount Park Welcome Center. The park was dedicated in 1967 as John F. Kennedy Plaza after President John F. Kennedy.

A &quot;LOVE&quot; sculpture, designed by Robert Indiana, was first placed in the plaza in 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial celebration. The sculpture was removed in 1978 after the celebration ended. However, the chairman of Philadelphia Art Commission, Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., was able to purchase the sculpture and to have it permanently placed it in the plaza during that year.

From 2016 to 2018, a major reconstruction project converted the largely hardscaped plaza into a greener space that contains large and small lawns for casual uses, two gardens and 2 green stormwater basins with tropical and native plantings, an open viewshed of City Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, new cafe seating, and daily recreational games. A redesigned fountain features a large central jet and a &quot;bird&#x27;s nest&quot; of smaller jets with programmable up-lighting within a large oval paved area.

==Skateboarding==
Skateboarders began skating LOVE Park in the 1980s. The first ban on skateboarding in the park was passed in 1984. In the early 1990s, during the administration of Mayor Ed Rendell, enforcement was ramped up and prioritized, with police giving $300 fines to skateboarders.

Despite the ban, throughout the 1990s skate videos and photographs featuring the park propelled it to becoming one of the most recognizable East Coast skateboarding locations. “Neither Vincent or I had the slightest premonition that our work would become world famous” Bacon said in 2004 regarding the fame skateboarding had brought the park. 

In 2000, LOVE Park was featured as a level in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2&quot;. 

In 2001, Mayor John F. Street’s administration announced plans to increase the level of policing and enforcement of the ban on skateboarding while simultaneously hosting the X-Games in 2001 and 2002, leading to criticism, protests, and discussion as to whether the city was wrongly wasting an asset by discouraging skateboarding in the park.

In early 2002, the city announced renovations that would intentionally destroy the skateable elements of the park. In October 2002, Bacon skateboarded across the park at age 92 in protest of both the renovations and the bans on skateboarding in an act of civil disobedience.

In 2004, DC Shoes offered to pay the city for the park’s upkeep if skateboarding would be allowed at the park, but the bans and renovations continued.

In February 2016, Mayor Jim Kenney temporarily lifted the ban on skateboarding for five days before the park was completely demolished and rebuilt, removing the iconic Fountain Gap and remaining skateable elements. 

In 2024, the city of Malmo, Sweden announced they had acquired the original granite used in the park and were rebuilding a portion of the original design intentionally to attract skateboarders. The park will be open in June of 2024.

<doc id="239002" wikidata="Q63928692" url="?curid=239002" title="BMW in Formula One">
<text>The German automobile manufacturer/brand BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s (often under Formula Two regulations), before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s. This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham, which resulted in the team&#x27;s chassis being powered by BMW engines from until , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW. BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier teams during this period, with various degrees of success. In , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines, which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge. Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for , rendering the M12/13 obsolete.

BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team, which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race début in the Williams FW22 in . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories, but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s. By , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated, and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright.

The BMW Sauber project lasted from until , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team. Two podium finishes in the first year were followed by a solid third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in (which became second when McLaren was disqualified). In , Robert Kubica won the team&#x27;s only race, the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, and led the Drivers&#x27; Championship at one point, but the team chose to focus on development of its 2009 car and slipped back in the standings by the end of the season. The 2009 season was a major disappointment as the F1.09 chassis proved uncompetitive. Combined with the global financial recession and the company&#x27;s frustration about the limitations of the contemporary technical regulations in developing technology relevant to road cars, BMW chose to withdraw from the sport, selling the team back to its founder, Peter Sauber.

==Entries in the 1950s and 1960s==

The early years of the post-war World Drivers&#x27; Championship saw private BMW racing cars, based on the pre-war BMW 328 chassis, entered in the 1952 and 1953 German Grands Prix. BMW-derived cars were also entered by the Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau (AFM) and Veritas companies in occasional races from to . The entries occurred during this period because the championship was effectively run to Formula Two regulations, allowing the BMW cars to take part. Amongst the modified 328s was one driven by an engine in the rear of the car (known as the &quot;Heck&quot;, the German automotive term for &quot;back&quot; or &quot;rear&quot;), a design feature which became standard in Formula One in the early 1960s after later success by the Cooper team.

In the 1960s, the Formula One German Grand Prix was often held concurrently with a Formula Two race on the same circuit, allowing BMW F2 cars to take part. In 1967, BMW entered Hubert Hahne in a Lola F2 chassis powered by an enlarged BMW engine which meant that it conformed with the Formula One regulations, while David Hobbs was entered by Lola in the same combination with the standard smaller BMW engine. For the 1968 race, Hahne returned with the previous year&#x27;s combination and finished tenth, BMW&#x27;s best result up to this point in its Formula One history. BMW then entered three of its own 269 F2 chassis for the 1969 race, for the trio of Hahne, Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester, but Mitter was fatally injured in a practice accident and the remainder of the team withdrew from the race.

==Engine supplier==

===Brabham, ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier (1982–1988)===


Following the commencement in of Renault&#x27;s Formula One project with a turbocharged engine and increasing success thereafter, BMW decided to develop its own turbo engine for the sport, a programme which it announced to the media in April 1980. The engine was based on the M10 unit, a four-cylinder, 1.5-litre, normally aspirated engine that had originally been designed in the late 1950s. Its racing derivative, the M12 had also been used in racing throughout the intervening period, winning races in Formula Two and other categories. In and , BMW provided a fleet of identical M1 cars for Formula One and other professional drivers to race in the BMW M1 Procar Championship, the rounds of which were held during Grand Prix race weekends, thus strengthening the marque&#x27;s ties with the sport. At the same time, Jochen Neerpasch oversaw the development by Paul Rosche of a prototype 1.4-litre turbo engine, which soon developed 600 bhp at a pressure of 2.8 bar. It was equipped with a single Kühnle, Kopp &amp; Kausch (KKK) turbocharger and Bosch electronics, including fuel injection. This engine formed the basis of the M12/13 design, the race unit that BMW ultimately supplied to five teams from 1982 to 1988.

Initial discussions were held with double World Champion Niki Lauda and McLaren on the subject of a 1980 campaign, but the BMW board denied Neerpasch&#x27;s request for the programme. Neerpasch then left his position to join the French Talbot marque, which was also planning to enter Formula One, in this case with the Ligier team. Neerpasch had arranged the sale of Rosche&#x27;s M12/13 engine to Talbot, but Rosche and Neerpasch&#x27;s successor, Dieter Stappert, successfully protested to their board that such an undertaking deserved full works commitment, particularly as the fact that M12/13 was derived from a production road car engine meant that potential success could be extremely valuable to BMW from a marketing and sales point of view. BMW thus negotiated an exclusive supply of M12/13 engines to the Brabham team.

Testing of the M12/13 got underway in late 1980 with a Brabham BT49 chassis converted to accept the engine. The team&#x27;s designer, Gordon Murray, designed a new car, the BT50 for the engine, but it was not completed until well into the season. The BT50 featured a longer wheelbase and a larger fuel cell than the BT49 to accommodate the requirements of the more powerful turbo engine, and was also one of the first Formula One cars to feature onboard telemetry as a means of monitoring the engine&#x27;s fuel injection. The team&#x27;s lead driver, Nelson Piquet, tested the BT50 throughout 1981, but the car proved chronically unreliable until Bosch introduced a digital electronic management system at the end of the year, which immediately improved the situation. The BT50 made a solitary race weekend appearance at the 1981 British Grand Prix, where Piquet set a qualifying time 0.7 seconds slower than his effort in the Cosworth DFV-powered BT49. The BT50 handled poorly but recorded through the speed trap, some faster than the BT49. Meanwhile, Brabham won the Drivers&#x27; Championship with Piquet, who drove the BT49 throughout the season.

Brabham began the 1982 season with two BMW-powered BT50 chassis at the South African Grand Prix, where Piquet and Patrese qualified second and fourth respectively, but retired early in the race. Team principal Bernie Ecclestone was under pressure from the team&#x27;s title sponsor, Parmalat, to defend Piquet&#x27;s championship, and opted to race with the Cosworth-powered BT49 chassis at the Brazilian Grand Prix, which Piquet won but was later disqualified for circumventing the minimum weight limit by running &quot;water-cooled brakes&quot;. Both drivers also raced the BT49 at the Long Beach Grand Prix, and the team boycotted the San Marino Grand Prix as part of the ongoing FISA–FOCA war. For the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet and Patrese switched back to the BT50, but Piquet finished three laps behind the winner and Patrese retired. As the relationship between Brabham, BMW and Parmalat became strained, Ecclestone was forced to compromise, with Piquet continuing development of the BT50 whilst Patrese raced with the Cosworth chassis. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Patrese won, whilst Piquet was more than two seconds slower in qualifying and retired from the race. The nadir of BMW&#x27;s Formula One involvement thus far came at the Detroit Grand Prix, where engine reliability problems prevented Piquet from qualifying.

BMW&#x27;s fortunes suddenly improved, however, at the next race in Canada, where the cool conditions suited the turbocharged engines and allowed Piquet to lead home Patrese (still in the BT49), to record BMW&#x27;s first Formula One victory. For the remainder of the season, both drivers raced with the BT50, and used Murray&#x27;s radical strategy of a planned pit stop for refuelling midway through the race to run at the front of the field on numerous occasions. The car was still unreliable, though, restricting Piquet and Patrese to just four further finishes before the end of the season. The BMW engine&#x27;s competitiveness was shown by the fact that Piquet retired from the lead of the British, French and German Grands Prix, whilst Patrese likewise retired from the lead of the Austrian Grand Prix. Patrese also secured BMW&#x27;s first fastest lap at the French Grand Prix, whilst Piquet took the marque&#x27;s maiden pole position at the Austrian race.

In , the improved reliability of the BMW engine in the new BT52 allowed Piquet to win the Drivers&#x27; Championship, after overhauling Alain Prost (Renault) in the points standings. Brabham also finished third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, although Patrese&#x27;s lack of consistency in the second car prevented the team challenging for this title. Piquet won three races and Patrese won the season finale. BMW also began supplying its engines to the German ATS team this season, but sole driver Manfred Winkelhock was unable to score any points.

For , BMW expanded to three teams by also supplying the M12/13 to Arrows. The team&#x27;s A7 chassis was not ready at the beginning of the season, and drivers Marc Surer and Thierry Boutsen drove the Cosworth-engined A6 on ten out of 32 entries, but scored three points with BMW engines later in the year. ATS again failed to score with either Winkelhock or Gerhard Berger, and withdrew from the sport at the end of the season. At the front of the field, Piquet was unable to defend his title, which was dominated by the two McLaren drivers, Niki Lauda and Prost. Piquet took nine pole positions during the season, but retired from the same number of races, and the McLarens were usually faster in race conditions, although he did win the Canadian and Detroit Grands Prix. The second Brabham was filled in most races by Teo Fabi, who attempted to compete in a full season of IndyCars, but committed to F1 full-time part-way through the year. Due to his American commitments he missed three races, in which he was substituted by his brother, Corrado. Winkelhock also raced for the team in the final race of the season after the Fabis&#x27; father died shortly before the event.

In , Brabham switched to Pirelli tyres, which had previously not been very competitive against the established Goodyear and Michelin suppliers, in the hope that the Italian company could provide bespoke tyres that would especially suit the new BT54 chassis. This proved to be a misjudgement, as Piquet only won one race—the French Grand Prix—and the team dropped from fourth to fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The team again had a clear number-one driver policy, with the second seat again being shared, this time between François Hesnault and Surer. Arrows, by contrast, had a much improved season, scoring 17 points with Berger and Boutsen, including a podium finish for the latter at the San Marino Grand Prix.

For the 1986 season, Murray designed the radical low-line BT55 chassis, whose aim was to significantly reduce the car&#x27;s drag and lower its centre of gravity. BMW produced the M12/13/1 engine, which was tilted sideways to fit in the reduced space allocated to the engine. Despite its theoretical advantages, the BT55 proved uncompetitive, suffering from poor traction and numerous mechanical failures caused by oil scavenge problems in the tilted engine. Moreover, the team suffered the death of Elio de Angelis in a testing accident after four races; his replacement Derek Warwick and team returnee Patrese scored two points between them all season. The Arrows team also slipped backwards, scoring just one point with Boutsen, Surer and Christian Danner, and also lost Surer&#x27;s services mid-season when the Swiss driver was seriously injured in a rallying accident. BMW&#x27;s most successful 1986 partnership was thus with the new Benetton team, which scored 19 points, won the Mexican Grand Prix and took two pole positions with Berger and Teo Fabi. Arrows and Benetton continued to use the original &quot;upright&quot; version of the M12/13 engine.

BMW reduced its full works commitment to the sole supply of Brabham in ; the team produced the more conservative BT56 chassis and scored ten points with Patrese, Andrea de Cesaris and Stefano Modena. At the end of the year, team owner Bernie Ecclestone, who was increasingly involved in running the commercial side of the sport, decided not to compete the following year, ending BMW&#x27;s tenure as a supplier of works turbo engines. The Arrows team, however, was still keen to use the upright version of the M12/13, and arranged for its title sponsor, USF&amp;G, to purchase the remaining stock. The engines were rebadged as &quot;Megatrons&quot;, and were used to power the Arrows cars in 1987 and , and the Ligier team in 1987 only. Arrows finished fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in the latter of these two seasons, a result which stands as the best in the team&#x27;s 25-year history.

For , the technical regulations were changed to ban turbocharged engines, outlawing the M12/13 engine. During its time in F1, the engine had won the 1983 Drivers&#x27; Championship and nine Grands Prix. It also took 14 pole positions and set 13 fastest laps.

===Williams (2000–2005)===
After a ten-year absence from Formula One, BMW began evaluating a return to the sport in the late 1990s. In , the marque signed a contract to supply the Williams team with engines. Williams had won the , , and Drivers&#x27; Championships, and the Constructors&#x27; Championships in all of these years as well as , in a successful partnership with Renault, but the French company withdrew from the sport at the end of , leaving team owner Frank Williams and Technical Director Patrick Head in need of a new engine partnership to remain competitive. As BMW spent 18 months building and testing a normally aspirated, three-litre V10 engine to comply with technical regulations that had changed significantly since the 1980s, the team used old Renault engines rebadged as first Mecachrome and then Supertec.

BMW&#x27;s E41 engine was ready to compete in the 2000 season, fitted in the FW22 and driven by Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button. Schumacher scored a podium finish in the engine&#x27;s first race, and added two more during the course of the season. A series of consistent points-scoring finishes meant that Williams finished a competitive third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, some distance behind the dominant Ferrari and McLaren teams, but ahead of engine manufacturers with more recent experience.

After the relatively conservative E41, BMW designed the more aggressive P80 engine for , a basic type number that was maintained for the remainder of the company&#x27;s involvement in Formula One. The engine immediately proved to have a significant power improvement, and propelled Schumacher and new teammate Juan Pablo Montoya into contention for race victories. In all, the two drivers scored four race wins, but lost other opportunities through unreliability and racing incidents. The FW23 chassis also lacked the ultimate downforce to compete with the Ferrari and McLaren drivers at every circuit, although it was the class of the field at &quot;power circuits&quot; such as Hockenheim and Monza.

For , the reliability and consistency of the FW24 chassis was much improved, but Ferrari made a more significant step forward with its own F2002 chassis and dominated both championships. The team scored twelve more points than in the previous year and beat McLaren to second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, but only won a single race with Schumacher at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Moreover, Montoya was unable to win a single race, despite taking seven pole positions.

The Williams team was more competitive in , as both drivers won on two occasions and Montoya remained in contention for the Drivers&#x27; Championship until the penultimate race of the season. However, he ultimately fell short, as did the team in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, as although the FW25 was often the car to beat in the second half of the season, it took too much time to reach this point.

For , the team produced the FW26 chassis, which featured a radical nose section designed by Antonia Terzi. This design proved ineffective, however, in another year of Ferrari dominance, and Williams slipped to fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Montoya&#x27;s victory in the Brazilian Grand Prix its sole win in the 2004 season. Before this result, the team had suffered the embarrassment of a double disqualification from the Canadian Grand Prix due to brake duct irregularities, and then Schumacher sustaining spinal injuries as a result of a high-speed crash at the United States Grand Prix, which caused him to miss six races until he recovered. Both drivers left the team at the end of the season.

The final year of BMW&#x27;s association with Williams, , saw the team&#x27;s decline in competitiveness continue, dropping to fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. None of the team&#x27;s three drivers—Mark Webber, Nick Heidfeld and Antônio Pizzonia—were able to win a race; the team&#x27;s best result was a double podium finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. By this time, the team&#x27;s relationship with its engine supplier had deteriorated, with BMW believing that its engines were capable of winning championships but were being let down by the Williams chassis they were powering. BMW offered to buy the team outright in the hope of gaining overall control of its Formula One endeavours, but Frank Williams refused; as a result, BMW chose to buy the rival Sauber team instead for and end its deal with Williams.

==BMW Sauber==
BMW bought Swiss team Sauber in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team (initially BMW planned to utilize BMW F1 Team naming). The takeover came after BMW&#x27;s relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months, the partnership ending at the end of the season. The team, operated under a German racing licence, was based at Sauber&#x27;s headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland and BMW&#x27;s headquarters in Munich, Germany. BMW retained Sauber naming for 2006 to 2009 seasons due to historical reasons despite BMW ownership.

The team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in 2006, its first season in Formula One. This was followed by a second place in 2007 after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship. Robert Kubica took the team&#x27;s only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Following a poor season, BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber.

===2006===
For the 2006 season, BMW Sauber signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be the lead driver, while World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his existing two-year contract with Sauber honoured. Robert Kubica was signed as the team&#x27;s third driver. The team continued to use Sauber&#x27;s facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW&#x27;s headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 2.4-litre P86 V8 engine, revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3-litre V10 formula. This replaced the Petronas-badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997. The Sauber team&#x27;s existing major sponsors, Petronas and Credit Suisse, renewed their contracts with BMW. The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company Intel. The team&#x27;s new livery, which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One, consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.

Villeneuve scored the team&#x27;s first points with a seventh-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix, after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race. Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth-place finishes, plus a fourth-place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix. The team ran a radical &quot;twin towers&quot; aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix, which was meant to improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis. The parts were promptly banned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) as they were adjudged to impede the drivers&#x27; vision and thus compromise safety.

Heidfeld scored the team&#x27;s first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid. This race also saw the début of Robert Kubica, who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight. The official reason for Villeneuve&#x27;s absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident, but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent. Kubica scored BMW Sauber&#x27;s second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix, after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops while Heidfeld finished in eighth. The team scored a total of 36 points to finish fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, an improvement on Sauber&#x27;s eighth position with 20 points in .

===2007===
On 19 October 2006, BMW announced that Robert Kubica would partner Nick Heidfeld for the 2007 Formula One season with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role. Timo Glock was later signed as the team&#x27;s second test driver. The team launched its 2007 car, the F1.07, on January 16, 2007.

The new car showed promising form throughout winter testing, topping the times sheets on occasions. However, team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the season&#x27;s opening race in Australia. Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem, but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race. In the early races of the season, Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third-fastest team, behind Ferrari and McLaren. Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it.

The Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team. While Heidfeld scored BMW Sauber&#x27;s best result thus far with a second-place finish, Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period. The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg, but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion. Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix, finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. Later in the season, Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the Toro Rosso team.

Kubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position. Over the remainder of the season, he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points, which secured the team second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship after McLaren&#x27;s disqualification. Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubica&#x27;s 39, while Vettel&#x27;s sole appearance produced an additional point.

===2008===
On August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of Heidfeld and Kubica for the season.
Their 2008 car, the F1.08 was officially launched in Munich at BMW Welt on January 14, 2008. It made its track debut at Valencia the next day, with Robert Kubica driving. Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the team&#x27;s first win.

BMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne. He later retired after being hit by Kazuki Nakajima but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in Malaysia, with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race. The team&#x27;s points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team&#x27;s first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors&#x27; championship for the first time.

The team also attained a second-place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with Robert Kubica, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton by three seconds.

BMW Sauber&#x27;s first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica&#x27;s first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi Räikkönen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion.

After the team&#x27;s breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix, the 17th round out of 18.

In October the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season.

===2009===
Although BMW Sauber targeted the season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team&#x27;s first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points, and occupied 8th place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship out of 10 teams. A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey, including an improved regenerative braking system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car&#x27;s aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team&#x27;s first points since the race in Turkey.

Following a meeting of the BMW board on July 28, the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team&#x27;s withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. Chairman Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1.

On 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer, Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests. However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship. The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry, which hinged either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship.

On November 22, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbak&#x27;s attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds. Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it. On November 27, 2009, it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season. The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3, after Toyota had left the sport. The team used Ferrari engines in .

<text>Raymond Earl Fosse (April 4, 1947 – October 13, 2021) was an American professional baseball player and television sports color commentator. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher from 1967 to 1979, most prominently as an All-Star player for the Cleveland Indians, and then as a two-time World Series champion with the Oakland Athletics dynasty of the early 1970s. He also played for the Seattle Mariners and the Milwaukee Brewers. After his playing career, Fosse was a popular television and radio color commentator for the Athletics.

Fosse was selected by the Indians to become the team&#x27;s first draft pick when MLB implemented its first amateur draft in 1965. Fosse was a two-time All-Star and won two Gold Glove Awards in a playing career that was marred by numerous injuries. In 2001, Fosse was voted one of the 100 greatest players in Cleveland Indians&#x27; history by a panel of veteran baseball writers, executives and historians. He was named to the Oakland Athletics&#x27; 50th-anniversary team in 2018, and was inducted into the St. Louis Hall of Fame on February 11, 2019. In 2022, Fosse was inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
Fosse was born in Marion, Illinois, where he grew up listening to the St. Louis Cardinals on the radio. He considered Stan Musial to be his favorite player. Fosse played as a catcher for the Marion High School baseball team and was named the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player three consecutive years. He also played football and basketball in high school. After high school, Fosse attended Southern Illinois University.

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Indians===
The Cleveland Indians selected Fosse in the first round of the 1965 MLB draft. Fosse played three seasons in the minor leagues before making his major-league debut with the Indians on September 8, 1967, at the age of 20. He returned to the minor leagues for the 1968 season, where he posted a .301 batting average in 103 games for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League.

Returning to the Indians in 1970, he platooned alongside Duke Sims. In the first half of 1970, he posted a .313 batting average with 16 home runs and 45 runs batted in. He hit in 23 consecutive games beginning June 9, the longest American League (AL) hitting streak since 1961, and was chosen as a reserve for the 1970 All-Star Game by Earl Weaver, the American League manager.

In the final play of the 1970 All-Star Game, Fosse was injured in a collision with Pete Rose at home plate. Initial X-rays revealed no fractures or other damage, although a re-examination the following year found Fosse had sustained a fractured and separated shoulder, which healed incorrectly, causing chronic pain that was never entirely resolved. Rose asserted that he was simply trying to win the game, and that Fosse — who had moved a few feet up the third-base line to receive the throw from Amos Otis — was blocking the plate, but Rose was widely criticized for over-aggressive play in an exhibition game. Fosse went on to play 42 games in the second half of the season, hitting .297 and winning the AL Gold Glove Award, but said that he was never as good a batter after the injury.

Fosse continued to be plagued by injuries in 1971 when he was kicked in his right hand during a brawl against the Detroit Tigers on June 18, sustaining a gash that required five stitches and sidelined him for more than a week. When he returned, he tore a ligament in his left hand during an at-bat against Denny McLain, forcing him to miss the 1971 All-Star Game. Despite these injuries, Fosse appeared in 133 games and led the league&#x27;s catchers in assists and in double plays to win his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He also posted a .276 batting average and contributed 12 home runs and a career-high 62 runs batted in for the last place Indians.

Fosse&#x27;s contributions at calling pitches was evident when Indians pitcher Gaylord Perry won the American League Cy Young Award in 1972. Perry gave Fosse credit for his success: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to split it up and give part, a big part, to my catcher, Ray Fosse. He kept pushing me in games when I didn&#x27;t have good stuff. He&#x27;d come out and show me that big fist of his when I wasn&#x27;t bearing down the way he thought I should.&quot;

===Oakland Athletics===
Fosse was acquired along with Jack Heidemann by the Oakland Athletics from the Indians for Dave Duncan and George Hendrick on March 24, 1973. He played in 143 games that season, the most of his career, on a team with three 20-game-winning pitchers: Ken Holtzman, Vida Blue, and Catfish Hunter. Fosse guided the Athletics pitching staff to the second best team earned run average as well the second most shutouts in the American League as, the Athletics won the AL Western Division pennant by six games over the Kansas City Royals. The Athletics then defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the AL Championship Series. Fosse made his mark in the series, throwing out five would-be base stealers. The Athletics went on to win the World Series against the New York Mets.

The Athletics repeated as world champions in 1974, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, but injuries once again plagued Fosse. On June 5, he suffered a crushed disc in his neck attempting to break up a locker room fight between teammates Reggie Jackson and Billy North, and spent three months on the disabled list. The Athletics won a fifth consecutive division title in 1975, but by then, Gene Tenace had replaced Fosse as the starting catcher. Fosse did participate in a combined no-hitter in the final game of the season, catching for Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers in the final three innings.

===Later career===
Fosse returned to the Indians when his contract was sold by the Athletics at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1975. He again became the starting catcher, only to return to the disabled list after a home-plate collision with Jim Rice. When he returned he was platooned with Alan Ashby. Fosse ended the year with a .301 batting average. On May 30, 1977, he caught Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s no-hitter versus the California Angels. Eckersley acknowledged Fosse&#x27;s contribution to the no-hitter: &quot;Give Fosse a lot of credit too,&quot; he said. &quot;He called a helluva game. I think I only shook him off three times.&quot; When Jeff Torborg replaced Frank Robinson as manager of the Indians in June 1977, he again placed Fosse in a platoon role with Fred Kendall. In September, he was traded to the new Seattle Mariners.

After finishing the year with the Mariners, he signed a contract to play for the Milwaukee Brewers, but during spring training, he tripped in a hole while running down the first base line and sustained injuries to his right leg. The most serious injury required the reconstruction of a knee ligament, forcing him to miss the entire season. He came back in 1979, but played in only 19 games; in 1980, he was released at the close of spring training.

==Career statistics==
In a 12-year MLB career, Fosse played in 924 games, accumulating 758 hits in 2,957 at bats for a .256 career batting average along with 61 home runs, 324 runs batted in, and a .301 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .986 fielding percentage. Fosse led AL catchers in 1970 with 854 putouts and 48 baserunners caught stealing, and in range factor (7.81). In 1971 he led the league with 73 assists, and in 1973, he led AL catchers in baserunners caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage.

Fosse was a member of two World Series Champion clubs: the 1973 and 1974 A&#x27;s, and also a member of the inaugural Seattle Mariners team of 1977. He won Gold Glove Awards in 1970 and 1971. Fosse was named to the 100 Greatest Cleveland Indians in 2001.

==Television and radio career==
From 1986 to 2021, Fosse was a color commentator for the Oakland Athletics on NBC Sports California and occasionally on Athletics radio broadcasts when a game was not on local television. In 2004, he was nominated for a Ford C. Frick Award.

==Personal life and death==
Fosse married his wife Carol in April 1970. They maintained residences in Oakland, California, and Scottsdale, Arizona.

On August 5, 2021, Fosse revealed that he had been battling cancer for the past 16 years, and needed to step away from his job as an announcer to focus on his treatment. Fosse died of cancer on October 13, 2021, at the age of 74.

<doc id="239007" wikidata="Q7757993" url="?curid=239007" title="The Practice Effect">
<text>The Practice Effect is a novel by David Brin, written in 1984. The story involves a world in which entropy works in reverse.

==Plot summary==
A scientist by the name of Dennis Nuel is working at, and attending, an institute of scientific research and pioneering work into the fictional scientific field of &quot;Zievatronics&quot;, the manipulation of Time and Space. After the death of his mentor, however, he is taken off the project and another professor takes over.

After a time, the device that has been created to move through space and time, known as the &quot;Zievatron&quot; encounters operational problems and is fixed to the co-ordinates of a world that appears to be very similar to the Earth in most respects, and Dennis is re-recruited to help fix it. He volunteers to be sent to the other world in order to fix the other part of the Zievatron. On arriving to this planet, he finds the Zievatron dismantled and critical parts of it missing. Of the three surveillance robots sent through to this planet, he finds two have also been broken apart. After a while, he finds the last robot, intact and still functioning, and uses it to view any recorded images that might help him identify what it was that happened to the Zievatron.

In this world, instead of objects wearing out as you use them, they improve. This is referred to as the &quot;Practice Effect&quot;. For example, swords get sharper with use, baskets get stronger the more things they carry, mirrors, furniture and decorations look more attractive the more they are looked at. The physical structure of objects changes in a way so as to become a better version of its previous existence with Practice, like the growth and evolution of a life form. The downside is that an object&#x27;s condition deteriorates over time if not put to use. Under the prevailing social system, members of society&#x27;s higher strata exert ownership over objects that they do not improve themselves but rather employ servants to improve by use of the Practice Effect.

It is eventually discovered that the Practice Effect is the result of an elusive, biologically-engineered creature known as a Krenegee Beast that causes a change in a law of thermodynamics. This creature emits a field under which the Practice Effect works. The closer one is to the Krenegee Beasts, the more efficient the Practice that is done. The Practice Effect can take many months before an object reaches its maximum point of &quot;practice&quot;, but the process is sped up if one is under a Felthesh Trance. The presence of a Krenegee Beast speeds up the process more than a Felthesh Trance.

==Table of contents==
The chapter titles are all jokes, some puns, most in Latin with one (ch. 6) in French. The translations are included.

# Sooee generis – &quot;&#x27;Sooee&#x27; is a classic call farmers would use to summon pigs for a meal. Pixolet resembles a pig. Hence &quot;Sooee Generis&quot; is a one-of-a-kind pig.&quot;
# Cogito, ergo tutti frutti – &quot;&#x27;Cogito, Ergo Tutti Frutti&#x27; refers to a flavor of ice cream and hence stands for &quot;I think, therefore I scream,&quot; which is spelled out in the chapter.&quot;
# Nom de Terre – tr. &#x27;name of the land&#x27; but in the context of the chapter a play on &#x27;Nom de Guerre&#x27;. This is also a pun on &#x27;pomme de terre&#x27; the french word for potato which translates directly to, apple of the earth. The name of the planet being &#x27;Tater&#x27; a common slang for potato. Making the nomme de terre a pomme de terre.
# The best way to Carnegie Hall – (... is practice)
# Transom dental – a play on &#x27;transcendental&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Transom Dental&#x27; - refers to the chapter&#x27;s chief event, practicing dental floss into a cutting tool that lets characters escape over a wall. A transom was a window that would open part way over an office door to let in air. Hence the phrase &quot;I got in over the transom&quot; meant &quot;I used an unconventional means to pass over a barrier.&quot; Combining that with dental floss offers a pun on &#x27;transcendental&#x27; surpassing an obstacle.&quot;
# Ballon d&#x27;essai – trial balloon
# Pundit Nero – Pandit Nehru, first Prime Minister of India.
# &quot;Eurekaarrgh&quot; – a more accurate variation of &#x27;eureka&#x27; A portmanteau of eureka and arrgh, a commonly used distressed scream in literature
# Discus jestus – majesty Disc. An alternate Latin meaning, in the chapter context: &quot;Quoit Jester&quot; = &quot;Court Jester&quot;
# Sic biscuitus disintegratum – or &#x27;this is how the cookie crumbles&#x27;
# Et two toots – or &#x27;Et tu, Brute?&#x27; 
# Semper ubi sub ubi – tr. &#x27;always where under where&#x27; but in the context of the chapter, &#x27;always wear underwear&#x27;

==Reception==
Algis Budrys found the novel&#x27;s premise appealing, praising Brin&#x27;s &quot;really first-rate SFnal idea,&quot; but its execution disappointing, leaving little of interest but plot details once the central mystery was explained at the novel&#x27;s midpoint, &quot;and as a plotsmith Brin is just another guy.&quot; The &quot;SF Encyclopedia&quot; considers it &quot;less successful&quot; than Brin&#x27;s series work, and notes that its premise is &quot;oddly Lamarckian&quot;. Charlie Jane Anders, however, has cited it as a work that will &quot;make [the reader] more passionate about science&quot;.

<doc id="239009" wikidata="Q331017" url="?curid=239009" title="To Catch a Thief">
<text>To Catch a Thief is a 1955 American romantic thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, from a screenplay by John Michael Hayes based on the 1952 novel of the same name by David Dodge. The film stars Cary Grant as a retired cat burglar who has to save his reformed reputation by catching an impostor preying on wealthy tourists (including an oil-rich widow and her daughter played by Grace Kelly) on the French Riviera.

==Plot==
Retired jewel thief John &quot;The Cat&quot; Robie is suspected by the police in a string of burglaries on the French Riviera. When they come to his hilltop villa to question him, he slips their grasp and heads to a restaurant owned by his friend Bertani. The restaurant&#x27;s staff are members of Robie&#x27;s old gang, who have been paroled for their work in the French Resistance during World War II. They are angry at Robie because they are all under suspicion as long as the new Cat is active. When the police arrive at the restaurant looking for Robie, Danielle, the daughter of the restaurant&#x27;s wine steward Foussard, spirits him to safety; she is a young woman who fancies him dearly.

Robie realizes he can prove his innocence by catching the new Cat in the act. He enlists the aid of an insurance man, H. H. Hughson, who reluctantly discloses a list of persons currently on the Riviera who own the most expensive jewelry. The American tourists Jessie Stevens, a wealthy nouveau-riche widow, and her daughter Frances top the list. Robie strikes up a friendship with them. Frances feigns modesty at first, but kisses Robie at the end of the night as she retires to her room.

The day after, Frances invites Robie to a swim at the beach, where Robie runs into Danielle. He keeps up his cover of being a wealthy American tourist, despite Danielle&#x27;s jealous barbs about his interest in Frances. Frances accompanies Robie to a villa, where Robie suspects the new Cat might break in. Frances reveals that she knows Robie&#x27;s real identity. He initially denies it, but concedes it that evening when she has invited him to her room to watch a fireworks display. They kiss passionately.

The next morning, Jessie discovers her jewels are gone. Frances accuses Robie of using her as a distraction so he could steal her mother&#x27;s jewelry. The police are called, but by the time they reach Jessie&#x27;s room Robie has disappeared.

Later Robie, while staking out an estate at night trying to catch the thief, is attacked by an unknown assailant. A second attacker raises a wrench and tries to kill Robie but accidentally instead hits the first assailant, who falls off the estate&#x27;s seawall into the water. When the police reach the body in the water it turns out to be Foussard.

The police chief announces to the press that Foussard was the jewel thief, but, as Robie points out privately in the chief&#x27;s office with Hughson present, this would have been impossible because Foussard had a wooden leg and could not climb on rooftops.

Foussard&#x27;s funeral is interrupted by Danielle&#x27;s loud accusation that Robie is responsible for her father&#x27;s death. Outside the graveyard, Frances apologizes to Robie and confesses her love. Robie asks Frances to arrange his attendance at a fancy masquerade ball, where he believes the Cat will strike again.

Robie accompanies Frances to the ball dressed as a masked Moor. The police hover nearby. When Jessie addresses the Moor as &quot;John&quot; and asks him to go and get her &quot;heart pills&quot;, the authorities are tipped off as to his identity. Upon the masked Moor&#x27;s return, the police wait as he and Frances dance together all night. When the masked Moor accompanies Frances to her room, he removes the mask and turns out to be Hughson, who switched places with Robie to conceal the latter&#x27;s exit. Upstairs, the cat burglar silently cleans out several jewel boxes.

Robie lurks on the rooftop, and his patience is finally rewarded when he spots a figure in black whom he unmasks as Danielle, Foussard&#x27;s daughter. The police throw a spotlight on him and demand that he halt, giving Danielle the chance to slip away. Robie flees as they shoot at him and manages to corner his foe with jewels in hand. She loses her footing on the roof and starts to fall, but Robie grabs her hand at the last second. While she hangs in his grasp, he forces her to confess to the police and admit that Bertani planned the thefts.

Robie speeds back to his villa. Frances follows to convince him that she has a place in his life. He agrees but looks less than thrilled when she says, &quot;Mother will love it up here.&quot;

===Cast notes===
*Alfred Hitchcock makes his signature cameo, approximately ten minutes into the film, as a bus passenger sitting next to Cary Grant and a caged pair of birds.

==Production==
&quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; was the director&#x27;s first film (of five) made using the VistaVision widescreen process, and the last of the three Hitchcock films with Grace Kelly. The film was the penultimate collaboration with Cary Grant; only &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) followed. It is also about a man with a mistaken identity who goes on a breakneck adventure to prove his innocence.

The costumes were by Edith Head, including Kelly&#x27;s memorable gold lamé gown for the film&#x27;s costume ball.

The car driven by Grace Kelly was a metallic blue 1953 Sunbeam Alpine Mk I.

===Locations===
&quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; was filmed largely in the Paramount Studios, Hollywood, California, and on location in the Alpes-Maritimes of southeastern France, on the Mediterranean coast. It included the resorts of Cannes, Nice, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Saint-Jeannet and Tourrettes sur Loup.

Crucial to the film&#x27;s success in shooting on location was the presence of unit production manager C.O. &quot;Doc&quot; Erickson. He had developed a reputation for his work on prior Paramount films that had relied on a great amount of location photography, such as &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) and &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954). Erickson thoroughly researched the logistics of shooting in the South of France and communicated with Bill Mull, the production manager on &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot; (1953).

==Distribution==
&quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; is the only Hitchcock film released by Paramount that is still owned and controlled by the company. The other five films Hitchcock made at Paramount, &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;, each passed from the studio to his personal ownership eight years after the date of their theatrical release, under the conditions of his contract. Those five are currently distributed by Universal Studios.

==Reception==

The film drew mixed reviews from critics, with some enjoying Grant and Kelly in the lead roles as well as the French Riviera setting, while others expressed disappointment at the lack of suspense compared to earlier Hitchcock films.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a positive review that the film &quot;comes off completely as a hit in the old Hitchcock style ... Mr. Grant and Miss Kelly do grandly, especially in one sly seduction scene.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that while the film was &quot;not the suspense piece one usually associated with the Alfred Hitchcock name,&quot; it was &quot;strong on sight and performance values&quot; though it had &quot;some plot weaknesses and is not as smooth in the unfolding as one might expect from an upper &#x27;A&#x27; presentation.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock has not endowed the action with as much suspense as one might expect in a picture produced and directed by him; nevertheless, its story of a one-time jewel robber who sets out to establish his innocence by catching a thief who was using his technique is tight and swiftly-paced, and constantly offers dramatic and comical developments.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;one of those de luxe pictures in which everyone lives in glorious workless luxury on the French Rivera, looks wonderful, speaks amusingly and is unconcerned with transit strikes or hurricanes. I loved every minute of it.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, calling Grant and Kelly &quot;ideal in the romantic leads&quot; and the dialogue &quot;daring but delightful,&quot; adding, &quot;Above all, there is the spell of the French Riviera—a lazy, laissez-faire thing that apparently captivated the director as much as it will audiences in the soft, beguiling hues of its Technicolor and VistaVision.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;an Alfred Hitchcock picture that makes you wonder what has happened to the man ... As the heiress, Grace Kelly is very pretty. She does not, presumably, try to act.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Even a comedy thriller needs considerably more in the way of plain excitement and tension than &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; provides, and Hitchcock&#x27;s celebrated habit of playing tricks with the audience ... seem a poor substitute for the real thing.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;a thorough disappointment,&quot; writing that Hitchcock had &quot;failed so completely that one can only wonder if, in this tale of high-class burglary on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, he has not altogether abandoned his devotion to &#x27;tension.&#x27; Certainly the &#x27;whodunnit&#x27; element in this film is remarkably slack; the unmasking of the master criminal, which is the climax of the story, comes as mildly as bread and milk.&quot;

François Truffaut wrote &quot;&quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; completely satisfies all [Hitchcock&#x27;s] fans—the snobbiest and the most ordinary—and still manages to be one of the most cynical films Hitchcock has ever made.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 92% based on reviews from 53 critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10, with the critical consensus reading: &quot;It may occasionally be guilty of coasting on pure charm, but &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; has it in spades -- as well as a pair of perfectly matched stars in Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.&quot;

==Accolades==
Robert Burks won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, while Hal Pereira, Joseph McMillan Johnson, Samuel M. Comer and Arthur Krams were nominated for Best Art Direction, and Edith Head was nominated for Best Costume Design.

In 2002, American Film Institute included the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions (#46).

==Adaptations==
In May 2018, it was announced that Viacom was set to adapt the film as a Spanish-language television series. It was launched in October 2019 as &quot;Atrapa a un ladrón&quot; (es).
