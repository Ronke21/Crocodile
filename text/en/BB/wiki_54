<text>Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. While some core ideas in the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard&#x27;s 1995 paper entitled &quot;Affective Computing&quot; and her 1997 book of the same name published by MIT Press. One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence, including to simulate empathy. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions.

== Areas ==

===Detecting and recognizing emotional information===
Detecting emotional information usually begins with passive sensors that capture data about the user&#x27;s physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. For example, a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, while a microphone might capture speech. Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring physiological data, such as skin temperature and galvanic resistance.

Recognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done using machine learning techniques that process different modalities, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, or facial expression detection. The goal of most of these techniques is to produce labels that would match the labels a human perceiver would give in the same situation: For example, if a person makes a facial expression furrowing their brow, then the computer vision system might be taught to label their face as appearing &quot;confused&quot; or as &quot;concentrating&quot; or &quot;slightly negative&quot; (as opposed to positive, which it might say if they were smiling in a happy-appearing way). These labels may or may not correspond to what the person is actually feeling.

===Emotion in machines===
Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. A more practical approach, based on current technological capabilities, is the simulation of emotions in conversational agents in order to enrich and facilitate interactivity between human and machine.

Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneering computer scientists in artificial intelligence, relates emotions to the broader issues of machine intelligence stating in &quot;The Emotion Machine&quot; that emotion is &quot;not especially different from the processes that we call &#x27;thinking.&#x27;&quot; The innovative approach &quot;digital humans&quot; or virtual humans includes an attempt to give these programs, which simulate humans, the emotional dimension as well, including reactions in accordance with the reaction that a real person would react in a certain emotionally stimulating situation as well as facial expressions and gestures.

Emotion in machines often refers to emotion in computational, often AI-based, systems. As a result, the terms &#x27;emotional AI&#x27; and &#x27;emotion AI&#x27; are being used.

== Technologies ==
In psychology, cognitive science, and in neuroscience, there have been two main approaches for describing how humans perceive and classify emotion: continuous or categorical. The continuous approach tends to use dimensions such as negative vs. positive, calm vs. aroused.

The categorical approach tends to use discrete classes such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, disgust. Different kinds of machine learning regression and classification models can be used for having machines produce continuous or discrete labels. Sometimes models are also built that allow combinations across the categories, e.g. a happy-surprised face or a fearful-surprised face.

The following sections consider many of the kinds of input data used for the task of emotion recognition.

===Emotional speech===
Various changes in the autonomic nervous system can indirectly alter a person&#x27;s speech, and affective technologies can leverage this information to recognize emotion. For example, speech produced in a state of fear, anger, or joy becomes fast, loud, and precisely enunciated, with a higher and wider range in pitch, whereas emotions such as tiredness, boredom, or sadness tend to generate slow, low-pitched, and slurred speech. Some emotions have been found to be more easily computationally identified, such as anger or approval.

Emotional speech processing technologies recognize the user&#x27;s emotional state using computational analysis of speech features. Vocal parameters and prosodic features such as pitch variables and speech rate can be analyzed through pattern recognition techniques.

Speech analysis is an effective method of identifying affective state, having an average reported accuracy of 70 to 80% in research from 2003 and 2006. These systems tend to outperform average human accuracy (approximately 60%) but are less accurate than systems which employ other modalities for emotion detection, such as physiological states or facial expressions. However, since many speech characteristics are independent of semantics or culture, this technique is considered to be a promising route for further research.

====Algorithms====

The process of speech/text affect detection requires the creation of a reliable database, knowledge base, or vector space model, broad enough to fit every need for its application, as well as the selection of a successful classifier which will allow for quick and accurate emotion identification.

, the most frequently used classifiers were linear discriminant classifiers (LDC), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), decision tree algorithms and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Various studies showed that choosing the appropriate classifier can significantly enhance the overall performance of the system. The list below gives a brief description of each algorithm:

* LDC – Classification happens based on the value obtained from the linear combination of the feature values, which are usually provided in the form of vector features.
* k-NN – Classification happens by locating the object in the feature space, and comparing it with the k nearest neighbors (training examples). The majority vote decides on the classification.
* GMM – is a probabilistic model used for representing the existence of subpopulations within the overall population. Each sub-population is described using the mixture distribution, which allows for classification of observations into the sub-populations.
* SVM – is a type of (usually binary) linear classifier which decides in which of the two (or more) possible classes, each input may fall into.
* ANN – is a mathematical model, inspired by biological neural networks, that can better grasp possible non-linearities of the feature space.
* Decision tree algorithms – work based on following a decision tree in which leaves represent the classification outcome, and branches represent the conjunction of subsequent features that lead to the classification.
* HMMs – a statistical Markov model in which the states and state transitions are not directly available to observation. Instead, the series of outputs dependent on the states are visible. In the case of affect recognition, the outputs represent the sequence of speech feature vectors, which allow the deduction of states&#x27; sequences through which the model progressed. The states can consist of various intermediate steps in the expression of an emotion, and each of them has a probability distribution over the possible output vectors. The states&#x27; sequences allow us to predict the affective state which we are trying to classify, and this is one of the most commonly used techniques within the area of speech affect detection.

It is proved that having enough acoustic evidence available the emotional state of a person can be classified by a set of majority voting classifiers. The proposed set of classifiers is based on three main classifiers: kNN, C4.5 and SVM-RBF Kernel. This set achieves better performance than each basic classifier taken separately. It is compared with two other sets of classifiers: one-against-all (OAA) multiclass SVM with Hybrid kernels and the set of classifiers which consists of the following two basic classifiers: C5.0 and Neural Network. The proposed variant achieves better performance than the other two sets of classifiers.

====Databases====

The vast majority of present systems are data-dependent. This creates one of the biggest challenges in detecting emotions based on speech, as it implicates choosing an appropriate database used to train the classifier. Most of the currently possessed data was obtained from actors and is thus a representation of archetypal emotions. Those so-called acted databases are usually based on the Basic Emotions theory (by Paul Ekman), which assumes the existence of six basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, surprise, joy, sadness), the others simply being a mix of the former ones. Nevertheless, these still offer high audio quality and balanced classes (although often too few), which contribute to high success rates in recognizing emotions.

However, for real life application, naturalistic data is preferred. A naturalistic database can be produced by observation and analysis of subjects in their natural context. Ultimately, such database should allow the system to recognize emotions based on their context as well as work out the goals and outcomes of the interaction. The nature of this type of data allows for authentic real life implementation, due to the fact it describes states naturally occurring during the human–computer interaction (HCI).

Despite the numerous advantages which naturalistic data has over acted data, it is difficult to obtain and usually has low emotional intensity. Moreover, data obtained in a natural context has lower signal quality, due to surroundings noise and distance of the subjects from the microphone. The first attempt to produce such database was the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus for CEICES (Combining Efforts for Improving Automatic Classification of Emotional User States), which was developed based on a realistic context of children (age 10–13) playing with Sony&#x27;s Aibo robot pet. Likewise, producing one standard database for all emotional research would provide a method of evaluating and comparing different affect recognition systems.

====Speech descriptors====

The complexity of the affect recognition process increases with the number of classes (affects) and speech descriptors used within the classifier. It is, therefore, crucial to select only the most relevant features in order to assure the ability of the model to successfully identify emotions, as well as increasing the performance, which is particularly significant to real-time detection. The range of possible choices is vast, with some studies mentioning the use of over 200 distinct features. It is crucial to identify those that are redundant and undesirable in order to optimize the system and increase the success rate of correct emotion detection. The most common speech characteristics are categorized into the following groups.

# Frequency characteristics
#* Accent shape – affected by the rate of change of the fundamental frequency.
#* Average pitch – description of how high/low the speaker speaks relative to the normal speech.
#* Contour slope – describes the tendency of the frequency change over time, it can be rising, falling or level.
#* Final lowering – the amount by which the frequency falls at the end of an utterance.
#* Pitch range – measures the spread between the maximum and minimum frequency of an utterance.
# Time-related features:
#* Speech rate – describes the rate of words or syllables uttered over a unit of time
#* Stress frequency – measures the rate of occurrences of pitch accented utterances
# Voice quality parameters and energy descriptors:
#* Breathiness – measures the aspiration noise in speech
#* Brilliance – describes the dominance of high or low frequencies In the speech
#* Loudness – measures the amplitude of the speech waveform, translates to the energy of an utterance
#* Pause Discontinuity – describes the transitions between sound and silence
#* Pitch Discontinuity – describes the transitions of the fundamental frequency.

===Facial affect detection===
The detection and processing of facial expression are achieved through various methods such as optical flow, hidden Markov models, neural network processing or active appearance models. More than one modality can be combined or fused (multimodal recognition, e.g. facial expressions and speech prosody, facial expressions and hand gestures, or facial expressions with speech and text for multimodal data and metadata analysis) to provide a more robust estimation of the subject&#x27;s emotional state. 

==== Facial expression databases ====

Creation of an emotion database is a difficult and time-consuming task. However, database creation is an essential step in the creation of a system that will recognize human emotions. Most of the publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions only. In posed expression databases, the participants are asked to display different basic emotional expressions, while in spontaneous expression database, the expressions are natural. Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort in the selection of proper stimuli which can lead to a rich display of intended emotions. Secondly, the process involves tagging of emotions by trained individuals manually which makes the databases highly reliable. Since perception of expressions and their intensity is subjective in nature, the annotation by experts is essential for the purpose of validation.

Researchers work with three types of databases, such as a database of peak expression images only, a database of image sequences portraying an emotion from neutral to its peak, and video clips with emotional annotations. Many facial expression databases have been created and made public for expression recognition purpose. Two of the widely used databases are CK+ and JAFFE.

====Emotion classification====

By doing cross-cultural research in Papua, New Guinea, on the Fore Tribesmen, at the end of the 1960s, Paul Ekman proposed the idea that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal. Thus, he suggested that they are biological in origin and can, therefore, be safely and correctly categorized.
He therefore officially put forth six basic emotions, in 1972:

* Anger
* Disgust
* Fear
* Happiness
* Sadness
* Surprise

However, in the 1990s Ekman expanded his list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles. The newly included emotions are:
# Amusement
# Contempt
# Contentment
# Embarrassment
# Excitement
# Guilt
# Pride in achievement
# Relief
# Satisfaction
# Sensory pleasure
# Shame

====Facial Action Coding System====
A system has been conceived by psychologists in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions on faces. The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978 based on earlier work by Carl-Herman Hjortsjö are action units (AU).
They are, basically, a contraction or a relaxation of one or more muscles. Psychologists have proposed the following classification of six basic emotions, according to their action units (&quot;+&quot; here mean &quot;and&quot;):

====Challenges in facial detection====
As with every computational practice, in affect detection by facial processing, some obstacles need to be surpassed, in order to fully unlock the hidden potential of the overall algorithm or method employed. In the early days of almost every kind of AI-based detection (speech recognition, face recognition, affect recognition), the accuracy of modeling and tracking has been an issue. As hardware evolves, as more data are collected and as new discoveries are made and new practices introduced, this lack of accuracy fades, leaving behind noise issues. However, methods for noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging, linear Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, or newer methods such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm.

Other challenges include
* The fact that posed expressions, as used by most subjects of the various studies, are not natural, and therefore algorithms trained on these may not apply to natural expressions.
* The lack of rotational movement freedom. Affect detection works very well with frontal use, but upon rotating the head more than 20 degrees, &quot;there&#x27;ve been problems&quot;.
* Facial expressions do not always correspond to an underlying emotion that matches them (e.g. they can be posed or faked, or a person can feel emotions but maintain a &quot;poker face&quot;).
* FACS did not include dynamics, while dynamics can help disambiguate (e.g. smiles of genuine happiness tend to have different dynamics than &quot;try to look happy&quot; smiles.)
* The FACS combinations do not correspond in a 1:1 way with the emotions that the psychologists originally proposed (note that this lack of a 1:1 mapping also occurs in speech recognition with homophones and homonyms and many other sources of ambiguity, and may be mitigated by bringing in other channels of information).
* Accuracy of recognition is improved by adding context; however, adding context and other modalities increases computational cost and complexity

===Body gesture===

Gestures could be efficiently used as a means of detecting a particular emotional state of the user, especially when used in conjunction with speech and face recognition. Depending on the specific action, gestures could be simple reflexive responses, like lifting your shoulders when you don&#x27;t know the answer to a question, or they could be complex and meaningful as when communicating with sign language. Without making use of any object or surrounding environment, we can wave our hands, clap or beckon. On the other hand, when using objects, we can point at them, move, touch or handle these. A computer should be able to recognize these, analyze the context and respond in a meaningful way, in order to be efficiently used for Human–Computer Interaction.

There are many proposed methods to detect the body gesture. Some literature differentiates 2 different approaches in gesture recognition: a 3D model based and an appearance-based. The foremost method makes use of 3D information of key elements of the body parts in order to obtain several important parameters, like palm position or joint angles. On the other hand, appearance-based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation. Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection methods.

===Physiological monitoring===
This could be used to detect a user&#x27;s affective state by monitoring and analyzing their physiological signs. These signs range from changes in heart rate and skin conductance to minute contractions of the facial muscles and changes in facial blood flow. This area is gaining momentum and we are now seeing real products that implement the techniques. The four main physiological signs that are usually analyzed are blood volume pulse, galvanic skin response, facial electromyography, and facial color patterns.

====Blood volume pulse====

=====Overview=====

A subject&#x27;s blood volume pulse (BVP) can be measured by a process called photoplethysmography, which produces a graph indicating blood flow through the extremities. The peaks of the waves indicate a cardiac cycle where the heart has pumped blood to the extremities. If the subject experiences fear or is startled, their heart usually &#x27;jumps&#x27; and beats quickly for some time, causing the amplitude of the cardiac cycle to increase. This can clearly be seen on a photoplethysmograph when the distance between the trough and the peak of the wave has decreased. As the subject calms down, and as the body&#x27;s inner core expands, allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities, the cycle will return to normal.

=====Methodology=====

Infra-red light is shone on the skin by special sensor hardware, and the amount of light reflected is measured. The amount of reflected and transmitted light correlates to the BVP as light is absorbed by hemoglobin which is found richly in the bloodstream.

=====Disadvantages=====

It can be cumbersome to ensure that the sensor shining an infra-red light and monitoring the reflected light is always pointing at the same extremity, especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position while using a computer.
There are other factors that can affect one&#x27;s blood volume pulse. As it is a measure of blood flow through the extremities, if the subject feels hot, or particularly cold, then their body may allow more, or less, blood to flow to the extremities, all of this regardless of the subject&#x27;s emotional state.

====Facial electromyography====
Facial electromyography is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the facial muscles by amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.
The face expresses a great deal of emotion, however, there are two main facial muscle groups that are usually studied to detect emotion:
The corrugator supercilii muscle, also known as the &#x27;frowning&#x27; muscle, draws the brow down into a frown, and therefore is the best test for negative, unpleasant emotional response.↵The zygomaticus major muscle is responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth back when you smile, and therefore is the muscle used to test for a positive emotional response.

====Galvanic skin response====
Galvanic skin response (GSR) is an outdated term for a more general phenomenon known as [Electrodermal Activity] or EDA. EDA is a general phenomena whereby the skin&#x27;s electrical properties change. The skin is innervated by the [sympathetic nervous system], so measuring its resistance or conductance provides a way to quantify small changes in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. As the sweat glands are activated, even before the skin feels sweaty, the level of the EDA can be captured (usually using conductance) and used to discern small changes in autonomic arousal. The more aroused a subject is, the greater the skin conductance tends to be.

Skin conductance is often measured using two small silver-silver chloride electrodes placed somewhere on the skin and applying a small voltage between them. To maximize comfort and reduce irritation the electrodes can be placed on the wrist, legs, or feet, which leaves the hands fully free for daily activity.

====Facial color====

=====Overview=====

The surface of the human face is innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Whether or not facial emotions activate facial muscles, variations in blood flow, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other changes occur. Also, the facial color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements.

=====Methodology=====

Approaches are based on facial color changes. Delaunay triangulation is used to create the triangular local areas. Some of these triangles which define the interior of the mouth and eyes (sclera and iris) are removed. Use the left triangular areas’ pixels to create feature vectors. It shows that converting the pixel color of the standard RGB color space to a color space such as oRGB color space or LMS channels perform better when dealing with faces. So, map the above vector onto the better color space and decompose into red-green and yellow-blue channels. Then use deep learning methods to find equivalent emotions.

===Visual aesthetics===
Aesthetics, in the world of art and photography, refers to the principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty. Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities is a highly subjective task. Computer scientists at Penn State treat the challenge of automatically inferring the aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem, with a peer-rated on-line photo sharing website as a data source. They extract certain visual features based on the intuition that they can discriminate between aesthetically pleasing and displeasing images.

==Potential applications==
=== Education ===
Affection influences learners&#x27; learning state. Using affective computing technology, computers can judge the learners&#x27; affection and learning state by recognizing their facial expressions. In education, the teacher can use the analysis result to understand the student&#x27;s learning and accepting ability, and then formulate reasonable teaching plans. At the same time, they can pay attention to students&#x27; inner feelings, which is helpful to students&#x27; psychological health. Especially in distance education, due to the separation of time and space, there is no emotional incentive between teachers and students for two-way communication. Without the atmosphere brought by traditional classroom learning, students are easily bored, and affect the learning effect. Applying affective computing in distance education system can effectively improve this situation.
=== Transportation ===
The applications of sensory computing may contribute to improving road safety. For example, a car can monitor the emotion of all occupants and engage in additional safety measures, such as alerting other vehicles if it detects the driver to be angry. In addition, affective computing systems for monitoring the driver&#x27;s stress may allow various interventions such as driver assistance systems adjusted according to the stress level and minimal and direct interventions to change the emotional state of the driver.

=== Healthcare ===
Social robots, as well as a growing number of robots used in health care benefit from emotional awareness because they can better judge users&#x27; and patient&#x27;s emotional states and alter their actions/programming appropriately. This is especially important in those countries with growing aging populations and/or a lack of younger workers to address their needs.

Affective computing is also being applied to the development of communicative technologies for use by people with autism. The affective component of a text is also increasingly gaining attention, particularly its role in the so-called emotional or emotive Internet.

=== Video games ===

Affective video games can access their players&#x27; emotional states through biofeedback devices. A particularly simple form of biofeedback is available through gamepads that measure the pressure with which a button is pressed: this has been shown to correlate strongly with the players&#x27; level of arousal; at the other end of the scale are brain–computer interfaces. Affective games have been used in medical research to support the emotional development of autistic children.

=== Psychomotor training ===
Training methods of psychomotor operations such as steering and maneuvering are used in various fields such as aviation, transportation and medicine. Integrating affective computing capabilities in this type of training systems, in accordance with the adaptive automation approach, has been found to be effective in improving the quality of training and shortening the required training duration.

=== Other applications ===

Affective computing has potential applications in human–computer interaction, such as affective mirrors allowing the user to see how he or she performs; emotion monitoring agents sending a warning before one sends an angry email; or even music players selecting tracks based on mood.

One idea put forth by the Romanian researcher Dr. Nicu Sebe in an interview is the analysis of a person&#x27;s face while they are using a certain product (he mentioned ice cream as an example). Companies would then be able to use such analysis to infer whether their product will or will not be well received by the respective market.

One could also use affective state recognition in order to judge the impact of a TV advertisement through a real-time video recording of that person and through the subsequent study of his or her facial expression. Averaging the results obtained on a large group of subjects, one can tell whether that commercial (or movie) has the desired effect and what the elements which interest the watcher most are.

==Cognitivist vs. interactional approaches==

Within the field of human–computer interaction, Rosalind Picard&#x27;s cognitivist or &quot;information model&quot; concept of emotion has been criticized by and contrasted with the &quot;post-cognitivist&quot; or &quot;interactional&quot; pragmatist approach taken by Kirsten Boehner and others which views emotion as inherently social.

Picard&#x27;s focus is human–computer interaction, and her goal for affective computing is to &quot;give computers the ability to recognize, express, and in some cases, &#x27;have&#x27; emotions&quot;. In contrast, the interactional approach seeks to help &quot;people to understand and experience their own emotions&quot; and to improve computer-mediated interpersonal communication. It does not necessarily seek to map emotion into an objective mathematical model for machine interpretation, but rather let humans make sense of each other&#x27;s emotional expressions in open-ended ways that might be ambiguous, subjective, and sensitive to context.

Picard&#x27;s critics describe her concept of emotion as &quot;objective, internal, private, and mechanistic&quot;. They say it reduces emotion to a discrete psychological signal occurring inside the body that can be measured and which is an input to cognition, undercutting the complexity of emotional experience.

The interactional approach asserts that though emotion has biophysical aspects, it is &quot;culturally grounded, dynamically experienced, and to some degree constructed in action and interaction&quot;. Put another way, it considers &quot;emotion as a social and cultural product experienced through our interactions&quot;.

<text>An external combustion engine (EC engine) is a reciprocating heat engine where a working fluid, contained internally, is heated by combustion in an external source, through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. The fluid then, by expanding and acting on the mechanism of the engine, produces motion and usable work. The fluid is then dumped (open cycle), or cooled, compressed and reused (closed cycle). 
In these types of engines, the combustion is primarily used as a heat source, and the engine can work equally well with other types of heat sources.

==Combustion==
&quot;Combustion&quot; refers to burning fuel with an oxidizer, to supply the heat. Engines of similar (or even identical) configuration and operation may use a supply of heat from other sources such as nuclear, solar, geothermal or exothermic reactions not involving combustion; they are not then strictly classed as external combustion engines, but as external thermal engines.

==Working fluid==
The working fluid can be of any composition and the system may be single-phase (liquid only or gas only) or dual-phase (liquid/gas).

===Single phase===
Gas is used in a Stirling engine. Single-phase liquid may sometimes be used.

===Dual phase===
Dual-phase external combustion engines use a phase transition to convert temperature to usable work, for example from liquid to (generally much larger) gas. This type of engine follows variants of the Rankine cycle. Steam engines are a common example of dual-phase engines. Another example is engines that use the Organic Rankine cycle.

<doc id="233953" wikidata="Q848010" url="?curid=233953" title="Database transaction">
<text>A database transaction symbolizes a unit of work, performed within a database management system (or similar system) against a database, that is treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database. Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes:

# To provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure. For example: when execution prematurely and unexpectedly stops (completely or partially) in which case many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status.
# To provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. If this isolation is not provided, the programs&#x27; outcomes are possibly erroneous.

In a database management system, a transaction is a single unit of logic or work, sometimes made up of multiple operations. Any logical calculation done in a consistent mode in a database is known as a transaction. One example is a transfer from one bank account to another: the complete transaction requires subtracting the amount to be transferred from one account and adding that same amount to the other.

A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic (it must either be complete in its entirety or have no effect whatsoever), consistent (it must conform to existing constraints in the database), isolated (it must not affect other transactions) and durable (it must get written to persistent storage). Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym ACID.

==Purpose==
Databases and other data stores which treat the integrity of data as paramount often include the ability to handle transactions to maintain the integrity of data. A single transaction consists of one or more independent units of work, each reading and/or writing information to a database or other data store. When this happens it is often important to ensure that all such processing leaves the database or data store in a consistent state.

Examples from double-entry accounting systems often illustrate the concept of transactions. In double-entry accounting every debit requires the recording of an associated credit. If one writes a check for $100 to buy groceries, a transactional double-entry accounting system must record the following two entries to cover the single transaction:

# Debit $100 to Groceries Expense Account
# Credit $100 to Checking Account

A transactional system would make both entries pass or both entries would fail. By treating the recording of multiple entries as an atomic transactional unit of work the system maintains the integrity of the data recorded. In other words, nobody ends up with a situation in which a debit is recorded but no associated credit is recorded, or vice versa.

==Transactional databases==
A transactional database is a DBMS that provides the ACID properties for a bracketed set of database operations (begin-commit). Transactions ensure that the database is always in a consistent state, even in the event of concurrent updates and failures. All the write operations within a transaction have an all-or-nothing effect, that is, either the transaction succeeds and all writes take effect, or otherwise, the database is brought to a state that does not include any of the writes of the transaction. Transactions also ensure that the effect of concurrent transactions satisfies certain guarantees, known as isolation level. The highest isolation level is serializability, which guarantees that the effect of concurrent transactions is equivalent to their serial (i.e. sequential) execution.

Most relational database management systems support transactions. NoSQL databases prioritize scalability along with supporting transactions in order to guarantee data consistency in the event of concurrent updates and accesses.

In a database system, a transaction might consist of one or more data-manipulation statements and queries, each reading and/or writing information in the database. Users of database systems consider consistency and integrity of data as highly important. A simple transaction is usually issued to the database system in a language like SQL wrapped in a transaction, using a pattern similar to the following:

# Begin the transaction.
# Execute a set of data manipulations and/or queries.
# If no error occurs, then commit the transaction.
# If an error occurs, then roll back the transaction.

A transaction commit operation persists all the results of data manipulations within the scope of the transaction to the database. A transaction rollback operation does not persist the partial results of data manipulations within the scope of the transaction to the database. In no case can a partial transaction be committed to the database since that would leave the database in an inconsistent state.

Internally, multi-user databases store and process transactions, often by using a transaction ID or XID.

There are multiple varying ways for transactions to be implemented other than the simple way documented above. Nested transactions, for example, are transactions which contain statements within them that start new transactions (i.e. sub-transactions). &quot;Multi-level transactions&quot; are a variant of nested transactions where the sub-transactions take place at different levels of a layered system architecture (e.g., with one operation at the database-engine level, one operation at the operating-system level). Another type of transaction is the compensating transaction.

===In SQL===
Transactions are available in most SQL database implementations, though with varying levels of robustness. For example, MySQL began supporting transactions from early version 3.23, but the InnoDB storage engine was not default before version 5.5. The earlier available storage engine, MyISAM does not support transactions.

A transaction is typically started using the command codice_1 (although the SQL standard specifies codice_2). When the system processes a codice_3 statement, the transaction ends with successful completion. A codice_4 statement can also end the transaction, undoing any work performed since codice_1. If autocommit was disabled with the start of a transaction, autocommit will also be re-enabled with the end of the transaction.

One can set the isolation level for individual transactional operations as well as globally. At the highest level (codice_6), the result of any operation performed after a transaction has started will remain invisible to other database users until the transaction has ended. At the lowest level (codice_7), which may occasionally be used to ensure high concurrency, such changes will be immediately visible.

==Object databases==
Relational databases are traditionally composed of tables with fixed-size fields and records. Object databases comprise variable-sized blobs, possibly serializable or incorporating a mime-type. The fundamental similarities between Relational and Object databases are the start and the commit or rollback.

After starting a transaction, database records or objects are locked, either read-only or read-write. Reads and writes can then occur. Once the transaction is fully defined, changes are committed or rolled back atomically, such that at the end of the transaction there is no inconsistency.

==Distributed transactions==
Database systems implement distributed transactions as transactions accessing data over multiple nodes. A distributed transaction enforces the ACID properties over multiple nodes, and might include systems such as databases, storage managers, file systems, messaging systems, and other data managers. In a distributed transaction there is typically an entity coordinating all the process to ensure that all parts of the transaction are applied to all relevant systems. Moreover, the integration of Storage as a Service (StaaS) within these environments is crucial, as it offers a virtually infinite pool of storage resources, accommodating a range of cloud-based data store classes with varying availability, scalability, and ACID properties. This integration is essential for achieving higher availability, lower response time, and cost efficiency in data-intensive applications deployed across cloud-based data stores.

==Transactional filesystems==
The Namesys Reiser4 filesystem for Linux supports transactions, and as of Microsoft Windows Vista, the Microsoft NTFS filesystem supports distributed transactions across networks. There is occurring research into more data coherent filesystems, such as the Warp Transactional Filesystem (WTF).

In other contexts where the object is accessed by reference object lifetime is not determined by the lifetime of a variable. For example, destruction of the variable may only destroy the reference; not the referenced object.

==Terminology==
Aspects of object lifetime vary between programming languages and within implementations of a language. The core concepts are relatively common, but terminology varies. For example, the concepts of create and destroy are sometimes termed construct and destruct and the language elements are termed constructor (ctor) and destructor (dtor).

==Determinism==

Creation of an object is generally &quot;deterministic&quot;, but destruction varies by programming context. Some contexts allow for deterministic destruction, but some do not. Notably, in a garbage-collection environment, objects are destroyed when the garbage collector chooses.

The syntax for creation and destruction varies by programming context. In many contexts, including C++, C# and Java, an object is created via special syntax like codice_1. In C++, that provides manual memory management, an object is destroyed via the codice_2 keyword. In C# and Java, with no explicit destruction syntax, the garbage collector destroys unused objects automatically and non-deterministically.

An alternative and deterministic approach to automatic destruction is where the object is destroyed when code decrements the object&#x27;s reference count to zero.

With an object pool, where objects may be created ahead of time and reused, the apparent creation and destruction of an object may not correspond to actual. The pool provides reinitialization for creation and finalization for destruction. Both creation and destruction may be non-deterministic.

Objects with static memory allocation have a lifetime that coincides with the run of a program, but the &quot;order&quot; of creation and destruction of the various static objects is generally non-deterministic.

==Life cycle==

Object life cycle refers to the events that an object experiences including and between creation and destruction.

Life cycle generally includes memory management and operations after allocation and before deallocation. Object creation generally consists of &quot;memory allocation&quot; and &quot;initialization&quot; where initialization includes assigning values to fields and running initialization code. Object destruction generally consists of &quot;finalization&quot; (a.k.a. cleanup) and &quot;memory deallocation&quot; (a.k.a. free). These steps generally proceed in order as: allocate, initialize, finalize, deallocate. 

Based on programming context, these steps may be partially or fully automated, and some of the steps can be customized.

The frequency of customization tends to vary by step and programming context. Initialization is the most commonly customized step. Finalization is common in languages with deterministic destruction, notably C++, but rare in garbage-collected languages. Allocation is rarely customized, and deallocation generally cannot be customized.

===Creation===

The way to create objects varies across programming contexts. In some class-based languages, a &quot;constructor&quot; handles initialization. Like other methods, a constructor can be overloaded in order to support creating with different initial state.

===Destruction===
Generally, an object is removed from memory after it is no longer needed. However, if there is sufficient memory or a program has a short run time, object destruction may not occur; memory simply being deallocated at process termination. 

In some cases, object destruction consists solely of deallocating memory, particularly with garbage-collection, or if the object is a plain old data structure. In other cases, cleanup is performed prior to deallocation, particularly destroying member objects (in manual memory management), or deleting references from the object to other objects to decrement reference counts (in reference counting). This may be automatic, or a special destruction method may be called on the object.

In class-based languages with deterministic object lifetime, notably C++, a &quot;destructor&quot; is called when an instance is deleted, before the memory is deallocated. In C++, destructors differ from constructors in various ways. They cannot be overloaded, must have no arguments, need not maintain class invariants, and can cause program termination if they throw exceptions.

With garbage collection, objects may be destroyed when they can no longer be accessed by the program. The garbage-collector calls a &quot;finalizer&quot; before memory deallocation. 

Destroying an object will cause any references to the object to become invalid. With manual memory management, any existing reference becomes a dangling reference. With garbage collection, objects are only destroyed when there are no references to them.

==Consistency==

Object lifetime begins when allocation completes and ends when deallocation starts. Thus, during initialization and finalization, an object is alive, but may not be in a consistent state. The period between when initialization completes to when finalization starts is when the object is both alive and in a consistent state.

If creation or destruction fail, error reporting (for example, raising an exception) can be complicated since the object or related objects may be in an inconsistent state.

For a static variable, with lifespan coinciding with the program run, a creation or destruction error is problematic since program execution is before or after normal execution.

==Class-based programming==

In class-based programming, object creation is also known as &quot;instantiation&quot; (creating an &quot;instance&quot; of a &quot;class&quot;). Creation and destruction can be customized via a &quot;constructor&quot; and a &quot;destructor&quot; and sometimes with separate &quot;initializer&quot; and &quot;finalizer&quot; methods.

Notably, a constructor is a class method as there is no object (instance) available until the object is created, but destructors, initializers, and finalizers are instance methods. 

Further, constructors and initializers often can accept arguments, while destructors and finalizers generally do not as they are often implicitly callable.

==Resource management==

In languages with deterministic lifetime objects, lifetime may be used to piggyback resource management. This is called the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom. Resources are acquired during initialization, and released during finalization. In languages with non-deterministic lifetime objects (i.e. garbage collected), the management of memory is generally kept separate from management of other resources.

==Examples==

===C++===

A C++ class can be declared with defaults as:
class Foo {};
When declared in an automatic context, the object is destroyed at the close of the block it is declared.
int bar() {
 Foo foo;
 // foo is destroyed here


When created dynamically, it lives until it is explicitly destroyed.
int bar() {
 Foo *pFoo = new Foo();
 delete pFoo;


===Java===

A Java class can be declared with defaults as:
class Foo {}
After an instance is created (i.e. codice_3) it lives until it has no references and the garbage collector deletes it.

===Rust===

Rust uses lifetime annotations to declare the lifetime of arguments passed into a function. The lifetime is declared in the function signature within angle brackets. In this example a reference to the struct is passed into the function with the lifetime annotation .

<text>An anti-pattern in software engineering, project management, and business processes is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive. The term, coined in 1995 by computer programmer Andrew Koenig, was inspired by the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; (which highlights a number of design patterns in software development that its authors considered to be highly reliable and effective) and first published in his article in the &quot;Journal of Object-Oriented Programming&quot;.
A further paper in 1996 presented by Michael Ackroyd at the Object World West Conference also documented anti-patterns.

It was, however, the 1998 book &quot;AntiPatterns&quot; that both popularized the idea and extended its scope beyond the field of software design to include software architecture and project management.
Other authors have extended it further since to encompass environmental, organizational, and cultural anti-patterns.

== Definition ==
According to the authors of &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, there are two key elements to an anti-pattern that distinguish it from a bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:

# The anti-pattern is a commonly-used process, structure or pattern of action that, despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones.
# Another solution exists to the problem the anti-pattern is attempting to address. This solution is documented, repeatable, and proven to be effective where the anti-pattern is not.

A guide to what is commonly used is a &quot;rule-of-three&quot; similar to that for patterns: to be an anti-pattern it must have been witnessed occurring at least three times.

== Uses ==
Documenting anti-patterns can be an effective way to analyze a problem space and to capture expert knowledge.

While some anti-pattern descriptions merely document the adverse consequences of the pattern, good anti-pattern documentation also provides an alternative, or a means to ameliorate the anti-pattern.

== Software engineering anti-patterns ==
In software engineering, anti-patterns include the big ball of mud (lack of) design, the god object (where a single class handles all control in a program rather than control being distributed across multiple classes), magic numbers (unique values with an unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could be replaced with a named constant), and poltergeists (ephemeral controller classes that only exist to invoke other methods on classes).

===Big ball of mud===
This indicates a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. 

The term was popularized in Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder&#x27;s 1997 paper of the same name, which defines the term:

Foote and Yoder have credited Brian Marick as the originator of the &quot;big ball of mud&quot; term for this sort of architecture.

== Project management anti-patterns ==
Project management anti-patterns included in the &quot;Antipatterns&quot; book include:

* Blowhard Jamboree (an excess of industry pundits)
* Analysis paralysis
* Viewgraph Engineering (too much time spent making presentations and not enough on the actual software)
* Death by Planning (similarly, too much planning)
* Fear of Success (irrational fears near to project completion)
* The Corncob (difficulties with people)
* Intellectual Violence (intimidation through use of jargon or arcane technology)
* Irrational Management (bad management habits)
* Smoke and Mirrors (excessive use of demos and prototypes by salespeople)
* Throw It Over the Wall (forcing fad software engineering practices onto developers without buy-in)
* Fire Drill (long periods of monotony punctuated by short crises)
* The Feud (conflicts between managers)
* e-mail Is Dangerous (situations resulting from ill-advised e-mail messages).

<text>In language, an archaism is a word, a sense of a word, or a style of speech or writing that belongs to a historical epoch beyond living memory, but that has survived in a few practical settings or affairs. Lexical archaisms are single archaic words or expressions used regularly in an affair (e.g. religion or law) or freely; literary archaism is the survival of archaic language in a traditional literary text such as a nursery rhyme or the deliberate use of a style characteristic of an earlier age—for example, in his 1960 novel &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot;, John Barth writes in an 18th-century style. Archaic words or expressions may have distinctive emotional connotations—some can be humorous (&quot;forsooth&quot;), some highly formal (&quot;What say you?&quot;), and some solemn (&quot;With thee do I plight my troth&quot;). 
The word &quot;archaism&quot; is from the , &quot;archaïkós&quot;, &#x27;old-fashioned, antiquated&#x27;, ultimately , &quot;archaîos&quot;, &#x27;from the beginning, ancient&#x27;.

A distinction between archaic and obsolete words and word senses is widely used by dictionaries. An archaic word or sense is one that still has some current use but whose use has dwindled to a few specialized contexts, outside which it connotes old-fashioned language. In contrast, an obsolete word or sense is one that is no longer used at all. A reader encounters them when reading texts that are centuries old. For example, the works of Shakespeare are old enough that some obsolete words or senses are encountered therein, for which glosses (annotations) are often provided in the margins.

Archaisms can either be used deliberately (to achieve a specific effect) or as part of a specific jargon (for example in law) or formula (for example in religious contexts). Many nursery rhymes contain archaisms. Some archaisms called fossil words remain in use within certain fixed expressions despite having faded away in all other contexts (for example, &quot;&quot; is not used in normal English outside the set phrase &quot;vim and vigor&quot;).

An outdated form of language is called archaic. In contrast, a language or dialect that contains many archaic traits (archaisms) relative to closely related languages or dialects spoken &quot;at the same time&quot; is called conservative.

==Usage==
Archaisms are most frequently encountered in history, poetry, fantasy literature, law, philosophy, science, technology, geography and ritual writing and speech. Archaisms are kept alive by these ritual and literary uses and by the study of older literature. Should they remain recognised, they can potentially be revived.

Because they are things of continual discovery and re-invention, science and technology have historically generated forms of speech and writing which have dated and fallen into disuse relatively quickly. However, the emotional associations of certain words have kept them alive, for example the archaic &#x27;wireless&#x27; rather than &#x27;radio&#x27; for a generation of British citizens who lived through the Second World War; but in recent years the term has been repurposed as a non-archaic term for wifi and cell-phone technology. 

A similar desire to evoke a former age means that archaic place names are frequently used in circumstances where doing so conveys a political or emotional subtext, or when the official new name is not recognised by all (for example: &#x27;Madras&#x27; rather than &#x27;Chennai&#x27;). So, a restaurant seeking to conjure up historic associations might prefer to call itself &quot;Old Bombay&quot; or refer to &quot;Persian cuisine&quot; in preference to using the newer place name. A notable contemporary example is the airline Cathay Pacific, which uses the archaic Cathay for China.

Archaisms are frequently misunderstood, leading to changes in usage. One example is the phrase &quot;odd man out&quot;, which originally came from the phrase &quot;to find the odd man out&quot;, where the verb &quot;to find out&quot; has been split by its object &quot;the odd man&quot;, meaning the item which does not fit. The object + split verb has been reinterpreted as a noun + adjective, such that &quot;out&quot; describes the man rather than any verb.

The pronominal adverbs found in the writing of lawyers (e.g. &quot;heretofore&quot;, &quot;hereunto&quot;, &quot;thereof&quot;) are examples of archaisms as a form of jargon. Some phraseologies, especially in religious contexts, retain archaic elements that are not used in ordinary speech in any other context: &quot;With this ring I thee wed.&quot; Archaisms are also used in the dialogue of historical novels to evoke the flavour of the period. Some may count as inherently funny words and are used for humorous effect.

== Examples ==
A type of archaism is the use of &quot;thou&quot;, the second-person singular pronoun that fell out of general use in the 17th century, while &quot;you&quot; or &quot;ye&quot;, formerly only used to address groups, and then also to respectfully address individuals, is now used to address both individuals and groups. &quot;Thou&quot; is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is &quot;thee&quot; (functioning as both accusative and dative), and the possessive is &quot;thy&quot; or &quot;thine&quot;.

Though thou hast ever so many counsellors, yet do not forsake the counsel of thy own soul.
:— English proverb
Today me, tomorrow thee.
:— English proverb

That is: today this happens to me, but tomorrow to you.

To thine own self be true.
: —William Shakespeare

Archaisms often linger in proverbs, &quot;falling easier on the tongue&quot;,
and employing two of the four fundamental rhetorical effects, permutation (immutatio) and addition (adiectio).

<text>John Thomas Grinder Jr. ( ; born January 10, 1940) is an American linguist, writer, management consultant, trainer and speaker. Grinder is credited with co-creating the pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) with Richard Bandler. He is co-director of Quantum Leap Inc., a management consulting firm founded by his partner Carmen Bostic St. Clair in 1987 (Grinder joined in 1989). Grinder and Bostic St. Clair also run workshops and seminars on NLP internationally.

==Life and career==
Grinder graduated from the University of San Francisco with a B.A. degree in psychology in the early 1960s. Grinder then entered the United States Army and served as a captain in the US Special Forces in Europe during the Cold War; following this he went on to work for a US intelligence agency. In the late 1960s, he returned to college to study linguistics and received his Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego in 1971. His dissertation, titled &quot;On Deletion Phenomena in English&quot;, was published by Mouton in 1976.

In the early 1970s, Grinder worked in George A. Miller&#x27;s laboratory at Rockefeller University. After receiving his doctorate, Grinder took a full-time position as an assistant professor in the linguistics faculty at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). He engaged in undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching, and research. His research focused on Noam Chomsky&#x27;s theories of transformational grammar specializing in syntax and deletion phenomena. He published several research papers with Paul Postal on the syntactical structures relating to &quot;missing antecedents&quot; or missing parasitic gaps for the pronoun. They argued that the syntactic structure of a deleted verb phrase (VP) is complete.
Edward Klima, doctoral adviser to both Postal and Grinder at UCSC, became involved in the early development of generative semantics.

Grinder co-authored, with Suzette Elgin, a linguistics text book titled &quot;A Guide to Transformational Grammar: History, Theory, Practice&quot;. In 2005, Grinder published &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Emergence&quot; with Tom Malloy and Carmen Bostic St Clair in the journal &quot;Cybernetics and Human Knowing&quot;.

==Development of neuro-linguistic programming==

In 1972 (during Grinder&#x27;s stint at UCSC) Richard Bandler, an undergraduate student of psychology, approached him for assistance in specific aspects of modeling Gestalt therapy. Bandler, along with good friend Frank Pucelik, had spent much time recording and editing recordings of Fritz Perls (founder of Gestalt therapy) and had learned Gestalt therapy implicitly during intense group sessions. After some time, Grinder was invited to participate in group discussions. Although at first Grinder sat quietly, he eventually approached Bandler and Pucelik with some observations and questions. Grinder left a lasting impression on Pucelik and was later dubbed &#x27;the real genius&#x27;. Bandler and Pucelik invited Grinder to team up, eventually creating a very close group. Although Bandler, Grinder and Pucelik were the main driving force, there were several other students at the university who contributed ‘a hell of a lot’ according to Pucelik. In the end, hours of unpaid research significantly aided the formation of Meta - modern day NLP.

From there Grinder and Bandler modelled the various cognitive behavioral patterns of therapists such as Perls, a leading figure in family therapy Virginia Satir and later the leading figure in hypnosis in psychiatry Milton Erickson. As a result, &quot;The Structure of Magic&quot; Volumes I &amp; II (1975, 1976), &quot;Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson&quot;, Volumes I &amp; II (1975, 1977) and &quot;Changing With Families&quot; (1976) were published. This work formed the basis of the methodology that became the foundation of neuro-linguistic programming.

The trio began hosting seminars and practice groups. These served as a place to practice and test their newly discovered patterns while allowing them to transfer the skills to the participants. Several books were published based on transcripts of their seminars, including &quot;Frogs into Princes&quot; (1979). During this period, a creative group of students and psychotherapists were asked to join including Robert Dilts, Leslie Cameron-Bandler, Judith DeLozier, Stephen Gilligan and David Gordon (All of whom are considered the second generation of co-developers; recruited by Bandler, Grinder and Pucelik after the original team graduated from university).

In the 1977, Bandler requested that Pucelik be removed from the group for personal reasons - which was agreed to by immediate mutual consent. It wasn&#x27;t long after that that Bandler, Grinder and their group of associates split acrimoniously, and stopped working together. Following this, many members of their group went out on their own and took NLP in their own directions. Some of Bandler and Grinder&#x27;s books went out of print for a while due to legal problems between the co-authors. &quot;Structure I &amp; II&quot;, and &quot;Patterns I &amp; II&quot; – considered the foundation of the field – were later republished. Bandler attempted to claim legal ownership of the term neuro-linguistic programming; however, it was eventually deemed to be a generic term, and could therefore not be trademarked. Grinder and Bandler settled their claims around 2001, clearing a platform for the future development of NLP as a legitimate field of endeavor.

===New code of neuro-linguistic programming===

Between 1982 and 1987, strongly influenced by anthropologist and systems theorist Gregory Bateson, who had a strong focus on ecology as a psychological construct, Grinder and Judith DeLozier collaborated to develop the &quot;New Code of NLP&quot;. (Grinder and Bateson had met during their affiliation with Kresge College at the University of California, Santa Cruz during the 1970s.) Grinder and Delozier presented an aesthetic framework for the &quot;classic code&quot; of NLP that explicates the involvement of ecology and the unconscious mind in change-work. &quot;Ecology&quot; in NLP involves respecting the integrity of a system as a whole when assessing a change to that system; the &quot;system&quot; in this case comprises a person&#x27;s model of the world and the consequences of that model in the person&#x27;s environment. Practically speaking, this consideration entails asking questions like &quot;What are the intended effects of this change? What other effects might this change have, and are those effects desirable? Is this change still a good idea?&quot;

The seminars were transcribed and published in 1987 as &quot;Turtles All the Way Down; Prerequisites to Personal Genius&quot;.

John Grinder and Carmen Bostic St Clair have further developed The New Code of NLP. (Bostic St Clair founded Quantum Leap Inc., a cultural-change consultancy firm.) Grinder and Bostic St Clair continue to present public seminars on NLP internationally. In 2001, Grinder (with Bostic St Clair) published &quot;Whispering in the Wind&quot; with a &quot;set of recommendations as to how specifically NLP can improve its practice and take its rightful place as a scientifically based endeavor with its precise focus on modeling of the extremes of human behavior: excellence and the high performers who actually do it&quot;. Grinder has since begun to strongly encourage the field to make a recommitment to what he considers the core activity of NLP: modeling.

<text>Richard Wayne Bandler (born 1950) is an American writer, consultant, and public speaker in the field of self-help. With John Grinder, he founded the neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) approach to psychotherapy in the 1970s, which is considered pseudoscience.

==Early life and education==
Richard Wayne Bandler was born in Teaneck, New Jersey and attended high school in Sunnyvale, California. He has stated that he was beaten as a child so badly that every bone in his body was broken. After his parents separated, he moved with his mother and stayed mostly in and around San Francisco. Bandler obtained a BA degree in philosophy and psychology from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in 1973, and an MA degree in psychology from Lone Mountain College in San Francisco in 1975.

==Neuro-linguistic programming==
Bandler helped publisher Robert S. Spitzer (of Science and Behavior Books, Inc.) edit &quot;The Gestalt Approach&quot; (1973) based on a manuscript by gestalt therapist Fritz Perls (who had died in 1970). He also assisted with checking transcripts for &quot;Eye Witness to Therapy&quot; (1973). According to Spitzer, &quot;[Bandler] came out of it talking and acting like Fritz Perls.&quot;

While a student at UCSC, Bandler also led a Gestalt therapy group. John Grinder, a professor at the University, said to Bandler that he could explain almost all the questions and comments Bandler made using transformational grammar. Grinder&#x27;s specialty was in linguistics. Together, they created what they called a &quot;therapist training group&quot;. This was the basis for their first book, &quot;The Structure of Magic&quot; (1975). Bandler and Grinder claim to have later codified some of the foundational models for neuro-linguistic programming in part by studying the methods of Milton Erickson and Virginia Satir.

==Murder trial and acquittal==
In 1986, Corine Ann Christensen (December 8, 1954 – November 3, 1986), a former girlfriend of Bandler&#x27;s friend and cocaine dealer, James Marino, was shot dead in her Santa Cruz townhouse with a .357 magnum owned by Bandler. Authorities charged Bandler with her murder. Bandler testified that he had been at Christensen&#x27;s house, but that Marino had shot Christensen. After a short deliberation, a jury found Bandler not guilty.

<text>The Vancouver Sun, also known as the Sun, is a daily broadsheet newspaper based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The newspaper is currently published by the Pacific Newspaper Group, a division of Postmedia Network, and is the largest newspaper in western Canada by circulation. Since 2022, it is published five days a week from Tuesday to Saturday.

The newspaper was first published on 12 February 1912. It quickly expanded by acquiring other papers, such as the &quot;Daily News-Advertiser&quot; and &quot;The Evening World&quot;. In 1963, the Cromie family sold the majority of its holdings in the &quot;Sun&quot; to FP Publications, who later sold the newspaper to Southam Inc. in 1980. The newspaper was taken over by Hollinger Inc. in 1992, and was later sold again to CanWest in 2000. In 2010, the newspaper became part of the Postmedia Network as a result of the collapse of CanWest.

== History ==

The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; published its first edition on 12 February 1912. The newspaper was originally based at 125 West Pender Street, just around the corner from &quot;The Vancouver Daily Province&quot;, its rival at the time. In 1917, the &quot;Sun&quot; acquired the &quot;Daily News-Advertiser&quot;, a newspaper that was established in 1886. From 1917 until his death in 1936, its publisher was Robert James Cromie. In 1924, the &quot;Sun&quot; acquired &quot;The Evening World&quot;, another newspaper established in 1888.

In March 1937, a fire destroyed the &quot;Sun&quot;&#x27;s business and editorial offices. The only death was the janitor, who suffered minor burns and smoke inhalation. The &quot;Sun&quot; promptly moved across the street into the World Building, where the &quot;World&quot; had been published. The building was accordingly renamed the Sun Tower. 

The &quot;Sun&quot; emerged as the city&#x27;s leading newspaper after &quot;The Vancouver Daily Province&quot; experienced a lengthy labour dispute from 1946 to 1949.

In 1958, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; joined to create the &quot;Pacific Press&quot; in response to the rising costs of producing newspapers. First the papers merged their mechanical and financial departments, then they both moved into the Pacific Press Building on December 27, 1965. 

In 1963, the majority of the Cromie family holdings in the newspaper were sold to FP Publications, who later sold it to Southam Inc. in 1980. In 1992, the newspaper was taken over by Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Inc.

The newspaper&#x27;s photography department became the first in the world to fully switch over to digital photography following the 1994 release of the Kodak DCS 400 series, which used a Nikon F90 body; the camera was developed by Kodak in collaboration with The Associated Press and each unit cost $16,950.

In 1997, Kennedy Heights, the printing press for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot;, was opened in Surrey. Later in 1997 the paper moved to Granville Square. In 2000, the newspaper was sold to CanWest.

In May 2009, the newspaper laid off long-time editorial cartoonist Roy Peterson who had been drawing for the paper since 1962.

In 2010, the newspaper became part of the Postmedia Network, as a result of the collapse of CanWest. In December 2011, after much research on the demographics of the greater Vancouver area, the newspaper launched a Chinese-language version &quot;Taiyangbao&quot; with original Chinese language content. According to an article broadcast on China Now on China Radio International (December 2011), the key to success was not necessarily to &quot;translate&quot; its English-language version into Chinese.

In January 2015, the Kennedy Heights printing press operation was shut down, resulting in 220 workers losing their jobs. Printing of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; were outsourced, each to different printing press operations.

In 2017, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; moved to East Vancouver, to the Broadway Tech Centre.

In October 2022, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; stopped printing the Monday editions.

==Content==
As a broadsheet newspaper, the &quot;Sun&quot; was not originally related to the Sun Media chain and its tabloid &quot;Sun&quot; papers in Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Edmonton. However, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and the tabloid &quot;Sun&quot; papers have been part of the same company since 2015, as a result of Postmedia&#x27;s acquisition of Sun Media.

===Editorial stances===
The newspaper was first established in 1912 to &quot;consistently advocate the principles of Liberalism&quot;. Under the Cromie family, the newspaper typically supported the Liberals, although they were often critical as well. Under Hollinger Inc., the newspaper was considered a middlebrow newspaper with a more socially and economically diverse readership than its competitor. While publishing under Hollinger, the &quot;Sun&quot;″s editorials, op-ed articles, and guest columns were unambiguously critical of the federal Liberal government.

== Circulation ==
The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; has seen, like most Canadian daily newspapers, a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 136,787 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

<doc id="233980" wikidata="Q5765758" url="?curid=233980" title="Paul Gottfried">
<text>Paul Edward Gottfried (born November 21, 1941) is an American paleoconservative political philosopher, historian, and writer. He is a former Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. He is editor-in-chief of the paleoconservative magazine &quot;Chronicles&quot;. He is an associated scholar at the Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank, and the US correspondent of &quot;Nouvelle École&quot;, a Nouvelle Droite journal.

Gottfried helped coin the term &quot;paleoconservative&quot; in 1986 and &quot;alternative right&quot; (with Richard Spencer) in 2008.&quot;&quot; The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has described him as a &quot;far-right thinker&quot;. He founded the H.L. Mencken Club, which the SPLC considers a white nationalist group. Although noted for working with far-right and alt-right groups and figures, he has said that he does &quot;not want to be in the same camp with white nationalists&quot; or associated with pro-Nazis, &quot;as somebody whose family barely escaped from the Nazis in the &#x27;30s&quot;. 

== Early life and education ==
Gottfried was born in 1941 in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Andrew Gottfried, was a furrier in Budapest who fled Hungary after the July Putsch of 1934. The family relocated to Bridgeport, Connecticut, soon after Paul Gottfried&#x27;s birth. Andrew Gottfried had a fur business in Bridgeport and was involved in its Hungarian Jewish community.

Gottfried attended Yeshiva University in New York as an undergraduate. He returned to Connecticut to attend Yale for graduate school, where he studied under Herbert Marcuse (with whom he disagreed). He defended his thesis on &quot;Catholic Romanticism in Munich, 1826–1834&quot; in 1968.

==Career==
Gottfried had written 13 books as of 2016. With Thomas Fleming in 1986 he coined the term &quot;paleoconservative&quot; (a term he identifies with), and with Richard Spencer in 2008 he coined &quot;alternative right&quot;. He has aimed to revitalize the Old Right to counter neoconservative and neoliberal influence in the conservative movement. He is considered a prominent reactionary critic of the Republican Party and has called himself a &quot;right-wing pluralist&quot;.

He is a former Horace Raffensperger Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship recipient. He moved to Elizabethtown after his first wife died, and taught at the college until &quot;a school official encouraged his early exit&quot;, according to a 2016 article in &quot;Tablet.&quot;

Gottfried was a friend of Richard Nixon after Nixon resigned from the presidency. Gottfried was expelled as a contributor to &quot;National Review&quot; in the 1980s; interviewed in 2017, he said &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;didn’t throw anybody out because they were racist,&quot; but alleged that it and the conservative movement had been captured by interests supportive of immigration and multiculturalism. In the 1980s, he edited the journal &quot;Continuity&quot; for the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which included some neo-Confederate writing. He was a key advisor in the 1990s to Pat Buchanan, notably during Buchanan&#x27;s campaign in the 1992 Republican primaries against President George H. W. Bush. He worked for the journal &quot;Telos&quot;, which embraced some far-right causes. He is opposed to nation-building and is a critic of American interventionist foreign policy; he additionally opposes the Zionist movement and the creation of the State of Israel. He has written that Murray Rothbard was a close friend and influence.

Gottfried is an associated scholar at the Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank. In 2018, he joined the Institut des sciences sociales, économiques et politiques (Institute of Social, Economic and Political Sciences), founded by Marion Maréchal and Thibaut Monnier, in Lyon, France. Gottfried is the US correspondent of &quot;Nouvelle École&quot;, a Nouvelle Droite journal founded by GRECE in 1968.

In 2008, Gottfried founded the H.L. Mencken Club, a group the SPLC has described as white nationalist. Richard Spencer was a board member. It is named for the famous writer H.L. Mencken; a &quot;Village Voice&quot; article about the club in 2013 noted Mencken&#x27;s casual racism. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; said the club was &quot;overwhelmingly geriatric&quot; and met in airport hotels near Baltimore. Marilyn Mayo of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Center on Extremism said the ADL did not consider the club a hate group, but that it &quot;attracts a number of white supremacists to their conferences&quot;.

Gottfried has spoken at &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conferences and written essays for VDARE. An &quot;Intelligencer&quot; article about the far right in 2017 summarized Gottfried as a &quot;nativist strategist&quot; who had &quot;spent a career agitating for an ethno-nationalist conservatism that celebrated white Western values and lamented what feminism and multiculturalism had done to dilute them&quot;.

=== Coining of &quot;alt-right&quot; and associations ===
Gottfried helped coin the term &quot;alternative right&quot; with a speech to the H.L. Mencken Club in 2008 envisioning a nationalist and populist right-wing movement; it was published by Richard Spencer in &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; with the title &quot;The Decline and Rise of the Alternative Right&quot;.&quot;&quot; Gottfried has been described as a former intellectual mentor to Spencer. As of 2010, according to the SPLC, Gottfried was a senior contributing editor at Alternative Right, a website edited by Spencer. He and Spencer co-edited a book in 2015.

In a 2016 article in the online magazine &quot;Tablet&quot; titled &quot;The Alt-Right&#x27;s Jewish Godfather&quot;, Gottfried said, &quot;Whenever I look at Richard [Spencer], I see my ideas coming back in a garbled form.&quot; He also said, &quot;I just do not want to be in the same camp with white nationalists,&quot; and &quot;As somebody whose family barely escaped from the Nazis in the &#x27;30s, I do not want to be associated with people who are pro-Nazi.&quot; Jacob Siegel, author of the &quot;Tablet&quot; article, described Gottfried as having &quot;tried to build a postfascist, postconservative politics of the far-right&quot; for the past 20 years, but that &quot;Spencer and his acolytes wanted to cross the threshold into fascist thought and beliefs&quot;.

In 2018, Robert Fulford of the &quot;National Post&quot; described Gottfried as the &quot;godfather of alt-right&quot; and wrote that Gottfried&#x27;s paleoconservative ideas were a major source of the alt-right phenomenon. Three weeks later, Gottfried published a response article objecting to some of its points. He wrote, &quot;I do know Richard Spencer and worked with him in 2010 when he edited the &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; website. We did develop the term &#x27;Alternative Right&#x27; together — it was a headline he put on one of my articles. But my subsequent strategic differences with him are a matter of public record, which should have been noted.&quot;

<text>Military robots are autonomous robots or remote-controlled mobile robots designed for military applications, from transport to search &amp; rescue and attack.

Some such systems are currently in use, and many are under development.
==History==

Broadly defined, military robots date back to World War II and the Cold War in the form of the German Goliath tracked mines and the Soviet teletanks. The introduction of the MQ-1 Predator drone was when &quot;CIA officers began to see the first practical returns on their decade-old fantasy of using aerial robots to collect intelligence&quot;.

The use of robots in warfare, although traditionally a topic for science fiction, is being researched as a possible future means of fighting wars. Already several military robots have been developed by various armies. Some believe the future of modern warfare will be fought by automated weapons systems. The U.S. military is investing heavily in the RQ-1 Predator, which can be armed with air-to-ground missiles and remotely operated from a command center in reconnaissance roles. DARPA has hosted competitions in 2004 &amp; 2005 to involve private companies and universities to develop unmanned ground vehicles to navigate through rough terrain in the Mojave Desert for a final prize of 2 million.

Artillery has seen promising research with an experimental weapons system named &quot;Dragon Fire II&quot; which automates loading and ballistics calculations required for accurate predicted fire, providing a 12-second response time to fire support requests. However, military weapons are prevented from being fully autonomous; they require human input at certain intervention points to ensure that targets are not within restricted fire areas as defined by Geneva Conventions for the laws of war.

There have been some developments towards developing autonomous fighter jets and bombers. The use of autonomous fighters and bombers to destroy enemy targets is especially promising because of the lack of training required for robotic pilots, autonomous planes are capable of performing maneuvers which could not otherwise be done with human pilots (due to high amount of G-force), plane designs do not require a life support system, and a loss of a plane does not mean a loss of a pilot. However, the largest drawback to robotics is their inability to accommodate for non-standard conditions. Advances in artificial intelligence in the near future may help to rectify this.

In 2020 a Kargu 2 drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya, according to a report from the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts on Libya, published in March 2021. This may have been the first time an autonomous killer robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings.

===In development===

*, a four-wheeled robot outfitted with several cameras, radar, and possibly a firearm, that automatically performs random or preprogrammed patrols around a military base or other government installation. It alerts a human overseer when it detects movement in unauthorized areas, or other programmed conditions. The operator can then instruct the robot to ignore the event, or take over remote control to deal with an intruder, or to get better camera views of an emergency. The robot would also regularly scan radio frequency identification tags (RFID) placed on stored inventory as it passed and report any missing items.
*Tactical Autonomous Combatant (TAC) units, described in Project Alpha study &quot;Unmanned Effects: Taking the Human out of the Loop&quot;.
*Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System is an experimental robotic weapons system being developed by the U.S. Army since 2005. It consists of a remotely operated sniper rifle attached to an unmanned autonomous helicopter. It is intended for use in urban combat or for several other missions requiring snipers. Flight tests are scheduled to begin in summer 2009.
* The &quot;Mobile Autonomous Robot Software&quot; research program was started in December 2003 by the Pentagon who purchased 15 Segways in an attempt to develop more advanced military robots. The program was part of a $26 million Pentagon program to develop software for autonomous systems.
* ACER
* Atlas (robot)
* Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot
* Dassault nEUROn (French UCAV)
* Dragon Runner
* MATILDA
* MULE (US UGV)
* R-Gator

==Effects and impact==

===Advantages===
Autonomous robotics would save and preserve soldiers&#x27; lives by removing serving soldiers, who might otherwise be killed, from the battlefield. Lt. Gen. Richard Lynch of the United States Army Installation Management Command and assistant Army chief of staff for installation stated at a 2011 conference:

Major Kenneth Rose of the US Army&#x27;s Training and Doctrine Command outlined some of the advantages of robotic technology in warfare:

Increasing attention is also paid to how to make the robots more autonomous, with a view of eventually allowing them to operate on their own for extended periods of time, possibly behind enemy lines. For such functions, systems like the Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot are being tried, which is intended to gain its own energy by foraging for plant matter. The majority of military robots are tele-operated and not equipped with weapons; they are used for reconnaissance, surveillance, sniper detection, neutralizing explosive devices, etc. Current robots that are equipped with weapons are tele-operated so they are not capable of taking lives autonomously. Advantages regarding the lack of emotion and passion in robotic combat is also taken into consideration as a beneficial factor in significantly reducing instances of unethical behavior in wartime. Autonomous machines are created not to be &quot;truly &#x27;ethical&#x27; robots&quot;, yet ones that comply with the laws of war (LOW) and rules of engagement (ROE). Hence the fatigue, stress, emotion, adrenaline, etc. that affect a human soldier&#x27;s rash decisions are removed; there will be no effect on the battlefield caused by the decisions made by the individual.

===Risks===
Human rights groups and NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots have started urging governments and the United Nations to issue policy to outlaw the development of so-called &quot;lethal autonomous weapons systems&quot; (LAWS). The United Kingdom opposed such campaigns, with the Foreign Office declaring that &quot;international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area&quot;.

In July 2015, over 1,000 experts in artificial intelligence signed a letter calling for a ban on autonomous weapons. The letter was presented in Buenos Aires at the 24th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-15) and was co-signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Noam Chomsky, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and Google DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, among others.

===Psychology===
American soldiers have been known to name the robots that serve alongside them. These names are often in honor of human friends, family, celebrities, pets, or are eponymic. The &#x27;gender&#x27; assigned to the robot may be related to the marital status of its operator.

Some affixed fictitious medals to battle-hardened robots, and even held funerals for destroyed robots. An interview of 23 explosive ordnance detection members shows that while they feel it is better to lose a robot than a human, they also felt anger and a sense of loss if they were destroyed. A survey of 746 people in the military showed that 80% either &#x27;liked&#x27; or &#x27;loved&#x27; their military robots, with more affection being shown towards ground rather than aerial robots. Surviving dangerous combat situations together increased the level of bonding between soldier and robot, and current and future advances in artificial intelligence may further intensify the bond with the military robots.

<doc id="233996" wikidata="Q654772" url="?curid=233996" title="Hostel">
<text>A hostel is a form of low-cost, short-term shared sociable lodging where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed in a dormitory sleeping 4–20 people, with shared use of a lounge and usually a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex and have private or shared bathrooms. Private rooms may also be available. Hostels are popular forms of lodging for backpackers, however very few impose age limits, so hostels are an option for travellers of all ages and styles. A hostel is shared accommodation for budget travelers and should not be confused with a hotel.
== Unique selling proposition ==
The benefits to travelers of hostels include lower costs and opportunities to meet people from different places, find travel partners, and share travel experiences. Some hostels, such as Hostelling International, cater to a niche market of travelers. Different hostels can be known for offering different experiences. For example, one hostel might feature in-house social gatherings such as movie nights or communal dinners, another might feature local tours, one might be known for its parties, and another might have a quieter place to relax in serenity, or be located on the beach. Newer hostels focus on a more trendy design, some of which are on par with boutique hotels. Some may cater to older digital nomads, global nomads, and perpetual travelers who prefer slightly more upmarket private rooms or a quieter atmosphere. Hostels may also differentiate themselves by being environmentally friendly ecohostels. In countries where wages are lower, the cost of staying at a hostel may be similar to staying in a budget hotel. 

== Accommodation services == 
Many hostels are locally owned and operated, and are usually cheaper than hotels. Hostels may offer long-term lodging to guests for free or at a discount in exchange for work as a receptionist or in housekeeping. There are approximately 10,000 hostels in Europe and approximately 300 hostels in the United States. In 2023, the hostel industry worldwide was estimated to be worth US$ 6 billion annually, and growing. The typical guest is between 16 and 34 years old, although it can vary depending on the country.
In addition to shared kitchen facilities, some hostels have a restaurant and/or bar. Washing machines and clothes dryers are often provided for an additional fee. Hostels sometimes provide luggage storage. Most hostels offer lockers for safely storing valuables. Some hostels do not provide linens. Some hostels may have a curfew and daytime lockouts. 

== Room rates ==
In some cities, hostels reported a higher average income per room than hotels. For example, in Honolulu, Hawaii, upscale hotels reported average daily room rates of $173 in 2006, while hostel rooms brought in as much as $200 per night, for rooms of eight guests paying $25 each. Even during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many hostels reported increased occupancy numbers at a time when hotel bookings were down.

== Youth travel ==
A 2013 study in Australia showed that youth travel was the fastest-growing travel demographic and that the hostel industry was growing at a faster rate than the hotel industry. It showed that youth travel can lead to higher overall spending due to longer trips than traditional vacations. In New Zealand, backpackers hostels had a 13.5% share of lodging guests/nights in 2007.

== Issues to consider ==

Guests are advised to be respectful of others:

* There is less privacy in a hostel than in a hotel. Sharing sleeping areas in a dormitory and bathrooms might not be comfortable for those requiring more privacy. However, the shared lodging makes it easier to meet new people. Some hostels encourage more social interaction between guests due to the shared sleeping areas and communal areas. Lounges typically have sofas and chairs, coffee tables, board games, books or book exchange, computers, and Internet access.
* Nearly all hostels have a shared communal kitchen area for the preparation of food and a storage area with refrigerators. Most hostels have a label system to identify the owner of the food. Some hostels will have a labeled &quot;free shelf&quot; where guests can leave unwanted food. Theft of food can happen. 
* Noise can make sleeping difficult, whether from snoring, talking, and social activities in the lounge, guests staying up with the light on, or someone either returning late from bars or leaving early. To mitigate the effects, many guests use earplugs and eye masks.

== History ==
In August 1909, Richard Schirrmann, a teacher in Germany, first published his idea of inexpensive accommodation for youth travel after leading a school camping trip that was derailed by a thunderstorm. Schirrmann received considerable support and opened a makeshift hostel for hikers in the school in which he taught. On June 1, 1912, Schirrmann opened the first hostel in Altena Castle. The original hostel rooms are now a museum. Schirrmann served in World War I and after observing the Christmas truce on the Western Front in December 1915, he wondered whether &quot;thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other&quot;. In 1919, he founded the German Youth Hostel Association. 

By 1932, Germany had more than 2,000 hostels recording more than 4.5 million overnights annually. The International Youth Hostel Federation (now Hostelling International) was founded in October 1932. It is now an organization composed of more than 90 hostel associations representing over 4,500 hostels in over 80 countries. These hostels cater more to school-aged children, sometimes through school trips, and families with school-aged children.

In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt was the honorary president of AYH (now Hostelling International USA). John D. Rockefeller III was a proponent of hostels and was president for several years.

During World War II, many hostels in Europe were temporarily shut down or placed under the control of the Hitler Youth.

In the 1960s and 1970s, hostelling prospered. The industry declined during the 1970s energy crisis. Hostels continued to grow during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, in part due to their cost appeal. After the Great Recession, the industry grew rapidly in New York City, Rome, Buenos Aires, and Miami. Following a 2010 New York State law 55 hostels in New York City closed, leaving about five which operated as hotels.

<doc id="233998" wikidata="Q160558" url="?curid=233998" title="Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn">
<text>Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (Arthur William Patrick Albert; 1 May 185016 January 1942) was the seventh child and third son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He served as Governor General of Canada, the tenth since Canadian Confederation and the only British prince to do so.

Arthur was educated by private tutors before entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich at 16 years old. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the British Army, where he served for some 40 years, seeing service in various parts of the British Empire. During this time, he was also created a royal duke, becoming Duke of Connaught and Strathearn as well as Earl of Sussex. In 1900, he was appointed as Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, which he regretted; his preference was to join the campaign against the Boers in South Africa. In 1911, he was appointed Governor General of Canada, replacing Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, as viceroy. He occupied this post until he was succeeded by Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, in 1916. He acted as the King&#x27;s, and thus the Canadian Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s, representative through the first years of the First World War.

After the end of his viceregal tenure, Arthur returned to the United Kingdom and performed various royal duties there and in Ireland, while also again taking up military duties. Though he retired from public life in 1928, he continued to make his presence known in the army well into the Second World War, before his death in 1942. He was Queen Victoria&#x27;s last surviving son.

==Early life==

Arthur was born at Buckingham Palace on 1 May 1850, the seventh child and third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The prince was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner, on 22 June in the palace&#x27;s private chapel. His godparents were Prince William of Prussia (the later King of Prussia and German Emperor Wilhelm I); his great-uncle&#x27;s sister-in-law, Princess Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (for whom his maternal grandmother the Duchess of Kent stood proxy); and the Duke of Wellington, with whom he shared his birthday and after whom he was named. As with his older brothers, Arthur received his early education from private tutors. It was reported that he became the Queen&#x27;s favourite child.

==Military career==

It was at an early age that Arthur developed an interest in the army, and in 1866 he followed through on his military ambitions by enrolling at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from where he graduated two years later and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers on 18 June 1868. The Prince transferred to the Royal Regiment of Artillery on 2 November 1868 and, on 2 August 1869, to the Rifle Brigade, his father&#x27;s own regiment, after which he pursued a long and distinguished career as an army officer, including service in South Africa, Canada in 1869, Ireland, Egypt in 1882, and in India from 1886 to 1890.
In Canada, Arthur, as an officer with the Montreal detachment of the Rifle Brigade, undertook a year&#x27;s training and engaged in defending the Dominion from the Fenian Raids; there was initially concern that his personal involvement in Canada&#x27;s defence might put the Prince in danger from Fenians and their supporters in the United States, but it was decided his military duty came first. Following his arrival at Halifax, Arthur toured the country for eight weeks and made a visit in January 1870 to Washington, D.C., where he met with President Ulysses S. Grant. During his service in Canada he was also entertained by Canadian society; among other activities, he attended an investiture ceremony in Montreal, was a guest at balls and garden parties, and attended the opening of parliament in Ottawa (becoming the first member of the royal family to do so), all of which was documented in photographs that were sent back for the Queen to view. On 25 May 1870 he was engaged in fending off Fenian invaders during the Battle of Eccles Hill, for which he received the Fenian Medal.

Arthur made an impression on many in Canada. He was given on 1 October 1869 the title &quot;Chief of the Six Nations&quot; by the Iroquois of the Grand River Reserve in Ontario and the name &quot;Kavakoudge&quot; (meaning the sun flying from east to west under the guidance of the Great Spirit), enabling him to sit in the tribe&#x27;s councils and vote on matters of tribe governance. As he became the 51st chief on the council, his appointment broke the centuries-old tradition that there should only be 50 chiefs of the Six Nations. Of the Prince, Lady Lisgar, wife of then Governor General of Canada Lord Lisgar, noted in a letter to Victoria that Canadians seemed hopeful Prince Arthur would one day return as governor general.

Arthur was promoted to the honorary rank of colonel on 14 June 1871, substantive lieutenant-colonel in 1876, colonel on 29 May 1880 and, on 1 April 13 years later, was made a general. He gained military experience as Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army from December 1886 to March 1890. He went on to be General officer commanding Southern District, at Portsmouth, from September 1890 to 1893. The Prince had hoped to succeed his first cousin once-removed, the elderly Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, upon the latter&#x27;s forced retirement in 1895. But this desire was denied to Arthur, and instead he was given, between 1893 and 1898, command of the Aldershot District Command.
He was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Rifle Brigade in 1880 and of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons in 1897, Honorary Colonel of the Isle of Wight Artillery Militia (later the &#x27;Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own&#x27;) in 1875 and of the 3rd (West Kent Militia) Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) in 1884. In August 1899 the 6th Battalion, Rifles of the Canadian Non-Permanent Active Militia, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, also asked Prince Arthur to give his name to the regiment and act as its honorary colonel. The regiment had recently been converted to the infantry role from the 2nd Battalion, 5th British Columbia Regiment of Canadian Artillery. With the Prince&#x27;s agreement the unit was renamed 6th Regiment, Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Rifles (DCORs) on 1 May 1900. He was subsequently appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment, then known as The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own), in 1923. He held that appointment until his death. Additionally, in 1890 he became patron of, giving his name to, the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars, which in 1958 amalgamated with 17th Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars, to become the Royal Canadian Hussars.

On 26 June 1902 he was promoted to the post of field marshal, and thereafter served in various important positions, including Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, from January 1900 to 1904, with the dual position of commander of the Third Army Corps from October 1901, and Inspector-General of the Forces, between 1904 and 1907.

For a brief period of time, after the May Coup that took place in Serbia in 1903, he was among those considered for the vacant Serbian throne after the extinction of the then ruling Obrenović dynasty. His succession was advocated particularly among the conservative anglophile circles, represented most prominently by Čedomilj Mijatović, then Serbian ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. 

==Peerage, marriage, and family==
On his mother&#x27;s birthday (24 May) in 1874, Arthur was created a royal peer, being titled as the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Earl of Sussex. Some years later, Arthur came into the direct line of succession to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany, upon the death in 1899 of his nephew, Prince Alfred of Edinburgh, the only son of his elder brother, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. He decided, however, to renounce his own and his son&#x27;s succession rights to the duchy, which then passed to his other nephew, Prince Charles Edward, the posthumous son of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.

At St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 13 March 1879, Arthur married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Frederick Charles and a great-niece of the German Emperor, Arthur&#x27;s godfather, Wilhelm I. The couple had three children: Princess Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah (15 January 1882 – 1 May 1920), Prince Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert (13 January 1883 – 12 September 1938), and Princess Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth (17 March 1886 – 12 January 1974), who were all raised at the Connaughts&#x27; country home, Bagshot Park, in Surrey, and after 1900 at Clarence House, the Connaughts&#x27; London residence. Through his children&#x27;s marriages, Arthur became the father-in-law of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden; Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife; and Sir Alexander Ramsay. The Duke&#x27;s first two children predeceased him; Margaret while pregnant with his sixth grandchild. For many years, Arthur maintained a liaison with Leonie, Lady Leslie, sister of Jennie Churchill, while still remaining devoted to his wife.

==Royal duties==
Alongside his military career, the Duke continued to undertake royal duties beyond, or only vaguely associated with, the army. He also represented the monarchy throughout the Empire. On the return from a posting in India, he again, this time with his wife, toured Canada in 1890, stopping in all major cities across the country. He also toured Canada in 1906. In January 1903, the Duke and Duchess represented the new King Edward VII at the 1903 Delhi Durbar to celebrate his accession. On their way to India, the couple passed through Egypt where the Duke opened the Aswan dam on 10 December 1902.

In 1910, Arthur travelled aboard the Union-Castle Line ship &quot;Balmoral Castle&quot; to South Africa, to open the first parliament of the newly formed Union of South Africa, and in Johannesburg on 30 November he laid a commemorative stone at the Rand Regiments Memorial, dedicated to the British soldiers that died during the Second Boer War.

Prince Arthur was a Freemason and was elected as Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England when his elder brother was obliged to resign the office upon his accession in 1901 as King Edward VII. He was subsequently re-elected an additional 37 times before 1939, when the Prince was nearly 90 years of age.

==Governor General of Canada==
It was announced on 6 March 1911 that King George V had, by commission under the royal sign-manual, approved the recommendation of his British prime minister, H.H. Asquith, to appoint Arthur as Governor General of Canada, the representative of the monarch. His brother-in-law, John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, had previously served as the country&#x27;s governor general, but when Arthur was sworn in on 13 October 1911 in the &quot;salon rouge&quot; of the parliament buildings of Quebec, he became the first Governor General who was a member of the British royal family.

To Canada, Arthur brought with him his wife and his youngest daughter, the latter of whom would become an extremely popular figure with Canadians. The Governor General and his viceregal family travelled throughout the country, performing such constitutional and ceremonial tasks as opening parliament in 1911 (for which Arthur wore his field marshal&#x27;s uniform and the Duchess of Connaught wore the gown she had worn at the King&#x27;s coronation earlier that year) and, in 1917, laying at the newly rebuilt Centre Block on Parliament Hill the same cornerstone his older brother, the late King Edward VII, had set on 1 September 1860, when the original building was under construction. The family crossed the country a number of times and the Governor General made another trip to the United States in 1912, when he met with President William Howard Taft.

When in Ottawa, Connaught maintained a routine of four days each week at his office on Parliament Hill and held small, private receptions for members of all political parties and dignitaries. The Duke learned to ice skate and hosted skating parties at his official residence Rideau Hall to which the Connaughts made many physical improvements during Arthur&#x27;s term as governor general. The royal family also took to camping and other outdoor sports, such as hunting and fishing.

In 1914, the First World War broke out, with Canadians called to arms against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Arthur maintained a wider role in the empire for instance, from 1912 until his death, serving as Colonel-in-Chief of the Cape Town Highlanders Regiment but the Connaughts remained in Canada after the beginning of the global conflict, Arthur emphasising the need for military training and readiness for Canadian troops departing for war, and giving his name to the Connaught Cup for the Royal North-West Mounted Police, to encourage pistol marksmanship for recruits. He was also active in auxiliary war services and charities and conducted hospital visits. Though well intended, upon the outbreak of the war, Arthur immediately donned his field marshal&#x27;s uniform and went, without advice or guidance from his ministers, to training grounds and barracks to address the troops and to see them off before their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of Prime Minister Robert Borden, who saw the Prince as overstepping constitutional conventions. Borden placed blame on the military secretary, Edward Stanton (whom Borden considered to be &quot;mediocre&quot;), but also opined that Arthur &quot;laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the royal family and never realised his limitations as Governor General.&quot; At the same time, the Duchess of Connaught worked for St John Ambulance, the Red Cross, and other organisations to support the war cause. She was also Colonel-in-Chief of the Duchess of Connaught&#x27;s Own Irish Canadian Rangers battalion, one of the regiments in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and Princess Patricia also lent her name and support to the raising of a new Canadian army regiment Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry.

His term as Canada&#x27;s Governor General ended in 1916.

Following the war, Arthur commissioned in memory of Canada&#x27;s fallen a stained glass window which is located in St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Ottawa, which the family attended regularly.

==Later life==

After his years in Canada, the Duke held no similar public offices but undertook a number of public engagements. In 1920, he travelled to South Africa to open Chapman&#x27;s Peak Drive. The following year he travelled to India, where he officially opened the new Central Legislative Assembly, Council of State, and Chamber of Princes. During his time in India, the Indian National Congress&#x27;s first satyagraha was ongoing; as part of this, shops were closed and few Indians attended the official ceremonies when he visited Calcutta in the same year. As president of the Boy Scouts Association and one of Lord Baden-Powell&#x27;s friends and admirers, he performed the official opening of the 3rd World Scout Jamboree at Arrowe Park.

The Duke also returned to military service and continued well into the Second World War, where he was seen as a grandfather figure by aspiring recruits. The Duchess, who had been ill during their years at Rideau Hall, had died in March 1917, and Arthur mostly withdrew from public life in 1928; his last formal engagement was the opening of the Connaught Gardens in Sidmouth, Devon, on 3 November 1934.

==Death==
Prince Arthur died on 16 January 1942 at Bagshot Park, at the age of 91 years, 8 months and 16 days, the same age as his elder sister, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, who had died two years and one month before. A funeral service for the Duke was held at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle on 23 January, after which his body was placed temporarily in the Royal Vault beneath the chapel. He was reburied on 19 March 1942 in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. He was Queen Victoria&#x27;s last surviving son. His will was sealed in Llandudno after his death in 1942. His estate was valued at £150,677 (or £4.9 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

== Legacy ==
His great-nephew King Edward VIII remembered Prince Arthur in his memoirs:&quot;His manners were faultless; his courtesy invested his simplest action with dignity and naturalness. I would not have called him a completely happy man. His family life had not been without sadness. As a younger brother and later the uncle and great-uncle of successive Sovereigns he had always had to play second fiddle in the affairs of the Royal Family. Yet, he never shirked the onerous demands made upon his services. As a sponsor of a multitude of national institutions and undertakings he was a distinguished figure in public life. In his personal philosophy, he was urbane, tolerant and wise. Even when I sometimes found myself in rebellion against some of the things of the world of which he was a part, I nevertheless felt that, while he might not necessarily approve the course I had in mind, he would view it in a sympathetic and understanding light.&quot;

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

As a member of the royal family and having been a viceroy, Prince Arthur held a number of titles and styles during his life. He was also the recipient of many honours, both domestic and foreign. He was an active member of the military, eventually reaching the rank of Field Marshal, and served as personal aide-de-camp to four successive sovereigns.

<doc id="234004" wikidata="Q4692255" url="?curid=234004" title="Aggregate pattern">
<text>An Aggregate pattern can refer to concepts in either statistics or computer programming. Both uses simplify complexity into smaller, simpler parts.

== Statistics ==
An aggregate pattern is an important statistical concept in many fields that rely on statistics to predict the behavior of large groups, based on the tendencies of subgroups to consistently behave in a certain way. It is particularly useful in sociology, economics, psychology, and criminology.

== Computer programming ==

In &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, an aggregate is not a design pattern but rather refers to an object such as a list, vector, or generator which provides an interface for creating iterators. The following example code is in Python.

def fibonacci(n: int):
 a, b = 0, 1
 count = 0
 while count &lt; n:
 count += 1
 a, b = b, a + b
 yield a

for x in fibonacci(10):
 print(x)

def fibsum(n: int) -&gt; int:
 total = 0
 for x in fibonacci(n):
 total += x
 return total

def fibsum_alt(n: int) -&gt; int:
 Alternate implementation. demonstration that Python&#x27;s built-in function sum()
 works with arbitrary iterators.
 return sum(fibonacci(n))

myNumbers = [1, 7, 4, 3, 22]

def average(g) -&gt; float:
 return float(sum(g)) / len(g) # In Python 3 the cast to float is no longer be necessary

Python hides essentially all of the details using the iterator protocol. Confusingly, &quot;Design Patterns&quot; uses &quot;aggregate&quot; to refer to the blank in the code codice_1 which is unrelated to the term &quot;aggregation&quot;. Neither of these terms refer to the statistical aggregation of data such as the act of adding up the Fibonacci sequence or taking the average of a list of numbers.

<doc id="234017" wikidata="Q132110" url="?curid=234017" title="The Province">
<text>The Province is a daily newspaper published in tabloid format in British Columbia by Pacific Newspaper Group, a division of Postmedia Network, alongside the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; broadsheet newspaper. Together, they are British Columbia&#x27;s only two major newspapers.

Formerly a broadsheet, &quot;The Province&quot; later became tabloid paper-size. It publishes daily except Saturdays, Mondays (as of October 17, 2022) and selected holidays.

== History ==

&quot;The Province&quot; was established as a weekly newspaper in Victoria in 1894. A 1903 article in the &quot;Pacific Monthly&quot; described the &quot;Province&quot; as the largest and the youngest of Vancouver&#x27;s important newspapers.

In 1923, the Southam family bought &quot;The Province&quot;. By 1945, the paper&#x27;s printers went out on strike. &quot;The Province&quot; had been the best selling newspaper in Vancouver, ahead of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;News Herald&quot;. As a result of the six-week strike, it lost significant market share, at one point falling to third place. In 1957, &quot;The Province&quot; and the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; were sold to Pacific Press Limited which was jointly owned by both newspaper companies.

A 1970 strike by Pacific Press employees shut down the &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Province&quot; for three months; in the interim, the &quot;Vancouver Express&quot; published daily editions. It ended on May 13 and resulted in increased pay for employees and a trustee pension fund with a board that included management and union representatives.

== Circulation ==
&quot;The Province&quot; has seen, like most Canadian daily newspapers, a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 114,467 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

== CFCB/CKCD radio station ==
At 2 p.m. on March 23, 1922, the &quot;Province&quot; launched radio station CFCB, with news and stock market reports. There were news bulletins throughout the day, followed by music. Sign off was at 10 p.m. The station&#x27;s name changed to CKCD in 1923 and it moved to 730 kHz in 1925. In 1933 the paper turned its operations over to the Pacific Broadcasting Co., while continuing to supply news reports to the station.

In 1936, the newly formed Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, established to function as both broadcaster and broadcasting regulator (taking over the latter function from previous regulator the Department of Marine and Fisheries), asked CKCD to relinquish its licence, and the station signed off for the last time in February 1940.

<doc id="234018" wikidata="Q741248" url="?curid=234018" title="Assertion (software development)">
<text>In computer programming, specifically when using the imperative programming paradigm, an assertion is a predicate (a Boolean-valued function over the state space, usually expressed as a logical proposition using the variables of a program) connected to a point in the program, that always should evaluate to true at that point in code execution. Assertions can help a programmer read the code, help a compiler compile it, or help the program detect its own defects.

For the latter, some programs check assertions by actually evaluating the predicate as they run. Then, if it is not in fact true – an assertion failure – the program considers itself to be broken and typically deliberately crashes or throws an assertion failure exception.

== Details ==

The following code contains two assertions, codice_1 and codice_2, and they are indeed true at the indicated points during execution:

x = 1;
assert x &gt; 0;
x++;
assert x &gt; 1;
Programmers can use assertions to help specify programs and to reason about program correctness. For example, a precondition—an assertion placed at the beginning of a section of code—determines the set of states under which the programmer expects the code to execute. A postcondition—placed at the end—describes the expected state at the end of execution. For example: codice_3.

The example above uses the notation for including assertions used by C. A. R. Hoare in his 1969 article. That notation cannot be used in existing mainstream programming languages. However, programmers can include unchecked assertions using the comment feature of their programming language. For example, in C++:
x = 5;
x = x + 1;

The braces included in the comment help distinguish this use of a comment from other uses.

Libraries may provide assertion features as well. For example, in C using glibc with C99 support:
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

int f(void)
 int x = 5;
 x = x + 1;
 assert(x &gt; 1);


Several modern programming languages include checked assertions – statements that are checked at runtime or sometimes statically. If an assertion evaluates to false at runtime, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. This draws attention to the location at which the logical inconsistency is detected and can be preferable to the behaviour that would otherwise result.

The use of assertions helps the programmer design, develop, and reason about a program.

== Usage ==

In languages such as Eiffel, assertions form part of the design process; other languages, such as C and Java, use them only to check assumptions at runtime. In both cases, they can be checked for validity at runtime but can usually also be suppressed.

=== Assertions in design by contract ===

Assertions can function as a form of documentation: they can describe the state the code expects to find before it runs (its preconditions), and the state the code expects to result in when it is finished running (postconditions); they can also specify invariants of a class. Eiffel integrates such assertions into the language and automatically extracts them to document the class. This forms an important part of the method of design by contract.

This approach is also useful in languages that do not explicitly support it: the advantage of using assertion statements rather than assertions in comments is that the program can check the assertions every time it runs; if the assertion no longer holds, an error can be reported. This prevents the code from getting out of sync with the assertions.

=== Assertions for run-time checking ===

An assertion may be used to verify that an assumption made by the programmer during the implementation of the program remains valid when the program is executed. For example, consider the following Java code:
 int total = countNumberOfUsers();
 if (total % 2 == 0) {
 // total is even
 } else {
 // total is odd and non-negative
 assert total % 2 == 1;


In Java, codice_4 is the &quot;remainder&quot; operator (&quot;modulo&quot;), and in Java, if its first operand is negative, the result can also be negative (unlike the modulo used in mathematics). Here, the programmer has assumed that codice_5 is non-negative, so that the remainder of a division with 2 will always be 0 or 1. The assertion makes this assumption explicit: if codice_6 does return a negative value, the program may have a bug.

A major advantage of this technique is that when an error does occur it is detected immediately and directly, rather than later through often obscure effects. Since an assertion failure usually reports the code location, one can often pin-point the error without further debugging.

Assertions are also sometimes placed at points the execution is not supposed to reach. For example, assertions could be placed at the codice_7 clause of the codice_8 statement in languages such as C, C++, and Java. Any case which the programmer does not handle intentionally will raise an error and the program will abort rather than silently continuing in an erroneous state. In D such an assertion is added automatically when a codice_8 statement doesn&#x27;t contain a codice_7 clause.

In Java, assertions have been a part of the language since version 1.4. Assertion failures result in raising an codice_11 when the program is run with the appropriate flags, without which the assert statements are ignored. In C, they are added on by the standard header codice_12 defining codice_13 as a macro that signals an error in the case of failure, usually terminating the program. In C++, both codice_14 and codice_15 headers provide the codice_16 macro.

The danger of assertions is that they may cause side effects either by changing memory data or by changing thread timing. Assertions should be implemented carefully so they cause no side effects on program code.

Assertion constructs in a language allow for easy test-driven development (TDD) without the use of a third-party library.

=== Assertions during the development cycle ===

During the development cycle, the programmer will typically run the program with assertions enabled. When an assertion failure occurs, the programmer is immediately notified of the problem. Many assertion implementations will also halt the program&#x27;s execution: this is useful, since if the program continued to run after an assertion violation occurred, it might corrupt its state and make the cause of the problem more difficult to locate. Using the information provided by the assertion failure (such as the location of the failure and perhaps a stack trace, or even the full program state if the environment supports core dumps or if the program is running in a debugger), the programmer can usually fix the problem. Thus assertions provide a very powerful tool in debugging.

=== Assertions in production environment ===
When a program is deployed to production, assertions are typically turned off, to avoid any overhead or side effects they may have. In some cases assertions are completely absent from deployed code, such as in C/C++ assertions via macros. In other cases, such as Java, assertions are present in the deployed code, and can be turned on in the field for debugging.

Assertions may also be used to promise the compiler that a given edge condition is not actually reachable, thereby permitting certain optimizations that would not otherwise be possible. In this case, disabling the assertions could actually reduce performance.

=== Static assertions ===

Assertions that are checked at compile time are called static assertions.

Static assertions are particularly useful in compile time template metaprogramming, but can also be used in low-level languages like C by introducing illegal code if (and only if) the assertion fails. C11 and C++11 support static assertions directly through codice_17. In earlier C versions, a static assertion can be implemented, for example, like this:
#define SASSERT(pred) switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

SASSERT( BOOLEAN CONDITION );
If the codice_18 part evaluates to false then the above code will not compile because the compiler will not allow two case labels with the same constant. The boolean expression must be a compile-time constant value, for example codice_19 would be a valid expression in that context. This construct does not work at file scope (i.e. not inside a function), and so it must be wrapped inside a function.

Another popular way of implementing assertions in C is:
static char const static_assertion[ (BOOLEAN CONDITION)
 ? 1 : -1


If the codice_18 part evaluates to false then the above code will not compile because arrays may not have a negative length. If in fact the compiler allows a negative length then the initialization byte (the codice_21 part) should cause even such over-lenient compilers to complain. The boolean expression must be a compile-time constant value, for example codice_22 would be a valid expression in that context.

Both of these methods require a method of constructing unique names. Modern compilers support a codice_23 preprocessor define that facilitates the construction of unique names, by returning monotonically increasing numbers for each compilation unit.

D provides static assertions through the use of codice_24.

== Disabling assertions ==

Most languages allow assertions to be enabled or disabled globally, and sometimes independently. Assertions are often enabled during development and disabled during final testing and on release to the customer. Not checking assertions avoids the cost of evaluating the assertions while (assuming the assertions are free of side effects) still producing the same result under normal conditions. Under abnormal conditions, disabling assertion checking can mean that a program that would have aborted will continue to run. This is sometimes preferable.

Some languages, including C, YASS and C++, can completely remove assertions at compile time using the preprocessor. 

Similarly, launching the Python interpreter with &quot;-O&quot; (for &quot;optimize&quot;) as an argument will cause the Python code generator to not emit any bytecode for asserts.

Java requires an option to be passed to the run-time engine in order to &quot;enable&quot; assertions. Absent the option, assertions are bypassed, but they always remain in the code unless optimised away by a JIT compiler at run-time or excluded at compile time via the programmer manually placing each assertion behind an codice_25 clause.

Programmers can build checks into their code that are always active by bypassing or manipulating the language&#x27;s normal assertion-checking mechanisms.

== Comparison with error handling ==

Assertions are distinct from routine error-handling. Assertions document logically impossible situations and discover programming errors: if the impossible occurs, then something fundamental is clearly wrong with the program. This is distinct from error handling: most error conditions are possible, although some may be extremely unlikely to occur in practice. Using assertions as a general-purpose error handling mechanism is unwise: assertions do not allow for recovery from errors; an assertion failure will normally halt the program&#x27;s execution abruptly; and assertions are often disabled in production code. Assertions also do not display a user-friendly error message.

Consider the following example of using an assertion to handle an error:
 int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
 assert(ptr);
 // use ptr


Here, the programmer is aware that codice_26 will return a codice_27 pointer if memory is not allocated. This is possible: the operating system does not guarantee that every call to codice_28 will succeed. If an out of memory error occurs the program will immediately abort. Without the assertion, the program would continue running until codice_29 was dereferenced, and possibly longer, depending on the specific hardware being used. So long as assertions are not disabled, an immediate exit is assured. But if a graceful failure is desired, the program has to handle the failure. For example, a server may have multiple clients, or may hold resources that will not be released cleanly, or it may have uncommitted changes to write to a datastore. In such cases it is better to fail a single transaction than to abort abruptly.

Another error is to rely on side effects of expressions used as arguments of an assertion. One should always keep in mind that assertions might not be executed at all, since their sole purpose is to verify that a condition which should always be true does in fact hold true. Consequently, if the program is considered to be error-free and released, assertions may be disabled and will no longer be evaluated.

Consider another version of the previous example:
 int *ptr;
 // Statement below fails if malloc() returns NULL,
 // but is not executed at all when compiling with -NDEBUG!
 assert(ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10));
 // use ptr: ptr isn&#x27;t initialised when compiling with -NDEBUG!


This might look like a smart way to assign the return value of codice_28 to codice_29 and check if it is codice_27 in one step, but the codice_28 call and the assignment to codice_29 is a side effect of evaluating the expression that forms the codice_16 condition. When the codice_36 parameter is passed to the compiler, as when the program is considered to be error-free and released, the codice_37 statement is removed, so codice_38 isn&#x27;t called, rendering codice_29 uninitialised. This could potentially result in a segmentation fault or similar null pointer error much further down the line in program execution, causing bugs that may be sporadic and/or difficult to track down. Programmers sometimes use a similar VERIFY(X) define to alleviate this problem.

Modern compilers may issue a warning when encountering the above code.

== History ==
In 1947 reports by von Neumann and Goldstine on their design for the IAS machine, they described algorithms using an early version of flow charts, in which they included assertions: &quot;It may be true, that whenever C actually reaches a certain point in the flow diagram, one or more bound variables will necessarily possess certain specified values, or possess certain properties, or satisfy certain properties with each other. Furthermore, we may, at such a point, indicate the validity of these limitations. For this reason we will denote each area in which the validity of such limitations is being asserted, by a special box, which we call an assertion box.&quot;

The assertional method for proving correctness of programs was advocated by Alan Turing. In a talk &quot;Checking a Large Routine&quot; at Cambridge, June 24, 1949 Turing suggested: &quot;How can one check a large routine in the sense of making sure that it&#x27;s right? In order that the man who checks may not have too difficult a task, the programmer should make a number of definite &quot;assertions&quot; which can be checked individually, and from which the correctness of the whole program easily follows&quot;.

<doc id="234020" wikidata="Q1264509" url="?curid=234020" title="Duke of Connaught and Strathearn">
<text>Duke of Connaught and Strathearn was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom that was granted on 24 May 1874 by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to her third son, Prince Arthur. At the same time, he was also granted the subsidiary title of Earl of Sussex.

==History==

By tradition, members of the sovereign&#x27;s family received titles associated with England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, the four Home Nations that made up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Dukedom of Connaught and Strathearn was named after one of the four provinces of Ireland, now known by its modern Irish language-based spelling of Connacht. It was seen as the title that, if available, would henceforth be awarded to the British monarch&#x27;s third son. The first son is the Duke of Cornwall (in England) and Duke of Rothesay (in Scotland), and would be made Prince of Wales at some point, while the second son would often become Duke of York, if the title was available.

The title Strathearn referred to the strath (valley) of the River Earn in Scotland; the ancient title Earl/Mormaer of Strathearn died out in the 15th century.

Since the exit of the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom in 1922, titles related to locations in the Free State (and later the Republic of Ireland) have not been awarded (though Prince Edward, Prince of Wales—in 1936 briefly King Edward VIII—was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick). However, territorial titles relating to Northern Ireland have continued to be awarded.

After Prince Arthur&#x27;s death in 1942, the title was inherited by his grandson, Alastair. In the absence of any male heirs, the dukedom became extinct when Alastair died, 15 months after his grandfather.

A Canadian military regiment, The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own), is a Canadian armoured regiment in the 1st Duke&#x27;s name. A British Indian Army cavalry regiment, the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Lancers (Watson&#x27;s Horse), was also named for the 1st Duke.

==Possible future creations==
The Dukedom is currently vacant. While there were some speculations that it was one of the options available for Prince Harry upon his wedding with Meghan Markle, press reports have also noted that Connaught is now part of the Republic of Ireland, as well as the supposed manner in which the last Duke of Connaught and Strathearn died, thus making it unsuitable.

Strathearn is a subsidiary Earldom in the Dukedom of Cambridge.

<doc id="234021" wikidata="Q4931503" url="?curid=234021" title="Boat anchor (metaphor)">
<text>In amateur radio and computing, a boat anchor or boatanchor is something obsolete, useless, and cumbersome – so-called because metaphorically its only productive use is to be thrown into the water as a boat mooring. Terms such as [[Brick (electronics)|brick]],doorstop, and paperweight are similar.

==Amateur radio==

In amateur radio, a &quot;boat anchor&quot; or &quot;boatanchor&quot; is an old piece of radio equipment. It is usually used in reference to large, heavy radio equipment of earlier decades that used tubes. In this context &quot;boat anchors&quot; are often prized by their owners and their strengths (e.g. immunity to EMP) emphasised, even if newer equipment is more capable.

An early use of the term appeared in a 1956 issue of &quot;CQ Amateur Radio Magazine&quot;. The magazine published a letter from a reader seeking &quot;schematics or conversion data&quot; for a war surplus Wireless Set No. 19 MK II transceiver in order to modify it for use on the amateur bands. The editor added this reply: 
The editor&#x27;s use of the term generated some reader interest, and in February 1957, CQ published a follow-up story that included photos.

==Computers==
The metaphor transfers directly from old radios to old computers. It also has been extended to refer to relic software.

===Hardware===

Early computers were physically large and heavy devices. As computers became more compact, the term &quot;boat anchor&quot; became popular among users to signify that the earlier, larger computer gear was obsolete and no longer useful.

===Software===
The term &quot;boat anchor&quot; has been extended to software code that is left in a system&#x27;s codebase, typically in case it is needed later. This is an example of an anti-pattern and therefore can cause many problems for people attempting to maintain the program that contains the obsolete code. The key problem comes from the fact that programmers will have a hard time differentiating between obsolete code which doesn&#x27;t do anything and working code which does. 

For example, a programmer may be looking into a bug with the program&#x27;s input handling system, so they search through the code looking for code that links into the input handling API. Obviously if the programmer comes across obsolete input handling code they may well start editing and debugging it, wasting valuable time before they realise that the code that they&#x27;re working with is never executed and therefore not part of the problem they&#x27;re trying to solve. Other problems include longer compile times and the risk that programmers may accidentally link working code into the defunct code, inadvertently resurrecting it. 

A recommended solution for dealing with boat anchors in source code is to remove them from the code base and to place them in a separate location so that they can be referred to if necessary, but will not be compiled or be mistaken as &quot;working&quot; code. (For example, deleting them, knowing they are stored in the project&#x27;s source control)

<doc id="234029" wikidata="Q6987201" url="?curid=234029" title="Negative cache">
<text>In computer programming, negative cache is a cache that also stores &quot;negative&quot; responses, i.e. failures. This means that a program remembers the result indicating a failure even after the cause has been corrected. Usually negative cache is a design choice, but it can also be a software bug.

==Examples==
Consider a web browser which attempts to load a page while the network is unavailable. The browser will receive an error code indicating the problem, and may display this error message to the user in place of the requested page. However, it is incorrect for the browser to place the error message in the page cache, as this would lead it to display the error again when the user tries to load the same page - even after the network is back up. The error message must not be cached under the page&#x27;s URL; until the browser is able to successfully load the page, whenever the user tries to load the page, the browser must make a new attempt.

A frustrating aspect of negative caches is that the user may put a great effort into troubleshooting the problem, and then after determining and removing the root cause, the error still does not vanish.

There are cases where failure-like states must be cached. For instance, DNS requires that caching nameservers remember negative responses as well as positive ones. If an authoritative nameserver returns a negative response, indicating that a name does not exist, this is cached. The negative response may be perceived as a failure at the application level; however, to the nameserver caching it, it is not a failure. The cache times for negative and positive caching may be tuned independently.

==Description==
A negative cache is normally only desired if failure is very expensive and the error condition raises automatically without user&#x27;s action. It creates a situation where the user is unable to isolate the cause of the failure: despite fixing everything they can think of, the program still refuses to work. When a failure is cached, the program should provide a clear indication of what must be done to clear the cache, in addition to a description of the cause of the error. In such conditions a negative cache is an example of a design anti-pattern.

Negative cache still may recover if the cached records expires.

<doc id="234031" wikidata="Q402885" url="?curid=234031" title="Black-footed ferret">
<text>The black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), also known as the American polecat or prairie dog hunter, is a species of mustelid native to central North America.

The black-footed ferret is roughly the size of a mink and is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat. It is largely nocturnal and solitary, except when breeding or raising litters. Up to 90% of its diet is composed of prairie dogs.

The species declined throughout the 20th century, primarily as a result of decreases in prairie dog populations and sylvatic plague. It was declared extinct in 1979, but a residual wild population was discovered in Meeteetse, Wyoming in 1981. A captive-breeding program launched by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service resulted in its reintroduction into eight western US states, Canada, and Mexico from 1991 to 2009. , over 200 mature individuals are in the wild across 18 populations, with four self-sustaining populations in South Dakota, Arizona, and Wyoming. It was first listed as &quot;endangered&quot; in 1982, then listed as &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; in 1996 before being upgraded back to &quot;endangered&quot; in the IUCN Red List in 2008. In February 2021, the first successful clone of a black-footed ferret, a female named Elizabeth Ann, was introduced to the public.

==Evolution==
Like its close relative, the Asian steppe polecat (with which it was once thought to be conspecific), the black-footed ferret represents a more progressive form than the European polecat in the direction of carnivory. The black-footed ferret&#x27;s most likely ancestor was &quot;Mustela stromeri&quot; (from which the European and steppe polecats are also derived), which originated in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. Molecular evidence indicates that the steppe polecat and black-footed ferret diverged from &quot;M. stromeri&quot; between 500,000 and 2,000,000 years ago, perhaps in Beringia. The species appeared in the Great Basin and the Rockies by 750,000 years ago. The oldest recorded fossil find originates from Cathedral Cave, White Pine County, Nevada, and dates back 750,000 to 950,000 years ago. Prairie dog fossils have been found in six sites that yield ferrets, thus indicating that the association between the two species is an old one. Anecdotal observations and 42% of examined fossil records indicated that any substantial colony of medium- to large-sized colonial ground squirrels, such as Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels, may provide a sufficient prey base and a source of burrows for black-footed ferrets. This suggests that the black-footed ferret and prairie dogs did not historically have an obligate predator–prey relationship. The species has likely always been rare, and the modern black-footed ferret represents a relict population. A reported occurrence of the species is from a late Illinoian deposit in Clay County, Nebraska, and it is further recorded from Sangamonian deposits in Nebraska and Medicine Hat, Alberta. Fossils have also been found in Alaska dating from the Pleistocene.

==Description==
The black-footed ferret has a long, slender body with black outlines on its paws, ears, parts of its face and its tail. The forehead is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and its ears are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws. The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus &quot;Gale&quot; (least and short-tailed weasels) and &quot;Putorius&quot; (European and steppe polecats). Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, massiveness and the development of its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle.

Although similar in size to polecats, its attenuate body, long neck, very short legs, slim tail, large orbicular ears and close-set pelage is much closer in conformation to weasels and stoats. The dentition of the black-footed ferret closely resembles that of the European and steppe polecat, though the back lower molar is vestigial, with a hemispherical crown which is too small and weak to develop the little cusps which are more apparent in polecats. It differs from the European polecat by the greater contrast between its dark limbs and pale body and the shorter length of its black tail-tip. In contrast, differences from the steppe polecat of Asia are slight, to the point where the two species were once thought to be conspecific. The only noticeable differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat are the former&#x27;s much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer post molar extension of the palate.

Males measure in body length and in tail length, thus constituting 22–25% of its body length. Females are typically 10% smaller than males. It weighs . Captive-bred ferrets used for the reintroduction projects were found to be smaller than their wild counterparts, though these animals rapidly attained historical body sizes once released.

The base color is pale yellowish or buffy above and below. The top of the head and sometimes the neck is clouded by dark-tipped hairs. The face is crossed by a broad band of sooty black, which includes the eyes. The feet, lower parts of the legs, the tip of the tail and the preputial region are sooty-black. The area midway between the front and back legs is marked by a large patch of dark umber-brown, which fades into the buffy surrounding parts. A small spot occurs over each eye, with a narrow band behind the black mask. The sides of the head and the ears are dirty-white in color.

==Behavior and ecology==

===Territorial behavior===

The black-footed ferret is solitary, except when breeding or raising litters. It is nocturnal and primarily hunts for sleeping prairie dogs in their burrows. It is most active above ground from dusk to midnight and 4 am to mid-morning. Aboveground activity is greatest during late summer and early autumn when juveniles become independent. Climate generally does not limit black-footed ferret activity, but it may remain inactive inside burrows for up to 6 days at a time during winter.

Female black-footed ferrets have smaller home ranges than males. Home ranges of males may sometimes include the home ranges of several females. Adult females usually occupy the same territory every year. A female that was tracked from December to March occupied . Her territory was overlapped by a resident male that occupied during the same period. The average density of black-footed ferrets near Meeteetse, Wyoming, is estimated at one black-footed ferret to . As of 1985, 40 to 60 black-footed ferrets occupied a total of of white-tailed prairie dog habitat. From 1982 to 1984, the average year-round movement of 15 black-footed ferrets between white-tailed prairie dog colonies was 1.6 miles/night (2.5 km) (with a spread of 1.1 miles or 1.7 km). Movement of black-footed ferrets between prairie dog colonies is influenced by factors including breeding activity, season, sex, intraspecific territoriality, prey density, and expansion of home ranges with declining population density. Movements of black-footed ferrets have been shown to increase during the breeding season; however, snow-tracking from December to March over a 4-year period near Meeteetse, Wyoming, revealed that factors other than breeding were responsible for movement distances.

Temperature is positively correlated with distance of black-footed ferret movement. Snow-tracking from December to March over a 4-year period near Meeteetse, Wyoming, revealed that movement distances were shortest during winter and longest between February and April, when black-footed ferrets were breeding and white-tailed prairie dogs emerged from hibernation. Nightly movement distance of 170 black-footed ferrets averaged (range ). Nightly activity areas of black-footed ferrets ranged from ), and were larger from February to March () than from December to January (). Adult females establish activity areas based on access to food for rearing young. Males establish activity areas to maximize access to females, resulting in larger activity areas than those of females.

Prey density may account for movement distances. Black-footed ferrets may travel up to to seek prey, suggesting that they will interchange freely among white-tailed prairie dog colonies that are less than apart. In areas of high prey density, black-footed ferret movements were nonlinear in character, probably to avoid predators. From December to March over a 4-year study period, black-footed ferrets investigated 68 white-tailed prairie dog holes per of travel/night. Distance traveled between white-tailed prairie dog burrows from December to March averaged over 149 track routes.

===Reproduction and development===

The reproductive physiology of the black-footed ferret is similar to that of the European polecat and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism. Mating occurs in February and March. When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is in contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male European polecat. During copulation, the male grasps the female by the nape of the neck, with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the black-footed ferret is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates. In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42–45 days. Litter size ranges from one to five kits. Kits are born in May and June in prairie dog burrows. Kits are altricial and are raised by their mother for several months after birth. Kits first emerge above ground in July, at 6 weeks old. They are then separated into individual prairie dog burrows around their mother&#x27;s burrow. Kits reach adult weight and become independent several months following birth, from late August to October. Sexual maturity occurs at the age of one year.

Intercolony dispersal of juvenile black-footed ferrets occurs several months after birth, from early September to early November. Dispersal distances may be short or long. Near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 9 juvenile males and three juvenile females dispersed following litter breakup. Four juvenile females dispersed a short distance (&lt;), but remained on their natal area.

== Diet ==

Up to 90% of the black-footed ferret&#x27;s diet is composed of prairie dogs. The remaining 10% of their diet is composed of small rodents, and lagomorphs. Their diet varies depending on geographic location. In western Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, black-footed ferrets are historically associated with white-tailed prairie dogs and were forced to find alternative prey when white-tailed prairie dogs entered their four-month hibernation cycle. In Wyoming, alternative prey items consumed during white-tailed prairie dog hibernation included voles (&quot;Microtus&quot; spp.) and mice (&quot;Peromyscus&quot; and &quot;Mus&quot; spp.) found near streams. In South Dakota, black-footed ferrets associate with black-tailed prairie dogs. Because black-tailed prairie dogs do not hibernate, little seasonal change in black-footed ferret diet is necessary.

In Mellette County, South Dakota, black-tailed prairie dog remains occurred in 91% of 82 black-footed ferret scats. Mouse remains occurred in 26% of scats. Mouse remains could not be identified to species; however, deer mice, northern grasshopper mice, and house mice were captured in snap-trap surveys. Potential prey items included thirteen-lined ground squirrels, plains pocket gophers, mountain cottontails, upland sandpipers, horned larks, and western meadowlarks.

Based on 86 black-footed ferret scats found near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 87% of their diet was composed of white-tailed prairie dogs. Other food items included deer mice, sagebrush voles, meadow voles, mountain cottontails, and white-tailed jackrabbits. Water is obtained through consumption of prey.

A study published in 1983 modeling metabolizable energy requirements estimated that one adult female black-footed ferret and her litter require about 474 to 1,421 black-tailed prairie dogs per year or 412 to 1,236 white-tailed prairie dogs per year for sustenance. They concluded that this dietary requirement would require protection of of black-tailed prairie dog habitat or of white-tailed prairie dog habitat for each female black-footed ferret with a litter.

==Distribution and habitat==

The historical range of the black-footed ferret was closely correlated with, but not restricted to, the range of prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot; spp.). Its range extended from southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan south to Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. , the only known wild black-footed ferret population was located on approximately in the western Big Horn Basin near Meeteetse, Wyoming. Since 1990, black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced to the following sites: Shirley Basin, Wyoming; UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge and Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Montana; Conata Basin/Badlands, Buffalo Gap National Grassland, Wind Cave National Park and the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota; Aubrey Valley, Arizona; Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and Wolf Creek in Colorado; Coyote Basin, straddling Colorado and Utah, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and Grasslands National Park, Canada.

Historical habitats of the black-footed ferret included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, were lined with buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide the greatest amount of cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.

==Mortality==
Primary causes of mortality include habitat loss, human-introduced diseases, and indirect poisoning from prairie dog control measures. Annual mortality of juvenile and adult black-footed ferrets over a 4-year period ranged from 59 to 83% (128 individuals) near Meeteetse, Wyoming. During fall and winter, 50–70% of juveniles and older animals perish. Average lifespan in the wild is probably only one year, but may be up to five years. Males have higher rates of mortality than females because of longer dispersal distances when they are most vulnerable to predators.

Given an obligate dependence of black-footed ferrets on prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets are extremely vulnerable to prairie dog habitat loss. Habitat loss results from agriculture, livestock use, and other development.

Black-footed ferrets are susceptible to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for canine distemper is available for captive black-footed ferrets, but no protection is available for young born in the wild. Black-footed ferrets are also susceptible to rabies, tularemia, and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets&#x27; prey base.

Predators of black-footed ferrets include golden eagles, great horned owls, coyotes, American badgers, bobcats, prairie falcons, ferruginous hawks, and prairie rattlesnakes.

Oil and natural gas exploration and extraction can have detrimental impacts on prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets. Seismic activity collapses prairie dog burrows. Other problems include potential leaks and spills, increased roads and fences, increased vehicle traffic and human presence, and an increased number of raptor perching sites on power poles. Traps set for coyotes, American mink, and other animals may harm black-footed ferrets.

==History==
Native American tribes, including the Crow, Blackfoot, Sioux, Cheyenne, and Pawnee, used black-footed ferrets for religious rites and for food. The species was not encountered during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, nor was it seen by Nuttall or Townsend, and it did not become known to modern science until it was first described in John James Audubon and John Bachman&#x27;s &quot;Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America&quot; in 1851.

===Decline===
For a time, the black-footed ferret was harvested for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis in the late 1830s. During the early years of predator control, black-footed ferret carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands.

Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in about of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. Ferrets are unlikely to persist through plague episodes unless there are management efforts that allow access to prey resources at a wider region or actions that could substantially reduce the plague transmission. Implementing efforts to conserve large prairie dog landscapes and plague mitigation tools are very important in conserving the black-footed ferrets&#x27; population.

Inbreeding depression may have also contributed to the decline, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming, revealed low levels of genetic variation. Canine distemper devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A live virus vaccine originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.

===Reintroduction and conservation===

The black-footed ferret experienced a recent population bottleneck in the wild followed by a more than 30-year recovery through &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding and then reintroduction into its native range. As such, this sole endemic North American ferret allows examining the impact of a severe genetic restriction on subsequent biological form and function, especially on reproductive traits and success. The black-footed ferret was listed as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1967. Declared extinct in 1979, a residual wild population was discovered in Meeteetse, Wyoming, in 1981. This cohort eventually grew to 130 individuals and was then nearly extirpated by sylvatic plague, &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, and canine distemper virus, &quot;Canine morbillivirus&quot;, with eventually 18 animals remaining. These survivors were captured from 1985 to 1987 to serve as the foundation for the black-footed ferret &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding program. Seven of those 18 animals produced offspring that survived and reproduced, and with currently living descendants, are the ancestors of all black-footed ferrets now in the &quot;ex situ&quot; (about 320) and &quot;in situ&quot; (about 300) populations.

The black-footed ferret is an example of a species that benefits from strong reproductive science. A captive-breeding program was initiated in 1987, capturing 18 living individuals and using artificial insemination. This is one of the first examples of assisted reproduction contributing to conservation of an endangered species in nature. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state and tribal agencies, private landowners, conservation groups, and North American zoos have actively reintroduced ferrets back into the wild since 1991. Beginning in Shirley Basin in Eastern Wyoming, reintroduction expanded to Montana, six sites in South Dakota in 1994, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Saskatchewan, Canada and Chihuahua, Mexico. The Toronto Zoo has bred hundreds, most of which were released into the wild. Several episodes of &quot;Zoo Diaries&quot; show aspects of the tightly controlled breeding. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the black-footed ferret as being an extirpated species in Canada. A population of 35 animals was released into Grasslands National Park in southern Saskatchewan on October 2, 2009, and a litter of newborn kits was observed in July 2010. Reintroduction sites have experienced multiple years of reproduction from released individuals.
The black-footed ferret was first listed as endangered in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation Act, and was re-listed on January 4, 1974, under the Endangered Species Act. In September 2006, South Dakota&#x27;s ferret population was estimated to be around 420, with 250 (100 breeding adults consisting of 67 females and 33 males) in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, which is , less than 3% of the public grasslands in South Dakota, east of Rapid City, South Dakota, in the Buffalo Gap National Grassland bordering Badlands National Park, 130 ferrets northeast of Eagle Butte, South Dakota, on Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, and about 40 ferrets on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Arizona&#x27;s Aubrey Valley ferret population was well over 100 and a second reintroduction site with around 50 animals is used. An August 2007 report in the journal Science counted a population of 223 in one area of Wyoming (the original number of reintroduced ferrets, most of which died, was 228), and an annual growth rate of 35% from 2003 to 2006 was estimated. This rate of recovery is much faster than for many endangered species, and the ferret seems to have prevailed over the previous problems of disease and prey shortage that hampered its improvement. , the total wild population of black-footed ferrets in the U.S. was well over 650 individuals, plus 250 in captivity. In 2008, the IUCN reclassified the species as &quot;globally endangered&quot;, a substantial improvement since the 1996 assessment, when it was considered extinct in the wild, as the species was indeed only surviving in captivity. In 2016, NatureServe considered the species &quot;Critically Imperiled&quot;.

, about 1,200 ferrets are thought to live in the wild. These wild populations are possible due to the extensive breeding program that releases surplus animals to reintroduction sites, which are then monitored by USFWS biologists for health and growth. However, the species cannot depend just on &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding for future survival, as reproductive traits such as pregnancy rate and normal sperm motility and morphology have been steadily declining with time in captivity. These declining markers of individual and population health are thought to be due to increased inbreeding, an occurrence often found with small populations or ones that spend a long time in captivity.

Conservation efforts have been opposed by stock growers and ranchers, who have traditionally fought prairie dogs. In 2005, the U.S. Forest Service began poisoning prairie dogs in private land buffer zones of the Conata Basin of Buffalo Gap National Grassland. Because 10–15 ranchers complained the measure was inadequate, the forest service advised by Mark Rey, then Undersecretary of Agriculture, expanded its &quot;prairie-dog management&quot; in September 2006 to all of South Dakota&#x27;s Buffalo Gap and the Fort Pierre National Grassland, and also to the Oglala National Grassland in Nebraska, against opinions of biologists in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Following exposure by conservation groups including the Climate, Community &amp; Biodiversity Alliance and national media public outcry and a lawsuit mobilized federal officials, and the poisoning plan was revoked.

The contradictory mandates of the two federal agencies involved, the USFWS and the U.S. Forest Service, are exemplified in what the Rosebud Sioux tribe experienced: The ferret was reintroduced by the USFWS, which according to the tribe promised to pay more than $1 million a year through 2010. On the other hand, the tribe was also contracted for the U.S. Forest Service prairie dog poisoning program. The increasing numbers of ferrets led to conflicts between the tribe&#x27;s Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Game, Fish and Parks Department and the Tribal Land Enterprise Organization. When the federal government started an investigation of the tribe&#x27;s prairie dog management program, threatening to prosecute tribal employees or agents carrying out the management plan in the ferret reintroduction area, the tribal council passed a resolution in 2008, asking the two federal agencies to remove ferrets, and reimburse the tribe for its expenses for the ferret recovery program.

In 2020, black-footed ferrets were used to test an experimental COVID-19 vaccine in Colorado.

Employees of the San Diego Zoo, the conservation organization Revive &amp; Restore, the ViaGen Pets and Equine Company, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have teamed up to clone a black-footed ferret. In 2020, a team of scientists cloned a female named Willa, who died in the mid-1980s and left no living descendants. Her clone, a female named Elizabeth Ann, was born on December 10, 2020, making her the first North American endangered species to be cloned. Scientists hoped that the contribution of this individual would alleviate the effects of inbreeding and help black-footed ferrets better cope with plague. Experts estimate that this female&#x27;s genome contains three times as much genetic diversity as any of the modern black-footed ferrets. In October 2022, Elizabeth Ann received a hysterectomy due to health complications related to hydrometra, a condition causing excessive fluid retention within the uterus, alongside an underdeveloped uterine horn. These conditions are common in black-footed ferrets, and are not believed to be due to the cloning process. Elizabeth Ann otherwise remained healthy and continues to demonstrate normal behavior for an adult ferret.

In April 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the birth of two new black-footed ferret clones, Noreen and Antonia, who were cloned from the same genetic material as Elizabeth Ann. Noreen was born at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado, while Antonia was born at the Smithsonian National Zoo &amp; Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia. In June 2024, Antonia gave birth to a litter of three kits after mating with a male named Urchin. Two of these, a male named Red Cloud and a female named Sibert, survived and are in good health.

== In popular culture ==

In 2023, the black-footed ferret was featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota. The U.S. Census Bureau featured a black-footed ferret on its &quot;Data Federated Electronic Research Review Extraction and Tabulation Tool&quot; or &quot;Data FERRETT&quot; web tool. This tool allowed researchers outside the government to extract unique, anonymized data from respondents to Census surveys, including the Current Population Survey.
The song &quot;Yon Ferrets Return&quot; by Neko Case, from her 2013 album &quot;The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You&quot;, is about the Black-footed Ferret.

<doc id="234034" wikidata="Q2295111" url="?curid=234034" title="Code smell">
<text>In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. Determining what is and is not a code smell is subjective, and varies by language, developer, and development methodology.

The term was popularized by Kent Beck on WardsWiki in the late 1990s. Usage of the term increased after it was featured in the 1999 book &quot;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code&quot; by Martin Fowler. It is also a term used by agile programmers.

==Definition==
One way to look at smells is with respect to principles and quality: &quot;Smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality&quot;. Code smells are usually not bugs; they are not technically incorrect and do not prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may slow down development or increase the risk of bugs or failures in the future. Bad code smells can be an indicator of factors that contribute to technical debt. Robert C. Martin calls a list of code smells a &quot;value system&quot; for software craftsmanship.

Contrary to these severe interpretations, Cunningham&#x27;s original definition was that a smell is a suggestion that something may be wrong, not evidence that there is already a problem.

Often the deeper problem hinted at by a code smell can be uncovered when the code is subjected to a short feedback cycle, where it is refactored in small, controlled steps, and the resulting design is examined to see if there are any further code smells that in turn indicate the need for more refactoring. From the point of view of a programmer charged with performing refactoring, code smells are heuristics to indicate when to refactor, and what specific refactoring techniques to use. Thus, a code smell is a driver for refactoring.

Factors such as the understandability of code, how easy it is to be modified, the ease in which it can be enhanced to support functional changes, the code&#x27;s ability to be reused in different settings, how testable the code is, and code reliability are factors that can be used to identify code smells. 

A 2015 study utilizing automated analysis for half a million source code commits and the manual examination of 9,164 commits determined to exhibit &quot;code smells&quot; found that:

* There exists empirical evidence for the consequences of &quot;technical debt&quot;, but there exists only anecdotal evidence as to &quot;how&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, or &quot;why&quot; this occurs.
* Common wisdom suggests that urgent maintenance activities and pressure to deliver features while prioritizing time-to-market over code quality are often the causes of such smells.

Tools such as Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, and SonarQube can automatically identify code smells.

<text>The Admiralty Arch is a historic landmark building in London, providing road and pedestrian access between The Mall, which extends to the southwest, and Trafalgar Square to the northeast. Commissioned by King Edward VII in memory of his mother, Queen Victoria, it was designed by Aston Webb, and is now a Grade I listed building. Until 2011, the building housed government offices, including the residence of the First Sea Lord, and was used by the Admiralty. In 2012, the government sold the building on a 125-year lease for £60m for redevelopment into the Waldorf Astoria London Admiralty Arch luxury hotel, which is scheduled to open in 2026.

==History==
The arch was designed by Aston Webb, who also designed the Victoria Memorial and the new façade of Buckingham Palace at the other end of the Mall. Admiralty Arch was constructed by John Mowlem &amp; Co and completed in 1912. It adjoins the Old Admiralty Building, hence the name. The building was commissioned by King Edward VII in memory of his mother Queen Victoria, although he did not live to see its completion in 1912. Admiralty Arch served as the official residence of the First Sea Lord, including Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. It also housed various government offices, initially for the Admiralty.

The structure, which combines the features of a triumphal arch with those of a government office building, is asymmetrical. As viewed from the Mall, the right wing of the building has one floor more than the left one: below the cornice there are three on the right, but just two on the left.
A Latin inscription along the top reads:
The sculptural figures of &quot;Navigation&quot; (left) and &quot;Gunnery&quot; (right) at the end of the two wings were designed by the English sculptor Thomas Brock.

Beneath the building is a warren of tunnels and chambers, including vaults which used to house the government archives.
In 2000, the Cabinet Office moved into offices in the building, while maintaining its headquarters on Whitehall. It was also home to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Strategy Unit and the Social Exclusion Task Force. In 2011, as part of the United Kingdom government austerity programme, the building became vacant and was put up for sale for a reported £75 million. In October 2012, the winning bidder was reported to be the Spanish real estate developer Rafael Serrano, who planned to turn the property into a luxury hotel. The property was sold as a 125-year lease.
In August 2013, Westminster City Council granted full planning permission for the restoration and conversion of Admiralty Arch into a 100-room hotel, residences and private members&#x27; club.

The architects Blair Associates were retained by property developer Prime Investors Capital (run by Rafael Serrano) to convert the building into a hotel, restaurant and four apartments. The residences went on sale in July 2016. 

In 2022, Motcomb Estates took over development of Admiralty Arch. The building is currently being converted into a luxury hotel under the Waldorf Astoria brand, and is scheduled to open in 2026.

There is reputedly an underground passage connecting Admiralty Arch to 10 Downing Street.

==Ceremonial use==
As the ceremonial entrance from Trafalgar Square to The Mall, itself the ceremonial road leading up to Buckingham Palace, Admiralty Arch plays an important role on ceremonial occasions. Processions at royal weddings, funerals, coronations and other public processions such as the 2012 processions at the end of the Olympic and Paralympic Games all passed under its arches. The central archway is reserved for use by royalty.

==Nose==

On the inside wall of the northernmost arch is a small protrusion the size and shape of a human nose. It was placed there by the artist Rick Buckley in 1997 as part of a campaign against the &quot;Big Brother&quot; society. The nose is at a height of about seven feet, and sits at waist-height for anyone riding through the arch on a horse.

<text>Chakravarti Rajagopalachari (10 December 1878 – 25 December 1972), popularly known as Rajaji or C.R., also known as Mootharignar Rajaji (Rajaji&quot;, the Scholar Emeritus&quot;), was an Indian statesman, writer, lawyer, and Indian independence activist. Rajagopalachari was the last Governor-General of India, as when India became a republic in 1950 the office was abolished. He was also the only Indian-born Governor-General, as all previous holders of the post were British nationals. He also served as leader of the Indian National Congress, Premier of the Madras Presidency, Governor of West Bengal, Minister for Home Affairs of the Indian Union and Chief Minister of Madras state. Rajagopalachari founded the Swatantra Party and was one of the first recipients of India&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. He vehemently opposed the use of nuclear weapons and was a proponent of world peace and disarmament. During his lifetime, he also acquired the nickname &#x27;Mango of Salem&#x27;.

Rajagopalachari was born in the Thorapalli village of Hosur taluk in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu and was educated at Central College, Bangalore, and Presidency College, Madras. In the 1900s he started legal practice at the Salem court. On entering politics, he became a member and later Chairperson of the Salem municipality. One of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s earliest political lieutenants, he joined the Indian National Congress and participated in the agitations against the Rowlatt Act, joining the non-cooperation movement, the Vaikom Satyagraha, and the Civil Disobedience movement. In 1930, Rajagopalachari risked imprisonment when he led the Vedaranyam Salt Satyagraha in response to the Dandi March. In 1937, Rajagopalachari was elected Prime minister of the Madras Presidency and served until 1940, when he resigned due to Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany. He later advocated co-operation over Britain&#x27;s war effort and opposed the Quit India Movement. He favoured talks with both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League and proposed what later came to be known as the &quot;C. R. formula&quot;. In 1946, Rajagopalachari was appointed Minister of Industry, Supply, Education and Finance in the Interim Government of India, and then as the Governor of West Bengal from 1947 to 1948, Governor-General of India from 1948 to 1950, Union Home Minister from 1951 to 1952 and as Chief Minister of Madras state from 1952 to 1954. In 1959, he resigned from the Indian National Congress and founded the Swatantra Party, which fought against the Congress in the 1962, 1967 and 1971 elections. Rajagopalachari was instrumental in setting up a united Anti-Congress front in Madras state under C. N. Annadurai, which swept the 1967 elections. He died on 25 December 1972 at the age of 94 and received a state funeral.

Rajagopalachari was an accomplished writer who made lasting contributions to Indian English literature and is also credited with the composition of the song &quot;Kurai Onrum Illai&quot; set to Carnatic music. He pioneered temperance and temple entry movements in India and advocated Dalit upliftment. He has been criticized for introducing the compulsory study of Hindi and the Madras Scheme of Elementary Education in Madras State, dubbed by its critics as Hereditary Education Policy put forward to perpetuate caste hierarchy. Critics have often attributed his pre-eminence in politics to his standing as a favourite of both Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Rajagopalachari was described by Gandhi as the &quot;keeper of my conscience&quot;.

== Early life ==

Rajagopalachari was born to Chakravarti Venkatarya Achari (Iyengar) and his wife Singaramma on 10 December 1878 in Thorapalli village on the outskirts of Hosur, in Dharmapuri taluk, Salem district, Madras Presidency, British Raj. His father was the &quot;munsiff&quot; of Thorapalli. He hailed from a Hindu Brahmin family belonging to the Sri Vaishnava sect. The couple already had two sons, Narasimhachari and Srinivasa.

A weak and sickly child, Rajagopalachari was a constant worry to his parents who feared that he might not live long. As a young child, he was admitted to a village school in Thorapalli then at the age of five moved with his family to Hosur where Rajagopalachari enrolled at Hosur R.V.Government Boys Higher Secondary School. He passed his matriculation examinations in 1891 and graduated in arts from Central College, Bangalore in 1894. Rajagopalachari also studied law at the Presidency College, Madras, from where he graduated in 1897.

Rajagopalachari married Alamelu Mangalamma in 1897 when she was ten years old and she gave birth to her son a day after her thirteenth birthday. The couple had five children, three sons: C. R. Narasimhan, C. R. Krishnaswamy, and C. R. Ramaswami, and two daughters: Lakshmi Gandhi (&quot;née&quot; Rajagopalachari) and Namagiri Ammal. Mangamma died in 1916 whereupon Rajagopalachari took sole responsibility for the care of his children. His son Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari Narasimhan was elected to the Lok Sabha from Krishnagiri in the 1952 and 1957 elections and served as a member of parliament for Krishnagiri from 1952 to 1962. He later wrote a biography of his father. Rajagopalachari&#x27;s daughter Lakshmi married Devdas Gandhi, son of Mahatma Gandhi while his grandsons include biographer Rajmohan Gandhi, philosopher Ramchandra Gandhi and former governor of West Bengal Gopalkrishna Gandhi. Rajagopalachari&#x27;s great-grandson, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari Kesavan, is a spokesperson of the Congress Party and Trustee of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee.

== Indian Independence Movement ==

Rajagopalachari&#x27;s interest in public affairs and politics began when he commenced his legal practice in Salem in 1900. At the age of 28, he joined the Indian National Congress and participated as a delegate in the 1906 Calcutta session. Inspired by Indian independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, he later became a member of the Salem municipality in 1911. In 1917, he was elected chairman of the municipality and served from 1917 to 1919 during which time he was responsible for the election of the first Dalit member of the Salem municipality. In 1917, he defended Indian independence activist P. Varadarajulu Naidu against charges of sedition and two years later participated in the agitations against the Rowlatt Act. Rajagopalachari was a close friend of the founder of Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company V. O. Chidambaram Pillai as well as greatly admired by Indian independence activists Annie Besant, Subramania Bharati and C. Vijayaraghavachariar.

After Mahatma Gandhi joined the Indian independence movement in 1919, Rajagopalachari became one of his followers. He participated in the non-cooperation movement and gave up his law practice. In 1921, he was elected to the Congress Working Committee and served as the General Secretary of the party before making his first major breakthrough as a leader during the 1922 Indian National Congress session at Gaya when he strongly opposed collaboration with the colonial administration and participation in the diarchial legislatures established by the Government of India Act 1919. While Gandhi was in prison, Rajagopalachari led the group of &quot;No-Changers&quot;, individuals against contesting elections for the Imperial Legislative Council and other provincial legislative councils, in opposition to the &quot;Pro-changers&quot; who advocated council entry. When the motion was put to the vote, the &quot;No-changers&quot; won by 1,748 to 890 votes resulting in the resignation of important Congress leaders including Pandit Motilal Nehru and C. R. Das, the President of the Indian National Congress. When the Indian National Congress split in 1923, Rajagopalachari was a member of the Civil Disobedience Enquiry Committee. He was also involved in the Vaikom Satyagraha movement against untouchability during 1924–25. In a public speech on 27 May 1924, he reassured the anxious upper caste Hindus in Vaikom, &quot;Mahatmaji does not want the caste system abolished but holds that untouchability should be abolished...Mahatmaji does not want you to dine with the Thiyyas or the Pulayas. What he wants is that we must be prepared to go near or touch other human beings as you go near a cow or a horse&quot;.

In the early 1930s, Rajagopalachari emerged as one of the major leaders of the Tamil Nadu Congress. When Gandhi organised the Dandi march in 1930, Rajagopalachari broke the salt laws at Vedaranyam, near Nagapattinam, along with Indian independence activist Sardar Vedaratnam. Rajagopalachari was sentenced to six-months of rigorous imprisonment and was sent to the Trichinopoly Central Prison. He was subsequently elected President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee. Following the enactment of the Government of India Act in 1935, Rajagopalachari was instrumental in getting the Indian National Congress to participate in the 1937 general elections.

== Madras Presidency 1937–39 ==

The Indian National Congress first came to power in the Madras Presidency (also called Madras Province by the British), following the Madras elections of 1937. Except for a six-year period when Madras was under the Governor&#x27;s direct rule, the Congress administered the Madras Presidency until India became independent on 15 August 1947 as the Dominion of India. At the age of 59, Rajagopalachari won the Madras University seat and entered the Assembly as the first Premier of the Madras Presidency from the Congress party.

In 1938, when Dalit members of the Madras Legislative Council proposed a Temple Entry Bill, Congress Prime Minister Rajagopalachari asked them to withdraw it. Rajagopalachari issued the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act 1939, under which restrictions were removed on Dalits and Shanars entering Hindu temples. In the same year, the Meenakshi temple at Madurai was also opened to the Dalits and Shanars. In March 1938, Rajagopalachari introduced the Agricultural Debt Relief Act, to ease the burden of debt on the province&#x27;s peasant population.

He also introduced prohibition, along with a sales tax to compensate for the loss of government revenue that resulted from the ban on alcohol. The Provincial Government shut down hundreds of government-run primary schools, citing lack of funds. His opponents said that this deprived many low-caste and Dalit students of their education. His opponents also attributed casteist motives to his government&#x27;s implementation of Gandhi&#x27;s Nai Talim scheme into the education system.

Rajagopalachari&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister of Madras is largely remembered for the compulsory introduction of Hindi in educational institutions, which made him highly unpopular. This measure sparked off widespread anti-Hindi protests, which led to violence in some places and the jailing of over 1,200 men, women and children who took part in the unrest. Two protesters, Thalamuthu Nadar and Natarasan, were killed during the protests. Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy opposed the decision of C. Rajagopalachari to make learning Hindi compulsory in schools in 1937. During the anti-Hindi agitations, Rajagopalachari was constantly identified as an enemy and destroyer of Tamil thai. The opposition to Rajagopalachari grew because he continued to openly criticize the Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40 in the most elitist terms and casually ignored the death of a young protester in 1938 when he was asked about it.

In 1940, Congress ministers resigned in protest over the declaration of war on Germany without their consent, leaving the governor to take over the reins of the administration. On 21 February 1940, the unpopular new law on the use of Hindi was quickly repealed by the Governor of Madras. Despite its numerous shortcomings, Madras under Rajagopalachari was still considered by political historians as the best-administered province in British India.

== Second World War ==

Some months after the outbreak of the Second World War, Rajagopalachari resigned as premier along with other members of his cabinet in protest at the declaration of war by the Viceroy of India. Rajagopalachari was arrested in December 1940, in accordance with the Defence of India rules, and sentenced to one year in prison. However, subsequently, Rajagopalachari differed in opposition to the British war effort. He also opposed the Quit India Movement and instead advocated dialogue with the British. He reasoned that passivity and neutrality would be harmful to India&#x27;s interests at a time when the country was threatened with invasion. He also advocated dialogue with the Muslim League, which was demanding the partition of India. He subsequently resigned from the party and the assembly following differences over resolutions passed by the Madras Congress legislative party and disagreements with the leader of the Madras provincial Congress K. Kamaraj.

Following the end of the war in 1945, elections followed in the Madras Presidency in 1946. During the last years of the war, Kamaraj was requested by Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to make Rajagopalachari the Premier of Madras Presidency. Kamaraj, President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, was forced to make Tanguturi Prakasam as Prime Ministerial candidate, by the elected members, to prevent Rajagopalachari from winning. However, Rajagopalachari did not contest the elections, and Prakasam was elected.

Rajagopalachari was instrumental in initiating negotiations between Gandhi and Jinnah. In 1944, he proposed a solution to the Indian Constitutional tangle. In the same year, he proposed an &quot;absolute majority&quot; threshold of 55 per cent when deciding whether a district should become part of India or Pakistan, triggering a huge controversy among nationalists.

From 1946 to 1947, Rajagopalachari served as the Minister for Industry, Supply, Education, and Finance in the Interim Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru.

== Governor of West Bengal 1947–1948 ==

When India and Pakistan attained independence, the province of Bengal was partitioned into two, with West Bengal becoming part of India and East Bengal part of Pakistan. At that time, Rajagopalachari was appointed as the first Governor of West Bengal.

Disliked by the Bengali political class for his criticism of Subhas Chandra Bose during the 1939 Tripuri Congress session, Rajagopalachari&#x27;s appointment as Governor of West Bengal was protested by Bose&#x27;s brother Sarat Chandra Bose. During his tenure as governor, Rajagopalachari&#x27;s priorities were to deal with refugees and to bring peace and stability in the aftermath of the Calcutta riots. He declared his commitment to neutrality and justice at a meeting of Muslim businessmen: &quot;Whatever may be my defects or lapses, let me assure you that I shall never disfigure my life with any deliberate acts of injustice to any community whatsoever.&quot; Rajagopalachari was also strongly opposed to proposals to include areas from Bihar and Odisha as part of the province of West Bengal. One such proposal by the editor of a newspaper led to the reply:
&quot;I see that you are not able to restrain the policy of agitation over inter-provincial boundaries. It is easy to yield to the current pressure of opinion and it is difficult to impose on enthusiastic people any policy of restraint. But I earnestly plead that we should do all we can to prevent ill-will from hardening into a chronic disorder. We have enough ill-will and prejudice to cope with. Must we hasten to create further fissiparous forces?&quot;

Despite the general attitude of the Bengali political class, Rajagopalachari was highly regarded and respected by Chief Minister Prafulla Chandra Ghosh and his ministry.

== Governor-General of India 1948–1950 ==

From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari served as Acting Governor-General of India in the absence of the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, who was on leave in England to attend the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Mountbatten&#x27;s nephew Prince Philip. Rajagopalachari led a very simple life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes. Impressed with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after Vallabhbhai Patel, when he was to leave India in June 1948. Rajagopalachari was eventually chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten&#x27;s first choice, as did Patel himself. He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, &quot;I hope you will not disappoint us. We want you to help us in many ways. The burden on some of us is more than we can carry.&quot; Rajagopalachari then served as Governor-General of India from June 1948 until 26 January 1950 and was not only the last Governor-General of India but the only Indian citizen ever to hold the office.

By the end of 1949, an assumption was made that Rajagopalachari, already Governor-General, would continue as president. Backed by Nehru, Rajagopalachari wanted to stand for the presidential election but later withdrew, due to the opposition of a section of the Indian National Congress mostly made up of North Indians who were concerned about Rajagopalachari&#x27;s non-participation during the Quit India Movement.

== Role in Constituent Assembly ==

He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India from Madras. He was a part of Advisory Committee and Sub-Committee on Minorities. He debated on issues relating to rights of religious denominations.

== In Nehru&#x27;s Cabinet ==

At Nehru&#x27;s invitation, in 1950, Rajagopalachari joined the Union Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio where he served as a buffer between Nehru and Home Minister Sardar Patel and on occasion offered to mediate between the two. Following Patel&#x27;s death on 15 December 1950, Rajagopalachari was finally made Home Affairs Minister and went on to serve for nearly 10 months. As had his predecessor, he warned Nehru about the expansionist designs of China and expressed regret over the Tibet problem. He also expressed concern over demands for new linguistically based states, arguing that they would generate differences amongst the people.

By the end of 1951, the differences between Nehru and Rajagopalachari came to the fore. While Nehru perceived the Hindu Mahasabha to be the greatest threat to the nascent republic, Rajagopalachari held the opinion that the Communists posed the greatest danger. He also adamantly opposed Nehru&#x27;s decision to commute the death sentences passed on those involved in the Telangana uprising and his strong pro-Soviet leanings. Tired of being persistently over-ruled by Nehru concerning critical decisions, Rajagopalachari submitted his resignation on the &quot;grounds of ill-health&quot; and returned to Madras.

== Madras State 1952–1954 ==

In the 1952 Madras elections, the Indian National Congress was reduced to a minority in the state assembly with a coalition led by the Communist Party of India winning most of the seats. The Congress did not want the Communists taking power or to impose Governor&#x27;s rule in the state. It brought Rajagopalachari out of retirement to form the government as a consensus candidate. On 31 March 1952, Kamaraj presented a resolution, proposing the election of Rajagopalachari as the leader of the Madras Legislature Congress party. The resolution was approved by the party and Kamaraj revealed that Rajagopalachari had been reluctant to accept the responsibility as Chief Minister and the leader of the Madras Legislature Congress party as his health was fragile and added that by acceding to the request of the party, Rajagopalachari had put country before self. Rajagopalachari did not contest the by-election and on 10 April 1952, Madras Governor Sri Prakasa appointed him as Chief Minister by nomination as MLC without consulting either the Prime Minister Nehru or the ministers in the Madras state cabinet. It was the first time when the governor office was accused of acting inappropriately after independence. P. C. Alexander, a former governor of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra wrote about the appointment of Rajagopalachari as &quot;The most conspicuous case of constitutional impropriety by the Governor in the exercise of discretion to choose the Chief Minister...&quot;

On 3 July 1952, Rajagopalachari was then able to prove that he had a majority in the assembly by luring MLAs from opposition parties and independents to join the Indian National Congress. 19 members of the Tamil Nadu Toilers Party led by S. S. Ramasami Padayachi, 5 members of the Madras State Muslim League and 6 members of Commonweal Party also provided their support to Rajagopalachari to prevent the Communists from gaining power. Nehru was furious and wrote to Rajagopalachari saying &quot;the one thing we must avoid giving is the impression that we stick to office and we want to keep others out at all costs.&quot; Rajagopalachari, however, refused to contest a by-election and remained as a nominated member of the Legislative Council.

During Rajagopalachari&#x27;s tenure as Chief Minister, a powerful movement for a separate Andhra State, comprising the Telugu-speaking districts of the Madras State, gained a foothold. On 19 October 1952, an Indian independence activist and social worker from Madras named Potti Sriramulu embarked on a hunger strike reiterating the demands of the separatists and calling for the inclusion of Madras city within the proposed state. Rajagopalachari remained unmoved by Sriramulu&#x27;s action and refused to intervene. After fasting for days, Sriramulu eventually died on 15 December 1952, triggering riots in Madras city and the Telugu-speaking districts of the state. Initially, both Rajagopalachari and Prime Minister Nehru were against the creation of linguistically demarcated states but as the law and order situation in the state deteriorated, both were forced to accept the demands. Andhra State was thus created on 1 October 1953 from the Telugu-speaking districts of Madras, with its capital at Kurnool. However, the boundaries of the new state were determined by a commission which decided against the inclusion of Madras city. Though the commission&#x27;s report suggested the option of having Madras as the temporary capital of Andhra State to allow smooth partitioning of the assets and the secretariat, Rajagopalachari refused to allow Andhra State to have Madras even for a day.

On 7 June 1952, Rajagopalachari ended the procurement policy and food rationing in the state, abolishing all price and quota controls. His decision was a rejection of a planned economy in favour of a free market economy. He also introduced measures to regulate the running of universities in the state.

In 1953, he introduced a new education scheme known as the &quot;Modified Scheme of Elementary education 1953&quot;, which reduced schooling for elementary school students from five hours to three hours per day and suggested that boys to learn the family crafts from their father and girls housekeeping from their mothers. Rajaji had not even consulted his own cabinet or members of the legislative assembly before the scheme&#x27;s implementation. He said: &quot;Did Shankara or Ramanuja announce their philosophy after consulting others?&quot;. The scheme came in for sharp criticism and evoked strong protests from the Dravidian parties. Two amendments were proposed against the scheme at the Madras State legislative assembly. One advocated for a study by an expert group, while another advocated for the scheme&#x27;s abolition. Both sides launched publicity campaigns in June 1953. At the Adyar riverside, Rajaji made a speech to the washermen. He stated kuladharma, or each clan&#x27;s or caste&#x27;s social obligation. He delivered talks and made radio broadcasts to clarify his views. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam dubbed the scheme &quot;Kula Kalvi Thittam&quot; or Hereditary Education Policy which was put forward with the intention of perpetuating the caste system. and attempted to organize massive demonstrations outside Rajagopalachari&#x27;s house on 13 and 14 July 1953. The scheme was criticized from political leaders from all sides as casteist. Opponents and critics claimed that the system would reinforce deep-seated, caste-based inequality in society. They regarded the plan as an attempt to place children from the upper caste in an advantageous place than children from oppressed groups, who were simply supposed to learn their father&#x27;s job. Rajagopalachari argued, It is a mistake to imagine that the school is within the walls. The whole village is a school. The village polytechnic is there, every branch of it, the dhobi, the wheelwright, the cobbler.

The Scheme was stayed by the house and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme. The committee found the scheme to be sound and endorsed the Government&#x27;s position. India&#x27;s President Rajendra Prasad and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also offered their support to the scheme.

Rajagopalachari closed down 6000 schools, citing financial constraints. Kamaraj opposed this policy and eventually opened 12,000 schools in his tenure.

Despite his government&#x27;s efforts to postpone the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education 1953, public resistance grew, particularly in response to initiatives that sought to establish Hindi as the national language. The rising unpopularity of his government forced Rajagopalachari to resign on 26 March 1954, as the President of the Madras Congress Legislature Party (CLP) thereby precipitating new elections. Kamaraj&#x27;s name was proposed by P. Varadarajalu Naidu for the post of CLP leader. M. Bakthavatsalam, another senior Congress leader, fielded C. Subramaniam. On 30 March 1954, the election took place, Subramaniam could garner only 41 votes to Kamaraj&#x27;s 93 and lost the elections. Rajagopalachari eventually resigned as Chief Minister on 13 April 1954, attributing the decision to poor health.

== Split from Congress – parting of ways ==

Following his resignation as Chief Minister, Rajagopalachari took a temporary break from active politics and instead devoted his time to literary pursuits. He wrote a Tamil re-telling of the Sanskrit epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; which appeared as a serial in the Tamil magazine &quot;Kalki&quot; from 23 May 1954 to 6 November 1955. The episodes were later collected and published as &quot;Chakravarthi Thirumagan&quot;, a book which won Rajagopalachari the 1958 Sahitya Academy award in Tamil language.

Rajagopalachari tendered his official resignation from the Indian National Congress and along with a number of other dissidents organised the Congress Reform Committee (CRC) in January 1957. K. S. Venkatakrishna Reddiar was elected president and the party fielded candidates in 55 constituencies in the 1957 state assembly elections, to emerge as the second largest party in Madras state with 13 seats in the legislative assembly. The Congress Reform Committee also contested 12 Lok Sabha seats during the 1957 Indian elections. The committee became a fully-fledged political party and was renamed the Indian National Democratic Congress at a state conference held in Madurai on September 28–29, 1957.

On 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya of the newly established Forum of Free Enterprise (FFE) and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist Nehru, announced the formation of the new Swatantra Party at a meeting in Madras. Conceived by disgruntled heads of former princely states such as the Raja of Ramgarh, the Maharaja of Kalahandi and the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, the party was conservative in character. Later, N. G. Ranga, K. M. Munshi, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort. Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve Jayaprakash Narayan in the initiative.

In his short essay &quot;Our Democracy&quot;, Rajagopalachari explained the necessity for a right-wing alternative to the Congress by saying:
since... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a strong and articulate Right
Rajagopalachari also insisted that the opposition must:
operate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but openly and periodically through the electorate.
He outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty one &quot;fundamental principles&quot; in the foundation document. The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector. Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term &quot;licence-permit Raj&quot; to describe Nehru&#x27;s elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari&#x27;s personality became a rallying point for the party.

In 1961, Rajagopalachari criticized Operation Vijay, the Indian military action in which Portuguese rule in Goa was forcibly ended and the territory was incorporated into India, writing that India had &quot;totally lost the moral power to raise her voice against militarism&quot; and had undermined the power and prestige of the United Nations Security Council. According to Rajagopalachari, while Portuguese rule in Goa had been an &quot;offense to Indian nationalism&quot;, it was not a greater offense than the Chinese occupation of territories claimed by India or the social evil of untouchability, and the &quot;great adventure&quot; of seizing Goa undermined India&#x27;s devotion to Gandhian principles of non-violence.

Rajagopalachari&#x27;s efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras legislative assembly elections. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded. The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections.

== 1965 Anti-Hindi agitations in Madras ==

On 26 January 1950, the Government of India adopted Hindi as the official language of the country, but because of objections in non-Hindi-speaking areas, it introduced a provision tentatively making English the second official language on a par with Hindi for a stipulated fifteen-year period to facilitate a switch to Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states. From 26 January 1965 onwards, Hindi was to become the sole official language of the Indian Union and people in non-Hindi speaking regions were compelled to learn Hindi. This led to vehement opposition and just before Republic Day, severe anti-Hindi protests broke out in Madras State. Rajagopalachari had earlier been sharply critical of the recommendations made by the Official Languages Commission in 1957. On 28 January 1956, Rajagopalachari signed a resolution along with Annadurai and Periyar endorsing the continuation of English as the official language. At an All-India Language Conference held on 8 March 1958, he declared: &quot;Hindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English [is] to the protagonists of Hindi&quot;. When the Anti-Hindi agitations broke out in 1965, Rajagopalachari completely reversed his 1938 support for the introduction of Hindi and took a strongly anti-Hindi stand in support of the protests, coining the slogan &#x27;English Ever, Hindi Never&#x27;. On 17 January 1965, he convened the Madras state Anti-Hindi conference in Tiruchirapalli. angrily declaring that Part XVII of the Constitution of India which declared that Hindi was the official language should &quot;be heaved and thrown into the Arabian Sea.&quot;

== 1967 elections ==

The fourth elections to the Madras Legislative assembly were held in February 1967. At the age of 88, Rajagopalachari worked to forge a united opposition to the Indian National Congress through a tripartite alliance between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Swatantra Party and the Forward Bloc. The Congress party was defeated in Madras for the first time in 30 years and the coalition led by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam came to power. C. N. Annadurai served as Chief Minister from 6 March 1967 until his death on 3 February 1969. Rajagopalachari delivered a moving eulogy to Annadurai at his funeral.

The Swatantra Party also did well in elections in other states and to the Lok Sabha, the directly elected lower house of the Parliament of India. It won 45 Lok Sabha seats in the 1967 general elections and emerged as the single largest opposition party. The principal opposition party in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, it also formed a coalition government in Odisha and had a significant presence in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Bihar.

== Later years and death ==

In 1971, Annadurai&#x27;s successor M. Karunanidhi relaxed prohibition laws in Tamil Nadu due to the poor financial situation of the state. Rajagopalachari pleaded with him not to repeal prohibition but to no avail and as a result, the Swatantra Party withdrew its support for the state government and instead allied with the Congress (O), a breakaway faction of the Indian National Congress led by Kamaraj.

In January 1971, a three-party anti-Congress coalition was established by the Congress (O), Jan Sangh and the Samyukta Socialist Party then on 8 January, the national executive of the Swatantra Party took the unanimous decision to join the coalition. The dissident parties formed an alliance called the National Democratic Front and fought against the Indian National Congress led by Indira Gandhi in the 1971 Indian general elections. However, the alliance fared badly. The Swatantra Party&#x27;s tally was reduced to 8 seats from 23 in the 1967 elections. The decline of the Swatantra Party was also visible in the 1971 Tamil Nadu Legislative assembly elections in which it won just 19 seats down from 27 in the 1967 elections.

By November 1972, Rajagopalachari&#x27;s health had begun to decline and on 17 December the same year, a week after his 94th birthday, he was admitted to the Government Hospital, Madras suffering from uraemia, dehydration and a urinary infection. In the hospital, he was visited by Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, V. V. Giri, Periyar and other state and national leaders. Rajagopalachari&#x27;s condition deteriorated in the following days as he frequently lost consciousness and he died at 5:44 pm on 25 December 1972 at the age of 94. His son, C. R. Narasimhan, was at his bedside at the time of his death reading him verses from a Hindu holy book. He was a widower for 56 years, and also outlived a son and both his sons-in-law.

On his death, condolences poured in from all corners of the country. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India commented:

An accomplished writer both in his mother tongue Tamil as well as English, Rajagopalachari was the founder of the Salem Literary Society and regularly participated in its meetings. In 1922, he published &quot;Siraiyil Tavam&quot; (Meditation in jail), a day-to-day account of his first imprisonment by the colonial government from 21 December 1921 to 20 March 1922.

Rajagopalachari started the Tamil Scientific Terms Society in 1916, a group that coined new words in Tamil for terms connected to botany, chemistry, physics, astronomy and mathematics. It received a mixed reception because it relied on Sanskrit roots to coin new Tamil words.

In 1951, he wrote an abridged retelling of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; in English, followed by one of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; in 1957. Earlier, in 1961, he had translated Kambar&#x27;s Tamil &quot;Ramayana&quot; into English. In 1965, he translated the Thirukkural into English and also wrote books on the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads in English as well as works on Socrates and Marcus Aurelius in Tamil. Rajagopalachari often regarded his literary works as the best service he had rendered to the people. In 1958, he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for works in the Tamil language for his retelling of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; – &quot;Chakravarti Thirumagan&quot;. He was also one of the founders of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, an organisation dedicated to the promotion of education and Indian culture. In 1959, the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan published his book: &quot;Hinduism: Doctrine and Way of Life&quot;.

Apart from his literary works, Rajagopalachari also composed a devotional song &quot;Kurai Onrum Illai&quot; devoted to Lord Venkateswara, a song set to music and a regular at Carnatic concerts. Rajagopalachari composed a benediction hymn sung by M. S. Subbulakshmi at the United Nations General Assembly in 1967.

== Legacy ==

In 1954, during US Vice-president Richard Nixon&#x27;s nineteen country Asian tour, he was lectured by Rajagopalachari on the consuming emotional quality of nuclear weapons. The pair discussed spiritual life, particularly reincarnation and predestination. Nixon wrote three pages of notes recording Rajagopalachari&#x27;s words, claiming in his memoirs thirty-six years later that the afternoon &quot;had such a dramatic effect on me that I used many of his thoughts in my speeches over the next several years.&quot;

While on a tour to the United States as a member of the Gandhi Peace Foundation delegation, in September 1962, Rajagopalachari visited American President John F. Kennedy at the White House. Rajagopalachari warned Kennedy of the dangers of embarking on an arms race, even one which the US could win. At the end of the meeting Kennedy remarked &quot;This meeting had the most civilizing influence on me. Seldom have I heard a case presented with such precision, clarity and elegance of language&quot;. On 1 May 1955, Rajagopalachari appealed to the Government of India to cancel receipt of aid from America if the country continued with its nuclear tests. India&#x27;s use of military force against Portugal to capture the Portuguese enclave of Goa was criticised by Rajagopalachari who said of the operation and subsequent acts of international diplomacy, &quot;India has totally lost the moral power to raise her voice against the use of military power.&quot;

E. M. S. Namboodiripad, a prominent Communist Party leader, once remarked that Rajagopalachari was the Congress leader he respected the most despite the fact he was also someone with whom he had the most differences. Of Rajagopalachari, Periyar, one of his foremost political rivals remarked &quot;he was a leader unique and unequaled, who lived and worked for high ideals&quot;.

Regarded as a pioneer of social reform, Rajagopalachari issued temple entry proclamations in the Madras Presidency and worked towards the upliftment of Dalits. He played a pivotal role in the conclusion of the Poona Pact between B. R. Ambedkar and the Indian National Congress and spearheaded the Mahabal Temple Entry program in 1938. He was a staunch advocate of prohibition and was elected Secretary of the Prohibition League of India in 1930. On assuming the premiership of the Madras Presidency, he introduced prohibition throughout the province. where it remained in vogue until its removal by M. Karunanidhi over thirty years later in 1971 and again prohibited by Karunanidhi in 1974 until it was reintroduced by M.G. Ramachandran in 1981. Rajagopalachari was also an active member of the All India Spinners Association. and a strong opponent of &quot;linguistic states&quot;, which he felt would bring anarchy to India.

He is also remembered for his literary contributions, some of which are considered modern-day classics. He frequently wrote articles for &quot;Kalki&quot; and his own journal &quot;Swarajya&quot;, of which Philip Spratt was editor.

Richard Casey, Governor of Bengal from 1944 to 1946, regarded Rajagopalachari as the wisest man in India. The best possible tribute to Rajagopalachari was from Mahatma Gandhi who referred to him as the &quot;keeper of my conscience&quot;. Today, his private papers are part of the archives at the Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library, at Teen Murti House, Delhi.

On 21 August 1978, a portrait of Rajagopalachari is put in the Central Hall of Parliament House. The portrait of Rajagopalachari, painted by N. S. Subbakrishna, was unveiled by the then President of India, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.

== Reception ==

Critics opine that he failed to gauge the thoughts and feelings of the masses in provincial and then state administrations. His introduction of Hindi and the Modified Scheme of Elementary education 1953 (dubbed by its critics as Hereditary Education Policy) have been the target of extensive criticism. His pacifist stance during the Quit India Movement and his C. R. Formula angered most of his colleagues in the Indian National Congress.

Referring to Rajagopalachari, Sarojini Naidu, who was never on good terms with him, remarked that &#x27;the Madras fox was a dry logical Adi Shankaracharya while Nehru was the noble, compassionate Buddha&#x27;.

Although his popularity at the regional level fluctuated greatly, Rajagopalachari was able to exercise his stranglehold over provincial politics mainly because he was favored by national leaders such as Gandhi, Patel and Nehru. The President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, K. Kamaraj, and a majority of the provincial leaders opposed him in the 1940s, Rajagopalachari clung on to a position of influence in regional politics through support from his colleagues at the center.

Rajagopalachari has always been the archetype of the Tamil Brahmin nemesis of the Dravidian movement. He was accused of being pro-Sanskrit and pro-Hindi, despite his fierce support for the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1965. Rajagopalachari claimed that jati was &quot;the most important element in the organization of our society&quot;. Christophe Jaffrelot argued that Rajagopalachari and other political leaders including Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel praised the caste system both indirectly and directly as a glue that binds the social structure together. As a governor-general, Rajaji stated, The food is grown, the cloth is woven, the sheep are shorn, the shoes are stitched, the scavenging is done, the cartwheels and the ploughs are built and repaired because, thank God, the respective castes are still there and the homes are trade schools as well and the parents are masters as well, to whom the children are automatically apprenticed.

<text>Citytv (sometimes shortened to City, which was the network&#x27;s official branding from 2012 to 2018) is a Canadian television network owned by the Rogers Sports &amp; Media subsidiary of Rogers Communications. The network consists of six owned-and-operated (O&amp;O) television stations located in the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver, a cable-only service that serves the province of Saskatchewan, and three independently owned affiliates serving smaller cities in Alberta and British Columbia. There is also one station using the brand name serving Bogotá, Colombia.

The Citytv brand name originates from its flagship station, CITY-TV in Toronto, a station that went on the air in September 28, 1972, in the former Electric Circus nightclub, and which became known for an intensely local format based on newscasts aimed at younger viewers, nightly movies, and music and cultural programming. The Citytv brand first expanded with then-parent company CHUM Limited&#x27;s acquisition of former Global owned-and-operated station CKVU-TV in Vancouver, followed by its purchase of Craig Media&#x27;s stations and the re-branding of its A-Channel system in Central Canada as Citytv in August 2005. CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) in 2007; to comply with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ownership limits, the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers. The network grew through further affiliations with three Jim Pattison Group-owned stations, along with Rogers&#x27;s acquisition of the cable-only Saskatchewan Communications Network and Montreal&#x27;s CJNT-DT. At one point, Citytv also existed in Barcelona and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

While patterned after the original station in Toronto, since the 2000s, and particularly since its acquisition by Rogers, Citytv has moved towards a series-based prime time schedule much like its competitors&#x27;, albeit one still focused on younger demographics.

== Early beginnings ==

The licence of the original Citytv station, granted the callsign of CITY-TV by the CRTC, was awarded in Toronto on November 25, 1971, by Channel Seventy-Nine Ltd., which consisted of – among others – Phyllis Switzer, Moses Znaimer, Jerry Grafstein and Edgar Cowan. The four principal owners raised over $2 million to help start up the station, with Grafstein raising about 50% of the required funds, Znaimer raising around 25%, and the remainder being accrued by Switzer and Cowan. CITY-TV began broadcasting on September 28, 1972, for the first time using the &quot;Citytv&quot; brand and initially operated as an independent station, and its transmitter operated at an effective radiated power of 31kW. The station operated from studio facilities located at 99 Queen Street East, near Church Street, at the former Electric Circus nightclub.

The station lost money early on, and was in debt by 1975. Multiple Access Ltd. (the owners of CFCF-TV in Montreal) purchased a 45% interest in the station, and sold its stake to CHUM Limited, the parent company of CKVR-TV in Barrie, Ontario, in 1978.

On May 1, 1976, the station&#x27;s main transmitter began broadcasting at 208 kW from the CN Tower. The station switched channel allocations on July 1, 1983, moving to UHF channel 57, the result of Industry Canada&#x27;s decision to reassign frequencies corresponding to high-band UHF channels 70 to 83 to the new AMPS mobile phone systems as a result of a CCIR international convention in 1982. 

In 1981, CITY was purchased outright by CHUM with the sale of Moses Znaimer&#x27;s interest in the station. Znaimer remained with the station as an executive until 2003, when he retired from his management role but continued to work with the station on some production projects. CITY and the other CHUM-owned television properties moved their operations to the company&#x27;s headquarters at 299 Queen Street West in May 1987, which became one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. On March 30, 1998, CHUM launched CablePulse 24 (CP24), a local cable news channel whose programming used anchors from and featured reports filed by CITY-TV&#x27;s news staff, rebroadcasts of the station&#x27;s &quot;CityPulse&quot; newscasts and select programming from CITY and other CHUM stations.

==Expansion beyond Toronto==
CHUM added CITY-TV&#x27;s three rebroadcast transmitters in Woodstock (CITY-TV-2 on channel 31, which also served nearby London) on September 1, 1986, while another transmitter was set up in Ottawa in 1996 (CITY-TV-3 on channel 65).

CITY-TV&#x27;s groundbreaking format became successful when CHUM dropped CKVR&#x27;s longtime affiliation with CBC Television on September 1, 1995 and relaunched it as an independent station. Eventually, CHUM began to replicate the format when it acquired four Ontario stations from Baton Broadcasting in 1997, namely CHRO in Pembroke, CFPL-TV in London, CKNX-TV in Wingham, and CHWI-TV in Windsor. Most of these stations were also former CBC affiliates, and in markets where CKVR&#x27;s sister station, CITY-TV, was already or subsequently became available on basic cable.

Until 1997, CHUM owned two television outlets in Atlantic Canada: the ATV system of CTV affiliates, and cable-only channel ASN. Many Citytv programs were aired on ASN during this period, effectively making ASN an unbranded Citytv O&amp;O. Both ATV and ASN were acquired by Baton Broadcasting (now Bell Media) in 1997; ASN continued to air much of the Citytv schedule until it became part of the A (now CTV 2) television system in 2008. This means that Atlantic Canada is now the largest gap in City&#x27;s local coverage area, and there are few remaining realistic options for Rogers to purchase or affiliate with existing stations in the region. This had led Rogers to attempt, unsuccessfully, to request simultaneous substitution privileges for Citytv Toronto on its cable systems in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. Prior to the CRTC&#x27;s decision to refuse the request, Rogers had hinted that a similar agreement had been tentatively reached with EastLink, the main cable provider in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

In 2000, after Canwest Global Communications acquired the assets of Western International Communications which led to a network shuffle in Vancouver, CHUM applied to the CRTC to acquire CKVU-TV (Global Vancouver) on July 26, 2001 for $175 million, with the intention of making it a newest Citytv station. CHUM planned on spending $8.03 million on British Columbia-based independent productions, $5.95 million on local news and information programming, and $1.37 million on local culture, social policy, and talent development over a period of seven years. A similar application was filed in 1996 by the CRTC but was dropped in favor of Baton launching CIVT-TV in 1997. CHUM gained CRTC approval for its acquisition of CKVU on October 15, 2001. Meanwhile, CIVI-TV in Victoria, British Columbia went on the air in October 2001 using the same format as CITY-TV. CKVU became known as &quot;Citytv Vancouver&quot; on July 22, 2002. Prior to CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of CKVU, some Citytv programming were split between KVOS-TV in Bellingham, Washington, which is close to Vancouver, and CTV-owned CIVT-TV, during the 1990s and early 2000s when Citytv did not have a station in Vancouver; CHAN-TV, then a CTV affiliate, also aired some Citytv programs, such as &quot;CityLine&quot;. The WIC stations in Alberta (including CITV-TV and CICT-TV) bought provincial rights to some Citytv programs prior to the launch of CKAL and CKEM in 1997.

On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The move came more than a month after the CRTC denied CHUM&#x27;s applications for new Calgary and Edmonton stations, which they applied back in 2003, because the market did not have sufficient advertising revenue to support a new entrant. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1 because it already owned stations in Toronto and nearby Barrie; Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media.

In February 2005, CHUM announced it would align Craig&#x27;s A-Channel stations with its existing major-market stations under the Citytv brand. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations&#x27;s on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv; they initially retained their local programs, relaunched under Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; morning brand and &quot;CityNews&quot; news brand. CHUM hoped to lift the ratings of the stations with the new moniker. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations.
On July 12, 2006, CHUM announced that it would dramatically reduce its newsgathering operations in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, and Winnipeg, as well as in several other cities. It laid off 281 part- and full-time employees, effectively cancelleing its supper-hour, late-night and weekend newscasts, laying off hundreds of news department staff among 281 job cuts. In a coincidental development, that same day, BCE Inc., owner of Bell Globemedia and the parent company of CTV, announced it would buy CHUM Limited.

==Ownership changes==

Bell Globemedia had intended to retain CHUM&#x27;s Citytv system while divesting CHUM&#x27;s A-Channel stations and Alberta cable channel Access to get the CRTC to approve the acquisition.

In October 2006, Citytv launched a daily national newscast, &quot;CityNews International&quot;, which was produced in Toronto for broadcast on the western Canadian stations and on CHUM&#x27;s Toronto news channel CP24. The Edmonton and Calgary stations also began broadcasting a daily 30-minute magazine show, &quot;Your City&quot;, instead of a full-fledged newscast. The Vancouver news operation, which had operated for 30 years under various owners and station identities, was not maintained aside from &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;. In the same month, Citytv Toronto became the first television station in Canada to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

The following year on June 8, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the CRTC made the deal conditional on CTV divesting itself of Citytv, because there were already CTV owned-and-operated stations serving the same cities (CFTO-TV Toronto, CIVT-TV Vancouver, CFCN-TV Calgary, CFRN-TV Edmonton, and CKY-TV Winnipeg). Without the divestment, CTV would have exceeded the CRTC&#x27;s concentration of media ownership limits. CTV announced on June 11, 2007, that it would retain the A-Channel stations, and sell the Citytv stations to Rogers Communications for $375 million. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on September 28 and was completed on October 31, 2007. On September 8, 2009, CITY Toronto moved to its current location at Yonge-Dundas Square at 33 Dundas Street East.

On December 6, 2010, &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot; Toronto anchor and continuity announcer Mark Dailey died after a long battle with cancer. The Citytv system began to phase in a modified branding in October 2012, with a new logo consisting only of the name &quot;City&quot;, and some promotions using the verbal branding &quot;City Television&quot; (later also switched to simply &quot;City&quot;) instead of &quot;Citytv&quot;. The change marked the first major alteration to the &quot;Citytv&quot; brand since its introduction in 1972. The network adopted the name &quot;City&quot; on December 31, 2012, during its New Year&#x27;s Eve special. For the 2018–19 television season, the network reintroduced its original &quot;Citytv&quot; branding, and its social media accounts.

==Transformation into a television network==
The Jim Pattison Group announced in July 2009 that its three television stations in western Canada (CKPG-TV, CFJC-TV, and CHAT-TV), formerly affiliated with E!, would join Citytv starting on September 1, 2009. These stations do not carry the Citytv branding; instead, the stations continue to use the same branding and logos they used as affiliates of the E! system. The Pattison-owned Citytv affiliates produce local newscasts, but do not produce their own versions of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; nor title their midday and evening newscasts under the &quot;CityNews&quot; brand like the Citytv owned-and-operated stations do. Through a long-term affiliation renewal agreement on May 3, 2012, the Pattison stations began to carry 90% of Citytv&#x27;s primetime programming and the majority of its morning and daytime programming from the programming grid of CKVU-DT, including simulcasts of the Vancouver edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;. Unlike CKVU, the Pattison stations continue to produce midday and evening local newscasts.

Meanwhile, on December 20, 2011, Bluepoint Investment Corporation announced an affiliation agreement with Rogers Communications to air Citytv programming on the Saskatchewan Communications Network (SCN) from 3 p.m.-6 a.m. CT daily, beginning on January 2, 2012. This program block followed the national program grid of Citytv and was known on-air as &quot;Citytv on SCN&quot;. Shortly after, on January 17, 2012, Rogers announced its intent to acquire SCN from Bluepoint. The deal gave the Citytv system stations in all provinces west of Quebec and south of the federal territories of Northern Canada. The sale was approved in late June 2012 by the CRTC and Rogers relaunched SCN as Citytv Saskatchewan on July 1. Rogers plans to invest in the station&#x27;s infrastructure, and also launch a high definition feed.

In Montreal, Rogers announced its intent to acquire multicultural station CJNT-DT from Toronto-based Channel Zero on May 3, 2012, and announced an affiliation agreement with the station, effective June 4, 2012. This gave Citytv stations in all provinces west of Atlantic Canada as well as the system&#x27;s first television station located east of the Greater Toronto Area. On December 20, 2012, the CRTC approved the acquisition of CJNT and Rogers&#x27;s request to convert the station from multicultural to a conventional English-language station. The station began carrying the full Citytv schedule on February 4, 2013, turning Citytv from a television system into a full-fledged network. Rogers will produce 15.5 hours of local programming a week for CJNT (including a local edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;), and agreed to contribute funding and programming to a new independent multicultural station in Montreal.

==Programming==
Citytv is well known for its unconventional approach to news and local programming. There is no news desk (anchors read the news standing up, or on stools), and cameras are sometimes hand-held. Citytv also pioneered the concept of videojournalism, where reporters often carry their own camera report and videotape their own stories. Citytv calls its videojournalists &quot;videographers&quot;, but unlike many stations in American television markets that try to conceal the fact that reporters are so-called &quot;one-man bands&quot;, Citytv embraced the use of video journalism by highlighting the use of technology; Citytv videographers often carry a second home video camera to record images of them videotaping on the scene. The low-grade video is then incorporated into the story to show viewers how the story was recorded.

At one time, Citytv&#x27;s Toronto flagship CITY-TV produced more local programs than any other television station in Canada, and more local programming than any other station in North America other than Boston&#x27;s WCVB-TV. Citytv produced shows such as &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot;, &quot;CityLine&quot; and was the original home of &quot;FashionTelevision&quot;, &quot;SexTV&quot; and &quot;MediaTelevision&quot;. Many of these series were not exclusively focused on Toronto – &quot;FT&quot;, for instance, consisted largely of foreign runway footage – and are easily syndicated to other outlets. The latter three shows are now owned by CTVglobemedia as a result of its takeover of CHUM and subsequent divestiture of the Citytv stations.
CITY prominently broadcast feature films during primetime, in late night and on weekends as part of the &quot;Great Movies&quot; block; as Citytv transitioned to a primetime lineup consisting of mainly domestic and American series during the 2000s, &quot;Great Movies&quot; was scaled back, then replaced in 2008 by reruns, reality shows and infomercials.

The station attracted attention and controversy by airing &quot;The Baby Blue Movie&quot;, a softcore pornography film showcase on Friday nights after midnight. Although this programming block was discontinued in the 1980s, it was reinstated on CITY and CKVU throughout most of the 2000s, until its ownership change to Rogers Communications. This, along with the &#x27;hide away&#x27; place on the UHF dial formed the basis of fictional station &quot;CIVIC TV&quot; (Channel 83, Cable 12) in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Videodrome&quot;, which is set in Toronto.

Citytv was one of the first television stations in Canada to implement a diversity policy in hiring its on-air staff, actively seeking out people of colour, people with disabilities, and other minority groups to work as on-air journalists. Znaimer described the policy as wanting the station to &quot;look like Toronto&quot;.

Beginning in 1983, Citytv began to produce a New Year&#x27;s Eve special live from Nathan Phillips Square in Downtown Toronto. Most recently known as the &quot;City New Year&#x27;s Eve Bash&quot;, the yearly concert special expanded to include a second event in Calgary, Alberta for its 2012–13 edition. In 2013–14, Citytv began simulcasting ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; instead of airing its own full special, though it continued to sponsor (and air some coverage of) the New Year&#x27;s event in Toronto.

===News===
Citytv Toronto&#x27;s &quot;CityNews&quot;, which used to be known as &quot;CityPulse&quot;, had developed a large following since its debut in 1977. Other stations around the world have imitated its format to varying degrees of success. However, Citytv itself was unsuccessful in expanding its audience to other Canadian markets, as evidenced by the eventual cancellation of the other stations&#x27; traditional newscasts. Flagship station CITY-DT, along with Jim Pattison Group-owned affiliates CFJC-TV, CKPG-TV and CHAT-TV are the only Citytv stations producing midday or evening newscasts. The Pattison stations use their individual callsigns, instead of branding under the Citytv name and do not use the &quot;CityNews&quot; title for their weekday newscasts. Four of City&#x27;s five other owned-and-operated broadcast stations (CKVU-DT, CKAL-DT, CKEM-DT and CHMI-DT) only produce localized versions of the morning program franchise &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;. Citytv Saskatchewan, meanwhile, does not carry any local programming, and would be unable to broadcast &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; due to its mandate of airing educational programming in the morning and daytime hours.

Due to the structural problems facing the conventional television industry in Canada and the Great Recession, Rogers Media announced cost-cutting measures at the Citytv stations on January 19, 2010, which included massive layoffs and the cancellation of the following newscasts:
* &quot;CityNews at Noon&quot; in Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto
* &quot;Lunch Television&quot; in Vancouver
* &quot;Your City&quot; in Calgary and Edmonton, which was an evening replacement for previous CityNews programming that was cancelled in 2006.
* The satirical news program &quot;The CityNews List&quot; in Vancouver
* &quot;CityOnline&quot;, &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; and all weekend news programming in Toronto (the latter two were restored in 2011)
* City&#x27;s national and international newscast, &quot;CityNews International&quot;

CITY-DT used to operate CP24, a cable news channel covering the Greater Toronto Area. During CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited, the company chose to retain CP24, and the channel was re-aligned with CFTO (CTV). As a replacement, Rogers received approval for, and launched, CityNews Channel in October 2011. The network was modelled on Rogers-owned radio station CFTR 680, and featured news, weather, traffic reports, and other content drawing from the resources of Rogers properties such as &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and Sportsnet. On May 30, 2013, as part of budget cuts, Rogers announced that the network would be shut down.

Citytv continued to produce &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; for all markets, and 6:00 p.m. and late-night &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot; in Toronto only (the evening newscasts in Toronto excluded weekend broadcasts until March 2011; the 5 p.m. newscast, meanwhile, would return in September 2011). 60 employees (including long-time Toronto news anchor Anne Mroczkowski) were laid off across Canada.

In 2015, Rogers cancelled the Winnipeg and Edmonton editions of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;; in Winnipeg, it was replaced by a simulcast of the morning show from co-owned radio station CITI-FM, and the Edmonton edition was replaced by the spin-off &quot;Dinner Television&quot;, an evening newsmagazine and discussion program which did not feature original news reporting.

On June 5, 2017, Rogers announced that it would relaunch local &quot;CityNews&quot; evening newscasts across its stations, which would air at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. nightly. The Edmonton and Winnipeg newscasts premiered on September 4, 2017, followed by Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver on September 3, 2018.

===Sports===

====National broadcasts====
Sports broadcasts on the Citytv stations have been sparse over the years. Between 2005 and 2014, the predominant sports property on Citytv was coverage of the National Football League.

Craig Media (then-owners of the current Citytv stations in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Calgary) owned the rights to &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in the early 2000s, and these rights moved to Citytv for &quot;MNF&quot;″s final season on ABC in 2005, before being moved again to TSN in 2006. Following the sale to Rogers, CKVU carried Sunday afternoon &quot;late window&quot; (4:00/4:15 p.m. ET, 1:00/1:15 p.m. PT) games during the 2007 season (as did Omni Television station CJMT in Toronto). From the 2008 season through 2013, all Citytv stations carried Sunday late-window games. After rights to late games were acquired by CTV (who also airs early games), Sportsnet and Citytv maintained rights to &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and the afternoon American Thanksgiving games until the 2017 season, when these rights were acquired by TSN.

Under Rogers ownership, Citytv has aired occasional sports broadcasts as an overflow channel for co-owned Sportsnet, such as a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification group-stage match between Canada and Panama on September 11, 2012, in simulcast with Sportsnet One. It has also broadcast supplementary coverage of two tennis events that were primarily broadcast by the Sportsnet channels: the 2012 Rogers Cup, and the 2012 Davis Cup World Group Play-off between Canada and South Africa.

On November 26, 2013, Rogers announced a 12-year, $5.2 billion deal to become the exclusive national rightsholder to the National Hockey League in the 2014–15 season. Beginning in October 2014, Citytv began to broadcast NHL games produced by Sportsnet as part of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, and &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&quot;, a Sunday night game of the week hosted by Ron MacLean. &quot;Hometown Hockey&quot; moved from Citytv to Sportsnet for the 2015-16 season.

====Local/regional broadcasts====
*In addition to NFL regular-season games, CITY also aired some Buffalo Bills preseason games (including those held at the Rogers Centre).
*The Citytv stations in Alberta (while still branded &quot;A-Channel&quot;) carried some regional NHL games during their first few years of operation. They occasionally carried regional broadcasts in the event of conflicts with other Sportsnet programming (Sportsnet West being the regional rightsholder to both the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames) until December 2009. Similarly, CKVU Vancouver carried two regional Vancouver Canucks broadcasts during the 2009-10 season, again due to programming conflicts on Sportsnet Pacific. Sportsnet has since preferred the use of regional overflow feeds tied to the license of Sportsnet One for these purposes.
*CITY-TV Toronto broadcast some regular-season basketball games during the inaugural season of the Toronto Raptors.
*On March 2, 2008, CITY-TV aired its first baseball game, a Toronto Blue Jays spring training game, against the Cincinnati Reds. The Blue Jays, like City, are owned by Rogers.
*CKVU occasionally carried broadcasts of Major League Soccer&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps FC as part of Sportsnet&#x27;s regional broadcast deal with the team from 2010 to 2013.
*CJNT occasionally carried overflow broadcasts of the Montreal Canadiens as part of Sportsnet&#x27;s regional broadcast deal with the team from 2014 through 2017.
*CKEM carried FC Edmonton games for a period.

==Citytv stations==

Individual stations are normally branded on-air as simply &quot;Citytv&quot; (from 2012 to 2018, the stations were referred to as &quot;City&quot;); the location may be added, for example &quot;Citytv Toronto&quot;, if disambiguation is necessary. The list also mentions which stations had been owned by either CHUM Ltd. or Rogers, depending on affiliation.

Like most Canadian networks, Citytv stations are generally available as distant signals on most cable and satellite providers nationwide.

===Owned-and-operated stations===
===Affiliates and international franchises===
The Citytv brand has been licensed to local television stations in Bogotá, Colombia, and formerly in Barcelona, Spain. Toronto&#x27;s CITY-DT is broadcast on a number of cable television providers in the Caribbean. In Barbados, Citytv is carried on channel 507 of the terrestrial subscription service known as Multi-Choice TV.
1 Italicized channel numbers indicate a digital channel allocated for future use by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

===Former franchises===
==Citytv HD==

In 2003, CHUM Limited launched a high definition simulcast of its Toronto station CITY-TV. In October 2006, Citytv installed a new control room, becoming one of the first fully HD broadcasters in Canada. On March 2, 2010, CKVU-TV in Vancouver launched its HD simulcast. CKEM-TV in Edmonton began testing its digital signal on May 26, 2010, and began regular HD broadcasts on June 29, 2010. CITY-DT-3 in Ottawa began testing its digital feed on June 12, 2010, and regular digital broadcasts on June 18, 2010. CKAL-TV began testing its high definition signal on August 31, 2010. By August 31, 2011, all Citytv owned-and-operated stations had their primary transmitters and most retransmitters broadcasting exclusively in digital.

Citytv HD is available nationally via satellite and on digital cable. It is also available for free over-the-air using a regular TV antenna and a digital tuner (included in most new television sets) via the following stations and retransmitters:
== Video on demand and streaming ==
Video on demand access to Citytv programming has been available in various forms, such as through TV provider&#x27;s set-top boxes, or streaming media through the network&#x27;s website and mobile apps.

=== CitytvNow ===
In June 2018, Rogers announced it would launch an expanded service called Citytv Now (stylized Citytv NOW) for authenticated customers of partnered TV service providers, such as corporate sibling Rogers Cable. Citytv Now features fulls-season (and several past season) availability of shows airing on Citytv. For a time, the service also featured exclusive programs not airing on the broadcast network.

=== Citytv+ ===
On April 12, 2022, Rogers announced the launch of Citytv+ (pronounced Citytv Plus), an add-on channel for Amazon&#x27;s Prime Video. The service includes most of the programming available on Citytv and its siblings, including Omni Television, as well as recent and selected past programming aired by the Canadian FX and FXX networks. The service succeeds Shomi, a joint venture between Rogers Communications and the now-defunct Shaw Media prior to the latter&#x27;s merger with Corus Entertainment; and has been compared to the latter company&#x27;s StackTV service. Bravo was added following its relaunch under Rogers in September 2024. 

Live linear feeds of most Citytv stations, as well as CityNews 24/7, also became available to Amazon Prime subscribers at no additional cost through Prime Video. CityNews 24/7 is a headline news channel, similar to those offered online by Global News, and an indirect successor to the CityNews Channel (which operated from 2011 to 2013, following the separation of Citytv and CP24 in 2009).

On January 1, 2025, Rogers&#x27;s authenticated streaming platform was relaunched under the Citytv+ name, replacing the separate websites and mobile apps for Citytv and FX/FXX. Access to Rogers&#x27;s newly-launched Warner Bros. Discovery-branded channels was added to both this platform and the Prime Video add-on at this time.

== In popular culture ==
* In the 1983 film &quot;Videodrome&quot;, a television station in Toronto which broadcasts sensationalistic programming is named CIVIC-TV; the name is in reference to flagship station CITY-TV. Additionally, a business partner of the station president in the film is named Moses, a possible reference to Citytv cofounder Moses Znaimer.

<text>Image response (or more correctly, image response rejection ratio, or IMRR) is a measure of performance of a radio receiver that operates on the superheterodyne principle. 

In such a radio receiver, a local oscillator (LO) is used to heterodyne or &quot;beat&quot; against the incoming radio frequency (RF), generating sum and difference frequencies. One of these will be at the intermediate frequency (IF), and will be selected and amplified. The radio receiver is responsive to any signal at its designed IF frequency, including unwanted signals. For example, with a LO tuned to 110 MHz, there are two incoming signal frequencies that can generate a 10 MHz IF frequency. A signal broadcast at 100 MHz (the wanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create the sum frequency of 210 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency at the desired 10 MHz. However, a signal broadcast at 120 MHz (the unwanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create a sum frequency of 230 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency also at 10 MHz. The signal at 120 MHz is called the &quot;image&quot; of the wanted signal at 100 MHz. The ability of the receiver to reject this image gives the image rejection ratio (IMRR) of the system.

==Image rejection ratio==
The &quot;image rejection ratio&quot;, or &quot;image frequency rejection ratio&quot;, is the ratio of the intermediate-frequency (IF) signal level produced by the desired input frequency to that produced by the image frequency. The image rejection ratio is usually expressed in dB. When the image rejection ratio is measured, the input signal levels of the desired and image frequencies must be equal for the measurement to be meaningful. 

IMRR is measured in dB, giving the ratio of the wanted to the unwanted signal to yield the same output from the receiver. In a good design, ratios of &gt;60 dB are achievable. Note that IMRR is not a measurement of the performance of the IF stages or IF filtering (selectivity); the signal yields a perfectly valid IF frequency. Rather, it is the measure of the bandpass characteristics of the stages preceding the IF amplifier, which will consist of RF bandpass filters and usually an RF amplifier stage or two.

== Image rejection formulas ==
The &quot;Image Frequency Rejection Ratio&quot; (IRR) is characterized by its RF filter which can be determined on the basis of its relative response of a parallel tuned circuit.

<doc id="234062" wikidata="Q782524" url="?curid=234062" title="Automatic gain control">
<text>Automatic gain control (AGC) is a closed-loop feedback regulating circuit in an amplifier or chain of amplifiers, the purpose of which is to maintain a suitable signal amplitude at its output, despite variation of the signal amplitude at the input. The average or peak output signal level is used to dynamically adjust the gain of the amplifiers, enabling the circuit to work satisfactorily with a greater range of input signal levels. It is used in most radio receivers to equalize the average volume (loudness) of different radio stations due to differences in received signal strength, as well as variations in a single station&#x27;s radio signal due to fading. Without AGC the sound emitted from an AM radio receiver would vary to an extreme extent from a weak to a strong signal; the AGC effectively reduces the volume if the signal is strong and raises it when it is weaker. In a typical receiver the AGC feedback control signal is usually taken from the detector stage and applied to control the gain of the IF or RF amplifier stages.

==How it works==
The signal to be gain controlled (the detector output in a radio) goes to a diode &amp; capacitor, which produce a peak-following DC voltage. This is fed to the RF gain blocks to alter their bias, thus altering their gain. Traditionally all the gain-controlled stages came before the signal detection, but it is also possible to improve gain control by adding a gain-controlled stage after signal detection.

== Example use cases ==

=== AM radio receivers ===
In 1925, Harold Alden Wheeler invented automatic volume control (AVC) and obtained a patent. Karl Küpfmüller published an analysis of AGC systems in 1928. By the early 1930s most new commercial broadcast receivers included automatic volume control.

AGC is a departure from linearity in AM radio receivers. Without AGC, an AM radio would have a linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the sound waveform – the sound amplitude, which correlates with loudness, is proportional to the radio signal amplitude, because the information content of the signal is carried by the changes of amplitude of the carrier wave. If the circuit were not fairly linear, the modulated signal could not be recovered with reasonable fidelity. However, the strength of the signal received will vary widely, depending on the power and distance of the transmitter, and signal path attenuation. The AGC circuit keeps the receiver&#x27;s output level from fluctuating too much by detecting the overall strength of the signal and automatically adjusting the gain of the receiver to maintain the output level within an acceptable range. For a very weak signal, the AGC operates the receiver at maximum gain; as the signal increases, the AGC reduces the gain.

It is usually disadvantageous to reduce the gain of the RF front end of the receiver on weaker signals as low gain can worsen signal-to-noise ratio and blocking; therefore, many designs reduce gain only for stronger signals.

Since the AM detector diode produces a DC voltage proportional to signal strength, this voltage can be fed back to earlier stages of the receiver to reduce gain. A filter network is required so that the audio components of the signal don&#x27;t appreciably influence gain; this prevents &quot;modulation rise&quot; which increases the effective modulation depth of the signal, distorting the sound. Communications receivers may have more complex AVC systems, including extra amplification stages, separate AGC detector diodes, different time constants for broadcast and shortwave bands, and application of different levels of AGC voltage to different stages of the receiver to prevent distortion and cross-modulation. Design of the AVC system has a great effect on the usability of the receiver, tuning characteristics, audio fidelity, and behavior on overload and strong signals.

FM receivers, even though they incorporate limiter stages and detectors that are relatively insensitive to amplitude variations, still benefit from AGC to prevent overload on strong signals.

=== Radar ===

A related application of AGC is in radar systems, as a method of overcoming unwanted clutter echoes. This method relies on the fact that clutter returns far outnumber echoes from targets of interest. The receiver&#x27;s gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled, and affected the gain with greater granularity, in specific detection cells.
Many radar countermeasures use a radar&#x27;s AGC to fool it, by effectively &quot;drowning out&quot; the real signal with the spoof, as the AGC will regard the weaker, true signal as clutter relative to the strong spoof.

=== Audio/video ===

An audio tape generates a certain amount of noise. If the level of the signal on the tape is low, the noise is more prominent, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio is lower than it could be. To produce the least noisy recording, the recording level should be set as high as possible without being so high as to clip or distort the signal. In professional high-fidelity recording the level is set manually using a peak-reading meter. When high fidelity is not a requirement, a suitable recording level can be set by an AGC circuit which reduces the gain as the average signal level increases. This allows a usable recording to be made even for speech some distance from the microphone of an audio recorder. Similar considerations apply with VCRs.

A potential disadvantage of AGC is that when recording something like music with quiet and loud passages such as classical music, the AGC will tend to make the quiet passages louder and the loud passages quieter, compressing the dynamic range; the result can be a reduced musical quality if the signal is not re-expanded when playing, as in a companding system.

Some reel-to-reel tape recorders and cassette decks have AGC circuits. Those used for high-fidelity generally don&#x27;t.

Most VCR circuits use the amplitude of the vertical blanking pulse to operate the AGC. Video copy control schemes such as Macrovision exploit this, inserting spikes in the pulse which will be ignored by most television sets, but cause a VCR&#x27;s AGC to overcorrect and corrupt the recording.

===Vogad===

A voice-operated gain-adjusting device or volume-operated gain-adjusting device 
(vogad) is a type of AGC or compressor for microphone amplification. It is usually used in radio transmitters to prevent overmodulation and to reduce the dynamic range of the signal which allows increasing average transmitted power. In telephony, this device takes a wide variety of input amplitudes and produces a generally consistent output amplitude.

In its simplest form, a limiter can consist of a pair of back-to-back clamp diodes, which simply shunt excess signal amplitude to ground when the diode conduction threshold is exceeded. This approach will simply clip off the top of large signals, leading to high levels of distortion.

While clipping limiters are often used as a form of last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed vogad circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that undermodulation is also avoided. Undermodulation can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently vogad is particularly important for voice applications such as radiotelephones.

A good vogad circuit must have a very fast attack time, so that an initial loud voice signal does not cause a sudden burst of excessive modulation. In practice the attack time will be a few milliseconds, so a clipping limiter is still sometimes needed to catch the signal on these short peaks. A much longer decay time is usually employed, so that the gain does not get boosted too quickly during the normal pauses in natural speech. Too short a decay time leads to the phenomenon of &quot;breathing&quot; where the background noise level gets boosted at each gap in the speech. Vogad circuits are normally adjusted so that at low levels of input the signal is not fully boosted, but instead follow a linear boost curve. This works well with noise cancelling microphones.

=== Telephone recording===
Devices to record both sides of a telephone conversation must record both the relatively large signal from the local user and the much smaller signal from the remote user at comparable loudnesses. Some telephone recording devices incorporate automatic gain control to produce acceptable-quality recordings.

=== Biological===

As is the case with many concepts found in engineering, automatic gain control is also found in biological systems, especially sensory systems. For example, in the vertebrate visual system, calcium dynamics in the retinal photoreceptors adjust gain to suit light levels. Further on in the visual system, cells in V1 are thought to mutually inhibit, causing normalization of responses to contrast, a form of automatic gain control. Similarly, in the auditory system, the olivocochlear efferent neurons are part of a biomechanical gain control loop.

== Recovery times ==

As in all automatic control systems, the temporal dynamics of AGC operation may be important in many applications. Some AGC systems are slow to react to the need for gain changes, while others may react very rapidly. An example of an application in which fast AGC recovery time is required is in receivers used in Morse code communications where so-called full break-in or QSK operation is necessary to enable receiving stations to interrupt sending stations mid-character (e.g. between dot and dash signals).

<text>Copy-and-paste programming, sometimes referred to as just pasting, is the production of highly repetitive computer programming code, as produced by copy and paste operations. It is primarily a pejorative term; those who use the term are often implying a lack of programming competence and ability to create abstractions. It may also be the result of technology limitations (e.g., an insufficiently expressive development environment) as subroutines or libraries would normally be used instead. However, there are occasions when copy-and-paste programming is considered acceptable or necessary, such as for boilerplate, loop unrolling (when not supported automatically by the compiler), languages with limited metaprogramming facilities, or certain programming idioms, and it is supported by some source code editors in the form of snippets.

== Origins ==
Copy-and-paste programming is often done by inexperienced or student programmers, who find the act of writing code from scratch difficult or irritating and prefer to search for a pre-written solution or partial solution they can use as a basis for their own problem solving.
(See also Cargo cult programming)

Inexperienced programmers who copy code often do not fully understand the pre-written code they are taking. As such, the problem arises more from their inexperience and lack of courage in programming than from the act of copying and pasting, per se. The code often comes from disparate sources such as friends&#x27; or co-workers&#x27; code, Internet forums, open-source projects, code provided by the student&#x27;s professors/TAs, or computer science textbooks. The result risks being a disjointed clash of styles, and may have superfluous code that tackles problems for which new solutions are no longer required.

A further problem is that bugs can easily be introduced by assumptions and design choices made in the separate sources that no longer apply when placed in a new environment.

Such code may also, in effect, be unintentionally obfuscated, as the names of variables, classes, functions and the like are typically left unchanged, even though their purpose may be completely different in the new context.

Copy-and-paste programming may also be a result of poor understanding of features common in computer languages, such as loop structures, functions and subroutines.

== Duplication ==
=== Applying library code ===
Copying and pasting is also done by experienced programmers, who often have their own libraries of well tested, ready-to-use code snippets and generic algorithms that are easily adapted to specific tasks.

Being a form of code duplication, copy-and-paste programming has some intrinsic problems; such problems are exacerbated if the code doesn&#x27;t preserve any semantic link between the source text and the copies. In this case, if changes are needed, time is wasted hunting for all the duplicate locations. (This can be partially mitigated if the original code and/or the copy are properly commented; however, even then the problem remains of making the same edits multiple times. Also, because code maintenance often omits updating the comments, comments describing where to find remote pieces of code are notorious for going out-of-date.)

Adherents of object oriented methodologies further object to the &quot;code library&quot; use of copy and paste. Instead of making multiple mutated copies of a generic algorithm, an object oriented approach would abstract the algorithm into a reusable encapsulated class. The class is written flexibly, with full support of inheritance and overloading, so that all calling code can be interfaced to use this generic code directly, rather than mutating the original. As additional functionality is required, the library is extended (while retaining backward compatibility). This way, if the original algorithm has a bug to fix or can be improved, all software using it stands to benefit. Generic programming provides additional tools to create abstractions.

=== Branching code ===
Branching code is a normal part of large-team software development, allowing parallel development on both branches and hence, shorter development cycles. Classical branching has the following qualities:
* Is managed by a version control system that supports branching
* Branches are re-merged once parallel development is completed.

Copy and paste is a less formal alternative to classical branching, often used when it is foreseen that the branches will diverge more and more over time, as when a new product is being spun off from an existing product.

As a way of spinning-off a new product, copy-and-paste programming has some advantages. Because the new development initiative does not touch the code of the existing product:
* There is no need to regression test the existing product, saving on QA time associated with the new product launch, and reducing time to market.
* There is no risk of introduced bugs in the existing product, which might upset the installed user base.

The downsides are:
* If the new product does not diverge as much as anticipated from the existing product, two code bases might need to be supported (at twice the cost) where one would have done. This can lead to expensive refactoring and manual merging down the line.
* The duplicate code base doubles the time required to implement changes which may be desired across both products; this &quot;increases&quot; time-to-market for such changes, and may, in fact, wipe out any time gains achieved by branching the code in the first place.

Similar to above, the alternative to a copy-and-paste approach would be a modularized approach:
* Start by factoring out code to be shared by both products into libraries.
* Use those libraries (rather than a second copy of the code base) as the foundation for the development of the new product.
* If an additional third, fourth, or fifth version of the product is envisaged down the line, this approach is far stronger, because the ready-made code libraries dramatically shorten the development life cycle for any additional products after the second.

=== Repetitive tasks or variations of a task ===

One of the most harmful forms of copy-and-paste programming occurs in code that performs a repetitive task, or variations of the same basic task depending on some variable. Each instance is copied from above and pasted in again, with minor modifications. Harmful effects include:
* The copy and paste approach often leads to large methods (a bad code smell).
* Each instance creates a code duplicate, with all the problems discussed in prior sections, but with a much greater scope. Scores of duplications are common; hundreds are possible. Bug fixes, in particular, become very difficult and costly in such code.
* Such code also suffers from significant readability issues, due to the difficulty of discerning exactly what differs between each repetition. This has a direct impact on the risks and costs of revising the code.
* The procedural programming model strongly discourages the copy-and-paste approach to repetitive tasks. Under a procedural model, a preferred approach to repetitive tasks is to create a function or subroutine that performs a single pass through the task; this subroutine is then called by the parent routine, either repetitively or better yet, with some form of looping structure. Such code is termed &quot;well decomposed&quot;, and is recommended as being easier to read and more readily extensible.
* The general rule of thumb applicable to this case is &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot;.

== Deliberate design choice ==
Copy-and-paste programming is occasionally accepted as a valid programming technique. This is most commonly seen in boilerplate, such as class declarations or importing standard libraries, or in using an existing code template (with empty contents or stub functions) as a framework to fill in.

Use of programming idioms and design patterns are similar to copy-and-paste programming, as they also use formulaic code. In some cases, this can be expressed as a snippet, which can then be pasted in when such code is necessary, though it is often simply recalled from the programmer&#x27;s mind. In other cases idioms cannot be reduced to a code template. In most cases, however, even if an idiom can be reduced to code, it will be either long enough that it is abstracted into a function or short enough that it can be keyed in directly.

The Subtext programming language is a research project aimed at &quot;decriminalizing&quot; cut and paste. Using this language, cut and paste is the primary interaction model, and hence not considered an anti-pattern.

=== Example ===

A simple example is a for loop, which might be expressed as for (int i=0; i!=n; ++i) {}.

Sample code using such a for-loop might be:
void foo(int n) {
 for (int i=0; i!=n; ++i) {
 /* body */
}

The looping code could then have been generated by the following snippet (specifying types and variable names):
 for ($type $loop_var = 0; $loop_var != $stop; ++$loop_var) {
 /* body */

<doc id="234074" wikidata="Q715607" url="?curid=234074" title="Valmiki">
<text>Valmiki (; , ) was a legendary poet who is celebrated as the traditional author of the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, based on the attribution in the text itself. He is revered as &quot;Ādi Kavi&quot;, the first poet, author of &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the first epic poem.

The &quot;Ramayana&quot;, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 shlokas and seven cantos (kaṇḍas). The is composed of about 480,002 words, being a quarter of the length of the full text of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; or about four times the length of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; tells the story of a prince, Rama of the city of Ayodhya in the Kingdom of Kosala, whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana, the demon-king (Rakshasa) of Lanka. The scholars&#x27; estimates for the earliest stage of the text ranging from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE, and later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE, although original date of composition is unknown. As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.

British satirist Aubrey Menen says that Valmiki was &quot;recognized as a literary genius,&quot; and thus was considered, &quot;an outlaw,&quot; presumably because of his &quot;philosophic scepticism,&quot; as part of an &quot;Indian Enlightenment&quot; period. Valmiki is also quoted as being the contemporary of Rama. Menen claims Valmiki is &quot;the first author in all history to bring himself into his own composition.&quot;

== Early life ==
Valmiki was born as Agni Sharma to a Brahmin named Pracheta (also known as Sumali) of Bhrigu gotra. According to legend he once met the great sage Narada and had a discourse with him on his duties. Moved by Narada&#x27;s words, Agni Sharma began to perform penance and chanted the word &quot;Mara&quot; which meant &quot;die&quot;. As he performed his penance for several years, the word became &quot;Rama&quot;, a name of the god Vishnu. Huge anthills formed around Agni Sharma and this earned him the name of Valmiki. Agni Sharma, rechristened as Valmiki, learnt the scriptures from Narada and became the foremost of ascetics, revered by everyone.

There also exist some legends about Valmiki having been a thief before turning into a rishi. The Nagara Khanda of the Skanda Purana in its section on the creation of Mukhara Tirtha mentions that Valmiki was born a Brahmin, with the name of Lohajangha and was a devoted son to his parents. He had a beautiful wife and both of them were faithful to each other. Once, when there was no rain in the region of Anarta, for twelve long years, Lohajangha, for the sake of his hungry family, started robbing people that he found in the forest. In the course of this life he met the seven sages or the Saptarishi and tried to rob them as well. But the learned sages felt pity on him and showed him the folly of his ways. One of them, Pulaha gave him a Mantra to meditate upon and the Brahmin turned thief got so engrossed in its recitation that ant-hills came up around his body. When the sages returned and heard the sound of the mantra coming from the ant-hill, they blessed him and said, &quot;Since you achieved great Siddhi seated within a Valmīka (an anthill), you will become well-known in the world as Vālmīki.&quot;

== The first shloka ==

Valmiki was going to the river Ganges for his daily ablutions. A disciple by the name Bharadwaja was carrying his clothes. On the way, they came across the Tamasa Stream. Looking at the stream, Valmiki said to his disciple, &quot;Look, how clear is this water, like the mind of a good man! I will bathe here today.&quot; When he was looking for a suitable place to step into the stream, he saw a crane couple mating. Valmiki felt very pleased on seeing the happy birds. Suddenly, hit by an arrow, the male bird died on the spot. Filled by sorrow, its mate screamed in agony and died of shock. Valmiki&#x27;s heart melted at this pitiful sight. He looked around to find out who had shot the bird. He saw a hunter with a bow and arrows, nearby. Valmiki became very angry. His lips opened and he cried out,

Emerging spontaneously from Valmiki&#x27;s rage and grief, this couplet is considered the first shloka in Sanskrit literature. Valmiki later composed the entire &quot;Ramayana&quot; in the same meter. Valmiki is revered as &quot;Adi Kavi&quot; (the first poet); the &quot;Ramayana&quot; is revered as the first kavya (poem).

== Role in &quot;Ramayana&quot; ==

Valmiki played an important role in &quot;Uttarakāṇḍa,&quot; the last chapter of the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The &quot;Uttarakāṇḍa&quot; may not have been originally worked by Valmiki. The scholars Robert and Sally Goldman, for example, have pointed out: &quot;Much of the narrative focuses on figures other than Rāma and is narrated only indirectly by Vālmīki, being placed in the mouths of other figures such as Agastya.&quot; It is believed to have been taken up from &quot;Sesha Ramayana.&quot; According to the legend, Rama sent Sita to the forest. Sita finds refuge in Sage Valmiki&#x27;s ashram, where she gives birth to twin boys Lava and Kusha. Lava and Kusha were Valmiki&#x27;s first disciples, to whom he taught the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Bala Kanda of the epic also tells the story of Valmiki narrating the Ramayana to Lava and Kusha, who become his disciples.
== Role in &quot;Mahabharata&quot; ==
Valmiki was alive during the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and he was one of the many sages that visited Yudhisthira after the war. He told Yudhisthira the benefits of worshipping Shiva. Once upon a time, some ascetic possessors of the homa fire cursed Valmiki as guilty of brahminicide. The sin possessed him as soon as he was cursed. So he prayed to Shiva and he became cleansed of all his sins. Valmiki told Yudhisthira that he should also pray to Shiva like him. 

==Reincarnation==
&quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; says that Valmiki was born in the Treta Yuga as a form of Brahma who composed &quot;Ramayana&quot; and that people desirous of earning knowledge should worship Valmiki. He was later reincarnated as Tulsidas, who composed the &quot;Ramcharitamanas&quot;, which was the Awadhi-Hindi version of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

== Pragat Diwas ==


The full moon day of Hindu month of Ashvin is celebrated as the birth anniversary of the poet. The day is also known as Pargat Diwas or Valmiki Jayanti, and is a major festival of the followers of the Balmiki religious sect of Hinduism.

==Temples==
The Balmiki sect of Hinduism reveres Valmiki, where he is also known as Lal Beg or Bala Shah, as a patron saint, with a plethora of mandirs (temples) dedicated to him.

In the Siddhar tradition of Tamil Nadu, Valmiki is known as Vanmeegar and is revered as one of the 18 esteemed Siddhars of yore. The Ettukudi Murugan Temple, Nagapattinam is home to his Jeeva Samadhi.

An area in Chennai, Tiruvanmiyur is believed to derive its name from Sage Valmiki, Thiru-Valmiki-Oor. There is a temple for Valmiki located in this place, which is believed to be 1300 years old.

Shree Valmiki Mata Maha Samsthana is a temple dedicated to Valmiki in Rajanahalli, Karnataka.

Valmiki Ashram, a site considered to be the original ashram of Valmiki, is located in Chitwan district of Nepal. The site is near the Triveni Dham pilgrimage site.

== In popular culture ==
Several Indian films have been made on the life of the poet, beginning with G. V. Sane&#x27;s &quot;Valmiki&quot; (1921); it was followed by Surendra Narayan Roy&#x27;s &quot;Ratnakar&quot; (1921), Ellis Dungan&#x27;s &quot;Valmiki&quot; (1946), Bhalji Pendharkar&#x27;s &quot;Valmiki&quot; (1946), Sundarrao Nadkarni&#x27;s &quot;Valmiki&quot; (1946), C.S.R. Rao&#x27;s &quot;Valmiki&quot; (starring Rajkumar 1963) and &quot;Valmiki&quot; (starring N. T. Rama Rao; 1963), and Arvind Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Sant Valmiki&quot; (1991).

Bhatt&#x27;s film which starred Suresh Oberoi in the title role remains unreleased after a case was filed against Oberoi for remarks deemed offensive by members of the Valmiki caste in India.

<text>Narada (, ), or Narada Muni, is a sage-divinity, famous in Hindu traditions as a travelling musician and storyteller, who carries news and enlightening wisdom. He is one of the mind-created children of Brahma, the creator god. He appears in a number of Hindu texts, notably the Mahabharata, telling Yudhishthira the story of Prahalada, and he also appears in the Ramayana and the Puranas. A common theme in Vaishnavism is the accompaniment of a number of deities such as Narada to offer aid to Vishnu upon his descent to earth to combat the forces of evil, or to enjoy a close view of epochal events. He is also referred to as &quot;Rishiraja&quot;, meaning the king of all sages. He was gifted with the boon of knowledge regarding the past, present, and the future.

== Hinduism ==
In Indian texts, Narada travels to distant worlds and realms (Sanskrit: &quot;lokas&quot;). He is depicted carrying a khartal (musical instrument) and the veena, and is generally regarded as one of the great masters of the ancient musical instrument. This instrument is also known by the name &quot;mahathi&quot;, and he uses it to accompany his singing of hymns, prayers, and mantras. In the Vaishnava tradition, he is presented as a sage with devotion to the preserver deity Vishnu. Narada is described as both wise and mischievous in some humorous tales. He is notorious for being meddlesome, provoking conflict between both the gods and the demons for the sake of their wisdom as well as for his own entertainment. Vaishnavas depict him as a pure, elevated soul who glorifies Vishnu through his devotional songs, singing the names &quot;Hari&quot; and &quot;Narayana&quot;, and therein demonstrating bhakti yoga. The Narada Bhakti Sutra is attributed to him. He would usually make his presence known by vocally chanting &quot;Narayana, Narayana&quot; before appearing in a scene.

Other texts named after Narada include the Narada Purana and the Nāradasmṛti (pre 6th century CE text), the latter called the &quot;juridical text par excellence&quot; and representing the only Dharmaśāstra text that deals solely with juridical matters while ignoring those of righteous conduct and penance.

The name &quot;Narada,&quot; referring to many different persons, appears in many Hindu legends. It appears as an earlier birth of Sariputta in the Jataka tales of Buddhism, as well as among names of medieval Buddhist scholars, and in Jainism.

=== Mahabharata ===
In the Mahabharata, Narada is portrayed as being conversant with the Vedas and the Upanishads and as acquainted with history and Puranas. He has a mastery of the six Angas (limbs of knowledge): pronunciation, grammar, prosody, terms, religious rites and astronomy. All celestial beings worship him for his knowledge - he is supposed to be well-versed in all that occurred in ancient kalpas (time cycles) and is termed to be conversant with Nyaya (justice) and the truth of moral science. He is a perfect master in reconciliatory texts and good at differentiating in applying general principles to particular cases. He can swiftly interpret contraries by references to differences in situations. He is eloquent, resolute, intelligent and a possessor of powerful memory. He knows the science of morals, politics; he is skilled in drawing inferences from evidence and very proficient in distinguishing inferior things from superior ones. He is competent in judging the correctness and incorrectness of complex syllogistic statements consisting of 5 proponents. He is capable of arriving at definite conclusions about religion, wealth, pleasure and salvation. He possesses knowledge of this whole universe and everything surrounding it. He is capable of successfully answering Brihaspati himself while arguing. He is a master of the Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy, conversant with sciences of war and treaties and proficient in drawing conclusions by judging things, not within direct knowledge. He knows about the six sciences of a treaty, war, military campaigns, maintenance of posts against the enemy and strategies of ambushes and reserves. He is a thorough master of every branch of learning. He is fond of war and music and incapable of being repulsed by any science or any course of action.

=== Puranas ===

The Bhagavata Purana describes the story of Narada&#x27;s spiritual enlightenment: He was the primary source of information among the devas, and is believed to be the first cosmic messenger upon the earth. In his previous birth, Narada was a gandharva (a musical being) who had been cursed to be born on earth for singing glories to the &quot;demigods&quot; instead of Vishnu. He was born as the son of a maidservant of some particularly saintly priests. The priests, being pleased with both his and his mother&#x27;s service, blessed him by allowing him to eat some of their food (prasada), previously offered to their deity, Vishnu.

Gradually, he received further blessings from these sages and heard them discussing many spiritual topics. During the four months of rainy seasons when the sages did not leave their hermitage and stayed together, they used to recite various deeds of Vishnu, and from there Narada used to hear these stories. After his mother died, he decided to roam the forest in search of enlightenment in understanding the &#x27;Supreme Absolute Truth&#x27;.

Reaching a tranquil forest location, after quenching his thirst from a nearby stream, he sat under a tree in meditation (yoga), concentrating on the paramatma form of Vishnu within his heart as he had been taught by the priests he had served. After some time Narada experienced a vision wherein Narayana (Vishnu) appeared before him, smiling, and spoke: &quot;that despite having the blessing of seeing Him at that very moment, Narada would not be able to see His (Vishnu&#x27;s) divine form again until he died&quot;. Narayana further explained that the reason he had been given a chance to see his form was that his beauty and love would be a source of inspiration and would fuel his dormant desire to be with Vishnu again. After instructing Narada in this manner, Vishnu then disappeared from his sight. The boy awoke from his meditation, both thrilled and disappointed.

For the rest of his life, Narada focused on his devotion, meditation upon and worship to Vishnu. After his death, Vishnu then blessed him with the spiritual form of &quot;Narada&quot; as he eventually became known. In many Hindu scriptures, Narada is considered a shaktyavesha-avatara or partial-manifestation (avatar) of God, empowered to perform miraculous tasks on Vishnu&#x27;s behalf.

The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; describes a legend in which Narada&#x27;s penance alarmed Indra, who sent Kamadeva to disturb his austerities. Due to the fact that the sage was meditating in the Himalayas and under Shiva&#x27;s favour, he was protected by the deity&#x27;s &quot;maya&quot; (illusory power) and hence remained undisturbed. When Narada learnt of this, still confounded by Shiva&#x27;s &quot;maya&quot;, he falsely attributed this event to his own mental prowess and grew proud of his achievement. Heeding Shiva&#x27;s suggestion to break the pride of the sage, Vishnu praised the qualities of Narada, but also warned him to not be delusional. The sage turned a deaf ear to this warning. Vishnu extended Shiva&#x27;s &quot;maya&quot; to create a great and prosperous city in Narada&#x27;s path. The king of the city, Shilanidhi, introduced his beautiful daughter, Shrimati--also known as Vishwamohini--to the sage, who grew desirous of marrying her. Shrimati was none other than an incarnation of Lakshmi. Narada travelled to Vaikuntha, requesting Vishnu to grant him the deity&#x27;s form so that Shrimati would choose the sage as her husband during her svayamvara ceremony. Vishnu promised to grant Narada what would be beneficial for him, granting him his own form, but the face of a monkey. Believing his wish had been granted, Narada grew assured that Shrimati would choose him, but soon realised what had transpired. Vishnu attended the ceremony in the form of a king, and Shrimati chose him as her husband instead. Enraged, Narada cursed Vishnu to also be separated from the woman he loved and would only be saved by one with a monkey-face. When his &quot;maya&quot; was dispelled, Narada begged forgiveness from Vishnu. The deity instructed the sage to visit the abodes and praise the qualities of Shiva, and the latter journeyed to the deity&#x27;s abode in Kashi.

In the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; and some other texts, Narada enquired Vishnu about the nature and greatness of &quot;maya&quot;. The deity guided him towards a lake, in which the sage took a bath. The sage was transformed into a woman. She married a king named Taladhvaja and was a mother to his many sons. After some time, Vishnu dispelled the illusion and restored Narada to his true male form. Narada came to understand the concept better, but concluded it was still mysterious to him.

=== Worship ===
Narada temples are few, most prominent being Sri Narada Muni Temple at Chigateri, Karnataka.

Some adherents believe that it was Narada who was reborn as Purandara Dasa as a Haridasa (servant of Vishnu). He emphasised his works on Vithala, another form of Vishnu and the presiding deity of the temple in Pandharpur.

==Jainism==

In Jainism, there are a total of 9 Naradas in every cycle of Jain Cosmology; current cycle&#x27;s Naradas were Bhima, Mahabhima, Rudra, Maharudra, Kala, Mahakala, Durmukha, Narakamukha and Adhomukha.

<text>Lanka (; ) is the name given in Hindu epics to the island fortress capital of the legendary Rakshasa king Ravana in the epics of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the Trikuta Mountains. The ancient city of Lankapura is said to have been burnt down by Hanuman. After its king, Ravana was killed by Rama with the help of Ravana&#x27;s brother Vibhishana, the latter was crowned king of Lankapura. His descendants were said to still rule the kingdom during the period of the Pandavas. According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Pandava Sahadeva visited this kingdom during his southern military campaign for the rajasuya of Yudhishthira. The palaces of Ravana were said to be guarded by four-tusked elephants.

== Ramayana ==

===Rulers of Lanka===
According to both the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Lanka was originally ruled by a rakshasa named Sumali. Kubera seized control of Lanka and established the Yaksha kingdom and his capital was guarded by rakshasas. His half-brother Ravana, son of the sage Vishrava and Sumali&#x27;s daughter Kaikesi, fought with Kubera and took Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as king of the Rakshasa kingdom. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous relief in the 12th-century Khmer temple of Angkor Wat.

After Ravana&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his brother, Vibhishana.

===Location of Ravana&#x27;s &quot;Lanka&quot; according to Ramayana===
The Lanka referred to in the still-extant Hindu Texts and the Ramayana (referred to as Ravana&#x27;s Lanka), is considered to be a large island-country, situated in the Indian Ocean. Studies refer that the Palace of Ravana was located in Sigiriya the palace built by the Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura as the legend describes the capital of the kingdom was located between plateaus and forests. Some scholars asserted that it must have been Sri Lanka because it is so stated in the 5th century Sri Lankan text &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;. However, the Ramayana clearly states that Ravana&#x27;s Lanka was situated 100 Yojanas (roughly 1213 km or 753.72 miles) away from mainland India.

Some scholars have interpreted the content of these texts to determine that Lanka was located at the point where the Prime-Meridian of India passes the Equator. This island would therefore lie more than southwest of present-day country of Sri Lanka. The most original of all the existing versions of Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana also suggest the location of Ravana&#x27;s Lanka to be in the western Indian Ocean. It indicates that Lanka was in the midst of a series of large island-nations, submerged mountains, and sunken plateaus in the western part of the Indian Ocean.

There has been a lot of speculation by several scholars since the 19th century that Ravana&#x27;s Lanka might have been in the Indian Ocean around where the Maldives once stood as a high mountain, before getting submerged in the Indian Ocean. This speculation is supported by the presence of Minicoy Island in the vicinity between India and Maldives, the ancient name being Minikaa, or Mainaka (the mountain met by Hanuman on his way to Lanka), which in the ancient language of the place means &quot;cannibal&quot;, probably a reference to Sursa, as cannibals from the Nicobars were frequently found here, along with snakes. Sumatra and Madagascar has also been suggested as a possibility.

===Description===

Ravana&#x27;s Lanka, and its capital Lankapuri, are described in a manner that seems superhuman even by modern-day standards. Ravana&#x27;s central palace complex (main citadel) was a massive collection of several edifices that reached over one yojana () in height, one yojana in length, and half a yojana in breadth. The island had a large mountain range known as the Trikuta Mountain (Trikonamalai-In Tamil/Trinkomale-English,where Ravan built Temple for shiva), atop which was situated Ravana&#x27;s capital of Lanka, at the center of which in turn stood his citadel. 

==References to Lanka in the Mahabharata==
Many of the references to Lanka in the Mahabharata are found in sage Markandeya&#x27;s narration of the story of Rama and Sita to the king Yudhishthira, which narration amounts to a truncated version of the Ramayana. The references in the following summary are to the Mahabharata and adhere to the following form: (book:section). Markandeya&#x27;s narration of the story begins at Book III (Varna Parva), Section 271 of the Mahabharata.

===Sahadeva&#x27;s expedition to South===

Sahadeva, the son of Pandu, conquered the town of Sanjayanti and the country of the Pashandas and the Karanatakas utilizing his messengers alone and made all of them pay tributes to him. The hero brought under his subjection and exacted tributes from the Paundrayas (Pandyas?) and the Dravidas along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas, the Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas, and also the delightful city of Atavi and that of the Yavanas. And, He has arrived at the seashore, then dispatched with great assurance messengers unto the illustrious Vibhishana, the grandson of Pulastya and the ruler of Lanka (2:30).

===Presence of the King of Lanka in Yudhishthira&#x27;s Rajasuya===
&quot;Lanka king is listed as present in the conclave of kings present in Pandava king Yudhishthira&#x27;s Rajasuya sacrifice.&quot;

The Vangas and Angas and Paundras and Odras and Cholas and Dravidas and Cheras and Pandyas and Mushika and Andhakas, and the chiefs of many islands and countries on the seaboard as also of frontier states, including the rulers of the Sinhalas, the barbarous mlecchas, the natives of Lanka, and all the kings of the West by hundreds, and all the chiefs of the seacoast, and the kings of the Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various tribes of the Kiratas and Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and Chinas and Tukharas and the Sindhavas and the Jagudas and the Ramathas and the Mundas and the inhabitants of the kingdom of women and the Tanganas and the Kekayas and the Malavas and the inhabitants of Kasmira... (3:51).

<doc id="234079" wikidata="Q1268980" url="?curid=234079" title="Dynamic programming language">
<text>A dynamic programming language is a type of programming language that allows various operations to be determined and executed at runtime. This is different from the compilation phase. Key decisions about variables, method calls, or data types are made when the program is running, unlike in static languages, where the structure and types are fixed during compilation. Dynamic languages provide flexibility. This allows developers to write more adaptable and concise code.

For instance, in a dynamic language, a variable can start as an integer. It can later be reassigned to hold a string without explicit type declarations. This feature of dynamic typing enables more fluid and less restrictive coding. Developers can focus on the logic and functionality rather than the constraints of the language.

==Implementation==
===Eval===
Some dynamic languages offer an &quot;eval&quot; function. This function takes a string or abstract syntax tree containing code in the language and executes it. If this code stands for an expression, the resulting value is returned. Erik Meijer and Peter Drayton distinguish the runtime code generation offered by eval from the dynamic loading offered by shared libraries and warn that in many cases eval is used merely to implement higher-order functions (by passing functions as strings) or deserialization.

===Object runtime alteration===
A type or object system can typically be modified during runtime in a dynamic language. This can mean generating new objects from a runtime definition or based on mixins of existing types or objects. This can also refer to changing the inheritance or type tree, and thus altering the way that existing types behave (especially with respect to the invocation of methods).

===Type inference===
As a lot of dynamic languages come with a dynamic type system, runtime inference of types based on values for internal interpretation marks a common task. As value types may change throughout interpretation, it is regularly used upon performing atomic operations.

===Variable memory allocation===
Static programming languages (possibly indirectly) require developers to define the size of utilized memory before compilation (unless working around with pointer logic). Consistent with object runtime alteration, dynamic languages implicitly need to (re-)allocate memory based on program individual operations.

===Reflection===
Reflection is common in many dynamic languages, and typically involves analysis of the types and metadata of generic or polymorphic data. It can, however, also include full evaluation and modification of a program&#x27;s code as data, such as the features that Lisp provides in analyzing S-expressions.

===Macros===
A limited number of dynamic programming languages provide features which combine code introspection (the ability to examine classes, functions, and keywords to know what they are, what they do and what they know) and eval in a feature called macros. Most programmers today who are aware of the term &quot;macro&quot; have encountered them in C or C++, where they are a static feature which is built in a small subset of the language, and are capable only of string substitutions on the text of the program. In dynamic languages, however, they provide access to the inner workings of the compiler, &quot;and&quot; full access to the interpreter, virtual machine, or runtime, allowing the definition of language-like constructs which can optimize code or modify the syntax or grammar of the language.

Assembly, C, C++, early Java, and Fortran do not generally fit into this category.

==Example code==
The following examples show dynamic features using the language Common Lisp and its Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).

===Computation of code at runtime and late binding===
The example shows how a function can be modified at runtime from computed source code
; the source code is stored as data in a variable
CL-USER &gt; (defparameter *best-guess-formula* &#x27;(lambda (x) (* x x 2.5)))
*BEST-GUESS-FORMULA*

; a function is created from the code and compiled at runtime, the function is available under the name best-guess
CL-USER &gt; (compile &#x27;best-guess *best-guess-formula*)
#&lt;Function 15 40600152F4&gt;

; the function can be called
CL-USER &gt; (best-guess 10.3)
265.225

; the source code might be improved at runtime
CL-USER &gt; (setf *best-guess-formula* `(lambda (x) ,(list &#x27;sqrt (third *best-guess-formula*))))
(LAMBDA (X) (SQRT (* X X 2.5)))

; a new version of the function is being compiled
CL-USER &gt; (compile &#x27;best-guess *best-guess-formula*)
#&lt;Function 16 406000085C&gt;

; the next call will call the new function, a feature of late binding
CL-USER &gt; (best-guess 10.3)
16.28573
===Object runtime alteration===
This example shows how an existing instance can be changed to include a new slot when its class changes and that an existing method can be replaced with a new version.
; a person class. The person has a name.
CL-USER &gt; (defclass person () ((name :initarg :name)))
#&lt;STANDARD-CLASS PERSON 4020081FB3&gt;

; a custom printing method for the objects of class person
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object ((p person) stream)
 (print-unreadable-object (p stream :type t)
 (format stream &quot;~a&quot; (slot-value p &#x27;name))))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT NIL (PERSON T) 4020066E5B&gt;

; one example person instance
CL-USER &gt; (setf *person-1* (make-instance &#x27;person :name &quot;Eva Luator&quot;))
#&lt;PERSON Eva Luator&gt;

; the class person gets a second slot. It then has the slots name and age.
CL-USER &gt; (defclass person () ((name :initarg :name) (age :initarg :age :initform :unknown)))
#&lt;STANDARD-CLASS PERSON 4220333E23&gt;

; updating the method to print the object
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object ((p person) stream)
 (print-unreadable-object (p stream :type t)
 (format stream &quot;~a age: ~&quot; (slot-value p &#x27;name) (slot-value p &#x27;age))))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT NIL (PERSON T) 402022ADE3&gt;

; the existing object has now changed, it has an additional slot and a new print method
CL-USER &gt; *person-1*
#&lt;PERSON Eva Luator age: UNKNOWN&gt;

; we can set the new age slot of instance
CL-USER &gt; (setf (slot-value *person-1* &#x27;age) 25)
25

; the object has been updated
CL-USER &gt; *person-1*
#&lt;PERSON Eva Luator age: 25&gt;

let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = &quot;bar&quot;; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean

===Assembling of code at runtime based on the class of instances===
In the next example, the class person gets a new superclass. The print method gets redefined such that it assembles several methods into the effective method. The effective method gets assembled based on the class of the argument and the at runtime available and applicable methods.
; the class person
CL-USER &gt; (defclass person () ((name :initarg :name)))
#&lt;STANDARD-CLASS PERSON 4220333E23&gt;

; a person just prints its name
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object ((p person) stream)
 (print-unreadable-object (p stream :type t)
 (format stream &quot;~a&quot; (slot-value p &#x27;name))))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT NIL (PERSON T) 40200605AB&gt;

; a person instance
CL-USER &gt; (defparameter *person-1* (make-instance &#x27;person :name &quot;Eva Luator&quot;))
*PERSON-1*

; displaying a person instance
CL-USER &gt; *person-1*
#&lt;PERSON Eva Luator&gt;

; now redefining the print method to be extensible
; the around method creates the context for the print method and it calls the next method
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object :around ((p person) stream)
 (print-unreadable-object (p stream :type t)
 (call-next-method)))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT (:AROUND) (PERSON T) 4020263743&gt;

; the primary method prints the name
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object ((p person) stream)
 (format stream &quot;~a&quot; (slot-value p &#x27;name)))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT NIL (PERSON T) 40202646BB&gt;

; a new class id-mixin provides an id
CL-USER &gt; (defclass id-mixin () ((id :initarg :id)))
#&lt;STANDARD-CLASS ID-MIXIN 422034A7AB&gt;

; the print method just prints the value of the id slot
CL-USER &gt; (defmethod print-object :after ((object id-mixin) stream)
 (format stream &quot; ID: ~a&quot; (slot-value object &#x27;id)))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD PRINT-OBJECT (:AFTER) (ID-MIXIN T) 4020278E33&gt;

; now we redefine the class person to include the mixin id-mixin
CL-USER 241 &gt; (defclass person (id-mixin) ((name :initarg :name)))
#&lt;STANDARD-CLASS PERSON 4220333E23&gt;

; the existing instance *person-1* now has a new slot and we set it to 42
CL-USER 242 &gt; (setf (slot-value *person-1* &#x27;id) 42)
42

; displaying the object again. The print-object function now has an effective method, which calls three methods: an around method, the primary method and the after method.
CL-USER 243 &gt; *person-1*
#&lt;PERSON Eva Luator ID: 42&gt;

<text>Upper Egypt ( &quot;&quot;, shortened to , , ; ) is the southern portion of Egypt and is composed of the Nile River valley south of the delta and the 30th parallel N. It thus consists of the entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser (formed by the Aswan High Dam).

==Name==
In ancient Egypt, Upper Egypt was known as &quot;tꜣ šmꜣw&quot;, literally &quot;the Land of Reeds&quot; or &quot;the Sedgeland&quot;, named for the sedges that grow there.

In Arabic, the region is called Sa&#x27;id or Sahid, from meaning &quot;uplands&quot;, from the root meaning to go up, ascend, or rise. Inhabitants of Upper Egypt are known as Sa&#x27;idis and they generally speak Sa&#x27;idi Egyptian Arabic.

==Geography==

Upper Egypt is between the Cataracts of the Nile beyond modern-day Aswan, downriver (northward) to the area of El-Ayait, which places modern-day Cairo in Lower Egypt. The northern (downriver) part of Upper Egypt, between Sohag and El-Ayait, is also known as Middle Egypt.

==History==

It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during the Naqada III period (c. 3200–3000 BC), and its subsequent unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period. Upper and Lower Egypt became intertwined in the symbolism of pharaonic sovereignty such as the Pschent double crown. Upper Egypt remained as a historical region even after the classical period.

===Predynastic Egypt===
The main city of prehistoric Upper Egypt was Nekhen. The patron deity was the goddess Nekhbet, depicted as a vulture.

By approximately 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals. Shortly thereafter, Egypt began to grow and increase in complexity. A new and distinctive pottery appeared, related to the Levantine ceramics, and copper implements and ornaments became common. Mesopotamian building techniques became popular, using sun-dried adobe bricks in arches and decorative recessed walls.

In Upper Egypt, the predynastic Badari culture was followed by the Naqada culture (Amratian), being closely related to the Lower Nubian; other northeast African populations, coastal communities from the Maghreb, some tropical African groups, and possibly inhabitants of the Middle East.

According to bioarchaeologist Nancy Lovell, the morphology of ancient Egyptian skeletons gives strong evidence that: &quot;In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas&quot;, but exhibited local variation in an African context. S. O. Y. Keita, a biological anthropologist also reviewed studies on the biological affinities of the Ancient Egyptian population and characterised the skeletal morphologies of predynastic southern Egyptians as a &quot;Saharo-tropical African variant&quot;. Keita also added that it is important to emphasize that whilst Egyptian society became more socially complex and biologically varied, the &quot;ethnicity of the Niloto-Saharo-Sudanese origins did not change. The cultural morays, ritual formulae, and symbols used in writing, as far as can be ascertained, remained true to their southern origins.&quot;

The proto-dynastic kings emerged from the Naqada region. Excavations at Hierakonpolis (Upper Egypt) found archaeological evidence of ritual masks similar to those used further south of Egypt, and obsidian linked to Ethiopian quarry sites. Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns, Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and A-Group Lower Nubia. He further elaborated that &quot;Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and A-Group Lower Nubia, and not in the Delta cultures, where the direct Western Asian contact was made, further vitiates the Mesopotamian-influence argument&quot;.

Similarly, Christopher Ehret, historian and linguist, stated that the cultural practice of sacral chiefship and kingship which emerged in Upper Egypt in the fourth millennium had originated centuries earlier in Nubia and the Middle Nile south of Egypt. He based this judgement on supporting, archaeological and comparative ethnographic evidence.

These cultural advances paralleled the political unification of towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, while the same occurred in the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt. This led to warfare between the two new kingdoms. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the delta and became sole ruler of the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt, a sovereignty which endured throughout Dynastic Egypt.

===Dynastic Egypt===
In royal symbolism, Upper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown &quot;Hedjet&quot;, the flowering lotus, and the sedge. Its patron deity, Nekhbet, was depicted by the vulture. After unification, the patron deities of Upper and Lower Egypt were represented together as the &quot;Two Ladies&quot;, to protect all of the ancient Egyptians, just as the two crowns were combined into a single pharaonic diadem.

Several dynasties of southern or Upper Egyptian origin, which included the 11th, 12th, 17th, 18th and 25th dynasties, reunified and reinvigorated pharaonic Egypt after periods of fragmentation.

For most of Egypt&#x27;s ancient history, Thebes was the administrative center of Upper Egypt. After its devastation by the Assyrians, the importance of Egypt declined. Under the dynasty of the Ptolemies, Ptolemais Hermiou took over the role of the capital city of Upper Egypt.

Shomarka Keita reported that a 2005 study on mummified remains found that &quot;some Theban nobles had a histology which indicated notably dark skin&quot;.

===Medieval Egypt===
In the eleventh century, large numbers of pastoralists, known as Hilalians, fled Upper Egypt and moved westward into Libya and as far as Tunis. It is believed that degraded grazing conditions in Upper Egypt, associated with the beginning of the Medieval Warm Period, were the root cause of the migration.

===20th-century Egypt===
In the twentieth-century Egypt, the title Prince of the Sa&#x27;id (meaning &quot;Prince of Upper Egypt&quot;) was used by the heir apparent to the Egyptian throne.

Although the Kingdom of Egypt was abolished after the Egyptian revolution of 1952, the title continues to be used by Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa&#x27;id.

<text>Lower Egypt ( &quot;&quot;; ) is the northernmost region of Egypt, which consists of the fertile Nile Delta between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, from El Aiyat, south of modern-day Cairo, and Dahshur. Historically, the Nile River split into seven branches of the delta in Lower Egypt. 
Lower Egypt was divided into nomes and began to advance as a civilization after 3600 BC. Today, it contains two major channels that flow through the delta of the Nile River – Mahmoudiyah Canal (ancient Agathos Daimon) and Muways Canal (, &quot;waterway of Moses&quot;).

== Name ==
In Ancient Egyptian, Lower Egypt was known as &quot;mḥw&quot; which means &quot;north&quot;. Later on, during Antiquity and the Middle Ages, Greeks and Romans called it &quot;Κάτω Αἴγυπτος&quot; or &quot;Aegyptus Inferior&quot; both meaning &quot;Lower Egypt&quot;, but Copts carried on using the old name related to the north – &quot;Tsakhet&quot; () or &quot;Psanemhit&quot; () meaning the &quot;Northern part&quot;. It was further divided into a number of regions or nomes () – &quot;Niphaiat&quot; (, ) in the west, &quot;Tiarabia&quot; () in the east, &quot;Nimeshshoti&quot; () in the north-east and &quot;Bashmur&quot; (Bashmuric ) in the north. Champollion adds another region in the middle of the Delta which he calls &quot;Petmour&quot; () based on mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium, but it is unclear if this is a separate region or just a Greek rendering of the name Bashmur.

After the Muslim conquest, the middle part of the Delta was called al-Rif () which means &quot;countryside, rural area&quot; and which is derived from Ancient Egyptian 
r:Z1-pr*Z1:niwt
&quot;r-pr&quot;, &quot;temple&quot;, because the rural areas were administered by them. The eastern part roughly comprising the ancient Tiarabia was called al-Hawf () meaning &quot;edge, fringe&quot;.

==Geography==

Today, there are two principal channels that the Nile takes through the river delta: one in the west at Rashid and one in the east at Damietta.

The delta region is well watered, crisscrossed by channels and canals.

Owing primarily to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the climate in Lower Egypt is milder than that of Upper Egypt, the southern portion of the country. Temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is more abundant in Lower Egypt.

==History==

It was divided into twenty districts called nomes, the first of which was at el-Lisht. Because Lower Egypt was mostly undeveloped scrubland, filled with all types of plant life such as grasses and herbs, the organization of the &quot;nomes&quot; underwent several changes.

The capital of Lower Egypt was Memphis. Its patron goddess was the goddess Wadjet, depicted as a cobra. Lower Egypt was represented by the Red Crown &quot;Deshret&quot;, and its symbols were the papyrus and the bee. After unification, the patron deities of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were represented together as the &quot;Two Ladies&quot;, Wadjet and Nekhbet (depicted as a vulture), to protect all of the ancient Egyptians.

By approximately 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile River had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals. Shortly after 3600 BC, Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization. A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant, appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time. The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks, and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time.

Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time, the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process. Warfare between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt occurred often. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies in the Delta and merged the kingdoms of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt under his single rule.

==List of kings of the Predynastic Period of Lower Egypt==

The Palermo stone, a royal annal written in the mid Fifth Dynasty (c. 2490 BC – c. 2350 BC) records a number of kings reigning over Lower Egypt before Narmer. These are completely unattested outside these inscriptions:
In contrast, the following kings are attested through archeological finds from Sinai and Lower Egypt: Double Falcon, Crocodile.

<text>A radiotelephone (or radiophone), abbreviated RT, is a radio communication system for conducting a conversation; radiotelephony means telephony by radio. It is in contrast to &quot;radiotelegraphy&quot;, which is radio transmission of telegrams (messages), or &quot;television&quot;, transmission of moving pictures and sound. The term is related to radio broadcasting, which transmit audio one way to listeners. Radiotelephony refers specifically to two-way radio systems for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication between separated users, such as CB radio or marine radio. In spite of the name, radiotelephony systems are not necessarily connected to or have anything to do with the telephone network, and in some radio services, including GMRS, interconnection is prohibited.

==Design==

===Mode of emission===

The word &quot;phone&quot; has a long precedent beginning with early US wired voice systems. The term means &quot;voice&quot; as opposed to telegraph or Morse code. This would include systems fitting into the category of two-way radio or one-way voice broadcasts such as coastal maritime weather. The term is still popular in the amateur radio community and in US Federal Communications Commission regulations.

===Modes of operation===

A standard landline telephone allows both users to talk and listen simultaneously; effectively there are two open communication channels between the two end-to-end users of the system. In a radiotelephone system, this form of working, known as full-duplex, requires a radio system to simultaneously transmit and receive on two separate frequencies, which both wastes bandwidth and presents some technical challenges. It is, however, the most comfortable method of voice communication for users, and it is currently used in cell phones and was used in the former IMTS.

The most common method of working for radiotelephones is half-duplex, operation, which allows one person to talk and the other to listen alternately. If a single frequency is used, both parties take turns to transmit on it, known as simplex. Dual-frequency working or duplex splits the communication into two separate frequencies, but only one is used to transmit at a time with the other frequency dedicated to receiving.

The user presses a special switch on the transmitter when they wish to talk—this is called the &quot;press-to-talk&quot; switch or PTT. It is usually fitted on the side of the microphone or other obvious position. Users may use a procedural code-word such as &quot;over&quot; to signal that they have finished transmitting.

==Features==

Radiotelephones may operate at any frequency where they are licensed to do so, though typically they are used in the various bands between 60 and 900 MHz (25 and 960 MHz in the United States). They may use simple modulation schemes such as AM or FM, or more complex techniques such as digital coding, spread spectrum, and so on. Licensing terms for a given band will usually specify the type of modulation to be used. For example, airband radiotelephones used for air to ground communication between pilots and controllers operates in the VHF band from 118.0 to 136.975 MHz, using amplitude modulation.

Radiotelephone receivers are usually designed to a very high standard, and are usually of the double-conversion superhet design. Likewise, transmitters are carefully designed to avoid unwanted interference and feature power outputs from a few tens of milliwatts to perhaps 50 watts for a mobile unit, up to a couple of hundred watts for a base station. Multiple channels are often provided using a frequency synthesizer.

Receivers usually feature a squelch circuit to cut off the audio output from the receiver when there is no transmission to listen to. This is in contrast to broadcast receivers, which often dispense with this.

===Privacy and selective calling===
Often, on a small network system, there are many mobile units and one main base station. This would be typical for police or taxi services for example. To help direct messages to the correct recipients and avoid irrelevant traffic on the network being a distraction to other units, a variety of means have been devised to create addressing systems.

The crudest and oldest of these is called CTCSS, or Continuous Tone-Controlled Squelch System. This consists of superimposing a precise very low frequency tone on the audio signal. Only the receiver tuned to this specific tone turns the signal into audio: this receiver shuts off the audio when the tone is not present or is a different frequency. By assigning a unique frequency to each mobile, private channels can be imposed on a public network. However this is only a convenience feature—it does not guarantee privacy.

A more commonly used system is called selective calling or Selcall. This also uses audio tones, but these are not restricted to sub-audio tones and are sent as a short burst in sequence. The receiver will be programmed to respond only to a unique set of tones in a precise sequence, and only then will it open the audio circuits for open-channel conversation with the base station. This system is much more versatile than CTCSS, as relatively few tones yield a far greater number of &quot;addresses&quot;. In addition, special features (such as broadcast modes and emergency overrides) can be designed in, using special addresses set aside for the purpose. A mobile unit can also broadcast a Selcall sequence with its unique address to the base, so the user can know before the call is picked up which unit is calling. In practice many selcall systems also have automatic transponding built in, which allows the base station to &quot;interrogate&quot; a mobile even if the operator is not present. Such transponding systems usually have a status code that the user can set to indicate what they are doing. Features like this, while very simple, are one reason why they are very popular with organisations that need to manage a large number of remote mobile units. Selcall is widely used, though is becoming superseded by much more sophisticated digital systems.

==Uses==

===Conventional telephone use===
Mobile radio telephone systems, such as Mobile Telephone Service and Improved Mobile Telephone Service, allowed a mobile unit to have a telephone number allowing access from the general telephone network, although some systems required mobile operators to set up calls to mobile stations. Mobile radio telephone systems before the introduction of cellular telephone services suffered from few usable channels, heavy congestion, and very high operating costs.

===Marine use===

The &quot;Marine Radiotelephone Service&quot; or &quot;HF ship-to-shore&quot; operates on shortwave radio frequencies, using single-sideband modulation. The usual method is that a ship calls a shore station, and the shore station&#x27;s marine operator connects the caller to the public switched telephone network. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet.

Short wave radio is used because it bounces between the ionosphere and the ground, giving a modest 1,000 watt transmitter (the standard power) a worldwide range.

Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. The frequencies with the longest range are usually near 20 MHz, but the ionosphere weather (propagation) can dramatically change which frequencies work best.

Single-sideband (SSB) is used because the short wave bands are crowded with many users, and SSB permits a single voice channel to use a narrower range of radio frequencies (bandwidth) when compared to earlier AM systems. SSB uses about 3.5 kHz, while AM radio uses about 8 kHz, and narrowband (voice or communication-quality) FM uses 9 kHz.

Marine radiotelephone first became common in the 1930s, and was used extensively for communications to ships and aircraft over water. In that time, most long-range aircraft had long-wire antennas that would be let out during a call, and reeled-in afterward. Marine radiotelephony originally used AM mode in the 2-3 MHz region before the transition to SSB and the adoption of various higher frequency bands in addition to the 2 MHz frequencies.

One of the most important uses of marine radiotelephony has been to change ships&#x27; itineraries, and to perform other business at sea.

==Regulations==

In the United States, since the Communications Act of 1934 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued various commercial &quot;radiotelephone operator&quot; licenses and permits to qualified applicants. These allow them to install, service, and maintain voice-only radio transmitter systems for use on ships and aircraft. (Until deregulation in the 1990s they were also required for commercial domestic radio and television broadcast systems. Because of treaty obligations they are still required for engineers of international shortwave broadcast stations.) The certificate currently issued is the general radiotelephone operator license.

<text>A crystal filter allows some frequencies to pass through an electrical circuit while attenuating undesired frequencies. An electronic filter can use quartz crystals as resonator components of a filter circuit. Quartz crystals are piezoelectric, so their mechanical characteristics can affect electronic circuits (&quot;see&quot; mechanical filter). In particular, quartz crystals can exhibit mechanical resonances with a very high factor (from 10,000 to 100,000 and greater – far higher than conventional resonators built from inductors and capacitors). The crystal&#x27;s stability and its high Q factor allow crystal filters to have precise center frequencies and steep band-pass characteristics. Typical crystal filter attenuation in the band-pass is approximately 2-3dB. Crystal filters are commonly used in communication devices such as radio receivers.

Crystal filters are used in the intermediate frequency (IF) stages of high-quality radio receivers. They are preferred because they are very stable mechanically and thus have little change in resonant frequency with changes in operating temperature. For the highest available stability applications, crystals are placed in ovens with controlled temperature making operating temperature independent of ambient temperature.

Cheaper sets may use ceramic filters built from ceramic resonators (which also exploit the piezoelectric effect) or tuned LC circuits. Very high quality &quot;crystal ladder&quot; filters can be constructed of serial arrays of crystals.

The most common use of crystal filters are at frequencies of 9 MHz or 10.7 MHz to provide selectivity in communications receivers, or at higher frequencies as a roofing filter in receivers using up-conversion. The vibrating frequencies of the crystal are determined by its &quot;cut&quot; (physical shape), such as the common AT cut used for crystal filters designed for radio communications. The cut also determines some temperature characteristics, which affect the stability of the resonant frequency. However, quartz has an inherently high temperature stability, its shape does not change much with temperatures found in typical radios.

By contrast, less expensive ceramic-based filters are commonly used with a frequency of 10.7 MHz to provide filtering of unwanted frequencies in consumer FM receivers. Additionally, a lower frequency (typically 455 kHz or nearby) can be used as the second intermediate frequency and have a piezoelectric-based filter. Ceramic filters at 455 kHz can achieve similar narrow bandwidths to crystal filters at 10.7 MHz.

The design concept for using quartz crystals as a filtering component was first established by W.G. Cady in 1922, but it was largely W.P. Mason&#x27;s work in the late 1920s and early 1930s that devised methods for incorporating crystals into LC lattice filter networks which set the groundwork for much of the progress in telephone communications. Crystal filter designs from the 1960s allowed for true Chebyshev, Butterworth, and other typical filter types. Crystal filter design continued to improve in the 1970s and 1980s with the development of multi-pole monolithic filters, widely used today to provide IF selectivity in communication receivers. Crystal filters can be found today in radio communications, telecommunications, signal generation, and GPS devices.

<doc id="234095" wikidata="Q17378201" url="?curid=234095" title="Corporal">
<text>Corporal is a military rank in use by the armed forces of many countries. It is also a police rank in some police services. The rank is usually the lowest ranking non-commissioned officer. In some militaries, the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers.

The word is a contraction from the medieval Italian phrase ( [of soldiers]). While most Indo-European languages use the contraction, West Iberian languages use .

== By country ==
=== Argentina ===
NCOs in the Argentine Armed Forces are divided into junior and senior NCOs, with three and four ranks, respectively. The three junior ranks are called &quot;corporal&quot; (cabo) in both the Navy and the Air Force, while in the Army the third rank is called &quot;sergeant&quot; (sargento).

National Gendarmerie and Coast Guard junior NCOs ranks are similar to those in the Army and Navy, respectively.

=== Australia ===
Corporal is the second lowest of the non-commissioned officer ranks in the Australian Army, falling between lance-corporal and sergeant. A corporal is usually appointed as a section commander, and is in charge of 7–14 soldiers of private rank. They are assisted by a second-in-command, usually a lance-corporal or senior private. A Corporal within Artillery is known as a bombardier. Corporal is also a rank of the Royal Australian Air Force, being equal to both the Australian Army and Royal Air Force rank of corporal.

=== Bangladesh ===
Corporal is a non-commissioned officer rank in the Bangladesh Army, falling between lance-corporal and sergeant, and in the Bangladesh Air Force, falling between leading aircraftman and sergeant.

=== Belgium ===
The branches of the Belgian Armed Forces use three ranks of corporal: corporal (, ), master corporal (, ) and 1st master corporal (, ). Corporal is equivalent to NATO Rank Code OR-3, whereas master corporal and 1st master corporal are equivalent to OR-4. The rank immediately below corporal is 1st private and the rank directly above 1st master corporal is sergeant.

Units with a cavalry, artillery or Logistic Corps (Transport unit) tradition replace Corporal by &quot;Brigadier&quot;.

The equivalent of these ranks in the Naval Component are quartermaster, chief quartermaster and 1st chief quartermaster.

=== Belarus ===

The Byelorussian Home Defence (23 February 1944 – 28 April 1945) used the kapral (), in the meaning of Corporal as enlisted grade, equivalent to Obergefreiter, Hauptgefreiter or Stabsgefreiter of the German Wehrmacht (1933–1945).

=== Brazil ===
Corporal (in Portuguese &quot;Cabo&quot;) is the second NCO rank of the Army and Navy, after the Private (or Sailor at the Navy), third of the Air Force, after Private First-Class. Soldiers (either a recruit or a promoted Private) who successfully complete the Corporal course may be promoted to the rank of Corporal should they excel in the course. A Corporal in the Brazilian Army will lead the smallest fractions of units as machine gun squads, mortar and infantry squads. 

=== Canada ===
Corporal is an Army and Air Force non-commissioned member rank of the Canadian Armed Forces. Its naval equivalent is sailor 1st class. It is senior to the rank of private and its naval equivalent sailor 2nd class, and junior to master corporal (&quot;caporal-chef&quot;) and its equivalent master sailor (&quot;matelot-chef&quot;). It is part of the cadre of junior non-commissioned officers, and one of the junior ranks. In French, the rank is &quot;caporal&quot;.

The rank insignia of a corporal is a two-bar chevron, point down, worn in gold thread on both upper sleeves of the service dress jacket; in rifle green (army) or dark blue (air force) thread on CADPAT slip-ons for operational dress; in old gold thread on blue slip-ons on other air force uniforms; and in gold metal and green enamel miniature pins on the collars of the army dress shirt and outerwear coats. On army ceremonial uniforms, it is usually rendered in gold braid (black for rifle regiments), on either both sleeves, or just the right, depending on unit custom.
Corporal is the first non-commissioned officer rank, and the lowest rank officially empowered to issue a lawful command. Corporals can lead troops if they have the formal qualifications to be promoted to master corporal but have not been promoted yet. However, the rank of corporal was severely downgraded after Unification, along with the attendant responsibilities. A corporal in the Canadian Army in 1967 had the same duties and responsibilities that a sergeant has today. In an infantry section, a corporal will sometimes command an assault team if a master corporal is leading the section or they are pending promotion to master corporal.

Another effect of Unification was to delete the appointments of lance-corporal and lance-sergeant (a corporal holding the acting rank of sergeant). The former is still common in other Commonwealth militaries.

Corporal is deemed to be the substantive rank of the members carrying the appointment of master corporal. On pay documents, corporal was formerly listed as &quot;Cpl (A)&quot; and master corporal as &quot;Cpl (B)&quot;.

In rifle regiments, a distinction was historically drawn between a corporal and an acting corporal; The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada had a special insignia to distinguish between the two.

=== Chile ===
In the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police, there are three grades of Corporal: Corporal, Corporal 2nd. and Corporal 1st. The next level is Sergeant 2nd. grade.

=== Germany ===
Corporal or Korporal was the most junior NCO grade in many German partial states of Deutscher Bund, before the term was replaced by the word Unteroffizier in the middle of the 19th century.

In September 2021, the Bundeswehr reimplemented the grade of Korporal, but this time as a senior enlisted rank below NCO level. Additionally, a completely new rank was created with the grade of Stabskorporal what is the most senior enlisted rank now. Both ranks are classified OR-4 in the NATO rank code system. In the Bundeswehr, both ranks share paygrade A6 with the junior NCO rank Stabsunteroffizier.

=== France ===
There are three ranks of corporal (). In the French Army, these are not NCO ranks, but enlisted ones. The corporals are called &quot;ranked&quot; (). Non-commissioned officers start at the rank of .

In regiments with a cavalry tradition, using white insignia, and artillery, is used instead.

=== India ===

In the Indian Air Force, a corporal is a rank given to an airman who is senior to leading aircraftman but junior to a sergeant. A corporal is designated as a Non-Commissioned Officer in the Indian Air Force.

=== Indonesia ===

In the Indonesian Military, the rank &quot;Corporal&quot; is known as . In Indonesia, &quot;Corporal&quot; has three levels, which are: Second Corporal (Lance Corporal), First Corporal (Corporal), and Master Corporal.

=== Ireland ===

Corporal () is the lowest rank of non-commissioned officer within the Irish Army and Air Corps. The Naval Service equivalent is leading seaman.

==== Army ====
The main role of an infantry corporal is either to command a section as the section commander or to command the fire support group as the second in command of the section. All corporals are qualified instructors on drill, section weapons, and fieldcraft.

In the Artillery Corps, the corporal is normally assigned to a gun detachment as a layer, or a detachment commander. Artillery corporals can also find themselves in charge of the battery signals section.

The army rank insignia consists of two winged chevrons (or &quot;stripes&quot;), the dress uniform being red chevrons with a yellow border.

==== Air Corps ====
Before 1994, the Air Corps was considered part of the army and wore army uniforms with distinct corps badges but the same rank insignia. With the introduction of a unique Air Corps blue uniform in 1994, the same rank markings in a white colour were worn, before the introduction of a new two-chevron badge with wing rank marking.

=== Italy ===

A soldier used to get promoted from private (&quot;soldato&quot;) to corporal rank (&quot;caporale&quot;) after 3 months of service until 2014, After 2014 they have to pass a selection to be promoted to corporal. The title was used as a senior office in the Italian Kingdom during World War II.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Defence Force awards the corporal rank to soldiers or airmen after 6 or 7 years of service. There is substantial responsibility on the part of a corporal in the New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force. They usually command a small team and work closely with their sergeants. A pay increase is also given.

Like their British, Canadian and Australian counterparts, they wear two chevrons to distinguish their rank.

Corporals have what is termed &#x27;power of arrest&#x27;, and is impressed on recruits in RNZAF basic training. Basically, this power means that any airman or private disobeying or ignoring an order from a corporal will be subject to military arrest by that individual. Power of arrest is used by higher ranks to enforce their orders, corporal in the RNZAF being the lowest rank with this power.

=== Pakistan ===
These ranks are still used in the Pakistan Air Force. it is a rank given to an airman who is senior to leading aircraftsman but junior to a sergeant.

=== Philippines === 
In the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the rank Corporal is locally called as &quot;Kabo&quot;. It is currently being used by both the Philippine Army and the Philippine Marine Corps. It stand above the rank of private first class and below sergeant.

The Philippine Revolutionary Army also used corporal as part of their ranks during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine–American War. It is the lowest enlisted personnel rank on the service, below the rank of sergeant.

As of 8 February 2019, a new ranking classification for the Philippine National Police was adopted, eliminating confusion of old ranks. The rank of corporal is included on the new ranking classification. It is the second from the bottom, placing above the rank of Patrolman and below police staff sergeant.

=== Poland ===
In the Polish Land Forces, the rank of is the lowest rank in the NCO corps (OR-3 in NATO code). Most commonly the rank is held by a NCO commanding an infantry squad, tank or gun crew, or a similar unit. The equivalent rank in the Polish Navy is .

As with many other military ranks, direct comparison between various armies might be misleading. Before World War II, the Polish Army&#x27;s was more or less equivalent to the British rank of lance corporal, while the British rank of corporal was named (lit. &quot;platooner&quot;). In modern times, the rank is still equivalent to a UK lance corporal or a private first class in the U.S. Army (OR-3), while the British and American rank of corporal (OR-4) is equivalent to the Polish rank of (lit. &quot;senior corporal&quot;), which was introduced in 1971.

Historically, the rank was first introduced in Poland in the 17th century, together with mercenary troops of Italian origin. In foreign troops on the royal payroll, a commanded four ranks of musketeers or part of a company of pikemen. In the 20th century, between the world wars, the rank of corporal was held by both conscripted NCOs and professional soldiers alike. This was changed after World War II, when the Polish Army was under Soviet command and the rank of was modified to resemble that of Soviet &quot;junior sergeant&quot;, reserved for conscripted NCOs. In the modern Polish Army, the rank is exclusively reserved for professional soldiers.

The insignia of (worn on shoulder straps or badge above breast pocket) are two bars.

=== Portugal ===
The Portuguese Navy has the rank of (corporal of the Navy). All other branches of the Portuguese Armed Forces have several ranks of corporal ( in Portuguese). The Portuguese Army and the Portuguese Air Force have the ranks of (second corporal), (first corporal) and (corporal adjudant). The National Republican Guard has the ranks of (corporal), (chief corporal) and (corporal-major).

The several ranks of corporal correspond to the several pay grades, above that of private, that can be reached inside the enlisted rank professional category of the Army, the Air Force and the National Republican Guard. In the Navy, the rank of is the highest pay grade in the enlisted rank category.

=== Russia ===
The rank of corporal () existed in the Russian Army from 1647 to 1798, when it was replaced with that of non-commissioned officer (, from , literally &quot;sub-officer&quot;). Soviet and modern Russian armies have the rank of &quot;&quot; (derived from the German ) as the highest rank of enlisted personnel, below lance (or junior) sergeant () which are assigned as squad leaders.

=== Singapore ===
==== Singapore Armed Forces ====
The Corporal rank in the Singapore Armed Forces is between the rank of Lance Corporal and Corporal First Class. National Servicemen are usually promoted to this rank within the 2nd year of their service.

Prior to 1992, the SAF followed the British model where corporals were non-commissioned officers often holding the appointment of section leader. Today, a corporal is not a specialist (NCO-equivalent). Corporals are usually given higher responsibilities/ appointments as a section 2IC, or 2nd-in-command.

==== Home Team ====
In the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Prison Service, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and Singapore Customs, a corporal is a rank below sergeant.

The rank insignia for a corporal is two chevrons pointing downwards.

==== Uniformed youth organisations ====
For the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the rank of Corporal is below the rank of Third Sergeant, and above the rank of Lance Corporal. For the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), the rank of Corporal is below the rank of Sergeant, and above the rank of Lance Corporal.

For NCC, the rank insignia is same as that of an SAF CPL, except that the letters &#x27;NCC&#x27; are below the insignia, so as to differentiate NCC cadets from SAF personnel. As for NPCC and NCDCC, the rank insignia is two pointed-down chevrons with the letters &#x27;NPCC&#x27; and &#x27;NCDCC&#x27; below the insignia, so as to differentiate NPCC and NCDCC cadets from Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel, respectively.

The rank of Corporal is generally awarded to cadets in Secondary Two, or Secondary Three. Corporals, after being appointed, are given training to command a squad.

=== Spain ===
In the Spanish Armed Forces, (corporal) is the rank between (first class private) and (first corporal). It actually equates to a NATO OR-4, with and equating both to an OR-5.

=== Ukraine ===
Since 2015, the Corporal (), was introduced in the National Police of Ukraine, that is a special rank of junior quarterdeck. It corresponds to former junior sergeant of militia. Also since 2018–19, the Corporal () was introduced in the Court Security Service (), and the DBR () as a special rank of junior quarterdeck.

=== United Kingdom ===

The rank of corporal, which falls between lance-corporal and sergeant is used by the British Army, Royal Marines, and Royal Air Force.
The badge of rank is a two-bar chevron (also known as &quot;stripes&quot;, &quot;tapes&quot;, or &quot;hooks&quot;). A corporal&#x27;s role varies between regiments; but, in the standard infantry role, a corporal commands a section, with a lance-corporal as second-in-command (2ic). When the section is split into fire teams, they command one each. In the Royal Armoured Corps, a corporal commands an individual tank. Their duties therefore largely correspond to those of staff sergeants in the United States Army and corporals are often described as the &quot;backbone&quot; of the British Army.

In the Household Cavalry, all non-commissioned ranks are designated as different grades of corporal up to regimental corporal major (who is a warrant officer class 1). There is no effective actual rank of corporal, however, and the ranks progress directly from lance-corporal to lance-corporal of horse (who is effectively equivalent to a corporal; technically, a lance-corporal of horse holds the rank of corporal but is automatically give the appointment of lance-corporal of horse). Similarly, in the Foot Guards and in the Honourable Artillery Company, every Corporal is appointed as a lance-sergeant meaning they wear three chevrons rather than the regular two, with a lance-corporal wearing two chevrons instead of one: this is sometimes said to have originated with Queen Victoria who did not like &quot;her own guardsmen&quot; having only one chevron.

Royal Artillery corporals are called bombardiers; although, until 1920, the Royal Artillery had corporals and bombardier was a lower rank. The rank of second corporal existed in the Royal Engineers and Royal Army Ordnance Corps until 1920.

A common nickname for a corporal is a &quot;full screw&quot;, with lance-corporals being known as &quot;lance-jacks&quot;.
Corporal is the lowest NCO rank in the Royal Air Force (aside from the RAF Regiment who have lance-corporals), coming between junior technician or Senior aircraftman technician and sergeant in the technical trades, or senior aircraftman and sergeant in the non-technical trades. Between 1950 and 1964, corporals in technical trades were known as &quot;corporal technicians&quot; and wore their chevrons point up.

In the Royal Navy, the equivalent to corporal is leading hand or leading rate.

The Army Cadet Force, Combined Cadet Force, Air Training Corps, Royal Marines sections of the Sea Cadet Corps and the Combined Cadet Force all have the rank of corporal, reflecting the structure of their parent service; therefore it is the second NCO rank of the ACF, CCF (including the RAF Section, which has the rank of lance corporal) and marine cadets, and the first NCO rank in the ATC.
=== United States ===
==== United States Army ====
In the U.S. Army, corporal is preceded by the first three forms of private and the rank of specialist. A corporal rank shares the same pay grade (E-4) as a specialist, though unlike a specialist, a corporal is a non-commissioned officer and may direct the activities of other soldiers.

The rank of corporal dates to the Revolutionary War. Each company in the Continental Army was divided into four squads, with the enlisted contingent of each comprising a sergeant, a corporal, and nineteen privates. The corporal, along with the superior sergeant, were responsible for the care, discipline, and training of their men. After the Civil War, U.S. Army infantry strategy increasingly focused on units below the company level. In 1891, a squad was defined as an eight-man unit led by a corporal, a definition which held through World War I until the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II.

In 1940, with the recognition of the increasing importance of small-unit tactics, the size of the squad was increased to twelve men, now led by a sergeant, with a corporal as assistant squad leader. In February 1944, the squad leader became a staff sergeant, assisted by a sergeant, dropping the corporal from the infantry company&#x27;s chain of command. As a result of this &quot;steady inflation&quot; of the NCO corps, writes historian Ernest F. Fisher, &quot;the rank of corporal came to mean very little in a line organization, though the corporal was in theory and by tradition a combat leader.&quot; After the Korean War, squad leaders were further promoted to sergeant first class (E-7), and the &quot;once-honored rank of corporal sank into oblivion.&quot;

As of July 2021, specialists who are graduates of the Basic Leader Course (BLC) and who have been recommended for promotion are to become corporals before further promotion; conversely current corporals who have not yet graduated from BLC will be laterally reassigned as specialists until they have graduated from BLC. No change in pay is involved, but corporals are expected to lead, teach, and mentor their teams.

==== United States Marine Corps ====
Corporal is the fourth enlisted rank in the U.S. Marine Corps, ranking immediately above lance corporal and immediately below sergeant. The Marine Corps, unlike the Army, has no other rank at the pay grade of E-4. Corporal is the lowest grade of non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, though promotion to corporal traditionally confers a significant jump in authority and responsibility compared to promotion from private through lance corporal. Marine infantry corporals generally serve as &quot;fire-team leaders&quot;, leading a four-man team or weapons crew of similar size (e.g., assault weapons squad, medium machine gun team, or LWCMS mortar squad).

In practice, however, the billet of fire team leader is generally held by a lance corporal, while corporals serve in the squad leader billet that would normally be held by a sergeant (E-5) in infantry units. In support units, corporals generally serve in &quot;journeyman&quot; level roles in which they direct the activities of junior Marines and provide technical supervision, on a very limited scope, under the direct supervision of a sergeant or SNCO.

Due to its emphasis on small-unit tactics, its infantry-centric ethos, and its tradition of empowering junior NCOs to exercise first-level leadership, the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Tables of Organization (TOs) usually places corporals (as well as sergeants and staff sergeants) in billets where other services would normally have higher ranking NCOs in authority. For example, the USMC Table of Organization &quot;billet&quot; rank for rifle fire team leader, rifle squad leader, and rifle platoon sergeant is corporal (E-4), sergeant (E-5), and staff sergeant (E-6), respectively. However, the same positions (Table of Organization and Equipment &quot;slots&quot;) in US Army infantry units are one grade higher and, except in fire teams (both services with four men in each team), the equivalent Army units are smaller (viz., USMC rifle squad and rifle platoon – 13 men and 43 men, respectively, vice US Army rifle squad and rifle platoon – 9 men and 34 men, respectively). Specifically, for the Army rifle units, the rank of the fire team, squad leader, and platoon sergeant are: sergeant (E-5), staff sergeant (E-6), and sergeant first class (E-7), respectively. Similarly, the term &quot;strategic corporal&quot; refers to the special responsibilities conferred upon a Marine corporal over against the normal responsibilities, and usual authority, of service members in the grade of E-4 in the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Until the mid-to-late 1980s, corporals were the lowest USMC rank eligible for selection as a drill instructor for USMC recruit training.

The history of the rank of corporal in the USMC roughly parallels that of the U.S. Army until 1942. From 1775 until WWII, the Marine Corps used essentially the same rank and organizational structure as its common British and colonial forebears with the Army, as well as the later Continental and U.S. armies. In 1942, as the Army modified its triangular division infantry organization to best fight in the European/North African/Middle Eastern Theatre the Marine Corps began modifying the triangular division plan to best employ its amphibious warfare doctrine in the Pacific Theatre. This meant that for the Corps, squad leaders would remain as sergeants and that the rifle squad would be sub-divided into three four-man fire teams each led by a corporal.

==== United States Air Force ====

When the United States Air Force was separated from the US Army in 1947, corporal (E-3) became the most junior NCO grade below sergeant of this newly created independent branch of the United States Armed Forces. It was replaced by Airman 2nd Class (E-3) in April 1952 respectively Airman 1st Class (E-3, previously E-4) in October 1967, both enlisted ranks below NCO level.

In the same process sergeant was first replaced by Airman 1st class in 1952 (E-4, becoming E-3 in 1967). The title sergeant was reimplated in E-4 as lowest NCO rank from October 1967 to March 1991. From 1976, sergeant shared his paygrade with Senior airman (since then the most senior enlisted rank below NCO status), before phasing out in the late 1990s.

While the rank is used in a number of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

<text>Herbaceous plants are vascular plants that have no persistent woody stems above ground. This broad category of plants includes many perennials, and nearly all annuals and biennials.

==Definitions of &quot;herb&quot; and &quot;herbaceous&quot;==
The fourth edition of the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;herb&quot; as:
# &quot;A plant whose stem does not become woody and persistent (as in a tree or shrub) but remains soft and succulent, and dies (completely or down to the root) after flowering&quot;;
# &quot;A (freq. aromatic) plant used for flavouring or scent, in medicine, etc.&quot;. (See: Herb)

The same dictionary defines &quot;herbaceous&quot; as:
# &quot;Of the nature of a herb; esp. not forming a woody stem but dying down to the root each year&quot;;
# &quot; Resembling a leaf in colour or texture. Opp. scarious&quot;.

Botanical sources differ from each other on the definition of &quot;herb&quot;. For instance, the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation includes the condition &quot;when persisting over more than one growing season, the parts of the shoot dying back seasonally&quot;. Some orchids, such as species of &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, are described in some sources (including the authoritative Plants of the World Online) as &quot;herbs&quot; but with &quot;leaves persistent or sometimes deciduous&quot;. In the glossary of &quot;Flora of the Sydney Region&quot;, Roger Charles Carolin defines &quot;herb&quot; as a &quot;plant that does not produce a woody stem&quot;, and the adjective &quot;herbaceous&quot; as meaning &quot;herb-like, referring to parts of the plant that are green and soft in texture&quot;.

==Description==
Herbaceous plants include graminoids, forbs, and ferns. Forbs are generally defined as herbaceous broad-leafed plants, while graminoids are plants with grass-like appearance including true grasses, sedges, and rushes.

Herbaceous plants most often are low-growing plants, different from woody plants like trees and shrubs, tending to have soft green stems that lack lignification and their above-ground growth is ephemeral and often seasonal in duration. By contrast, non-herbaceous vascular plants are woody plants that have stems above ground that remain alive, even during any dormant season, and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts – these include trees, shrubs, vines and woody bamboos. Banana plants are also regarded as herbaceous plants because the stem does not contain true woody tissue.

Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large, such as the genus &quot;Musa&quot;, to which the banana belongs.

==Habit and habitat==

Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants (especially annuals) are pioneers, or early-successional species. Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats, occurring for example in the ground layer of forests, or in naturally open habitats such as meadow, salt marsh or desert. Some habitats, like grasslands and prairies and savannas, are dominated by herbaceous plants along with aquatic environments like ponds, streams and lakes.

The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by herbchronology, the analysis of annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem.

Herbaceous plants do not produce perennializing above-ground structures using lignin, which is a complex phenolic polymer deposited in the secondary cell wall of all vascular plants. The development of lignin during vascular plant evolution provided mechanical strength, rigidity, and hydrophobicity to secondary cell walls creating a woody stem, allowing plants to grow tall and transport water and nutrients over longer distances within the plant body. Since most woody plants are perennials with a longer life cycle because it takes more time and more resources (nutrients and water) to produce persistently living lignified woody stems, they are not as able to colonize open and dry ground as rapidly as herbs.

The surface of herbs is a catalyst for dew, which in arid climates and seasons is the main type of precipitation and is necessary for the survival of vegetation, i.e. in arid areas, herbaceous plants are a generator of precipitation and the basis of an ecosystem. Most of the water vapor that turns into dew comes from the air, not the soil or clouds. The taller the herb (surface area is the main factor though), the more dew it produces, so a short cut of the herbs necessitates watering. For example, if you frequently and shortly cut the grass without watering in an arid zone, then desertification occurs.

==Types of herbaceous plants==
Most herbaceous plants have a perennial (85%) life cycle but some are annual (15%) or biennial (&lt;1%). Annual plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited, and then new plants grow from seed. Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have stems that die at the end of the growing season, but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season (for biennials, until the next growing season, when they grow and flower again, then die).

New growth can also develop from living tissues remaining on or under the ground, including roots, a caudex (a thickened portion of the stem at ground level) or various types of underground stems, such as bulbs, corms, stolons, rhizomes and tubers. Examples of herbaceous biennials include carrot, parsnip and common ragwort; herbaceous perennials include potato, peony, hosta, mint, most ferns and most grasses.

<text>In anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.

The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.

==Structure==
===Bones===

The femur is the only bone in the thigh and serves as an attachment site for all thigh muscles. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. By most measures, the femur is the strongest and longest bone in the body.

The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphyses, the lower extremity and the upper extremity of femur, that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.

===Muscular compartments===

In cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate compartments, divided by fascia, each containing muscles. These compartments use the femur as an axis and are separated by tough connective tissue membranes (or septa). Each of these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply, and contains a different group of muscles.

* Medial fascial compartment of thigh, adductor
* Posterior fascial compartment of thigh, flexion, hamstring
* Anterior fascial compartment of thigh, extension

Anterior compartment muscles of the thigh include sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles – rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis.

Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris.

Medial compartment muscles are pectineus, adductor magnus, adductor longus and adductor brevis, and also gracilis.

Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity.

===Blood supply===

The arterial supply is by the femoral artery and the obturator artery. The lymphatic drainage closely follows the arterial supply and drains to the lumbar lymphatic trunks on the corresponding side, which in turn drains to the cisterna chyli.

The deep venous system of the thigh consists of the femoral vein, common femoral vein, deep femoral vein, the proximal part of the popliteal vein, and various smaller vessels; these are the site of proximal deep vein thrombosis. The perforating veins connect the deep and the superficial system, which consists of the small and great saphenous veins (the site of varicose veins).

==Clinical significance==
Thigh weakness can result in a positive Gowers&#x27; sign on physical examination.

Thigh injury resulting from sports, whether acute or from overuse, can mean significant incapacity to perform. Soft tissue injury can encompass sprains, strains, bruising and tendinitis.

Runner&#x27;s knee (patellofemoral pain) is a direct consequence of the kneecap rubbing against the end of the thigh bone (femur). Tight hamstrings and weak thigh muscles, required to stabilize the knee, increase the risk of developing of runner&#x27;s knee.

==Society and culture==
Western societies generally tolerate clothing that displays thighs, such as short shorts and miniskirts. Beachwear and many athleisure styles often display thighs as well. Professional dress codes may require covering up bare thighs.

Many Islamic countries disapprove of or prohibit the display of thighs, especially by women.

Strategic covering or display of thighs is used in popular fashion around the world, such as thigh-high boots and &quot;zettai ryoiki&quot;.

<text>Raymond Ames Spruance (July 3, 1886 – December 13, 1969) was a United States Navy admiral during World War II. He commanded U.S. naval forces during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, one of the most significant naval battles of the Pacific Theatre. He also commanded Task Force 16 at the Battle of Midway, comprising the carriers and . At Midway, dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; sank four larger carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Most historians consider Midway the turning point of the Pacific War.

Official Navy historian Samuel Eliot Morison characterized Spruance&#x27;s performance as &quot;superb&quot;, and he was nicknamed &quot;electric brain&quot; for his calmness even in moments of supreme crisis, a reputation enhanced by his successful tactics. He emerged from the war as one of the greater admirals in American history. After the war, Spruance was appointed President of the Naval War College, and later served as American ambassador to the Philippines.

==Early life==
Spruance was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 3, 1886, to Alexander and Annie Hiss Spruance. He was raised in Indianapolis, Indiana. Spruance attended Indianapolis public schools and graduated from Shortridge High School. From there, he went on to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy class of 1907 early on September 12, 1906, and received further, hands-on education in electrical engineering a few years later. His Academy classmates included Patrick N. L. Bellinger, Willis W. Bradley, George M. Courts, Henry K. Hewitt, Jonas H. Ingram, and Claud A. Jones.

==Career prior to World War II==
Spruance&#x27;s first duty assignment was aboard the battleship , an 11,400-ton veteran of the Spanish–American War. In July 1907 he transferred to the battleship and was aboard her during the historic around-the-world cruise of the Great White Fleet from 1907 to 1909.

Spruance&#x27;s seagoing career included command of the destroyers from March 1913 to May 1914, , three other destroyers, and the battleship .

In 1916 he aided in the fitting out of the battleship and he served on board her from her commissioning in June 1916 until November 1917. During the last year of World War I he was assigned as Assistant Engineer Officer of the New York Naval Shipyard, and carried out temporary duty in London, England and Edinburgh, Scotland.

Following his return to the United States, Spruance served aboard transport ship , before he was ordered to Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, for duty in connection with fitting out of destroyer in March 1919. He commanded that vessel during the patrols with the Atlantic Fleet until January 1920, when he assumed command of newly commissioned destroyer in San Francisco, California.

He commanded the &quot;Percival&quot; during the sea trials off the California coast and during the patrol cruises with the Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet until May 1922, when he was ordered to Washington, D.C., for duty in the Bureau of Engineering under Rear Admiral John K. Robison. While in that capacity he assumed additional duty as a member of the board on doctrine of aircraft in connection with fleet fire control.

Spruance served in Washington until early 1924, when he was ordered to the headquarters, Commander Naval Force in Europe. He served as Assistant Chief of Staff under Vice Admiral Philip Andrews during the period of tensions between Greece and Turkey and was decorated with the Gold Cross of the Order of the Savior by the Government of Greece for his service.

Spruance ran a quiet bridge, without chit-chat; he demanded that orders be given concisely and clearly. In one incident a distraught officer rushed to report, &quot;Captain, we&#x27;ve just dropped a depth charge over the stern!&quot; &quot;Well, pick it up and put it back,&quot; was Spruance&#x27;s measured response.

He began attendance at the Naval War College in 1926, and graduated in 1927. Spruance served as executive officer of USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; from October 1929 to June 1931. He also held several engineering, intelligence, staff and Naval War College positions up to the 1940s. He served as an instructor at the Naval War College from 1935 to 1938. He commanded the battleship USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; from April 1938 to December 1939, when he was promoted to rear admiral. On February 26, 1940, Spruance reported as commandant of the 10th Naval District with headquarters at Naval Station Isla Grande in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On August 1, 1941, he finished his tour in Puerto Rico.

==World War II==
===Before Midway===
In the first months of World War II in the Pacific, Spruance commanded the four heavy cruisers and support ships of Cruiser Division Five from his flagship, the heavy cruiser . His division was an element of the task force built around the aircraft carrier and commanded by Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. Early on, Halsey had led his task force on hit-and-run raids against the Japanese in the western Pacific: striking the Gilbert and Marshall islands in February 1942, Wake Island in March, and projecting the air power of the Doolittle Raid against the Japanese homeland in April. These raids were critical to moralesetting a new tone of aggressiveness by U.S. commanders while providing invaluable battle experience for the commanders and sailors of the U.S. Navy.

===Midway===

During the third week of May 1942, U.S. naval intelligence units confirmed that the Japanese would—by early June—invade Midway Island. Capturing and occupying Midway was the brainchild-plan of commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. With it he intended to significantly expand the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s outer defense perimeter across the central Pacific; and, he believed, this very powerful stroke against Midway would so severely threaten Hawaii and Pearl Harbor that the U.S. government would be induced to sue for peace. On the other hand, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester Nimitz knew he must intercept the Japanese invasion fleet, and that he must give battle to the enemy aircraft carriers before they could project their overwhelming power against the naval air station at Midway.

Fewer than two days before launch from Pearl Harbor, Nimitz&#x27;s commander of the fleet carrier force, Admiral Halsey, was hospitalized with severe shingles; Halsey immediately recommended Admiral Spruance to Nimitz as his replacement with Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher receiving overall command. Although Spruance was proven as a cruiser division commander, he had no experience handling carrier-air combat; Halsey reassured Nimitz, and he told Spruance and Fletcher to rely on their newly inherited staff, particularly Captain Miles Browning, a battle-proven expert in carrier warfare. Spruance assumed command of Task Force 16 with its two carriers, and , under battle command of Admiral Fletcher. Fletcher would command Task Force 17, but the task force flagship, , had been badly damaged at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the formation&#x27;s other carrier, , had been sunk, but at Nimitz&#x27;s behest &quot;Yorktown&quot; was patched-repaired in &quot;rush&quot; time purposefully to join the Midway operation.

The U.S. Navy intercept force centered on the three carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Hornet&quot;, and &quot;Yorktown,&quot; and their air-attack squadrons. It faced a Japanese invasion fleet organized into two groups: the air-attack task force of four carriers with support ships under command of Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, and the surface and occupation forces under Admiral Nobutake Kondō and others. Admiral Yamamoto commanded the combined invasion fleet from aboard his flagship .

At 0530 June 4, a scout plane from Midway sighted the &quot;Kido Butai;&quot; however, the scout only reported sighting &quot;(t)wo carriers and battleships,&quot; and giving course and speed. Since US intelligence had reported the possibility that the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; would be operating in two separate task forces, that meant that Fletcher only knew the location of half of the carrier force. Armed with this information, Fletcher ordered Spruance to launch a strike at the Japanese with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; while holding &quot;Yorktown&quot; in reserve in case the other Japanese carriers were discovered. Since the Japanese planes were returning from the Midway strike, Spruance ordered that his strike be launched without delay so as to maximize the chances that the Japanese carriers would be caught while landing planes or spotting the next wave. In this state the Japanese carriers would be extremely vulnerable. Furthermore, Spruance ordered that the air squadrons fly directly to their targets before assembling every squadron into a proper formation, gambling that the attacks would leave the enemy carriers in disarray and delay the launching of their own counterstrike. Though this gamble paid off, &quot;Enterprise&quot; air squadrons would pay a heavy price, flying in piecemeal and mostly without fighter escort.

The battle commenced on the morning of June 4; the first several waves of U.S. attack aircraft were badly beaten, both near Midway and at sea around the Japanese task force. Then U.S. dive bombers from Spruance&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew to Nagumo&#x27;s fleet of four carriers – which, fatefully, were without air cover. Most of Nagumo&#x27;s attack planes had just returned from the first strike on Midway and were immobilized in the carrier hangars, while his combat air patrol cover planes were engaged with battling torpedo bombers from &quot;Hornet&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bombers critically damaged two Japanese carriers including Nagumo&#x27;s flagship ; while the &quot;Yorktown&quot; air group, launched after Fletcher was confident that all Japanese carriers were accounted for, crippled the &quot;Soryu&quot;. All three were eventually scuttled.

, the surviving carrier, gave the Japanese some brief respite by sending strikes that again damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot;. But several hours later—near the end of daylight hours—a U.S. scout plane located &quot;Hiryū&quot; again. Fletcher quickly ordered his dive bombers to strike, which fatally damaged the fourth Japanese carrier; it was scuttled the next day. However a second strike from &quot;Hiryū&quot; would fatally cripple Fletcher&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and as a result, Fletcher passed command to Spruance, who would command the mop-up phase of the battle.

The U.S. Navy counterforce sank all four Japanese carriers while losing one of its own, &quot;Yorktown&quot;. The repulse of the Japanese invasion fleet at Midway, and critically the destruction of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, allowed the U.S. to gain parity in the naval air war. In 1949, naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted that Spruance was subjected to criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese and allowing the surface fleet to escape. But in summing up Spruance&#x27;s performance in the battle, Morison wrote: &quot;Fletcher did well, but Spruance&#x27;s performance was superb. Calm, collected, decisive, yet receptive to advice; keeping in his mind the picture of widely disparate forces, yet boldly seizing every opening. Raymond A. Spruance emerged from the battle one of the greatest admirals in American naval history&quot;. For his actions at the battle of Midway, Rear Admiral Spruance was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and cited as follows: &quot;For exceptionally meritorious service ... as Task Force Commander, United States Pacific Fleet. During the Midway engagement which resulted in the defeat of and heavy losses to the enemy fleet, his seamanship, endurance, and tenacity in handling his task force were of the highest quality.&quot; Both Fletcher and Nimitz recommended Spruance for the Distinguished Service Medal for his role in the battle.

The Battle of Midway is considered by many to be a turning point of the war in the Pacific, along with the Guadalcanal campaign. Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese Combined Fleet. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese timetable to encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial machine time to accelerate war production, and ultimately, turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other matériel of war.

===Commanding the Fifth Fleet===

Shortly after the Midway battle, Spruance became chief of staff to Admiral Nimitz, and in September 1942 was appointed as Deputy Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.

On 5 August 1943 Spruance was placed in command of the Central Pacific Force, which, on April 29, 1944, was redesignated as the Fifth Fleet. At that time, Admiral Nimitz instituted a unique arrangement in which the command of the vessels which made up the &quot;Big Blue Fleet&quot; alternated between Admiral William Halsey Jr., at which time it was identified as the Third Fleet and Task Force 38, and Admiral Spruance, when it became the Fifth Fleet and Task Force 58. When not in command of the fleet the admirals and their staffs were based at Pearl Harbor and planned future operations.

The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance had a knack for getting along with difficult people, including his friend Admiral Kelly Turner, the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet&#x27;s amphibious force. One exception was Admiral John Towers, a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.

Most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey; most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance. Captain George C. Dyer of the light cruiser , who served under both Spruance and Halsey, summed up the view of many ship captains:

This gave rise to the description of Spruance as &quot;an Admiral&#x27;s admiral&quot;.

Spruance directed Operation Hailstone against the Japanese naval base Truk in February 1944 in which twelve Japanese warships, thirty-two merchant ships and 249 aircraft were destroyed. This occurred at the same time that Admiral Turner&#x27;s forces were attacking Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshalls, about 700 miles to the east. Spruance himself directed a task group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers that left the main body to go after Japanese ships that were fleeing Truk, sinking the light cruiser and destroyer . This was said to be the first time that a four-star admiral took part in a sea action aboard one of the ships engaged. Admiral Spruance commanded with deadly precision, reported an observer.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
While screening the American invasion of Saipan in June 1944, Spruance defeated the Japanese fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Although he broke the back of the Japanese naval air force by sinking three carriers, two oilers and destroying about 600 enemy airplanes (so many that the remaining Japanese carriers were used solely as decoys in the Battle of Leyte Gulf a few months later due to the lack of aircraft and aircrews to fly them) Spruance has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in exploiting his success in the Philippine Sea. Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison:

However, his actions were both praised and understood by the main persons ordering and directly involved in the battle. Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations, said to him &quot;Spruance, you did a damn fine job there. No matter what other people tell you, your decision was correct.&quot; Spruance&#x27;s fast carrier commander, Marc Mitscher, told his chief of staff Arleigh Burke:

===End of the Pacific War===
For most of the war, Spruance preferred to use the heavy cruiser , named for his hometown, as his flagship. He shifted his flag to the old battleship of the shore bombardment force after &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was struck by a kamikaze off Okinawa. When &quot;New Mexico&quot; was struck by two kamikaze on the night of 12 May 1945, a hasty search by Spruance&#x27;s staff found the admiral manning a fire hose amidship. Determining that &quot;New Mexico&quot; was not too badly damaged to remain on station, Spruance kept her as his flagship. Spruance later chose the battleship as his flagship, as the huge had both room for his staff and the speed to keep up with the fast carrier task forces.

Spruance received the Navy Cross for his actions at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

Spruance succeeded Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas in November 1945, a few months after the end of the war.

On October 16, 1946, the former Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, presented the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Admiral Spruance, with citation as follows:

==Post-war==
===Retirement===

At the end of the Second World War Congress created a limited number of five-star ranks for the Army and the Navy, designated General of the Army and Fleet Admiral. The Navy, by law, was limited to four fleet admirals; three of these appointments were obvious: Ernest King, Chester Nimitz and William Leahy. The fourth was a choice between Halsey and Spruance, and after much deliberation, eventually Halsey was appointed in December 1945. Spruance&#x27;s achievements were acknowledged by the unique distinction of a special act of Congress awarding him Admiral&#x27;s full pay for life. Spruance expressed his personal feelings on this matter as follows:
Spruance was President of the Naval War College from February 1946 until he retired from the Navy in July 1948. He was decorated with Order of Leopold and Croix de guerre with Palm by the Government of Belgium for his service for the Allied cause.

Shortly before his retirement, Spruance received the following Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy:

===Later life===
He was appointed as Ambassador to the Philippines by President Harry S. Truman, and served there from 1952 to 1955.

He received his Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.), honoris causa degree from Central Philippine University in 1955, an institution of higher learning founded by the American Baptist missionary, William Orison Valentine in 1905.

Spruance died in Pebble Beach, California, on December 13, 1969, and was buried with full military honors at Golden Gate National Cemetery near San Francisco. His wife, Margaret Dean (1888–1985), is buried alongside him, as are Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, his longtime friend Admiral Richmond K. Turner, and Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, an arrangement made by all of them while living. He was the grandfather of theatre director Anne Bogart.

==Personality==
Spruance was an active man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were generally simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance spent most of his retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.

His achievements in the navy were well known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except with his family and his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. &quot;When I look at myself objectively,&quot; he wrote in retirement, &quot;I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely due to the fact that I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution.&quot; About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: &quot;Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank.&quot;

==Legacy==
The destroyers , lead ship of the of destroyers, and , 61st ship of the of destroyers, were named in his honor.

The main auditorium of the U.S. Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, is named Spruance Hall. A bust of Spruance is in the lobby.

==Cultural depictions==
Spruance was portrayed by Glenn Ford (a US Naval Reserve officer himself) in the 1976 film &quot;Midway&quot;, and by Jake Weber in the 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;.

Spruance is depicted as the controversial victor of Midway by G. D. Spradlin in the 1988 TV miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. He is shown to be at loggerheads with his staff on numerous occasions and corrected by them once. The series, based on Herman Wouk&#x27;s book of the same name, shows Spruance&#x27;s decision to end the battle and retreat rather than confront the rest of the Japanese fleet as having been opposed by his subordinates, and he was mocked behind his back as &quot;lacking the stomach.&quot; Yet the decision is hailed by the series&#x27;s narrator as instrumental in sealing the American victory. Wouk writes in his book that &quot;Spruance escaped [the Japanese fleet admiral] Yamamoto&#x27;s terrible trap by acting on perfect military instinct. Not till many months later did American intelligence ferret out the facts.&quot;

It is the longest and widest single nerve in the human body, going from the top of the leg to the foot on the posterior aspect. The sciatic nerve has no cutaneous branches for the thigh. This nerve provides the connection to the nervous system for the skin of the lateral leg and the whole foot, the muscles of the back of the thigh, and those of the leg and foot. It is derived from spinal nerves L4 to S3. It contains fibres from both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus.

==Structure==
In humans, the sciatic nerve is formed from the L4 to S3 segments of the sacral plexus, a collection of nerve fibres that emerge from the sacral part of the spinal cord. The lumbosacral trunk from the L4 and L5 roots descends between the sacral promontory and ala, and the S1 to S3 roots emerge from the ventral sacral foramina. These nerve roots unite to form a single nerve in front of the piriformis muscle. The nerve passes beneath the piriformis and through the greater sciatic foramen, exiting the pelvis. From here, it travels down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. The nerve travels in the posterior compartment of the thigh behind (superficial to) the adductor magnus muscle and is itself in front of (deep to) the long head of the biceps femoris muscle. At the popliteal fossa, the nerve divides into its two branches: 
* The tibial nerve, which travels down the posterior compartment of the leg into the foot
* The common fibular nerve (also called the common peroneal nerve), which travels down the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg into the foot

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the human body.

===Development===
==Function==
The sciatic nerve supplies sensation to the skin of the foot, as well as the entire lower leg (except for its inner side). Sensation to skin to the sole of the foot is provided by the tibial nerve, and the lower leg and upper surface of the foot via the common fibular nerve.

The sciatic nerve also innervates muscles. In particular: 
* Via the tibial nerve, the muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg and sole of the foot (plantar aspect). 
* Via the common fibular nerve, the muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg.

==Clinical significance==

===Sciatica===

Pain caused by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by a problem in the lower back is called sciatica. Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions: spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and piriformis syndrome. Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing, muscular hypertension, and sneezing.

===Injury===
A sciatic nerve injury occurs between 0.5% and 2.0% of the time during a hip replacement. Sciatic nerve palsy is a complication of total hip arthroplasty with an incidence of 0.2% to 2.8% of the time, or with an incidence of 1.7% to 7.6% following revision. Following the procedure, in rare cases, a screw, broken piece of trochanteric wire, fragment of methyl methacrylate bone cement, or Burch-Schneider antiprofusio cage can impinge on the nerve; this can cause sciatic nerve palsy, which may resolve after the fragment is removed and the nerve is freed. The nerve can be surrounded by oxidised, regenerated cellulose to prevent further scarring. Sciatic nerve palsy can also result from severe spinal stenosis following the procedure, which can be addressed by spinal decompression surgery. It is unclear if inversion therapy is able to decompress the sacral vertebrae; it may only work on the lumbar aspects of the sciatic nerves.
A sciatic nerve injury may also occur from improperly performed injections into the buttock, and may result in sensory loss.

===Other disease===
Bernese periacetabular osteotomy resulted in major nerve deficits in the sciatic or femoral nerves in 2.1% of 1760 patients, of whom approximately half experienced complete recovery within a mean of 5.5 months.

Sciatic nerve exploration can be done by endoscopy in a minimally invasive procedure to assess lesions of the nerve. Endoscopic treatment for sciatic nerve entrapment has been investigated in deep gluteal syndrome. Patients were treated with sciatic nerve decompression by resection of fibrovascular scar bands, piriformis tendon release, obturator internus, or quadratus femoris, or by hamstring tendon scarring. 

=== Anaesthetic ===
Signals from the sciatic nerve and its branches can be blocked, in order to interrupt the transmission of pain signals from the innervation area, by performing a regional nerve blockade called a sciatic nerve block.

==Society and culture==
According to Jewish law, the sciatic nerve (Hebrew: Gid hanasheh) may not be eaten by Jews to commemorate Jacob&#x27;s injury in his struggle with an angel.

<text>The European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), also known as British storm petrel, or just storm petrel, is a species of seabird in the northern storm petrel family, Hydrobatidae. The small, square-tailed bird is entirely black except for a broad, white rump and a white band on the under wings, and it has a fluttering, bat-like flight. The large majority of the population breeds on islands off the northern coasts of Europe, with the greatest numbers in the Faroe Islands, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Iceland. The Mediterranean population is a separate subspecies whose strongholds are Filfla Island (Malta), Sicily, and the Balearic Islands. This subspecies is indiscernible at sea from its Atlantic relatives.

The storm petrel nests in crevices and burrows, sometimes shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, which is not normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the Northern Hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid, and zooplankton, while pattering on the sea&#x27;s surface, and can find oily, edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird&#x27;s stomach to an oily orange liquid, which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight. The male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.

The storm petrel cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural predation from gulls, skuas, owls, and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern due to its high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners&#x27; superstitions, and by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.

== Taxonomy ==

The northern storm petrels, Hydrobatidae, are one of the four families of the Procellariiformes or &quot;tubenoses&quot;, an order of seabirds that also includes the albatrosses in the family Diomedeidae, the petrels and shearwater in the family Procellariidae and the southern storm petrels in the family Oceanitidae. The northern storm petrels are more closely related to members of the family Procellariidae than they are to the southern storm petrels. The European storm petrel was formerly defined as the only member of the genus &quot;Hydrobates&quot;, the remainder of the Hydrobatinae being placed in &quot;Oceanodroma&quot;, although the least storm petrel was sometimes separated as the sole member of &quot;Halocyptena&quot;. Molecular phylogenetic studies found that &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Hydrobates&quot;. As a consequence, in 2021 all members of &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; were subsumed into an enlarged &quot;Hydrobates&quot;.

The storm petrel was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Procellaria pelagica&quot;. It was moved to the genus &quot;Hydrobates&quot; by Friedrich Boie in 1822. &quot;Petrel&quot;, first recorded in 1602, is a corruption of &quot;pitteral&quot;, referring to the bird&#x27;s pitter-pattering across the water. The suggestion that the word refers to St Peter&#x27;s walking on the waves is a later invention. &quot;Storm&quot; arises from seamen&#x27;s association of this bird with bad weather. In English, the name of the species was written as &quot;stormy petrel&quot; by some 19th-century authors.

The scientific name &quot;hydrobates&quot; derives from Greek &quot;&quot;, from &quot;hydōr&quot; &quot;water&quot;, and &quot;batēs&quot; &quot;walker&quot;, and &quot;pelagicus&quot; from &quot;pelagikos&quot; &quot;pelagic, of the (open) sea&quot;, from &quot;pelagos&quot; &quot;sea, open sea, high sea&quot;. There are two recognised subspecies, the North Atlantic nominate subspecies, &quot;H. p. pelagicus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758), and the Mediterranean &quot;H. p. melitensis&quot; (Schembri, 1843). Although there is some genetic support for classifying the southern form as a separate species, the morphology is not considered sufficiently different from that of the nominate subspecies to justify a split.

== Description ==


The storm petrel is a small bird, in length with a wingspan. It weighs , with an average of . It is square-tailed and has all-black plumage except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the under wings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow white bar on the upper wing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn. No obvious differences between the sexes are seen, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males. The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.

Moult is prolonged in all tubenoses, since they must maintain an ability to fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June, respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.

The storm petrel&#x27;s large nasal olfactory bulbs facilitate a keen sense of smell (unlike most birds), and the birds have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and can use it to locate their nests in the dark.

Their flight is weak-looking and resembles that of a bat, with fluttering interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but unlike Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel, do not look as if they are walking on the water. Birds sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.

The European storm petrel can be distinguished from related Western Palaearctic species by the white bar on its under wing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to Leach&#x27;s storm petrel, band-rumped storm petrel, and the recently described Monteiro&#x27;s storm petrel, it is also smaller, darker, and shorter-winged, and has a square tail. Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel lacks an under wing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.

=== Voice ===

In its display flight, the storm petrel gives a call consisting of eight or more repetitions of a fast &quot;ter-CHICK&quot; sounds ending in a trill (rapid alternation of notes). This chattering, staccato call is highly variable in pitch, stress, and length. Both sexes make the call, which is used as an advertisement for a mate, for pair recognition, and in the nuptial flight. The details of the vocalisation vary geographically, including between the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, and birds recognise calls from their own breeding area. The chatter-call of the Mediterranean subspecies is distinctive. It has the first two notes running into each other, and the final element is sometimes doubled. The storm petrel is usually silent at sea, but sometimes gives the chattering call. A purring song &quot;arrr-r-r-r-r-r-r&quot;... ending with a sharp &quot;chikka&quot; is given in the burrow only by the male; it was described by Charles Oldham as &quot;like a fairy being sick&quot;. Other vocalisations include a fast &quot;wick-wick-wick&quot;, sometimes given in flight, and an &quot;up-CHERRK&quot; alarm which resembles the chatter-call. Chicks give a whistling &quot;pee-pee-pee&quot; call when being fed, and a faster version of this vocalisation is used by adults and young to signal distress.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Storm petrels breed only in the Western Palaearctic on islands off the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. The largest colonies are in the Faroe Islands (150,000–400,000 pairs), United Kingdom (20,000–150,000), Ireland (50,000–100,000), and Iceland (50,000–100,000), with smaller breeding areas off Norway, Malta, Spain, the Canary Islands, Italy, France, and Greece. The strongholds of the &quot;H. p. melitensis&quot; subspecies are the islands of Filfla (Malta), Sicily, and the Balearic Islands, with smaller sites elsewhere in the Mediterranean. This latter form also breeds in North Africa; definitely in Tunisia, probably in Algeria and possibly in Morocco. Because of its nocturnal habits and the problems of accessing some of the small islands on which it breeds, the distribution is poorly known. A colony was discovered as recently as 2009, on Lampedusa. The storm petrel has been recorded as a vagrant in several European countries as far east as Ukraine, in the Guinea region of West Africa, and in Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and the US. Although no North American records were reported for more than 30 years after the first in 1970, this bird has been more or less annual in small numbers since 2003.

The storm petrel breeds on exposed and usually uninhabited islands, which it visits only at night. It otherwise frequents mid-depth waters away from the coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.

The storm petrel is migratory, spending the Northern Hemisphere winter mainly in cool waters off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, south to latitude 38°S and east to KwaZulu-Natal. Some birds stay north of the equator in the seas adjoining Mauritania and Rio de Oro, and a few remain near the breeding islands, especially in the Mediterranean. It is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season, although it is described as regularly seen from land in West Africa. Young birds do not return to the breeding colonies until their second or third year. Birds mostly head south from the breeding islands between September and November, reaching West Africa by mid-November and the south Atlantic by the end of the year. The return passage starts in April, with late records from the tropics and further south probably representing subadult birds that will not breed that year.

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===

The storm petrel is sexually mature at age 4–5 years, with the Mediterranean subspecies typically breeding a year earlier than the Atlantic form. Breeding happens in colonies and normally begins in late May or June. Pairs have a repeated nocturnal display flight in which the male chases the female, the chase being accompanied by flight calls. Some near-adult birds may pair up and occupy a hole at the same time, prior to breeding in the following year.

Storm petrels normally nest in crevices between or under rocks, or burrow in the soil. When they make their own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings, or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits, or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.

The nest tunnel is long and across, with a slightly narrower entrance. The nest chamber is typically unlined, although pairs may bring in some grass, bracken, or seaweed. Although the storm petrel is generally not territorial when breeding, a pair defends the nest chamber itself after the eggs have been laid.

The clutch is a single egg, usually pure white, sometimes with some reddish-brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, a replacement may be laid on rare occasions. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three days at a time on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after the first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.

Tubenoses have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may also contribute to the lengthy incubation.

The adult petrel&#x27;s annual death rate is 12–13%, and the typical life span is 11years. Longevity records established from bird ringing recoveries include a bird aged 31years11 months9 days, and another aged more than 33years.

=== Feeding ===

The storm petrel normally flies within of the water surface and typically feeds by picking items off the sea as it patters over the surface. Birds have been observed diving for food to a depth of not more than . and it is claimed, using indirect measurements, that the Mediterranean subspecies reaches depths of up to ). A bird may range up to over the course of two or three days in search of food. Although the bird usually feeds during the day, in the breeding season petrels will often feed at night close to the shore.

The typical prey consists of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, more than half the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies&#x27; diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach&#x27;s storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.

Petrels can be attracted to boats with &quot;chum&quot;, a malodorous mixture typically containing fish heads, bones and offal, with added fish oil and popcorn to aid flotation. An apparently empty ocean will soon fill with hundreds of birds attracted by the smell. The attraction of the fishy odour is sometimes enhanced by the addition of dimethylsulphide (DMS) a chemical also naturally produced by some planktonic organisms, although there are doubts about the safety of this possible carcinogen.

== Predators and parasites ==

Adults and young are vulnerable to predation at the breeding colonies, their only defence being to spit oil. Petrels cannot breed on islands where rats have been introduced, and feral cats frequently kill these birds on Foula in the Shetland Islands. The American mink, a non-native species in Europe, is a strong swimmer, and can colonise islands up to from the mainland. Natural predators of petrels and other seabirds include skuas and large gulls. The yellow-legged gull is a particular problem in the Mediterranean, and great skuas were estimated to kill 7,500 petrels a year on St Kilda, an unsustainable number. Some great black-backed gulls on the Atlantic islands specialise in taking seabird chicks at night, and peregrine falcons hunt adults at sea. Localised predators include Eleonora&#x27;s falcon on the Columbretes Islands and the nocturnal barn owl on the Balearics; a few owls can wipe out a colony. The little owl is also a predator of both adults and young where it occurs.

Feather mites of at least two species have been found on the storm petrel, with &quot;Halipeurus pelagicus&quot; occurring at much higher densities than &quot;Philoceanus robertsi&quot;. The flea &quot;Xenopsylla gratiosa&quot; and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect their survival rate.

Storm petrels seem to be largely free of blood parasites, even when in close proximity to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune systems that prevent serious blood parasitism.

== Status ==

The European population of the storm petrel has been estimated at 430,000–510,000 breeding pairs or 1,290,000–1,530,000 individual birds and makes up 95% of the world total numbers. The population estimate includes 11,000 to 16,000 breeding pairs of the Mediterranean subspecies. It is very difficult to accurately determine storm petrel populations. The main method used is listening for responses to playback calls at burrow entrances, but infra-red filming may also be an option.

Although this species&#x27; population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.

Because it feeds in flight, the storm petrel is less affected by oil pollution than other seabirds, and may be able to use its good sense of smell to avoid slicks, although a large spill near a breeding colony could have serious consequences.

== In culture ==


Its association with storms makes the storm petrel a bird of bad omen to mariners; they are said to either foretell or cause bad weather. A more prosaic explanation of their appearance in rough weather is that, like most oceanic seabirds, they rely on the winds to support them in flight and just sit on the water surface when becalmed. The birds were sometimes thought to be the souls of perished sailors, and killing a petrel was believed to bring bad luck. The petrel&#x27;s reputation led to the old name of &quot;witch&quot;, although the commonest of the folk names is Mother Carey&#x27;s chicken, a name also used for storm petrels in general in the UK and North America from at least 1767. This is believed to be a corruption of &quot;mater cara&quot; (&quot;dear mother&quot;, the Virgin Mary), a reference to the supernatural Mother Carey, or a superstitious modification of an earlier &quot;Mother Mary&#x27;s chicken&quot; to reduce the potency of the religious name. The Mother Carey character appears a number of times in literature. In the Cicely Fox Smith poem &quot;Mother Carey&quot;, she calls old sailors to return to the sea, but in John Masefield&#x27;s poem of the same name she is seen as a wrecker of ships. She appears as a fairy in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;The Water Babies&quot; and is depicted in one of Jessie Willcox Smith&#x27;s illustrations for the book.

The association of the storm petrel with turbulent weather has led to its use as a metaphor for revolutionary views, the epithet &quot;stormy petrel&quot; being applied by various authors to characters as disparate as Roman tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher, a Presbyterian minister in the early Carolinas, an Afghan governor, or an Arkansas politician.
A 1901 poem by Russian writer Maxim Gorky is invariably titled in English as &quot;The Song of the Stormy Petrel&quot;, although that may not be a perfectly accurate translation of the Russian title &quot;Песня о Буревестнике&quot;, because &quot;Буревестник&quot; (the name of the bird in Russian) translates to the English general term &quot;storm bird&quot;. The poem was called &quot;the battle anthem of the revolution&quot;, and earned Gorky the nickname &quot;The Storm Petrel of the Revolution&quot;.

Various revolutionary anarchist groups adopted the bird&#x27;s name, either as a group identifier, as in the Spanish Civil War, or for their publications. &quot;The Stormy Petrel&quot; (&quot;Burevestnik&quot;) was the title of the magazine of the Anarchist Communist Federation in Russia around the time of the 1905 revolution, and is still an imprint of the London group of the Anarchist Federation. To honour Gorky and his work, the name &quot;Burevestnik&quot; was bestowed on a variety of institutions, locations, and products in the USSR.

In the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, the bursar of the &quot;Edinburgh Trader&quot; (played by Max Baker) makes a reference to Mother Carey&#x27;s chickens, moments before the Kraken attacks the ship.

<text>A zinc finger is a small protein structural motif that is characterized by the coordination of one or more zinc ions (Zn2+) which stabilizes the fold. The term &quot;zinc finger&quot; was originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from the African clawed frog (&quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;) transcription factor IIIA. However, it has been found to encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures in eukaryotic cells. &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; TFIIIA was originally demonstrated to contain zinc and require the metal for function in 1983, the first such reported zinc requirement for a gene regulatory protein followed soon thereafter by the Krüppel factor in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. It often appears as a metal-binding domain in multi-domain proteins.

Proteins that contain zinc fingers (zinc finger proteins) are classified into several different structural families. Unlike many other clearly defined supersecondary structures such as Greek keys or β hairpins, there are a number of types of zinc fingers, each with a unique three-dimensional architecture. A particular zinc finger protein&#x27;s class is determined by its three-dimensional structure, but it can also be recognized based on the primary structure of the protein or the identity of the ligands coordinating the zinc ion. In spite of the large variety of these proteins, however, the vast majority typically function as interaction modules that bind DNA, RNA, proteins, or other small, useful molecules, and variations in structure serve primarily to alter the binding specificity of a particular protein.

Since their original discovery and the elucidation of their structure, these interaction modules have proven ubiquitous in the biological world and may be found in 3% of the genes of the human genome. In addition, zinc fingers have become extremely useful in various therapeutic and research capacities. Engineering zinc fingers to have an affinity for a specific sequence is an area of active research, and zinc finger nucleases and zinc finger transcription factors are two of the most important applications of this to be realized to date.

== History ==
Zinc fingers were first identified in a study of transcription in the African clawed frog, &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; in the laboratory of Aaron Klug. A study of the transcription of a particular RNA sequence revealed that the binding strength of a small transcription factor (transcription factor IIIA; TFIIIA) was due to the presence of zinc-coordinating finger-like structures. Amino acid sequencing of TFIIIA revealed nine tandem sequences of 30 amino acids, including two invariant pairs of cysteine and histidine residues. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure confirmed the identity of the zinc ligands: two cysteines and two histidines. The DNA-binding loop formed by the coordination of these ligands by zinc were thought to resemble fingers, hence the name. This was followed soon thereafter by the discovery of the Krüppel factor in &quot;Drosophila&quot; by the Schuh team in 1986. More recent work in the characterization of proteins in various organisms has revealed the importance of zinc ions in polypeptide stabilization.

The crystal structures of zinc finger-DNA complexes solved in 1991 and 1993 revealed the canonical pattern of interactions of zinc fingers with DNA. The binding of zinc finger is found to be distinct from many other DNA-binding proteins that bind DNA through the 2-fold symmetry of the double helix, instead zinc fingers are linked linearly in tandem to bind nucleic acid sequences of varying lengths. Zinc fingers often bind to a sequence of DNA known as the GC box. The modular nature of the zinc finger motif allows for a large number of combinations of DNA and RNA sequences to be bound with high degree of affinity and specificity, and is therefore ideally suited for engineering protein that can be targeted to and bind specific DNA sequences. In 1994, it was shown that an artificially-constructed three-finger protein can block the expression of an oncogene in a mouse cell line. Zinc fingers fused to various other effector domains, some with therapeutic significance, have since been constructed.

Such was its importance that &quot;the zinc-finger motif&quot; was cited in the Scientific Background to the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (awarded to David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper for computational protein design and protein structure prediction). 

==Domain==
Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs that contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not, instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein, and/or lipid substrates. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and on the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. Znf motifs occur in several unrelated protein superfamilies, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g., some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodeling, and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.

== Classes ==
Initially, the term zinc finger was used solely to describe DNA-binding motif found in &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;; however, it is now used to refer to any number of structures related by their coordination of a zinc ion. In general, zinc fingers coordinate zinc ions with a combination of cysteine and histidine residues. Originally, the number and order of these residues was used to classify different types of zinc fingers ( e.g., Cys2His2, Cys4, and Cys6). More recently, a more systematic method has been used to classify zinc finger proteins instead. This method classifies zinc finger proteins into &quot;fold groups&quot; based on the overall shape of the protein backbone in the folded domain. The most common &quot;fold groups&quot; of zinc fingers are the Cys2His2-like (the &quot;classic zinc finger&quot;), treble clef, and zinc ribbon.

The following table shows the different structures and their key features:


=== Cys2His2 ===
The Cys2His2-like fold group (C2H2) is by far the best-characterized class of zinc fingers, and is common in mammalian transcription factors. Such domains adopt a simple ββα fold and have the amino acid sequence motif:

:X2-Cys-X2,4-Cys-X12-His-X3,4,5-His

This class of zinc fingers can have a variety of functions such as binding RNA and mediating protein-protein interactions, but is best known for its role in sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as Zif268 (Egr1). In such proteins, individual zinc finger domains typically occur as tandem repeats with two, three, or more fingers comprising the DNA-binding domain of the protein. These tandem arrays can bind in the major groove of DNA and are typically spaced at 3-bp intervals. The α-helix of each domain (often called the &quot;recognition helix&quot;) can make sequence-specific contacts to DNA bases; residues from a single recognition helix can contact four or more bases to yield an overlapping pattern of contacts with adjacent zinc fingers.
===Gag-knuckle===
This fold group is defined by two short β-strands connected by a turn (zinc knuckle) followed by a short helix or loop and resembles the classical Cys2His2 motif with a large portion of the helix and β-hairpin truncated.

The retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) protein from HIV and other related retroviruses are examples of proteins possessing these motifs. The gag-knuckle zinc finger in the HIV NC protein is the target of a class of drugs known as zinc finger inhibitors.
===Treble-clef===
The treble-clef motif consists of a β-hairpin at the N-terminus and an α-helix at the C-terminus that each contribute two ligands for zinc binding, although a loop and a second β-hairpin of varying length and conformation can be present between the N-terminal β-hairpin and the C-terminal α-helix. These fingers are present in a diverse group of proteins that frequently do not share sequence or functional similarity with each other. The best-characterized proteins containing treble-clef zinc fingers are the nuclear hormone receptors.

===Zinc ribbon===
The zinc ribbon fold is characterised by two beta-hairpins forming two structurally similar zinc-binding sub-sites.
=== Zn2/Cys6 ===
The canonical members of this class contain a binuclear zinc cluster in which two zinc ions are bound by six cysteine residues. These zinc fingers can be found in several transcription factors including the yeast Gal4 protein.


=== Miscellaneous ===

The &quot;zinc finger antiviral protein&quot; () binds to the CpG site. It is used in mammals for antiviral defense.

== Applications ==
Various protein engineering techniques can be used to alter the DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers and tandem repeats of such engineered zinc fingers can be used to target desired genomic DNA sequences. Fusing a second protein domain such as a transcriptional activator or repressor to an array of engineered zinc fingers that bind near the promoter of a given gene can be used to alter the transcription of that gene. Fusions between engineered zinc finger arrays and protein domains that cleave or otherwise modify DNA can also be used to target those activities to desired genomic loci. The most common applications for engineered zinc finger arrays include zinc finger transcription factors and zinc finger nucleases, but other applications have also been described. Typical engineered zinc finger arrays have between 3 and 6 individual zinc finger motifs and bind target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length. Arrays with 6 zinc finger motifs are particularly attractive because they bind a target site that is long enough to have a good chance of being unique in a mammalian genome.

=== Zinc finger nucleases ===
Engineered zinc finger arrays are often fused to a DNA cleavage domain (usually the cleavage domain of FokI) to generate zinc finger nucleases. Such zinc finger-FokI fusions have become useful reagents for manipulating genomes of many higher organisms including &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, tobacco, corn, zebrafish, various types of mammalian cells, and rats. Targeting a double-strand break to a desired genomic locus can be used to introduce frame-shift mutations into the coding sequence of a gene due to the error-prone nature of the non-homologous DNA repair pathway. If a homologous DNA &quot;donor sequence&quot; is also used then the genomic locus can be converted to a defined sequence via the homology directed repair pathway. An ongoing clinical trial is evaluating Zinc finger nucleases that disrupt the CCR5 gene in CD4+ human T-cells as a potential treatment for HIV/AIDS.

=== Methods of engineering zinc finger arrays ===
The majority of engineered zinc finger arrays are based on the zinc finger domain of the murine transcription factor Zif268, although some groups have used zinc finger arrays based on the human transcription factor SP1. Zif268 has three individual zinc finger motifs that collectively bind a 9 bp sequence with high affinity. The structure of this protein bound to DNA was solved in 1991 and stimulated a great deal of research into engineered zinc finger arrays. In 1994 and 1995, a number of groups used phage display to alter the specificity of a single zinc finger of Zif268. There are two main methods currently used to generate engineered zinc finger arrays, modular assembly, and a bacterial selection system, and there is some debate about which method is best suited for most applications.

The most straightforward method to generate new zinc finger arrays is to combine smaller zinc finger &quot;modules&quot; of known specificity. The structure of the zinc finger protein Zif268 bound to DNA described by Pavletich and Pabo in their 1991 publication has been key to much of this work and describes the concept of obtaining fingers for each of the 64 possible base pair triplets and then mixing and matching these fingers to design proteins with any desired sequence specificity.
The most common modular assembly process involves combining separate zinc fingers that can each recognize a 3-basepair DNA sequence to generate 3-finger, 4-, 5-, or 6-finger arrays that recognize target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length. Another method uses 2-finger modules to generate zinc finger arrays with up to six individual zinc fingers. The Barbas Laboratory of The Scripps Research Institute used phage display to develop and characterize zinc finger domains that recognize most DNA triplet sequences while another group isolated and characterized individual fingers from the human genome. A potential drawback with modular assembly in general is that specificities of individual zinc finger can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA. A recent study demonstrated that a high proportion of 3-finger zinc finger arrays generated by modular assembly fail to bind their intended target with sufficient affinity in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and fail to function as zinc finger nucleases, but the success rate was somewhat higher when sites of the form GNNGNNGNN were targeted.

A subsequent study used modular assembly to generate zinc finger nucleases with both 3-finger arrays and 4-finger arrays and observed a much higher success rate with 4-finger arrays. A variant of modular assembly that takes the context of neighboring fingers into account has also been reported and this method tends to yield proteins with improved performance relative to standard modular assembly.

Numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences. Initial selection efforts utilized phage display to select proteins that bound a given DNA target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc finger arrays. This technique is difficult to use on more than a single zinc finger at a time, so a multi-step process that generated a completely optimized 3-finger array by adding and optimizing a single zinc finger at a time was developed. More recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells. A promising new method to select novel 3-finger zinc finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed &quot;OPEN&quot; by its creators. This system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence. This system was developed by the Zinc Finger Consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc finger arrays. It is somewhat difficult to directly compare the binding properties of proteins generated with this method to proteins generated by modular assembly as the specificity profiles of proteins generated by the OPEN method have never been reported.

<text>Kermit Cintrón (born October 22, 1979) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer and online boxing writer. He held the IBF welterweight title from 2006 to 2008, and has challenged once for the WBC super welterweight title in 2011.

==Early and personal life==
Cintrón had a difficult childhood. He witnessed his mother lie in bed for months before she died of cancer. Unable to care for Cintrón and his siblings, Cintrón&#x27;s father sent him to the United States, with Cintrón&#x27;s uncle, Benjamin Serrano, a former Middleweight contender who had fought Frank Fletcher. Cintrón&#x27;s father remained in regular contact with his children but when Cintrón was 13 his father died of a heart attack, leaving him and his siblings orphaned. 

As a child, Cintrón took up wrestling and boxing. While attending William Tennent High School in Warminster, Pennsylvania, he became an accomplished high-school wrestler on the same team as actor Mike Vogel. After competing at William Tennent, Cintron wrestled at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, a junior college in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In early 2008, Cintrón was trained by Emanuel Steward, who focused his training in boxing and counterattacks. He decided to finish this partnership, based on the fact that Steward&#x27;s time was limited due to several other compromises. Despite this, both conserved a close friendship. During this timeframe, Cintrón abandoned Main Events, signing a promotional contract with Lou DiBella. His next trainer was Ronnie Shields, who emphasized on a faster training pace. Shields preferred a more aggressive style, reminiscent of the one presented during the early stage of Cintrón&#x27;s early career. Brian Caldwell was employed as conditioning coach, in the process modifying his weight routines.

Cintrón is married to María Cintrón and the couple have three children. Two daughters, Denali and Savannah and a son, Clemente.

==Boxing career==
===Welterweight===
Cintrón did not start boxing in the amateurs until he was 19. He compiled a record of 24 wins and 5 losses as an amateur.

On October 7, 2000, Cintrón knocked out Jesse Williams in two rounds in Lancaster to begin his professional career. Cintrón thus began an undefeated streak that would last for more than three-and-a-half years.

One of his toughest tests during that streak came against Omar Davila on February 16, 2002. Cintrón took the fight on one week&#x27;s notice and traveled to his opponent&#x27;s hometown of San Antonio. Despite being cut on the side of one of his eyes in the first round, Cintrón overcame adversity, coming back to defeat Davila by knockout in round two.

Cintrón was featured on NBC on May 18, 2003, against Puerto Rican veteran Luis Rosario, and he won by knockout 59 seconds into round one.

On July 17, 2004, Cintrón made his HBO Boxing debut, knocking out Teddy Reid in eight rounds.

KO Magazine featured Cintrón in an article, which compared his punching power to that of Félix Trinidad and Thomas Hearns.

Still undefeated and now considered a rising star in the division, Cintrón was scheduled for his first world title bout against WBO welterweight champion Antonio Margarito on April 23, 2005, as part of the undercard of a Shane Mosley win by unanimous decision against the Guatemalan-American boxer David Estrada. Cintrón was dropped by Margarito four times en route to a fifth-round knockout loss.

In early 2006, Cintrón rebounded with a tenth-round technical knockout of Estrada, thus reestablishing himself as a contender in the welterweight division.

====IBF welterweight champion====
Cintrón then won his first title belt in a match against Mark Suarez for the IBF crown that had been vacated on June 20, 2006 by Floyd Mayweather Jr.

On July 14, 2007, Cintrón was dominant in his first title defense, knocking down Argentine Walter Matthysse three times on his way to a knockout victory twenty-nine seconds into the second round. Prior to this match, Matthysse had never been knocked down by any opponent, although he had suffered a tenth-round technical knockout in May 2006 at the hands of Paul Williams. (The Cintrón-Matthysse bout was the main undercard of a WBO title bout between challenger Williams and incumbent Margarito)

Cintrón and Williams were scheduled for an IBF/WBO title unification bout on February 2, 2008. But as a result of an injury to Cintrón&#x27;s right hand sustained during his bout with Jesse Feliciano the fight has been canceled.

Cintrón lost his IBF title to Antonio Margarito by knockout on an April 12 broadcast of HBO&#x27;s World Championship Boxing in a rematch from Atlantic City, NJ, on the undercard of Miguel Cotto vs. Alfonso Gómez. In the sixth round, Cintrón fell to the canvas after receiving a one-two punch to the head and a body shot and did not get up before the referee concluded the protective count. It was the first time he had lost a professional fight by a knockout (his previous loss to Margarito being scored as a technical knockout).

Cintrón returned to action against Lovemore N&#x27;dou, competing in an eliminatory fight sanctioned by the IBF. The fight took place on November 15, 2008, in a card held in Nashville, Tennessee. Early in the fight, Cintrón began on the offensive, while N&#x27;dou clinched regularly. This pattern slowed the fight&#x27;s tempo throughout the contest. In the third round, Cintrón connected a solid punch, N&#x27;dou tried to counterattack and exchange but was ineffective, eventually returning to a strategy based on holds. The numerous clinches resulted in head butts, the referee issued numerous warnings to N&#x27;dou for these, eventually deducting a point in the ninth. In the tenth round, an accidental headbutt opened a laceration over Cintrón&#x27;s eyebrow. In the eleventh round, he was able to injure N&#x27;dou with a punch, but did not continue pressing the offensive. Subsequently, the judges awarded Cintrón scores of 117-110, 115-112 and 116-111.

===Light middleweight===
Cintrón&#x27;s victory over N&#x27;dou made him Joshua Clottey&#x27;s mandatory challenger. The fight was discussed and preliminary agreements scheduled it for February 21, 2009. However, after receiving a more lucrative offer, Cintrón decided to fight Sergio Martínez for the World Boxing Council&#x27;s interim light middleweight championship. The bout took place on February 14, 2009, and ended in a controversial majority draw. The opening rounds held no meaningful action, with Cintrón holding an early edge due to his aggression and cleaner punching. By the fourth round, Martínez started moving around with his hands down in an effort to draw Cintrón into a mistake, but to no avail, as there continued to be more clinching than punching. Martínez opened a cut over Cintrón&#x27;s left eye early in the fifth round. Late in the seventh round, a left hand to the head hurt Cintrón, and after backing into the ropes, he went down to his knees before Martínez could attack. Cintrón claimed he was headbutted while the referee Frank Santore continued the count. After Cintrón&#x27;s protests and a lot of confusion in the ring, Santore allowed the bout to continue, saying Cintrón was up at nine and that he never stopped the fight. Martínez went after Cintrón once the eighth round commenced and taunted him after landing punches to the head. Cintrón responded with sustained action of his own, but it was Martínez ending the round with another left hand to the head. The ninth round was favorable for Martínez, but Cintrón rebounded in the tenth round. Martínez lost a point for a punch to the back of the head in the final round. Scores were 116-110 for Martínez and 113-113 draw.

====Cintrón vs. Angulo, Williams====
On May 30, 2009 Cintron defeated Alfredo Angulo, who was unbeaten, by unanimous decision. This high-profile win put Cintrón into position to fight Paul Williams, at the time one of boxing&#x27;s top fighters, pound for pound. This fight took place on May 8, 2010. Although Williams had averaged over a hundred punches per round in his previous outings, Cintrón was able to neutralize his punch output over the first three rounds by effectively jabbing and countering with his right hand. This resulted in a very technical three rounds of boxing and, not surprisingly, voluminous jeers from the spectating crowd. In the fourth round, however, the combatants began to exchange punches, each landing hard power punches on one another. One such exchange caused an entanglement between the fighters, sending Williams to the canvas and Cintrón through the ropes, where he landed on a media table abutting the exterior of the ring. He then fell to the floor and was immediately attended to by ringside doctors. Boxing rules dictate that a fighter, in these circumstances, is afforded a five-minute period with which to recover; however, given that Cintrón was advised by doctors not to move, the fight was called and Cintrón was removed from the arena bound to a stretcher. Since three rounds had been completed, the fight became official and Williams was declared the winner by split decision.

On July 9, 2010, Cintrón lost a unanimous decision to Carlos Molina, who had an 18-4-2 record going into the fight.

On August 12, 2011, Cintrón won a unanimous decision over Antwone Smith.

====Cintrón vs. Álvarez====

On November 26, 2011, Cintrón was knocked out in five rounds by Canelo Álvarez.

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Public challenge to Sean Sherk===
In April 2007, Floyd Mayweather Jr. publicly claimed that any boxer could make the transition into mixed martial arts and win. In response, Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s president, Dana White, issued him a challenge to fight the promotion&#x27;s lightweight champion, Sean Sherk. Mayweather later said that he did not wish to compete in the discipline. However, Cintrón stated that he was willing to fight Sherk in his place. &quot;I want the fight,&quot; said Cintrón, who was 27-1 with 25 KOs. &quot;I can wrestle. I can box. I can beat those UFC fighters at their own game. Tell Mr. White to make me an offer and I&#x27;ll take on his guy...&quot;

===Lingering interest===
Seven years later, Mike Sloan of Sherdog argued that &quot;If Cintron [sic] would have had the opportunity to compete in MMA when he first got into boxing, he would have torn most of the lower weight divisions asunder&quot; and &quot;would have been a top contender in MMA.&quot; Sloan argued that his wrestling background and &quot;ferocious banging style&quot; represented &quot;a dynamic combination that would have given MMA contenders all sorts of trouble&quot; had he completed the transition in his prime.

In June 2017, Cintrón once again commented on his interest noting that he &quot; would have loved to get into mixed martial arts. At that time I was rising in the sport of boxing, but I would have crossed to MMA if the opportunity had come. I didn&#x27;t know anyone in that sport so I never proceeded with it. Never looked into it as I should have, I guess. I think I would have done great.&quot; He noted that he &quot;would if UFC called&quot;. Later that year, Cintrón expressed interest in accepting Conor McGregor&#x27;s challenge for boxers to &quot;come into his world&quot; and step into the UFC octagon.

===Formal transition===
In November 2019, Cintrón announced that upon retiring from boxing, he would try his hand at MMA, still feeling confident that his background in amateur wrestling would facilitate the transition. When queried why it took so long, he responded &quot;[o]ne time, the name Sean Sherk came up, and I was all about it! And that kind of died out so I continued with my boxing career. I&#x27;ve tried! I&#x27;ve tried over the years to get connected to Dana White and see if I can get an opportunity but it never came about. Hopefully this happens this time around!&quot; For this, he added 20 pounds to his frame, given the disparity of the welterweight division between sports. Cintrón also retook his wrestling training, working with an NCAA Division-1 wrestler and a former UFC fighter.

<doc id="234132" wikidata="Q863109" url="?curid=234132" title="Klystron">
<text>A klystron is a specialized linear-beam vacuum tube, invented in 1937 by American electrical engineers Russell and Sigurd Varian, which is used as an amplifier for high radio frequencies, from UHF up into the microwave range. Low-power klystrons are used as oscillators in terrestrial microwave relay communications links, while high-power klystrons are used as output tubes in UHF television transmitters, satellite communication, radar transmitters, and to generate the drive power for modern particle accelerators.

In a klystron, an electron beam interacts with radio waves as it passes through resonant cavities, metal boxes along the length of a tube. The electron beam first passes through a cavity to which the input signal is applied. The energy of the electron beam amplifies the signal, and the amplified signal is taken from a cavity at the other end of the tube. The output signal can be coupled back into the input cavity to make an electronic oscillator to generate radio waves. The power gain of klystrons can be high, up to 60 dB (an increase in signal power of a factor of one million), with output power up to tens of megawatts, but the bandwidth is narrow, usually a few percent although it can be up to 10% in some devices.

A &quot;reflex klystron&quot; is an obsolete type in which the electron beam was reflected back along its path by a high potential electrode, used as an oscillator.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;klystron&quot; comes from the Greek verb κλύζω (&quot;klyzo&quot;) referring to the action of waves breaking against a shore, and the suffix -τρον (&quot;tron&quot;) meaning the place where the action happens. The name &quot;klystron&quot; was suggested by Hermann Fränkel, a professor in the classics department at Stanford University when the klystron was under development.

==History==
The klystron was the first significantly powerful source of radio waves in the microwave range; before its invention the only sources were the Barkhausen–Kurz tube and split-anode magnetron, which were limited to very low power. It was invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford University. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937. Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on radar equipment. The Varians went on to found Varian Associates to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small linear accelerators to generate photons for external beam radiation therapy). Their work was preceded by the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and Oskar Heil (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils&#x27; work.

The work of physicist W. W. Hansen was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper. His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator). During the Second World War, Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from Sperry Gyroscope Company on Long Island. His resonator was called a &quot;rhumbatron&quot; by the Varian brothers. Hansen died of beryllium disease in 1949 as a result of exposure to beryllium oxide (BeO).

During the Second World War, the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the cavity magnetron for much shorter-wavelength centimetric microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as synchrotrons and radar systems, have since been developed.

Right after the war, AT&amp;T used 4-watt klystrons in its brand new network of microwave relay links that covered the contiguous United States . The network provided long-distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. Western Union Telegraph Company also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers. In some applications Klystrons have been replaced by solid state transistors. High efficiency Klystrons have been developed with have 10% more effiency than conventional Klystrons.

== Operation ==
Klystrons amplify RF signals by converting the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. In a vacuum, a beam of electrons is emitted by an electron gun or thermionic cathode and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). 

This beam passes through an input cavity resonator. RF energy has been fed into the input cavity at, or near, its resonant frequency, creating standing waves, which produce an oscillating voltage, which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to &quot;bunch&quot;: electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated, causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency.

To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional &quot;buncher&quot; cavities.

The beam then passes through a &quot;drift&quot; tube, in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the &quot;bunches&quot;, then through a &quot;catcher&quot; cavity.

In the output &quot;catcher&quot; cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons&#x27; motion, decelerating them. Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a coaxial cable or waveguide.

The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.

To make an oscillator, the output cavity can be coupled to the input cavity(s) with a coaxial cable or waveguide. Positive feedback excites spontaneous oscillations at the resonant frequency of the cavities.

==Two-cavity klystron==
The simplest klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron. In this tube there are two microwave cavity resonators, the &quot;catcher&quot; and the &quot;buncher&quot;. When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified is applied to the buncher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.

At one end of the tube is the hot cathode which produces electrons when heated by a filament. The electrons are attracted to and pass through an anode cylinder at a high positive potential; the cathode and anode act as an electron gun to produce a high velocity stream of electrons. An external electromagnet winding creates a longitudinal magnetic field along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.

The beam first passes through the &quot;buncher&quot; cavity resonator, through grids attached to each side. The buncher grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity&#x27;s resonant frequency applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide. The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal. Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field in the same direction as their motion, and are accelerated by the field. Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.

Beyond the buncher grids is a space called the &quot;drift space&quot;. This space is long enough so that the accelerated electrons catch up with electrons that were decelerated at an earlier time, forming &quot;bunches&quot; longitudinally along the beam axis. Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.

The electrons then pass through a second cavity, called the &quot;catcher&quot;, through a similar pair of grids on each side of the cavity. The function of the &quot;catcher grids&quot; is to absorb energy from the electron beam. The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity. Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion. The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their kinetic energy is converted to electric potential energy, increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity. Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity. The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.

After passing through the catcher and giving up its energy, the lower energy electron beam is absorbed by a &quot;collector&quot; electrode, a second anode which is kept at a small positive voltage.

===Klystron oscillator===
An electronic oscillator can be made from a klystron tube, by providing a feedback path from output to input by connecting the &quot;catcher&quot; and &quot;buncher&quot; cavities with a coaxial cable or waveguide. When the device is turned on, electronic noise in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again. Because of the high Q of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the resonant frequency of the cavities.

==Multicavity klystron==
In all modern klystrons, the number of cavities exceeds two. Additional &quot;buncher&quot; cavities added between the first &quot;buncher&quot; and the &quot;catcher&quot; may be used to increase the gain of the klystron or to increase the bandwidth.

The residual kinetic energy in the electron beam when it hits the collector electrode represents wasted energy, which is dissipated as heat, which must be removed by a cooling system. Some modern klystrons include depressed collectors, which recover energy from the beam before collecting the electrons, increasing efficiency. Multistage depressed collectors enhance the energy recovery by &quot;sorting&quot; the electrons in energy bins.

==Reflex klystron==

The reflex klystron (also known as a Sutton tube after one of its inventors, Robert Sutton) was a low power klystron tube with a single cavity, which functioned as an oscillator. It was used as a local oscillator in some radar receivers and a modulator in microwave transmitters in the 1950s and 1960s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.

In the reflex klystron the electron beam passes through a single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into one end of the tube by an electron gun. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected. The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The voltage on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the RF oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in frequency modulation for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.
There are often several regions of reflector voltage where the reflex klystron will oscillate; these are referred to as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex klystron is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power points—the points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.

Modern semiconductor technology has effectively replaced the reflex klystron in most applications.

== Gyroklystron ==

The gyroklystron is a microwave amplifier with operation dependent on the cyclotron resonance condition.
Similarly to the klystron, its operation depends on the modulation of the electron beam, but instead of axial bunching the modulation forces alter the cyclotron frequency and hence the azimuthal component of motion, resulting in phase bunches. In the output cavity, electrons which arrive at the correct decelerating phase transfer their energy to the cavity field and the amplified signal can be coupled out. 

The gyroklystron has cylindrical or coaxial cavities and operates with transverse electric field modes. Since the interaction depends on the resonance condition, larger cavity dimensions than a conventional klystron can be used. This allows the gyroklystron to deliver high power at very high frequencies which is challenging using conventional klystrons.

== Tuning ==
Some klystrons have cavities that are tunable. By adjusting the frequency of individual cavities, the technician can change the operating frequency, gain, output power, or bandwidth of the amplifier. No two klystrons are exactly identical (even when comparing like part/model number klystrons). Each unit has manufacturer-supplied calibration values for its specific performance characteristics. Without this information the klystron would not be properly tunable, and hence not perform well, if at all.

Tuning a klystron is delicate work which, if not done properly, can cause damage to equipment or injury to the technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician must be careful not to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent magnets. If a technician uses ferrous tools (which are ferromagnetic) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (or rather very weakly diamagnetic) tools made of beryllium alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.

Precautions are routinely taken when transporting klystron devices in aircraft, as the intense magnetic field can interfere with magnetic navigation equipment. Special overpacks are designed to help limit this field &quot;in the field,&quot; and thus allow such devices to be transported safely.

==Optical klystron==
The technique of amplification used in the klystron is also being applied experimentally at optical frequencies in a type of laser called the free-electron laser (FEL); these devices are called &quot;optical klystrons&quot;. Instead of microwave cavities, these use devices called undulators. The electron beam passes through an undulator, in which a laser light beam causes bunching of the electrons. Then the beam passes through a second undulator, in which the electron bunches cause oscillation to create a second, more powerful light beam.

==Floating drift tube klystron==
The floating drift tube klystron has a single cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, this is similar to the two cavity oscillator klystron with considerable feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.

==Applications==
Klystrons can produce far higher microwave power outputs than solid state microwave devices such as Gunn diodes. In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the CloudSat satellite). Klystrons can be found at work in radar, satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in television broadcasting and EHF satellite terminals), medicine (radiation oncology), and high-energy physics (particle accelerators and experimental reactors). At SLAC, for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50 MW (pulse) and 50 kW (time-averaged) at 2856 MHz. The Arecibo Planetary Radar used two klystrons that provided a total power output of 1 MW (continuous) at 2380 MHz.

&quot;Popular Science&quot;″s &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New 2007&quot; described a company, Global Resource Corporation, currently defunct, using a klystron to convert the hydrocarbons in everyday materials, automotive waste, coal, oil shale, and oil sands into natural gas and diesel fuel.
