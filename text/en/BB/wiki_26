<text>Isotretinoin, also known as 13-&quot;cis&quot;-retinoic acid and sold under the brand name Accutane among others, is a medication used to treat skin diseases like harlequin-type ichthyosis, and lamellar ichthyosis, and severe cystic acne or moderate acne that is unresponsive to antibiotics. Isotretinoin is used off-label to treat basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, although clinical evidence suggests it is not effective in this setting. It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its isomer, tretinoin, is also an acne drug.

The most common adverse effects are dry lips (cheilitis), dry and fragile skin (xeroderma), dry eyes and an increased susceptibility to sunburn. Uncommon and rare side effects include muscle aches and pains (myalgias), and headaches. Some of those side effects can persist long after the discontinuation of the use of the drug. Isotretinoin may cause liver failure, therefore the patient&#x27;s blood levels should be regularly tested. It is known to cause birth defects due to in-utero exposure because of the molecule&#x27;s close resemblance to retinoic acid, a natural vitamin A derivative that controls normal embryonic development. It is associated with psychiatric side effects, most commonly depression but also, more rarely, psychosis and unusual behaviors. Other rare side effects include hyperostosis and premature epiphyseal closure, which have been reported to be persistent.
Isotretinoin was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1982. In 2021, it was the 264th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
== Medical uses ==
Isotretinoin is used primarily for persistent cystic acne. Many dermatologists also support its use for treatment of lesser degrees of acne that prove resistant to other treatments, or that produce scarring or psychological distress. Isotretinoin is not indicated for the treatment of prepubertal acne and is not recommended in children less than 12 years of age.

It is also somewhat effective for hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe rosacea. It can also be used to help treat harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and is used in xeroderma pigmentosum cases to relieve keratoses. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma in Japan, but data for its efficacy is not conclusive and it has not been approved in other countries.

Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore proven effective against genital warts in experimental use but is rarely used for this indication as there are more effective treatments. Isotretinoin may represent an efficacious and safe alternative systemic form of therapy for recalcitrant condylomata acuminata (RCA) of the cervix. In most countries, this therapy is currently unapproved and only used if other therapies fail.

=== Prescribing restrictions ===
Isotretinoin is a teratogen; there is about a 20–35% risk for congenital defects in infants exposed to the drug &quot;in utero&quot;, and about 30–60% of children exposed to isotretinoin prenatally have been reported to show neurocognitive impairment. Because of this risk, there are strict controls prescribing isotretinoin to women who have potential to become (or be) pregnant while taking isotretinoin and many are strongly advised to terminate their pregnancies because of the 20-60% risk. Isotretinoin is also not recommended for use by breastfeeding women.

In the United States, since March 2006, the dispensing of isotretinoin is run through the iPLEDGE program, under the direction of the Food and Drug Administration. Prescribers, pharmacists, and all people to whom the drug is prescribed need to register on the site and log information into it. Women with child-bearing potential must commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for the duration of isotretinoin therapy and for a month immediately preceding and a month immediately following therapy. Additionally, they must have two negative pregnancy tests 30 days apart and have negative pregnancy tests before each prescription is written.

In most countries, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by dermatologists or specialist physicians; some countries also allow limited prescriptions by general practitioners and family doctors. In the United Kingdom and Australia, isotretinoin may be prescribed only by or under the supervision of a consultant dermatologist. Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious. In New Zealand, isotretinoin can be prescribed by any doctor but subsidized only when prescribed by a vocationally-registered general practitioner, dermatologist or nurse practitioner.

== Adverse effects ==
Increasingly higher dosages will result in higher toxicity, resembling vitamin A toxicity. Adverse effects include:

===Possible permanent effects===
The effects of isotretinoin may be permanent. This has been proposed to be due to induction of apoptosis in sebaceous glands, meibomian glands, neuroblastoma cells, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells, Dalton&#x27;s lymphoma ascites cells, B16F-10 melanoma cells, neuronal crest cells, stem cells and others, that it changes epigenetics and shortens telomeres.

Isotretinoin may stop long bone growth in young people who are still growing. Premature epiphyseal closure can occur in people receiving recommended doses of Accutane.

Isotretinoin is known to cause meibomian gland dysfunction which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of the cells of the exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some people after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy, although most cases of decreased night vision appear to resolve after discontinuing the medication.

=== Sexual ===
Isotretinoin is also associated with permanent sexual side effects, namely erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. In October 2017, the UK MHRA issued a Drug Safety Update to physicians in response to reports of these problems. This was in response to an EU review, published in August 2017, which states that a plausible physiological explanation of these side effects &quot;may be a reduction in plasma testosterone&quot;. The review also stated that &quot;the product information should be updated to include ‘sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction and decreased libido’ as an undesirable effect with an unknown frequency&quot;. There have also been reports of spermatogenesis disorders, such as oligospermia. 27 cases of sexual dysfunction report either negative dechallenge or positive dechallenge.

=== Skin ===
The most common side effects are mucocutaneous: dry lips, skin, and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness of the skin (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (pruritus) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all people who take it.

Regular use of lip balm and moisturizer is recommended throughout treatment to reduce these problems. The dose may need to be decreased to reduce the severity of these side effects. The skin becomes more fragile—especially to frictional forces—and may not heal as quickly as normal. Wound healing is delayed. For this reason, elective surgery, waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, dermabrasion, exfoliation, etc., are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin.

=== Teratogenicity ===
Isotretinoin is a teratogen highly likely to cause birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception. A few of the more common birth defects this drug can cause are hearing and visual impairment, missing or malformed earlobes, facial dysmorphism, and abnormalities in brain function. Isotretinoin is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category X and ADEC Category X, and use is contraindicated in pregnancy. In the EU, isotretinoin (oral) is contraindicated in pregnancy and must not be taken by women able to have children unless the conditions of a pregnancy prevention program are met.

The manufacturer recommends pregnancy be ruled out two weeks before commencement of isotretinoin, and women should use two simultaneous forms of effective contraception at least one month before commencement, during, and for at least one month following isotretinoin therapy.

In the US, around 2000 women became pregnant while taking the drug between 1982 and 2000, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. About 160 babies with birth defects were born. After the FDA put the more strict iPLEDGE program in place for the companies marketing the drug in the US, in 2011, 155 pregnancies occurred (0.12%) among 129,544 women of childbearing potential taking isotretinoin.

People taking isotretinoin are not permitted to donate blood during and for at least one month after discontinuation of therapy due to its teratogenicity.

===Psychological effects===
Rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies, irritable mood, and anxiety. Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. In a total of 5577 adverse reactions reported to the UK&#x27;s MHRA up to 31 March 2017, the plurality (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects. There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of suicide and 43 of suicide attempts.

Isotretinoin decreases the brain metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex by an average of 21%, a brain area known to mediate symptoms of depression.

The association between isotretinoin use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use. Several studies have been conducted since then of the drug&#x27;s effect on depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects.

==== Depression and suicidality ====
Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the FDA&#x27;s top 10 list of drugs associated with depression and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts. A black box warning for suicide, depression, and psychosis has been present on isotretinoin&#x27;s packaging in the United States since 2005. In March 2018, European Medicines Agency issued a warning on a possible risk of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and mood changes) following the use of oral retinoids, including isotretinoin, though the limitations of the available data did not allow them to establish whether this risk was due to the use of retinoids.

A Swedish retrospective cohort study with 5756 patients showed a significantly increased risk of attempted suicides from 6 months after the treatment to around 2 years after the treatment.

In 2012, a systematic review covering all articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression, and suicide, as well as articles related to class effect, dose-response, and biological plausibility found that the literature reviewed was consistent with an association of isotretinoin administration and depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals. Following this systematic review, in a 2014 review a group of Australian dermatologists and psychiatrists collaborated on a set of recommendations for safe prescribing of isotretinoin. However, whether isotretinoin use is causally associated with mental illness remains controversial.

Evidence for depression being causally associated with isotretinoin use includes 41 reports of positive challenge/dechallenge/rechallenge with isotretinoin, involving administering isotretinoin, withdrawing the drug, and then re-administering it. The majority of these cases had no psychiatric history. There is also a temporal relationship between the development of depression and initiation of isotretinoin treatment, with most cases developing after 1–2 months of treatment. Further, higher doses of isotretinoin increase the risk of developing depression, with 25% of people showing depression on a dose of 3 mg/kg/day as compared with 3–4% at normal doses. Studies have uncovered several biological processes which may credibly explain the affective changes induced by isotretinoin.

==== Psychosis ====
Isotretinoin has also been linked to psychosis. Many of the side effects of isotretinoin mimic hypervitaminosis A, which has been associated with psychotic symptoms. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and psychosis suggests that an increase in dopaminergic stimulation or sensitivity in the limbic system causes psychotic symptoms.

It has been suggested that dysregulation of retinoid receptors by retinoids such as isotretinoin may cause schizophrenia. The evidence for this is threefold: transcriptional activation of the dopamine D2 receptor – in addition to serotonin and glutamate receptors – is regulated by retinoic acid; schizophrenia and the retinoid cascade have been linked to the same gene loci; and retinoid dysfunction causes congenital anomalies identical to those observed in people with schizophrenia. Further, the expression of dopamine receptors has indeed been shown to be regulated by retinoic acid.

=== Musculoskeletal ===
Isotretinoin has a number of muscoloskeletal effects. Myalgia (muscular pain) and arthralgia (joint pain) are common side effects. Retinoids, such as high dose etretinate, are well known to cause bone changes, the most common type of which is hyperostotic changes (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents. While excessive bone growth has been raised as a possible side effect of isotretinoin, a 2006 review found little evidence for this. Other problems include premature epiphyseal closure and calcification of tendons and ligaments. The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage, and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using X-ray imaging.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Isotretinoin may cause non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The drug is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—ulcerative colitis, but not Crohn&#x27;s disease. There are also reports of people developing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and worsening of existing IBS.

=== Eyes ===
Isotretinoin and other retinoids are well known to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during treatment and is caused by isotretinoin&#x27;s apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some people develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some people, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances.

==Pharmacology==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Isotretinoin&#x27;s exact mechanism of action is unknown, but several studies have shown that isotretinoin induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.

One study suggests the drug amplifies production of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in the skin, which has been shown to reduce sebum production by inducing apoptosis in sebaceous gland cells, while exhibiting an antimicrobial effect on &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;. The drug decreases the size and sebum output of the sebaceous glands. Isotretinoin is the only available acne drug that affects all four major pathogenic processes in acne, which distinguishes it from alternative treatments (such as antibiotics) and accounts for its efficacy in severe, nodulocystic cases. The effect of isotretinoin on sebum production can be temporary, or remission of the disease can be &quot;complete and prolonged.&quot;

Isotretinoin has been speculated to down-regulate the enzyme telomerase and hTERT, inhibiting &quot;cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis.&quot; In a 2007 study, isotretinoin was proven to inhibit the action of the metalloprotease MMP-9 (gelatinase) in sebum without any influence in the action of TIMP1 and TIMP2 (the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases). It is already known that metalloproteases play an important role in the pathogenesis of acne.

==== CNS activities ====
A possible biological basis for the case reports of depression involves decreased metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of the frontal lobe. It has also been found that decreased OFC metabolism was correlated with headaches. People reporting headache as a side effect often report comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression; a statistically significant relationship between headache and depression has been established. It is suggested that people sensitive to isotretinoin-induced CNS effects may also be susceptible to other psychiatric side effects such as depression.

Studies in mice and rats have found that retinoids, including isotretinoin, bind to dopaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. Isotretinoin may affect dopaminergic neurotransmission by disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity. The dopaminergic system is implicated in numerous psychological disorders, including depression. Isotretinoin is also thought to affect the serotonergic system – it increases expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the pre-synaptic neuron, which inhibit serotonin secretion. Isotretinoin also, directly and indirectly, increases the translation of the serotonin transporter protein (SERT), leading to increased reuptake and consequently reduced synaptic availability of serotonin.

Inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis may also play a role in the development of isotretinoin-induced depression. A further effect of isotretinoin on the brain involves retinoic acid function in the hypothalamus, the hormone regulatory centre of the brain and part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, a key part of the body&#x27;s stress response. Other brain regions regulated by retinoic acid and potentially disrupted by isotretinoin include the frontal cortex and the striatum.

=== Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ===
Oral isotretinoin is best absorbed when taken with a high-fat meal because it has a high level of lipophilicity. The efficacy of isotretinoin doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to isotretinoin&#x27;s molecular relationship to vitamin A, it should not be taken with vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. Accutane also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed (&#x27;mini-pill&#x27;) progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol (&#x27;OrthoNovum 7/7/7&#x27;), St. John&#x27;s Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids.

Isotretinoin is primarily (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Three metabolites of isotretinoin are detectable in human plasma after oral administration: 4-&quot;oxo&quot;-isotretinoin, retinoid acid (tretinoin), and 4-&quot;oxo&quot;-retinoic acid (4-&quot;oxo&quot;-tretinoin). Isotretinoin also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-&quot;oxo&quot;-isotretinoin—which forms its geometric isomer 4-&quot;oxo&quot;-tretinoin. After an orally administered 80 mg dose of liquid suspension 14C-isotretinoin, 14C-activity in blood declines with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and its conjugates are then excreted in the subject&#x27;s urine and faeces in relatively equal amounts. After a single, 80 mg oral dose of Isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean ±SD elimination half-life (t1/2) of isotretinoin and 4-&quot;oxo&quot;-isotretinoin were 21.0 ± 8.2 hours and 24.0 ± 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.90 to 5.43 in people with cystic acne.

== History ==
The compound 13-cis retinoic acid was first studied in the 1960s at Roche Laboratories in Switzerland by Werner Bollag as a treatment for skin cancer. Experiments completed in 1971 showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer but, surprisingly, that it could be useful to treat acne. However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around thalidomide, Roche abandoned the product. In 1979, an article was published reporting the drug&#x27;s effectiveness as a treatment of cystic and conglobate acne on fourteen patients, thirteen of which experienced complete clearing of their disease. In clinical trials, subjects were carefully screened to avoid including women who were or might become pregnant. Roche&#x27;s New Drug Application for isotretinoin for the treatment of acne included data showing that the drug caused birth defects in rabbits. The FDA approved the application in 1982.

Scientists involved in the clinical trials published articles warning of birth defects at the same time the drug was launched in the US, but isotretinoin was taken up quickly and widely, both among dermatologists and general practitioners. Cases of birth defects showed up in the first year, leading the FDA to begin publishing case reports and to Roche sending warning letters to doctors and placing warning stickers on drug bottles, and including stronger warnings on the label. Lawsuits against Roche started to be filed. In 1983 the FDA&#x27;s advisory committee was convened and recommended stronger measures, which the FDA took and were at that time unprecedented: warning blood banks not to accept blood from people taking the drug and adding a warning to the label advising women to start taking contraceptives a month before starting the drug. However, the use of the drug continued to grow, as did the number of babies born with birth defects. In 1985 the label was updated to include a boxed warning. In early 1988 the FDA called for another advisory committee, and FDA employees prepared an internal memo estimating that around 1,000 babies had been born with birth defects due to isotretinoin, that up to around 1,000 miscarriages had been caused, and that between 5,000 and 7,000 women had had abortions due to isotretinoin. The memo was leaked to &quot;The New York Times&quot; a few days before the meeting, leading to a storm of media attention. In the committee meeting, dermatologists and Roche each argued to keep the drug on the market but to increase education efforts; pediatricians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) argued to withdraw the drug from the market. The committee recommended restricting physicians who could prescribe the drug and requiring a second opinion before it could be prescribed. The FDA, believing it did not have authority under the law to restrict who had the right to prescribe the drug, kept the drug on the market but took further unprecedented measures: it required Roche to make warnings yet more visible and graphic, provide doctors with informed consent forms to be used when prescribing the drug, and to conduct follow up studies to test whether the measures were reducing exposure of pregnant women to the drug. Roche implemented those measures, and offered to pay for contraception counseling and pregnancy testing for women prescribed the drug; the program was called the &quot;Pregnancy Prevention Program&quot;.

A CDC report published in 2000, showed problems with the Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed that the increase in prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the &quot;Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program&quot; and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken. In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage Accutane Related Teratogenicity) that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give people after they have confirmed a negative pregnancy test; prescriptions could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription.

In February 2002, Roche&#x27;s patents for isotretinoin expired, and there are now many other companies selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On 29 June 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their Accutane brand in the United States due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with the high cost of defending personal injury lawsuits brought by some people who took the drug. Roche USA continues to defend Accutane and claims to have treated over 13million people since its introduction in 1982. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. apparently will continue to manufacture and distribute Roaccutane outside of the United States.

Among others, actor James Marshall sued Roche over allegedly Accutane-related disease that resulted in the removal of his colon. The jury, however, decided that James Marshall had a pre-existing bowel disease.

Several trials over inflammatory bowel disease claims have been held in the United States, with many of them resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments against the makers of isotretinoin.

<text>Wolf–Rayet stars, often abbreviated as WR stars, are a rare heterogeneous set of stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad emission lines of ionised helium and highly ionised nitrogen or carbon. The spectra indicate very high surface enhancement of heavy elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar winds. The surface temperatures of known Wolf–Rayet stars range from 20,000 K to around 210,000 K, hotter than almost all other kinds of stars. They were previously called W-type stars referring to their spectral classification.

Classic (or population I) Wolf–Rayet stars are evolved, massive stars that have completely lost their outer hydrogen and are fusing helium or heavier elements in the core. A subset of the population I WR stars show hydrogen lines in their spectra and are known as WNh stars; they are young extremely massive stars still fusing hydrogen at the core, with helium and nitrogen exposed at the surface by strong mixing and radiation-driven mass loss. A separate group of stars with WR spectra are the central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe), post-asymptotic giant branch stars that were similar to the Sun while on the main sequence, but have now ceased fusion and shed their atmospheres to reveal a bare carbon-oxygen core.

All Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects due to their high temperatures—thousands of times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun () for the CSPNe, for the population I WR stars, to for the WNh stars—although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their radiation output is in the ultraviolet.

The naked-eye star systems γ Velorum and θ Muscae both contain Wolf-Rayet stars, and two of the most massive known stars, BAT99-98 and R136a1 in 30 Doradus, are also Wolf–Rayet stars.

==Observation history==

In 1867, using the 40 cm Foucault telescope at the Paris Observatory, astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet
discovered three stars in the constellation Cygnus (HD 191765, HD 192103 and HD 192641, now designated as WR 134, WR 135, and WR 137 respectively) that displayed broad emission bands on an otherwise continuous spectrum.
Most stars only display absorption lines or bands in their spectra, as a result of overlying elements absorbing light energy at specific frequencies, so these were clearly unusual objects.

The nature of the emission bands in the spectra of a Wolf–Rayet star remained a mystery for several decades. E.C. Pickering theorized that the lines were caused by an unusual state of hydrogen, and it was found that this &quot;Pickering series&quot; of lines followed a pattern similar to the Balmer series when half-integer quantum numbers were substituted. It was later shown that these lines resulted from the presence of helium, the chemical element having just been discovered in 1868.
Pickering noted similarities between Wolf–Rayet spectra and nebular spectra, and this similarity led to the conclusion that some or all Wolf–Rayet stars were the central stars of planetary nebulae.

By 1929, the width of the emission bands was being attributed to Doppler broadening, and hence the gas surrounding these stars must be moving with velocities of 300–2400 km/s along the line of sight. The conclusion was that a Wolf–Rayet star is continually ejecting gas into space, producing an expanding envelope of nebulous gas. The force ejecting the gas at the high velocities observed is radiation pressure.
It was well known that many stars with Wolf–Rayet type spectra were the central stars of planetary nebulae, but also that many were not associated with an obvious planetary nebula or any visible nebulosity at all.

In addition to helium, Carlyle Smith Beals identified emission lines of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen in the spectra of Wolf–Rayet stars.
In 1938, the International Astronomical Union classified the spectra of Wolf–Rayet stars into types WN and WC, depending on whether the spectrum was dominated by lines of nitrogen or carbon-oxygen respectively.

In 1969, several CSPNe with strong oxygen (O) emissions lines were grouped under a new &quot;O sequence&quot;, or just OVI type. Similar stars not associated with planetary nebulae were described shortly after and the WO classification was adopted for them. The OVI stars were subsequently classified as [WO] stars, consistent with the population I WR stars.
The understanding that certain late, and sometimes not-so-late, WN stars with hydrogen lines in their spectra are at a different stage of evolution from hydrogen-free WR stars has led to the introduction of the term &quot;WNh&quot; to distinguish these stars generally from other WN stars. They were previously referred to as WNL stars, although there are late-type WN stars without hydrogen as well as WR stars with hydrogen as early as WN5.

==Classification==

Wolf–Rayet stars were named on the basis of the strong broad emission lines in their spectra, identified with helium, nitrogen, carbon, silicon, and oxygen, but with hydrogen lines usually weak or absent. Initially simply referred to as class W or W-type stars, the classification was then split into stars with dominant lines of ionised nitrogen (N, N, and N) and those with dominant lines of ionised carbon (C and C) and sometimes oxygen (O – O), referred to as WN and WC respectively.
The two classes WN and WC were further split into temperature sequences WN5–WN8 and WC6–WC8 based on the relative strengths of the 541.1 nm He and 587.5 nm He lines. Wolf–Rayet emission lines frequently have a broadened absorption wing (P Cygni profile) suggesting circumstellar material. A WO sequence has also been separated from the WC sequence for even hotter stars where emission of ionised oxygen dominates that of ionised carbon, although the actual proportions of those elements in the stars are likely to be comparable. WC and WO spectra are formally distinguished based on the presence or absence of C emission. WC spectra also generally lack the O lines that are strong in WO spectra.

The WN spectral sequence was expanded to include WN2–WN9, and the definitions refined based on the relative strengths of the N lines at 463.4–464.1 nm and 531.4 nm, the N lines at 347.9–348.4 nm and 405.8 nm, and the N lines at 460.3 nm, 461.9 nm, and 493.3–494.4 nm.
These lines are well separated from areas of strong and variable He emission and the line strengths are well correlated with temperature. Stars with spectra intermediate between WN and Ofpe have been classified as WN10 and WN11 although this nomenclature is not universally accepted.

The type WN1 was proposed for stars with neither N nor N lines, to accommodate Brey 1 and Brey 66 which appeared to be intermediate between WN2 and WN2.5.
The relative line strengths and widths for each WN sub-class were later quantified, and the ratio between the 541.1 nm He and 587.5 nm, He lines was introduced as the primary indicator of the ionisation level and hence of the spectral sub-class. The need for WN1 disappeared and both Brey 1 and Brey 66 are now classified as WN3b. The somewhat obscure WN2.5 and WN4.5 classes were dropped.

The WC spectral sequence was expanded to include WC4–WC11, although some older papers have also used WC1–WC3. The primary emission lines used to distinguish the WC sub-types are C 426.7 nm, C at 569.6 nm, C 465.0 nm, C at 580.1–581.2 nm, and the O (and O) blend at 557.2–559.8 nm. The sequence was extended to include WC10 and WC11, and the subclass criteria were quantified based primarily on the relative strengths of carbon lines to rely on ionisation factors even if there were abundance variations between carbon and oxygen.

For WO-type stars the main lines used are C at 580.1 nm, O at 340.0 nm, O (and O) blend at 557.2–559.8 nm, O at 381.1–383.4 nm, O at 567.0 nm, and O at 606.8 nm. The sequence was expanded to include WO5 and quantified based the relative strengths of the O/C and O/O lines.
A later scheme, designed for consistency across classical WR stars and CSPNe, returned to the WO1 to WO4 sequence and adjusted the divisions.

Detailed modern studies of Wolf–Rayet stars can identify additional spectral features, indicated by suffixes to the main spectral classification:
* h for hydrogen emission;
* ha for hydrogen emission and absorption;
* o for no hydrogen emission;
* w for weak lines;
* s for strong lines;
* b for broad strong lines;
* d for dust (occasionally vd, pd, or ed for variable, periodic, or episodic dust).

The classification of Wolf–Rayet spectra is complicated by the frequent association of the stars with dense nebulosity, dust clouds, or binary companions. A suffix of &quot;+OB&quot; is used to indicate the presence of absorption lines in the spectrum likely to be associated with a more normal companion star, or &quot;+abs&quot; for absorption lines with an unknown origin.

The hotter WR spectral sub-classes are described as early and the cooler ones as late, consistent with other spectral types. WNE and WCE refer to early type spectra while WNL and WCL refer to late type spectra, with the dividing line approximately at sub-class six or seven. There is no such thing as a late WO-type star. There is a strong tendency for WNE stars to be hydrogen-poor while the spectra of WNL stars frequently include hydrogen lines.

Spectral types for the central stars of planetary nebulae are qualified by surrounding them with square brackets (e.g. [WC4]). They are almost all of the WC sequence with the known [WO] stars representing the hot extension of the carbon sequence. There are also a small number of [WN] and [WC/WN] types, only discovered quite recently.
Their formation mechanism is as yet unclear. Temperatures of the planetary nebula central stars tend to the extremes when compared to population I WR stars, so [WC2] and [WC3] are common and the sequence has been extended to [WC12]. The [WC11] and [WC12] types have distinctive spectra with narrow emission lines and no He and C lines.
Certain supernovae observed before their peak brightness show WR spectra.
This is due to the nature of the supernova at this point: a rapidly expanding helium-rich ejecta similar to an extreme Wolf–Rayet wind. The WR spectral features only last a matter of hours, the high ionisation features fading by maximum to leave only weak neutral hydrogen and helium emission, before being replaced with a traditional supernova spectrum. It has been proposed to label these spectral types with an &quot;X&quot;, for example XWN5(h). Similarly, classical novae develop spectra consisting of broad emission bands similar to a Wolf–Rayet star. This is caused by the same physical mechanism: rapid expansion of dense gases around an extremely hot central source.

==Slash stars==
The separation of Wolf–Rayet stars from spectral class O stars of a similar temperature depends on the existence of strong emission lines of ionised helium, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, but there are a number of stars with intermediate or confusing spectral features. For example, high-luminosity O stars can develop helium and nitrogen in their spectra with some emission lines, while some WR stars have hydrogen lines, weak emission, and even absorption components. These stars have been given spectral types such as O3If∗/WN6 and are referred to as slash stars.

Class O supergiants can develop emission lines of helium and nitrogen, or emission components to some absorption lines. These are indicated by spectral peculiarity suffix codes specific to this type of star:
* f for N and He emission
* f* for N and He emission with N stronger than N
* f+ for emission in Si in addition to N and He
* parentheses indicating He absorption lines instead of emission, e.g. (f)
* double parentheses indicating strong He absorption and N emission diluted, e.g. ((f+))

These codes may also be combined with more general spectral type qualifiers such as p or a. Common combinations include OIafpe and OIf*, and Ofpe. In the 1970s, it was recognised that there was a continuum of spectra from pure absorption class O to unambiguous WR types, and it was unclear whether some intermediate stars should be given a spectral type such as O8Iafpe or WN8-a. The slash notation was proposed to deal with these situations, and the star Sk−67°22 was assigned the spectral type O3If*/WN6-A. The criteria for distinguishing OIf*, OIf*/WN, and WN stars have been refined for consistency. Slash star classifications are used when the Hβ line has a P Cygni profile; this is an absorption line in O supergiants and an emission line in WN stars. Criteria for the following slash star spectral types are given, using the nitrogen emission lines at 463.4–464.1 nm, 405.8 nm, and 460.3–462.0 nm, together with a standard star for each type:
Another set of slash star spectral types is in use for Ofpe/WN stars. These stars have O supergiant spectra plus nitrogen and helium emission, and P Cygni profiles. Alternatively they can be considered to be WN stars with unusually low ionisation levels and hydrogen. The slash notation for these stars was controversial and an alternative was to extend the WR nitrogen sequence to WN10 and WN11 Other authors preferred to use the WNha notation, for example WN9ha for WR 108. A recent recommendation is to use an O spectral type such as O8Iaf if the 447.1 nm He line is in absorption and a WR class of WN9h or WN9ha if the line has a P Cygni profile. However, the Ofpe/WN slash notation as well as WN10 and WN11 classifications continue to be widely used.

A third group of stars with spectra containing features of both O class stars and WR stars has been identified. Nine stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud have spectra that contain both WN3 and O3V features, but do not appear to be binaries. Many of the WR stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud also have very early WN spectra plus high excitation absorption features. It has been suggested that these could be a missing link leading to classical WN stars or the result of tidal stripping by a low-mass companion.

==Nomenclature==

The first three Wolf–Rayet stars to be identified, coincidentally all with hot O-class companions, had already been numbered in the Henry Draper catalogue. These stars and others were referred to as Wolf–Rayet stars from their initial discovery but specific naming conventions for them would not be created until 1962 in the &quot;fourth&quot; catalogue of galactic Wolf–Rayet stars. The first three catalogues were not specifically lists of Wolf–Rayet stars and they used only existing nomenclature. 

The fourth catalogue of Wolf-Rayet stars numbered them sequentially in order of right ascension. The fifth catalogue used the same numbers prefixed with MR after the author of the fourth catalogue, plus an additional sequence of numbers prefixed with LS for new discoveries. Neither of these numbering schemes remains in common use.
=== Modern WR catalogues ===
The sixth Catalogue of Galactic Wolf–Rayet stars was the first to actually bear that name, as well as to describe the previous five catalogues by that name. It also introduced the WR numbers widely used ever since for galactic WR stars. These are again a numerical sequence from WR 1 to WR 158 in order of right ascension. 

Compiled in 2001, the seventh catalogue and its annex used the same numbering scheme and inserted new stars into the sequence using lower case letter suffixes, for example WR 102ka for one of the numerous WR stars discovered in the galactic centre. Modern high volume identification surveys use their own numbering schemes for the large numbers of new discoveries. A 2006 Annex was added to the seventh catalog. 

In 2011, an online Galactic Wolf Rayet Catalogue was set up, hosted by the University of Sheffield. As of January 2025, it includes 679 stars.

=== Other numbering schemes ===
Wolf–Rayet stars in external galaxies are numbered using different schemes. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, the most widespread and complete nomenclature for WR stars is from &quot;The Fourth Catalogue of Population I Wolf–Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud&quot; prefixed by , for example . Many of these stars are also referred to by their third catalogue number, for example Brey 77. As of 2018, 154 WR stars are catalogued in the LMC, mostly WN but including about twenty-three WCs as well as three of the extremely rare WO class. Many of these stars are often referred to by their RMC (Radcliffe observatory Magellanic Cloud) numbers, frequently abbreviated to just R, for example R136a1.

In the Small Magellanic Cloud SMC WR numbers are used, usually referred to as AB numbers, for example AB7. There are only twelve known WR stars in the SMC, a very low number thought to be due to the low metallicity of that galaxy

In 2012, an IAU working group expanded the numbering system from the Catalogue of Galactic Wolf–Rayet stars so that additional discoveries are given the closest existing WR number plus a numeric suffix in order of discovery. This applies to all discoveries since the 2006 annex, although some of these have already been named under the previous nomenclature; thus WR 42e is now numbered WR 42-1.

==Properties==
Wolf–Rayet stars are a normal stage in the evolution of very massive stars, in which strong, broad emission lines of helium and nitrogen (&quot;WN&quot; sequence), carbon (&quot;WC&quot; sequence), and oxygen (&quot;WO&quot; sequence) are visible. Due to their strong emission lines they can be identified in nearby galaxies. About 600 Wolf–Rayets have been catalogued in our own Milky Way Galaxy. This number has changed dramatically during the last few years as the result of photometric and spectroscopic surveys in the near-infrared dedicated to discovering this kind of object in the Galactic plane. It is expected that there are fewer than 1,000 WR stars in the rest of the Local Group galaxies, with around 166 known in the Magellanic Clouds, 206 in the Triangulum Galaxy, and 154 in the Andromeda Galaxy. 

Outside the local group, whole galaxy surveys have found thousands more WR stars and candidates. For example, in the M101 Group, over a thousand potential WR stars have been detected, from magnitude 21 to 25, and astronomers hope to eventually catalog over ten thousand. These stars are expected to be particularly common in the Wolf–Rayet galaxies named after them and in starburst galaxies.

Their characteristic emission lines are formed in the extended and dense high-velocity wind region enveloping the very hot stellar photosphere, which produces a flood of UV radiation that causes fluorescence in the line-forming wind region. This ejection process uncovers in succession, first the nitrogen-rich products of CNO cycle burning of hydrogen (WN stars), and later the carbon-rich layer due to He burning (WC and WO-type stars).

It can be seen that the WNh stars are completely different objects from the WN stars without hydrogen. Despite the similar spectra, they are much more massive, much larger, and some of the most luminous stars known. They have been detected as early as WN5h in the Magellanic Clouds. The nitrogen seen in the spectrum of WNh stars is still the product of CNO cycle fusion in the core, but it appears at the surface of the most massive stars due to rotational and convectional mixing while still in the core hydrogen burning phase, rather than after the outer envelope is lost during core helium fusion.

Some Wolf–Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (&quot;WC&quot;), especially those belonging to the latest types, are noticeable due to their production of dust. Usually this takes place on those belonging to binary systems as a product of the collision of the stellar winds forming the pair, as is the case of the famous binary WR 104; however this process occurs on single ones too.

A few – roughly 10% – of the central stars of planetary nebulae, despite their much lower masses – typically ~0.6 &quot;M&quot;☉ – are also observationally of the WR-type; i.e. they show emission line spectra with broad lines from helium, carbon and oxygen. Denoted [WR], they are much older objects descended from evolved low-mass stars and are closely related to white dwarfs, rather than to the very young, very massive population I stars that comprise the bulk of the WR class. These are now generally excluded from the class denoted as Wolf–Rayet stars, or referred to as Wolf–Rayet-type stars.

===Metallicity===
The numbers and properties of Wolf–Rayet stars vary with the chemical composition of their progenitor stars. A primary driver of this difference is the rate of mass loss at different levels of metallicity. Higher metallicity leads to high mass loss, which affects the evolution of massive stars and also the properties of Wolf–Rayet stars. Higher levels of mass loss cause stars to lose their outer layers before an iron core develops and collapses, so that the more massive red supergiants evolve back to hotter temperatures before exploding as a supernova, and the most massive stars never become red supergiants. In the Wolf–Rayet stage, higher mass loss leads to stronger depletion of the layers outside the convective core, lower hydrogen surface abundances and more rapid stripping of helium to produce a WC spectrum.

These trends can be observed in the various galaxies of the local group, where metallicity varies from near-solar levels in the Milky Way, somewhat lower in M31, lower still in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and much lower in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Strong metallicity variations are seen across individual galaxies, with M33 and the Milky Way showing higher metallicities closer to the centre, and M31 showing higher metallicity in the disk than in the halo. Thus the SMC is seen to have few WR stars compared to its stellar formation rate and no WC stars at all (one star has a WO spectral type), the Milky Way has roughly equal numbers of WN and WC stars and a large total number of WR stars, and the other main galaxies have somewhat fewer WR stars and more WN than WC types. LMC, and especially SMC, Wolf–Rayets have weaker emission and a tendency to higher atmospheric hydrogen fractions. SMC WR stars almost universally show some hydrogen and even absorption lines even at the earliest spectral types, due to weaker winds not entirely masking the photosphere.

The maximum mass of a main-sequence star that can evolve through a red supergiant phase and back to a WNL star is calculated to be around in the Milky Way, in the LMC, and in the SMC. The more evolved WNE and WC stages are only reached by stars with an initial mass over at near-solar metallicity, in the LMC. Normal single star evolution is not expected to produce any WNE or WC stars at SMC metallicity.

===Rotation===

Mass loss is influenced by a star&#x27;s rotation rate, especially strongly at low metallicity. Fast rotation contributes to mixing of core fusion products through the rest of the star, enhancing surface abundances of heavy elements, and driving mass loss. Rotation causes stars to remain on the main sequence longer than non-rotating stars, evolve more quickly away from the red supergiant phase, or even evolve directly from the main sequence to hotter temperatures for very high masses, high metallicity or very rapid rotation.

Stellar mass loss produces a loss of angular momentum and this quickly brakes the rotation of massive stars. Very massive stars at near-solar metallicity should be braked almost to a standstill while still on the main sequence, while at SMC metallicity they can continue to rotate rapidly even at the highest observed masses. Rapid rotation of massive stars may account for the unexpected properties and numbers of SMC WR stars, for example their relatively high temperatures and luminosities.

===Binaries===
Massive stars in binary systems can develop into Wolf–Rayet stars due to stripping by a companion rather than inherent mass loss due to a stellar wind. This process is relatively insensitive to the metallicity or rotation of the individual stars and is expected to produce a consistent set of WR stars across all the local group galaxies. As a result, the fraction of WR stars produced through the binary channel, and therefore the number of WR stars observed to be in binaries, should be higher in low metallicity environments. Calculations suggest that the binary fraction of WR stars observed in the SMC should be as high as 98%, although less than half are actually observed to have a massive companion. The binary fraction in the Milky Way is around 20%, in line with theoretical calculations.

==Nebulae==
A significant proportion of WR stars are surrounded by nebulosity associated directly with the star, not just the normal background nebulosity associated with any massive star forming region, and not a planetary nebula formed by a post-AGB star. The nebulosity presents a variety of forms and classification has been difficult. Many were originally catalogued as planetary nebulae and sometimes only a careful multi-wavelength study can distinguish a planetary nebula around a low mass post-AGB star from a similarly shaped nebula around a more massive core helium-burning star.

==Wolf–Rayet galaxies==

A Wolf–Rayet galaxy is a type of starburst galaxy where a sufficient number of WR stars exist that their characteristic emission line spectra become visible in the overall spectrum of the galaxy. Specifically a broad emission feature due to the 468.6 nm He and nearby spectral lines is the defining characteristic of a Wolf–Rayet galaxy. The relatively short lifetime of WR stars means that the starbursts in such galaxies must have occurred within the last few million years, and must have lasted less than a million years or else the WR emission would be swamped by large numbers of other luminous stars.

==Evolution==
Theories about how WR stars form, develop, and die have been slow to form compared to the explanation of less extreme stellar evolution. They are rare, distant, and often obscured, and even into the 21st century many aspects of their lives are unclear.

===History===
Although Wolf–Rayet stars have been clearly identified as an unusual and distinctive class of stars since the 19th century,
the nature of these stars was uncertain until towards the end of the 20th century. Before the 1960s, even the classification of WR stars was highly uncertain, and their nature and evolution was essentially unknown. The very similar appearance of the central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) and the much more luminous classical WR stars contributed to the uncertainty.

By about 1960, the distinction between CSPNe and massive luminous classical WR stars was more clear. Studies showed that they were small dense stars surrounded by extensive circumstellar material, but not yet clear whether the material was expelled from the star or contracting onto it.
The unusual abundances of nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, as well as the lack of hydrogen, were recognised, but the reasons remained obscure.
It was recognised that WR stars were very young and very rare, but it was still open to debate whether they were evolving towards or away from the main sequence.

By the 1980s, WR stars were accepted as the descendants of massive OB stars, although their exact evolutionary state in relation to the main sequence and other evolved massive stars was still unknown.
Theories that the preponderance of WR stars in massive binaries and their lack of hydrogen could be due to gravitational stripping had been largely ignored or abandoned.
WR stars were being proposed as possible progenitors of supernovae, and particularly the newly-discovered type Ib supernovae, lacking hydrogen but apparently associated with young massive stars.

By the start of the 21st century, WR stars were largely accepted as massive stars that had exhausted their core hydrogen, left the main sequence, and expelled most of their atmospheres, leaving behind a small hot core of helium and heavier fusion products.

===Current models===

Most WR stars, the classical population I type, are now understood as being a natural stage in the evolution of the most massive stars (not counting the less common planetary nebula central stars), either after a period as a red supergiant, after a period as a blue supergiant, or directly from the most massive main-sequence stars. Only the lower mass red supergiants are expected to explode as a supernova at that stage, while more massive red supergiants progress back to hotter temperatures as they expel their atmospheres. Some explode while at the yellow hypergiant or LBV stage, but many become Wolf–Rayet stars.
They have lost or burnt almost all of their hydrogen and are now fusing helium in their cores, or heavier elements for a very brief period at the end of their lives.

Massive main-sequence stars create a very hot core which fuses hydrogen very rapidly via the CNO process and results in strong convection throughout the whole star. This causes mixing of helium to the surface, a process that is enhanced by rotation, possibly by differential rotation where the core is spun up to a faster rotation than the surface. Such stars also show nitrogen enhancement at the surface at a very young age, caused by changes in the proportions of carbon and nitrogen due to the CNO cycle. The enhancement of heavy elements in the atmosphere, as well as increases in luminosity, create strong stellar winds which are the source of the emission line spectra. These stars develop an Of spectrum, Of* if they are sufficiently hot, which develops into a WNh spectrum as the stellar winds increase further. This explains the high mass and luminosity of the WNh stars, which are still burning hydrogen at the core and have lost little of their initial mass. These will eventually expand into blue supergiants (LBVs?) as hydrogen at the core becomes depleted, or if mixing is efficient enough (e.g. through rapid rotation) they may progress directly to WN stars without hydrogen.

WR stars are likely to end their lives violently rather than fade away to a white dwarf. Thus every star with an initial mass more than about 9 times the Sun would inevitably result in a supernova explosion (with the exception of direct collapse), many of them from the WR stage.

A simple progression of WR stars from low to hot temperatures, resulting finally in WO-type stars, is not supported by observation. WO-type stars are extremely rare and all the known examples are more luminous and more massive than the relatively common WC stars. Alternative theories suggest either that the WO-type stars are only formed from the most massive main-sequence stars, and/or that they form an extremely short-lived end stage of just a few thousand years before exploding, with the WC phase corresponding to the core helium burning phase and the WO phase to nuclear burning stages beyond. It is still unclear whether the WO spectrum is purely the result of ionisation effects at very high temperature, reflects an actual chemical abundance difference, or if both effects occur to varying degrees.

Key:
* O: O-type main-sequence star
* Of: evolved O-type showing N and He emission
* BSG: blue supergiant
* RSG: red supergiant
* YHG: yellow hypergiant
* LBV: luminous blue variable
* WNh: WN plus hydrogen lines
* WNL: &quot;late&quot; WN-class Wolf–Rayet star (about WN6 to WN11)
* WNE: &quot;early&quot; WN-class Wolf–Rayet star (about WN2 to WN6)
* WN/WC: Transitional (transitioning from WN to WC) Wolf–Rayet star (may be WN#/WCE or WC#/WN)
* WC: WC-class Wolf–Rayet star
* WO: WO-class Wolf–Rayet star

Wolf–Rayet stars form from massive stars, although the evolved population I stars have lost half or more of their initial masses by the time they show a WR appearance. For example, γ2 Velorum A currently has a mass around 9 times the Sun, but began with a mass at least 40 times the Sun. High-mass stars are very rare, both because they form less often and because they have short lives. This means that Wolf–Rayet stars themselves are extremely rare because they only form from the most massive main-sequence stars and because they are a relatively short-lived phase in the lives of those stars. This also explains why type Ib/c supernovae are less common than type II, since they result from higher-mass stars.

WNh stars, spectroscopically similar but actually a much less evolved star which has only just started to expel its atmosphere, are an exception and still retain much of their initial mass. The most massive stars currently known are all WNh stars rather than O-type main-sequence stars, an expected situation because such stars show helium and nitrogen at the surface only a few thousand years after they form, possibly before they become visible through the surrounding gas cloud. An alternative explanation is that these stars are so massive that they could not form as normal main-sequence stars, instead being the result of mergers of less extreme stars.

The difficulties of modelling the observed numbers and types of Wolf–Rayet stars through single star evolution have led to theories that they form through binary interactions which could accelerate loss of the outer layers of a star through mass exchange. WR 122 is a potential example that has a flat disk of gas encircling the star, almost 2 trillion miles wide, and may have a companion star that stripped its outer envelope.

===Supernovae===

It is widely suspected that many type Ib and type Ic supernova progenitors are WR stars, although no conclusive identification has been made of such a progenitor.

Type Ib supernovae lack hydrogen lines in their spectra. The more common type Ic supernovae lack both hydrogen and helium lines in their spectra. The expected progenitors for such supernova are massive stars that respectively lack hydrogen in their outer layers, or lack both hydrogen and helium. WR stars are just such objects. All WR stars lack hydrogen and in some WR stars, most notably the WO group, helium is also strongly depleted. WR stars are expected to experience core collapse when they have generated an iron core, and resulting supernova explosions would be of type Ib or Ic. In some cases it is possible that direct collapse of the core to a black hole would not produce a visible explosion.

WR stars are very luminous due to their high temperatures but not visually bright, especially the hottest examples that are expected to make up most supernova progenitors. Theory suggests that the progenitors of type Ibc supernovae observed to date would not be bright enough to be detected, although they place constraints on the properties of those progenitors. A possible progenitor star which has disappeared at the location of supernova iPTF13bvn may be a single WR star, although other analyses favour a less massive binary system with a stripped star or helium giant. The only other possible WR supernova progenitor is for SN 2017ein, and again it is uncertain whether the progenitor is a single massive WR star or binary system.

In 2022 astronomers from the Gran Telescopio Canarias reported the first supernova explosion of a Wolf–Rayet star. SN 2019hgp was a type Icn supernova and is also the first in which the element neon has been detected.

==Examples==

By far the most visible example of a Wolf–Rayet star is γ2 Velorum (WR 11), which is a bright naked eye star for those located south of 40 degrees northern latitude, although most of the light comes from an O7.5 giant companion. Due to the exotic nature of its spectrum (bright emission lines in lieu of dark absorption lines) it is dubbed the &quot;Spectral Gem of the Southern Skies&quot;. The only other Wolf–Rayet star brighter than magnitude 6 is θ Muscae (WR 48), a triple star with two O class companions. Both are WC stars. The &quot;ex&quot; WR star WR 79a (HR 6272) is brighter than magnitude 6 but is now considered to be a peculiar O8 supergiant with strong emission. The next brightest at magnitude 6.4 is WR 22, a massive binary with a WN7h primary.

The most massive and most luminous star currently known, R136a1, is also a Wolf–Rayet star of the WNh type that is still fusing hydrogen in its core. This type of star, which includes many of the most luminous and most massive stars, is very young and usually found only in the centre of the densest star clusters. Occasionally a runaway WNh star such as VFTS 682 is found outside such clusters, probably having been ejected from a multiple system or by interaction with other stars.

An example of a triple star system containing a Wolf–Rayet binary is Apep. It releases huge amounts of carbon dust driven by their extreme stellar winds. As the two stars orbit one another, the dust gets wrapped into a glowing sooty tail.

All of the very hottest non-degenerate stars (the hottest few) are Wolf–Rayet stars, the hottest of which being WR 102, which seems to be as hot as 210,000 K, followed by WR 142 which is around 200,000 K in temperature. LMC195-1, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, should have a similar temperature, but at the moment this temperature is unknown.
HD 45166 has been described as the most magnetic massive star known and as the first magnetic known Wolf-Rayet star.

Only a minority of planetary nebulae have WR type central stars, but a considerable number of well-known planetary nebulae do have them.

<text>Catenaccio () or The Chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence. In Italian, &quot;catenaccio&quot; means &quot;door-bolt&quot;, which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence focused on nullifying opponents&#x27; attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities.

==History==
===Predecessors and influences===
Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot; was influenced by the &quot;verrou&quot; (also &quot;doorbolt&quot; or &quot;chain&quot; in French) system invented by Austrian coach Karl Rappan. As coach of Switzerland in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive sweeper called the &quot;verrouilleur&quot;, positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper. Rappan&#x27;s &quot;verrou&quot; system, proposed in 1932, when he was coach of Servette, was essentially a modification of the 2–3–5 system, and in some ways resembled the modern 4–4–2 or 4–3–3 formations; his system implemented with four defenders, three of which were fielded in a fixed role playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus an attacking centre-half, who would also act as a playmaker, in the middle of the field, who played the ball together with two midfield wings. The system was essentially a 1–3–3–3 formation, with the &quot;verouiller&quot; as the last player in front of the goalkeeper, and with the two outside forwards or wingers functioning as forwards high up the pitch, keeping possession of the ball and always looking to cross the ball to the central striker making runs into the box or looking to find a pass to the most forward midfielder making a run in behind the opposing defense from the midfield. (with the right winger sitting slightly further back), but who would often drop off into deeper midfield roles when possession was lost. The team would often sit back and defend during matches, which enabled them to overcome stronger teams or physically fitter opponents successfully. In his 2009 book &quot;Inverting the Pyramid&quot;, Jonathan Wilson notes that the: &quot;&quot;verrou&quot; [...] is best understood as a development from the old 2–3–5 [...]. Rather than the centre-half dropping in between the two full-backs, as in the W-M, the two wing-halves fell back to flank them. They retained an attacking role, but their primary function was to combat the opposition wingers. The two full-backs then became in effect central defenders, playing initially almost alongside each other, although in practice, if the opposition attacked down their right, the left of the two would move towards the ball, with the right covering just behind, and vice versa. In theory, that always left them with a spare man–the &quot;verouller&quot; as the Swiss press of the time called him or the &quot;libro&quot; as he would become–at the back.&quot; Wilson notes that a weakness of the &quot;verrou&quot; system was that it placed excessive demands on the centre-half, as the player deployed in this role was required to attack and act as a playmaker when on the ball, while instead dropping back into the defence, acting almost as a centre-back, off the ball. However, with this system, Rappan won two league titles with Servette, and five more with Grasshopper, after joining the club in 1935.

During his time with Soviet club Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev in the 1940s, Alexander Kuzmich Abramov also used a similar defensive tactic known as the &quot;Volzhskaya Zashchepka&quot;, or the &quot;Volga Clip.&quot; Unlike the &quot;verrou&quot;, his system was not as flexible, and was a development of the 3–2–5 or &quot;WM&quot;, rather than the 2–3–5, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs, essentially acting as a sweeper.

In Spain, starting in the 1940s and reaching great success in the 1950s, Helenio Herrera developed an early version of his 1960s &quot;catenaccio.&quot; With Atlético Madrid (1949–1953), he won two consecutive league titles with a defence nicknamed &quot;the Iron Curtain&quot;. He kept on developing his system later on in other Spanish clubs until reaching his well-known 5–3–2 formation when he went years later to Inter in Italy (see below).

Italian &quot;Catenaccio&quot; also has its roots with Mario Villini of Triestina in the 1941 season, Ottavio Barbieri of Spezia in the campionato Alta Italia 1944, and Gipo Viani of Salernitana in the 1948 season. 
&quot;Mezzo sistema&quot; was influenced by Rappan&#x27;s verrou and originated from an idea that one of the club&#x27;s players altered the English WM system – known as the &quot;sistema&quot; in Italy – by having his centre-half-back – known as the &quot;centromediano metodista&quot; or &quot;metodista,&quot; in Italy – retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centre-forward, instead leaving his full-back (which, at the time, was similar to the modern centre-back role) free to function as what was essentially a sweeper, or &quot;libero&quot; (&quot;free,&quot; in Italian).
Although this ultra-defensive strategy was initially criticised by members of the Italian press, including journalist Gianni Brera, Andrea Schianchi of &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man–to–man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.

In the 1946 season Ottavio Barbieri introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as Genoa&#x27;s manager. He was influenced by Rappan&#x27;s &quot;verrou&quot;, and made several alterations to the English WM system or &quot;sistema&quot;, which led to his system being described as &quot;mezzosistema&quot;. Gipo Viani, after him, called this &quot;Vianema&quot;. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a &quot;terzino volante&quot; (or &quot;vagante&quot;, as noted at the time by former footballer and &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; journalist Renzo De Vecchi); the latter position was essentially a &quot;libero&quot;. The team&#x27;s midfield played in a triangular shape, with the centre-half-back or &quot;metodista&quot; fielded in front of the back-line. His formation also made use of three forwards in attacking trident, but the right-sided winger was also tasked with assisting the midfield defensively, and therefore acted in the manner of a right-sided wide midfielder, known as the &quot;tornante&quot; in Italian football.

===Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot;===
In the late 1950s, Nereo Rocco&#x27;s Padova pioneered a modified catenaccio tactics in Italy where it would be used again by other Italian teams throughout the 1960s; his strategy was initially also known as the &quot;mezzosistema&quot;, as, like the &quot;vianema&quot;, it modified elements of the &quot;sistema&quot;. Rocco&#x27;s tactic, often referred to as the real &quot;Catenaccio&quot;, was shown first in 1947 with Triestina: the most common mode of operation was a 1–3–3–3 formation with a strictly defensive team approach, while his team would look to score by starting quick counter-attacks with long balls after winning back possession. With catenaccio, Triestina finished the Serie A tournament in a surprising second place. Some variations include 1–4–4–1 and 1–4–3–2 formations. He later had great success with Milan using the catenaccio system during the 60s and 70s, winning several titles, including two Serie A titles, three Coppa Italia titles, two European Cups, two European Cup Winners&#x27; Cups, and an Intercontinental Cup.

Alfredo Foni also used the &quot;catenaccio&quot; tactic successfully with Inter during the early 1950s; unlike Rocco, however, the teams&#x27;s strong defensive play off the ball did not limit the offensive manner in which his team played while in possession of the ball. In his system, his team&#x27;s right winger, Gino Armano, would drop back to mark the opposing team&#x27;s left winger (essentially acting as a &quot;tornante&quot;), allowing Ivano Blason, the right-back, to shift across and act as a sweeper and clear balls away. Blason also played as a sweeper under Rocco; as such, he is often considered to be the first true sweeper in Italian football.

The key innovation of &quot;Catenaccio&quot; was the introduction of the role of a libero (&quot;free&quot;) defender, also called &quot;sweeper&quot;, who was positioned behind a line of three defenders. The sweeper&#x27;s role was to recover loose balls, nullify the opponent&#x27;s striker and double-mark when necessary. Another important innovation was the counter-attack, mainly based on long passes from the defence.

In Helenio Herrera&#x27;s version of &quot;catenaccio&quot; in the 1960s, he used a 5–3–2 formation, in which four man-marking defenders were tightly assigned to the opposing attackers while an extra player, the sweeper, would pick up any loose ball that escaped the coverage of the defenders. The emphasis of this system in Italian football spawned the rise of many top Italian defenders who became known for their hard-tackling and ruthless defending. However, despite the defensive connotations, Herrera claimed shortly before his death that the system was more attacking than people remembered, saying &#x27;the problem is that most of the people who copied me copied me wrongly. They forgot to include the attacking principles that my Catenaccio included. I had Picchi as a sweeper, yes, but I also had Facchetti, the first full back to score as many goals as a forward.&#x27; Indeed, although his &quot;Grande Inter&quot; side were known primarily for their defensive strength, they were equally renowned for their ability to score goals with few touches from fast, sudden counter-attacks, due to Herrera&#x27;s innovative use of attacking, overlapping full-backs. Under Herrera, Inter enjoyed a highly successful spell, which saw them win three Serie A titles, two European Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups.

Manager Ferruccio Valcareggi also used tactics inspired by the Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot; system, which was popularised by Inter manager Herrera during the 1960s, with the Italy national team, employing a sweeper behind two man–marking central defenders and a full-back, as well as a strategy which made use of heavy defending, focussing predominantly on stability, grinding out results while conceding few goals and defending narrow leads; although his tactics were controversial – in particular as during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, he devised his infamous &quot;staffetta&quot; (relay) policy of playing one of his two star playmakers, Sandro Mazzola and Gianni Rivera, in each half, to avoid offsetting the defensive balance within his team – and not particularly exciting, they proved to be effective. Moreover, although at times he drew criticism in the Italian media over Italy&#x27;s dull, slow gameplay and lack of goals, Italy also demonstrated their offensive capabilities throughout the tournament, as well as their technical capabilities, which enabled them to conserve energy and cope with the altitude in Mexico. He had a successful spell as Italy&#x27;s manager, winning UEFA Euro 1968 on home soil, and leading Italy to the 1970 World Cup final. However, in the latter match, Italy suffered a heavy 4–1 defeat to a much more offensive minded and stylish Brazilian side. His team adopted a more attractive playing style in the lead-up to the 1974 World Cup, however, which saw them considered among the favourites to win, but suffered a surprising first-round elimination in the final tournament.

===Decline of &quot;catenaccio&quot; with the advent of &quot;total football&quot;, and the birth of &quot;zona mista&quot;===
Jock Stein&#x27;s Celtic defeated the &quot;catenaccio&quot; system in the 1967 European Cup Final with a highly offensive strategy. They beat Herrera&#x27;s Inter Milan 2–1 on 25 May 1967 creating the blue print for Rinus Michels&#x27; &quot;total football&quot;, a continuation of Stein&#x27;s free flowing attacking football.

&quot;Total Football&quot;, which was invented by Dutch manager Rinus Michels in the 1970s, exposed the weaknesses of the &quot;Catenaccio&quot; system. Unlike previous systems, in &quot;Total Football&quot;, no out–field player is fixed in their nominal role; anyone can assume in the field the duties of an attacker, a midfielder or a defender, depending on the play. Due to players often switching positions with one another, man-marking strategies, such as &quot;catenaccio&quot;, were no longer effective at coping with this fluid system. Despite previously losing out 4–1 to Milan in the 1969 European Cup Final, who were managed by Rocco, a manager known for his defensive catenaccio strategy, in 1972, Michels&#x27; Ajax defeated Inter 2–0 in the European Cup final, and Dutch newspapers announced the &quot;destruction of &quot;Catenaccio&quot;&quot; at the hands of &quot;Total Football&quot;. The following year, Ajax defeated Cesare Maldini&#x27;s Milan 6–0 in the second leg of the European Super Cup, in a match in which the defensive &quot;catenaccio&quot; system employed by Milan was unable to stop Ajax, which saw the Dutch side win the title 6–1 on aggregate; this was the worst defeat for an Italian team in an UEFA competition final.

As man-marking alone was insufficient to cope with the fluidity of &quot;total football&quot;, coaches consequently began to create a new tactical system that mixed man-marking with zonal defence in order to counter this strategy, which came to be known as &quot;zona mista&quot; (&quot;mixed zone,&quot; in Italian), or &quot;gioco all&#x27;italiana&quot; (&quot;gameplay in the Italian manner,&quot; in Italian), in Italian football, as it mixed elements of Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot; (man-marking) with elements of &quot;total football&quot; (zonal marking). Italian manager Giovanni Trapattoni, who had played under Rocco at Milan, and was initially influenced by Rocco&#x27;s &quot;catenaccio&quot; system, was one of the main proponents of this system from the 1970s onwards, and used it to great success.

==Modern use of &quot;catenaccio&quot;==
===Derivative defensive strategies===
Highly defensive structures with little attacking intent – which are colloquially often referred to as &quot;anti-football&quot; or &quot;parking the bus,&quot; and which have been employed at times by managers such as José Mourinho and Diego Simeone – are often arbitrarily and incorrectly labelled as &quot;Catenaccio&quot; by pundits, managers, and players, but this deviates from the original design of the system; while &quot;catenaccio&quot; was similarly an organised system that involved tactical discipline and deep, heavy, and patient defending off – or even behind – the ball, it also made use of now obsolete man-to-man marking, a sweeper, who was tasked with protecting the back-line and also starting plays after winning back possession, as well as employing sudden counter–attacks to score goals.

===Italian football===
Although &quot;Catenaccio&quot; has still come to be associated with the Italy national side and Italian club teams, due to its historic association with Italian football, it is actually used quite infrequently by Serie A and Italy national teams in contemporary football, who instead currently prefer to apply balanced tactics and formations, mostly using the 5–3–2 or 3–5–2 system. For example, under manager Cesare Prandelli, the Italy national team also initially used the 3–5–2 formation, which had been popularised by Juventus manager Antonio Conte throughout the previous Serie A season following his success in the league; although Prandelli used a ball–playing sweeper, he also used attacking wing-backs and a more offensive–minded approach with Italy. In their first two clashes of UEFA Euro 2012 Group C, the system resulted in two 1–1 draws against Spain and Croatia. He subsequently switched to a stylish attacking possession-based system using their &#x27;standard&#x27; 4–4–2 diamond formation for the knockout stages; the switch proved to be effective, as the team went on to reach the final, where they suffered defeat to a similarly more offensive-minded Spain side, who used a possession–based strategy based on passing known as &quot;tiki-taka&quot;. Rob Smyth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was critical of Spain&#x27;s striker–less formation and particular brand of &quot;tiki-taka&quot; at UEFA Euro 2012, however, believing that the lack of emphasis on the offensive aspect of the game led to fewer goals, and that the team&#x27;s seemingly endless passing and preoccupation with ball–possession was in fact boring, dubbing it &quot;Tiki-takanaccio,&quot; a reference to the defensive–minded &quot;catenaccio&quot; tactical system, despite the fact that &quot;tiki-taka&quot; had ironically originated from the more offensive minded Dutch &quot;total football&quot; strategy. Prandelli did make use of a more organised and defensive 3–4–3 formation against Spain during the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup semi-final, however, attempting to stifle Spain&#x27;s possession game by reducing spaces, and subsequently hitting them on the counter-attack; the system proved to be more effective, as Italy created several opportunities and were only eliminated on penalties following a goalless draw.

Several of Italy&#x27;s previous coaches, such as Cesare Maldini and Giovanni Trapattoni, used elements of &quot;catenaccio&quot; to a greater extent at international level, and both failed to go far in the tournaments in which they took part; under Maldini, Italy lost on penalties to hosts France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals, following a 0–0 draw, while Trapattoni lost early in the second round of the 2002 FIFA World Cup to co-hosts South Korea on a golden goal, and subsequently suffered a first-round elimination at UEFA Euro 2004.

Other Italian managers have often deviated from the &quot;catenaccio&quot; system, despite still employing aspects of the strategy into their gameplay, and maintaining a strong defensive unit. While Dino Zoff&#x27;s 5–2–1–2 system initially largely differed from the more defensive-minded approach of his predecessors who were in charge of the Italy national side, by introducing younger players and adopting a more attractive and offensive-minded approach, he also made use of a sweeper, a tight back-line, and put &quot;Catenaccio&quot; to good use for Italy in the semi-final of UEFA Euro 2000 against co-hosts Netherlands, when the team went down to ten men; despite coming under criticism in the media for his defensive playing style during the match, following a penalty shoot-out victory after a 0–0 draw, he secured a place in the final. In the final, Italy only lost on the golden goal rule to France.

Previously, Azeglio Vicini, on the other hand, had led Italy to the semi-finals of both UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup, on home soil, thanks to a more attractive, offensive-minded possession based system, which was combined with a solid back-line and elements of the Italian &quot;zona mista&quot; (&quot;mixed zone,&quot; in Italian) approach (or &quot;Gioco all&#x27;Italiana&quot;), which was a cross between zonal marking and man-marking systems, such as &quot;catenaccio&quot;. Despite their more aggressive attacking approach under Vicini during the latter tournament, Italy initially struggled in the first round, before recovering their form in the knock-out stages, and produced small wins in five hard-fought games against defensive sides, in which they scored little but risked even less, totalling only seven goals for and none against leading up to the semi-finals of the competition. Italy would then lose a tight semi-final on penalties following a 1–1 draw with Argentina, due in no small part to a more defensive strategy from Carlos Bilardo, who then went on to lose the final 1–0 to a much more offensive-minded Germany side led by manager Franz Beckenbauer. Italy then claimed the bronze medal match with a 2–1 victory over England.

Vicini&#x27;s successor as the Italy national side&#x27;s manager, Arrigo Sacchi, also attempted to introduce his more attacking–minded tactical philosophy, which had been highly successful with Milan, to the Italy national team; his tactics, which were inspired by Dutch &quot;total football&quot;, made use of an aggressive high-pressing system, which used a 4–4–2 formation, an attractive, fast, attacking, and possession-based playing style, and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high defensive line playing the offside trap, which largely deviated from previous systems in Italian football, despite still maintaining defensive solidity. Italy initially struggled to replicate the system successfully, however, and encountered mixed results: under Sacchi, Italy reached the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup after a slow start, only to lose on penalties following a 0–0 draw with a defensive–minded Brazilian side, but later also suffered a first-round exit at Euro 1996.

Previously, at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, Enzo Bearzot&#x27;s Italian side also often adopted an attractive, offensive-minded possession game based on passing, creativity, movement, attacking flair, and technique, due to the individual skill of his players; the front three would also often change positions with one another, in order to disorient the opposing defenders. Italy finished the tournament in fourth place, a result they replicated two years later at UEFA Euro 1980 on home soil. At the 1982 FIFA World Cup, he instead adopted a more flexible and balanced tactical approach, which was based on the &quot;zona mista&quot; system, and which used a fluid 4–3–3 formation, with Gaetano Scirea as a sweeper, who held both defensive and creative duties. While the team were organised and highly effective defensively, they were also capable of getting forward and scoring from quick counter-attacks, or keeping possession when necessary. The system proved to be highly effective as Italy went on to win the title. Bearzot&#x27;s Italy side were also known for their solidity, aggression, and defensive strength, possessing a number of hard–tackling players in their team, such as midfielder Marco Tardelli, and defenders Claudio Gentile and Giuseppe Bergomi. Gentile, who served as the team&#x27;s &quot;stopper&quot;, or man-marking centre-back, gained a degree of infamy in the media for his highly physical man-marking of Diego Maradona in Italy&#x27;s second-round match against Argentina; although controversial, the strategy proved to be effective as Gentile essentially nullified the Argentine playmaker&#x27;s impact on the game, with Italy winning the match 2–1.

Similarly, although Italy successfully used a more offensive-minded approach under manager Marcello Lippi during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which saw a record ten of the team&#x27;s 23 players find the back of the net, with the side scoring 12 goals in total as they went on to claim the title, the team&#x27;s organised back-line only conceded two goals, neither of which came in open play. Notwithstanding their more attacking minded playing style throughout the tournament, when Italy was reduced to ten men in the 50th minute of the 2nd round match against Australia, following Marco Materazzi&#x27;s red card, coach Lippi changed the Italians&#x27; formation to a defensive orientation which caused the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to note that &quot;the timidity of Italy&#x27;s approach had made it seem that Helenio Herrera, the high priest of &quot;Catenaccio&quot;, had taken possession of the soul of Marcello Lippi.&quot; The ten-man team was playing with a 4–3–2 scheme, just a midfielder away from the team&#x27;s regular 4–4–2 system. In a tightly-contested match, Italy went on to keep a clean sheet and earned a 1–0 victory through a controversial injury-time penalty. 

During his tenure with the Italy national team, Conte returned to Italy&#x27;s traditional tactical roots, adopting a more organised, defensive-minded, counter-attacking approach, due to the perceived lack of talent in the side at the time, as well as injuries to key players. He used a fluid 3–5–2 formation at UEFA Euro 2016, in which the wide midfielders or wingbacks effectively functioned as wingers in a 3–3–4 formation when attacking, and as fullbacks in a 5–3–2 formation when defending behind the ball. Conte&#x27;s tactics proved to be effective as Italy reached the quarter-finals, only losing out to Germany on penalties. However, despite the team&#x27;s defensive solidity, he refuted claims in the media that the team&#x27;s style of play was based on &quot;catenaccio&quot;, in particular following Italy&#x27;s offensive displays in their 2–0 victory over defending champions Spain in the round of 16.

During Italy&#x27;s victorious UEFA Euro 2020 campaign, Roberto Mancini – who once had a reputation for being a more defensive-minded and pragmatic manager – instead built on the work of Maurizio Viscidi at youth level, as well as Maurizio Sarri, Roberto De Zerbi and Gian Piero Gasperini in Serie A, using a 4–3–3 formation and an attractive, attacking style based on fluid passing in possession – built around the gameplay of the midfield trio of Marco Verratti, Jorginho and Nicolò Barella – and energetic pressing and counterpressing out of possession. En route to winning the title, Mancini&#x27;s side broke the record for most goals scored by an Italian side during a major international tournament.

===Other examples===
However, &quot;Catenaccio&quot; in its purer form has also had its share of success stories in recent years.

German coach Otto Rehhagel used a similarly defensive approach for his Greece side in UEFA Euro 2004, with the team defending deeply behind the ball, and putting pressure on their opponents, while Traianos Dellas operated as a sweeper behind the back-line. Under Rehhagel, Greece surprisingly went on to win the tournament, despite Greece being considered as underdogs prior to the competition. Despite strong emphasis on defence, only one Greek game went into extra time, which the Greeks won with a Golden goal by Traianos Dellas.

Trapattoni himself also successfully employed aspects of the system in securing a Portuguese Liga title with Benfica in 2005 – the club&#x27;s first in 11 years – and had also successfully used elements of the strategy in his &quot;gioco all&#x27;Italiana&quot; or &quot;zona mista&quot; tactical system with several Italian clubs throughout his career, which blended aspects of zonal marking from Dutch total football with aspects of man-marking found in Italian catenaccio.

In contrast to previous editions of the tournament, during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, several teams found success against opponents who dominated possession by adopting a more defensive style and instead maintaining a deep, disciplined, and narrow defensive line, while also looking to score on counter-attacks.

==Legacy==
Although pure &quot;catenaccio&quot; is no longer as commonplace in Italian football, the stereotypical association of ruthless defensive tactics with the Serie A and the Italy national team continues to be perpetuated by foreign media, particularly with the predominantly Italian defences of A.C. Milan of the 1990s and Juventus from the 2010s onwards being in the spotlight. Rob Bagchi wrote in British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Italy has also produced defenders with a surplus of ability, composure and intelligence. For every Gentile there was an Alessandro Nesta.&quot; Critics and foreign footballers who have played in the Serie A have described Italian defenders as being &quot;masters of the dark arts&quot; motivated by a Machiavellian philosophy of winning a game at all costs by cunning and calculating methods. Historian John Foot summed up the mentality: &quot;...the tactics are a combination of subtlety and brutality. [...] The &#x27;tactical foul&#x27; is a way of life for Italian defenders&quot;.

<text>Kopete was a multi-protocol, free software instant messaging client released as part of the KDE Software Compilation. Although it can run in numerous environments, it was designed for and integrates with the KDE Plasma Workspaces. Kopete was started because ICQ blocked Licq from their network in 2001. According to the original author, Duncan Mac-Vicar Prett, the name comes from the Chilean Spanish word &quot;copete&quot;, meaning &quot;a drink with your friends&quot;. Kopete has been nominated for multiple awards. The designated successor is KDE Telepathy from the KDE RTCC Initiative.

== Protocols ==
Kopete allows users to connect to the following protocols:
MSNP (Microsoft Messenger service, commonly known as &quot;MSN&quot;, &quot;.NET&quot;, or &quot;Live&quot;) was also supported until the protocol was discontinued by Microsoft.

== Features ==
== Plugins ==
By default, Kopete supports the following plugins (not all of which are currently functional):
With third-party plugins, Kopete supports:
* Off-the-Record Messaging enabling for encrypted conversations with deniable authentication and perfect forward secrecy.
* Antispam by asking a simple question to unknown contacts.
* OpenPGP cryptography is available from the Debian package &quot;kopete-cryptography&quot;.

<doc id="230000" wikidata="Q940513" url="?curid=230000" title="Rensis Likert">
<text>Rensis Likert ( ; August5, 1903September3, 1981) was an American organizational and social psychologist known for developing the Likert scale, a psychometrically sound scale based on responses to multiple questions. The scale has become a method to measure people&#x27;s thoughts and feelings from opinion surveys to personality tests. Likert also founded the theory of participative management, which is used to engage employees in the workplace. Likert&#x27;s contributions in psychometrics, research samples, and open-ended interviewing have helped form and shape social and organizational psychology.

In 1926, Likert earned a B.A. in Economics and Sociology from the University of Michigan; in 1932 he earned a Ph.D. in Psychology from Columbia University. He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until 1946. During World War II, Likert transitioned to working for the Office of War Information (OWI). At the OWI, he was appointed head of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Morale Division (USSBS) in 1944.

After retiring at the age of 67, he formed Rensis Likert Associates, an institution based on his theories of management in organizational psychology. He is the author of numerous books about management, conflict, and behavioral research applications, including &quot;Human Organization: Its Management and Value&quot; and &quot;New Ways of Managing Conflict&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Rensis Likert was born in 1903 to George Herbert Likert and Cornelia Zonna Adrianna (Cora) Likert in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Influenced by his father, an engineer with the Union Pacific Railroad, Likert studied civil engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for three years. He worked as an intern with the Union Pacific Railroad during the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, which sparked his interest in studying organizational behavior.

At the University of Michigan, Likert switched from studying civil engineering to economics and sociology due to the influence of professor Robert Angell. Likert received a B.A. in sociology in 1926. Upon graduation, he studied at the Union Theological Seminary for a year. He then went on to earn a Ph.D. in psychology at Columbia University in 1932. While studying at Columbia University, he approached the nascent discipline of social psychology. In 1938, he co-authored &quot;Public Opinion and the Individual&quot; with his mentor at Columbia, Gardner Murphy.

On August 31, 1928, Likert married Jane Gibson (editor and consultant) while at Columbia University, having met at the University of Michigan. They had two daughters: Elizabeth David Likert and Patricia Pohlman Likert. In 1969, Likert retired as Director of the Institute for Social Research. The couple moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he formed Rensis Likert Associates. Likert died at 78 years of age on September 3, 1981, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

== Career ==

=== Life Insurance Agency Management Association ===
In 1935, Likert became Director of Research for the Life Insurance Agency Management Association (LIAMA) in Hartford, Connecticut. There, Likert began a research program to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different modes of supervision. The research lead to the development of the three volumes of moral and agency management.

=== United States Department of Agriculture ===
In 1939, Likert was invited by Henry Wallace to organize the Division of Program Surveys (DPS) at the Bureau of Agriculture Statistics (BAS). Its purpose was to gather farmers&#x27; thoughts about USDA-sponsored New Deal programs and to combat the effects of the Great Depression. During World War II, as the director of the Program Surveys Division in the USDA&#x27;s Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), Likert ran surveys for the USDA. But as the war progressed, the division ran program surveys for multiple government agencies, including the Office of War Information, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. In 1943, he developed the first national geographic sampling frame. During the war, Likert recruited other social psychologists into the growing government survey department.

=== The War Effort ===
On December 7, 1941, Likert gained support from the federal government on his program survey. From this the National survey was introduced which helped the federal government make decision on World War II. There were new interviews and sample methods that were the outcome of the program survey through the support of the federal government and other agencies.

=== Institute for Social Research ===
After the end of the war, the Department of Agriculture was forced by Congress to stop its social survey work. Likert and his team (many of them academics on temporary wartime duty) decided to move to a university. They accepted an offer in the summer of 1946 from the University of Michigan to form the Survey Research Center (SRC). In 1949, when Dorwin Cartwright moved the Center for Group Dynamics from MIT to the University of Michigan in 1949, the SRC became the Institute for Social Research (ISR). Likert was the director of the ISR until his retirement in 1970.

=== Rensis Likert Associates ===
Upon retirement, Likert founded Rensis Likert Associates to consult for numerous corporations. He also helped start the Institute for Corporate Productivity. During his tenure at the Institute for Corporate Productivity, Likert devoted particular attention to research on organizations. During the 1960s and 1970s, his books on management theory were closely studied in Japan and their impact can be seen across modern Japanese organizations. He completed research on major corporations around the world, and his studies have accurately predicted the subsequent performance of the corporations.

== Contributions ==

=== Open-ended interviewing ===
Likert contributed to the field of psychometrics by developing open-ended interviewing, a technique used to collect information about a person&#x27;s thoughts, experiences, and preferences. It was common in the 1930s for researchers to use objective, closed-ended questions for the coding process to be valid. While this technique was used well in many domains, Likert saw the need for more opportunities to ask people about their attitudes towards various issues. Within open-ended interviewing, he and his colleagues invented the &quot;funneling technique&quot;, which is a way to keep the interview open for comments, but directed in a specific way. The interview would begin with open-ended questions but gradually move into more narrowed questions. Today, open-ended interviewing is largely used in research studies where there is a need to understand people&#x27;s attitudes.

=== Likert scale ===
Likert is best known for the Likert scale. Likert created the method in 1932 as part of his Ph.D. thesis to identify the extent of a person&#x27;s attitudes and feelings towards international affairs. The Likert scale is used in conducting surveys, with applications to business-related areas such as marketing or customer satisfaction, the social sciences, and attitude-related research projects.

A Likert scale consists of the sum or average of scores from responses to a group of survey questions. These scores are transformed into a scale score through psychometric methods.

==Management systems==
Likert developed his theory of management systems in the 1950s. He outlined a way of describing typical relationships, degree of involvement, and the roles of managers and subordinates in industrial settings. Four clusters of arrangements are identified. These &quot;management systems&quot; are known as:
#Exploitative Authoritative
#Benevolent Authoritative
#Consultative System
#Participative System.

<text>Scratching, sometimes referred to as scrubbing, is a DJ and turntablist technique of moving a vinyl record back and forth on a turntable to produce percussive or rhythmic sounds. A crossfader on a DJ mixer may be used to fade between two records simultaneously.

While scratching is most associated with hip hop music, where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of EDM like techno, trip hop, and house music and rock music such as rap rock, rap metal, rapcore, and nu metal. In hip hop culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ&#x27;s skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the DMC World DJ Championships and IDA (International DJ Association), formerly known as ITF (International Turntablist Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched &quot;hooks&quot; often use portions of other songs. Other music genres such as jazz, pop, and rock have also incorporated scratching.

==History==
===Precursors===

A rudimentary form of turntable manipulation that is related to scratching was developed in the late 1940s by radio music program hosts, disc jockeys (DJs), or the radio program producers who did their own technical operation as audio console operators. It was known as back-cueing, and was used to find the very beginning of the start of a song (i.e., the cue point) on a vinyl record groove. This was done to permit the operator to back the disc up (rotate the record or the turntable platter itself counter-clockwise) in order to permit the turntable to be switched on, and come up to full speed without ruining the first few bars of music with the &quot;wow&quot; of incorrect, unnaturally slow-speed playing. This permitted the announcer to time their remarks, and start the turntable in time for when they wanted the music on the record to begin.

Back cueing was a basic skill that all radio production staff needed to learn, and the dynamics of it were unique to the brand of professional turntable in use at a given radio station. The older, larger and heavier turntables needed a 180-degree backward rotation to allow for run up to full speed; some of the newer 1950s models used aluminum platters and cloth-backed rubber mats which required a third of a rotational turn or less to achieve full speed when the song began. All this was done in order to present a music show on air with the least amount of silence (&quot;alive air&quot;) between music, the announcer&#x27;s patter and recorded advertising commercials. The rationale was that any &quot;dead air&quot; on a radio station was likely to prompt a listener to switch stations, so announcers and program directors instructed DJs and announcers to provide a continuous, seamless stream of sound–from music to an announcer to a pre-recorded commercial, to a &quot;jingle&quot; (radio station theme song), and then immediately back to more music.

Back-cueing was a key function in delivering this seamless stream of music. Radio personnel demanded robust equipment and manufacturers developed special tonearms, styli, cartridges and lightweight turntables to meet these demands.

===Turntablism===


Modern scratching techniques were made possible by the invention of direct-drive turntables, which led to the emergence of turntablism. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for scratching since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear and tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.

In the 1970s, hip hop musicians and club DJs began to use this specialized turntable equipment to move the record back and forth, creating percussive sounds and effects–&quot;scratching&quot;–to entertain their dance floor audiences. Whereas the 1940s–1960s radio DJs had used back-cueing while listening to the sounds through their headphones, without the audience hearing, with scratching, the DJ intentionally lets the audience hear the sounds that are being created by manipulating the record on the turntable, by directing the output from the turntable to a sound reinforcement system so that the audience can hear the sounds. Scratching was developed by early hip hop DJs from New York City such as Grand Wizzard Theodore, who described scratching as, &quot;&quot;nothing&quot; but the back-cueing that you hear in your ear before you push it [the recorded sound] out to the crowd.&quot; He developed the technique when experimenting with the Technics SL-1200, a direct-drive turntable released by Matsushita in 1972 when he found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Afrika Bambaataa made a similar discovery with the SL-1200 in the 1970s. The Technics SL-1200 went on to become the most widely used turntable for the next several decades.

Jamaican-born DJ Kool Herc, who immigrated to New York City, influenced the early development of scratching. Kool Herc developed break-beat DJing, where the breaks of funk songs—being the most danceable part, often featuring percussion—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. He was influenced by Jamaican dub music, and developed his turntable techniques using the Technics SL-1100, released in 1971, due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity.

Although previous artists such as writer and poet William S. Burroughs had experimented with the idea of manipulating a reel-to-reel tape manually to make sounds, as with his 1950s recording, &quot;Sound Piece&quot;), vinyl scratching as an element of hip hop pioneered the idea of making the sound an integral and rhythmic part of music instead of an uncontrolled noise. Scratching is related to &quot;scrubbing&quot; (in terms of audio editing and production) when the reels of an open reel-to-reel tape deck (typically 1/4 inch magnetic audiotape) are gently rotated back and forth while the playback head is live and amplified, to isolate a specific spot on the tape where an editing &quot;cut&quot; is to be made. Today, both scratching and scrubbing can be done on digital audio workstations (DAWs) which are equipped for these techniques.

Christian Marclay was one of the earliest musicians to scratch outside hip hop. In the mid-1970s, Marclay used gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages. He developed his turntable sounds independently of hip hop DJs. Although he is little-known to mainstream audiences, Marclay has been described as &quot;the most influential turntable figure outside hip hop&quot; and the &quot;unwitting inventor of turntablism.&quot;

In 1981 Grandmaster Flash released the song &quot;The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel&quot; which is notable for its use of many DJ scratching techniques. It was the first commercial recording produced entirely using turntables. In 1982, Malcolm McLaren &amp; the World&#x27;s Famous Supreme Team released a single &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;, juxtaposing extensive scratching with calls from square dancing, and, in 1983, the EP, &quot;D&#x27;ya Like Scratchin&#x27;?&quot;, which is entirely focused on scratching. Another 1983 release to prominently feature scratching is Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning single &quot;Rockit&quot;. This song was also performed live at the 1984 Grammy Awards, and in the documentary film &quot;Scratch&quot;, the performance is cited by many 1980s-era DJs as their first exposure to scratching. The Street Sounds Electro compilation series which started in 1983 is also notable for early examples of scratching. Also, a notable piece was &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; by Bill Laswell-Michael Beinhorn band Material, released on 12&quot; single in Japan and containing scratch performed by Grand Mixer DXT, another pioneer of scratching.

== Basic techniques ==

===Vinyl recordings===
Most scratches are produced by rotating a vinyl record on a direct drive turntable rapidly back and forth with the hand with the stylus (&quot;needle&quot;) in the record&#x27;s groove. This produces the distinctive sound that has come to be one of the most recognizable features of hip hop music. Over time with excessive scratching, the stylus will cause what is referred to as &quot;cue burn&quot;, or &quot;record burn&quot;.

The basic equipment setup for scratching includes two turntables and a DJ mixer, which is a small mixer that has a crossfader and cue buttons to allow the DJ to cue up new music in their headphones without the audience hearing. When scratching, this crossfader is utilized in conjunction with the scratching hand that is manipulating the record platter. The hand manipulating the crossfader is used to cut in and out of the record&#x27;s sound.

===Digital vinyl systems===
Using a digital vinyl system (DVS) consists of playing vinyl discs on turntables whose contents are a timecode signal instead of a real music record.
# The turntables&#x27; audio outputs are connected to the audio inputs of a computer audio interface.
# The audio interface digitizes the timecode signal from the turntables and transfers it to the computer&#x27;s DJ software.
# The DJ software uses this data (e.g., about how fast the platter is spinning) to determine the playback status, speed, scratch sound of the hardware turntables, etc., and it duplicates these effects on the digital audio files or computer tracks the DJ is using.
# By manipulating the turntables&#x27; platters, speed controls, and other elements, the DJ thus controls how the computer plays back digitized audio and can therefore produce &quot;scratching&quot; and other turntablism effects on songs which exist as digital audio files or computer tracks.

There is not a single standard of DVS, so each form of DJ software has its own settings. Some DJ software such as Traktor Scratch Pro or Serato Scratch Live supports only the audio interface sold with their software, requiring multiple interfaces for one computer to run multiple programs.

Some digital vinyl systems software include:
*Traktor Scratch Pro
*Cross DVS
*VirtualDJ Pro
*Serato Scratch Live
*M-Audio Torq
*Deckadance
*Xwax

===Non-vinyl scratching===
While some turntablists consider the only true scratching media to be the vinyl disc, there are other ways to scratch, such as:
*Specialized DJ-CD players (CDJ) with jog wheels, allowing the DJ to manipulate a CD as if it were a vinyl record, have become widely available in the 2000s.
*A vinyl emulation is an emulation software, which may be combined with hardware elements, which allows a DJ to manipulate the playback of digital music files on a computer via a DJ control surface (generally MIDI or a HID controller). DJs can scratch, beatmatch, and perform other turntablist operations that cannot be done with a conventional keyboard and mouse. DJ software performing computer scratch operations include Traktor Pro, Mixxx, Serato Scratch Live &amp; Itch, VirtualDJ, M-Audio Torq, DJay, Deckadance, Cross.
*DJs have also used magnetic tape, such as cassette or reel to reel to both mix and scratch. Tape DJing is rare, but Ruthless Ramsey in the US, TJ Scratchavite in Italy and Mr Tape in Latvia use exclusively tape formats to perform.

==Sounds==
Sounds that are frequently scratched include but are not limited to drum beats, horn stabs, spoken word samples, and vocals/lyrics from other songs. Any sound recorded to vinyl can be used, and CD players providing a turntable-like interface allow DJs to scratch not only material that was never released on vinyl, but also field recordings and samples from television and movies that have been burned to CD-R. Some DJs and anonymous collectors release 12-inch singles called battle records that include trademark, novel or hard-to-find scratch &quot;fodder&quot; (material). The most recognizable samples used for scratching are the &quot;Ahh&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot; samples, which originate from the song &quot;Change the Beat&quot; by Fab 5 Freddy.

There are many scratching techniques, which differ in how the movements of the record are combined with opening and closing the crossfader (or another fader or switch, such as a kill switch, where &quot;open&quot; means that the signal is audible, and &quot;closed&quot; means that the signal is inaudible). This terminology is not unique; the following discussion, however, is consistent with the terminology used by DJ QBert on his &quot;Do It Yourself Scratching&quot; DVD.

===Basic techniques===

* Faderless scratches
** Baby scratch - The simplest scratch form, it is performed with the scratching hand only, moving the record back and forth in continuous movements while the crossfader is in the open position.
*** Scribble scratch - The scribble scratch is by rapidly pushing the record back and forth. The crossfader is not used.
*** Drag scratch - Equivalent to the baby and scribble scratch, but done more slowly. The crossfader is not used.
*** Tweak scratch - Performed while the turntable&#x27;s motor is not running. The record platter is set in motion manually, then &quot;tweaked&quot; faster and slower to create a scratch. This scratch form is best performed with long, sustained sounds.
*** Hydrophonic scratch - A baby scratch with a &quot;tear scratch&quot; sound produced by the thumb running in the opposite direction as the fingers used to scratch. This rubbing of the thumb adds a vibrating effect or reverberation to forward movements on the turntable.
** Tear scratch - Tear scratches are scratches where the record is moved in a staggered fashion, dividing the forward and backward movement into two or more movements. This allows creating sounds similar to &quot;flare scratches&quot; without the use of the crossfader and it allows for more complex rhythmic patterns. The term can also refer to a simpler, slower version of the chirp.
*** Orbit scratch - Describes any scratch, most commonly flares, that is repeated during the forward and backward movement of the record. &quot;Orbit&quot; is also used as a shorthand for two-click flares.
* Transformer scratch - with the crossfader closed, the record is moved with the scratching hand while periodically &quot;tapping&quot; the crossfader open and immediately closing it again.
** Forward and backward scratch - The forward scratch, also referred to as scrubbing, is a baby scratch where the crossfader is closed during the backwards movement of the record. If the record is let go instead of being pushed forward it is also called &quot;release scratch&quot; or &quot;drop&quot;. Cutting out the forward part of the record movement instead of the backward part gives a &quot;backward scratch&quot;
* Chirp scratch - The chirp scratch involves closing the crossfader just after playing the start of a sound, stopping the record at the same point, then pushing it back while opening the fader to create a &quot;chirping&quot; sound. When performed using a recording of drums, it can create the illusion of doubled scratching speed, due to the attack created by cutting in the crossfader on the backward movement.
** Flare scratch - Begins with the crossfader open, and then the record is moved while briefly closing the fader one or more times to cut the sound out. This produces a staggering sound which can make a single &quot;flare&quot; sound like a very fast series of &quot;chirps&quot; or &quot;tears.&quot; The number of times the fader is closed (&quot;clicks&quot;) during the record&#x27;s movement is usually used as a prefix to distinguish the variations. The flare allows a DJ to scratch continuously with less hand fatigue than would result from the transformer. The flare can be combined with the crab for an extremely rapid continuous series of scratches.
*** Euro scratch - A variation of the &quot;flare scratch&quot; in which two faders are used simultaneously with one hand to cut the sound much faster. It can also be performed by using only the up fader and the phono line switch to cut the sound.
* Crab scratch - Consists of moving the record while quickly tapping the crossfader open or closed with each finger of the crossfader hand. In this way, DJs are able to perform transforms or flares much faster than they could by manipulating the crossfader with the whole hand. 
** Twiddle scratch - A crab scratch using only the index and middle fingers.

=== Scratch combinations ===
More complex combinations can be generated by grouping elementary crossfader motions (such as the open, close, and tap) into three and four-move sequences. Closing and tapping motions can be followed by opens and taps, and opens can be followed by closes only. 


Note that some sequences of motions ultimately change the direction of the switch, whereas others end in a position such that they can be repeated immediately without having to reset the position of the switch. Sequences that change the direction of the switch can be dovetailed with sequences that change it in the opposite directions to produce repeating patterns, or can be used to transition between open and closed crossfader techniques, such as chirps/flares and transforms, respectively. These crossfader sequences are frequently combined with orbits and tears to produce combination scratches, such as the aquaman scratch, which goes &quot;close-tap-open&quot;.

==Subculture==
While scratching is becoming more and more popular in pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the DJ subculture. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz from San Francisco focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs Q-Bert, Disk &amp; Shortkut and later Mix Master Mike. In July 2000, San Francisco&#x27;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided &quot;the education and development of skratch music literacy&quot;. In 2001, Thud Rumble became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.

In 2004, &quot;Scratch Magazine&quot;, one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and record producers, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known &quot;Tablist&quot; magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an MC at events, and perform club sets.

==Use outside hip hop==
Scratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including pop, rock, jazz, some subgenres of heavy metal (notably nu metal) and some contemporary and avant-garde classical music performances. For recording use, samplers are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record.

DJ Product©1969, formerly of the rap rock band Hed PE, recalled that the punk rock band the Vandals was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching. Product©1969 also recalled the early rap metal band Proper Grounds, which was signed to Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records, as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music.

Guitarist Tom Morello, known for his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, has performed guitar solos that imitate scratching by using the kill switch on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;, in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a crossfader.

Since the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as nu metal, exemplified by Linkin Park, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. Nelly Furtado) and alternative rock (e.g. Incubus). Scratching is also popular in various electronic music styles, such as techno.

<text>Thomas Cubitt (25 February 1788 – 20 December 1855) was a British master builder, notable for his employment in developing many of the historic streets and squares of London, especially in Belgravia, Pimlico and Bloomsbury. His great-great-great-granddaughter is Queen Camilla.

==Background==
The son of a Norfolk carpenter, he journeyed to India as a ship&#x27;s carpenter, from which he earned sufficient funds to start his own building firm in 1810 on Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, London, where he was one of the first builders to have a &#x27;modern&#x27; system of employing all the trades under his own management.

==Work==
Cubitt&#x27;s first major building was the London Institution in Finsbury Circus, built in 1815. After this he worked primarily on speculative housing at Camden Town, Islington, and especially at Highbury Park, Stoke Newington. 

His development of areas of Bloomsbury, including Gordon Square and Tavistock Square, began in 1820, for a group of landowners including the Duke of Bedford.

He was commissioned in 1824 by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, to create a great swathe of building in Belgravia centred on Belgrave Square and Pimlico, in what was to become his greatest achievement in London. Notable amongst this development are the north and west sides of Eaton Square, which exemplify Cubitt&#x27;s style of building and design.
After Cubitt&#x27;s workshops in Thames Bank were destroyed by fire, he remarked &quot;Tell the men they shall be at work within a week, and I will subscribe £600 towards buying them new tools.&quot;

Cubitt was also responsible for the east front of Buckingham Palace. He also built and personally funded nearly a kilometre of the Thames Embankment. He was employed in the large development of Kemp Town in Brighton, and Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, completed in 1851. Cubitt&#x27;s public works included the provision of public parks, including being an organiser of the Battersea Park Scheme. His work outside London includes the country house Polesden Lacey, near Dorking, Surrey, which he rebuilt to largely its present form in the early 1820s.

In 1827 he withdrew from the management of his Gray&#x27;s Inn Road concern leaving this to his brother William Cubitt; the firm of Cubitts still carried out the work of Thomas Cubitt and the change robbed neither partner of the credit for their work.

==Family==
Cubitt had two brothers, the contractor and politician William and the civil engineer Lewis who designed many houses built by Thomas.

Cubitt married Mary Anne Warner (1802–1880), on 25 March 1821 in the church of St Marylebone and they had at least twelve children – Anne (1820), Mary (1821), Emily (1823), George (1828), Sophia (1830), Fanny (1832), William (1834), Lucy (1835), Caroline (1837), Arthur (1840), and twins Thomas and Charles (1842), although five children predeceased their father. George became a politician, created Baron Ashcombe in 1892. Mary, later Mrs Parker, was a botanist whose botanical specimens are held at the Royal Botanica Gardens, Kew.

Thomas through his son, George, is a great-great-great-grandfather of Queen Camilla.

==Legacy==

Cubitt died in 1855 and was taken from Dorking for burial at West Norwood Cemetery on 27 December 1855.

After his death, Queen Victoria said, &quot;In his sphere of life, with the immense business he had in hand, he is a real national loss. A better, kindhearted or more simple, unassuming man never breathed.&quot;

As well as the statue in Denbigh Street, London, another of Cubitt can be seen in Dorking, opposite the Dorking Halls, as he was favoured there for his architecture on his Denbies estate.

In 1883 the business was acquired by Holland &amp; Hannen, a leading competitor, which combination became known as Holland &amp; Hannen and Cubitts, later Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts.

Restaurants, pubs and other places have been named in his honour.

<text>The flying gurnards are a family, Dactylopteridae, of marine fish notable for their greatly enlarged pectoral fins. As they cannot literally fly or glide in the air (like flying fish), an alternative name preferred by some authors is helmet gurnards. They have been regarded as the only family in the suborder Dactylopteroidei of the Scorpaeniformes but more recent molecular classifications put them in the order Syngnathiformes, in the superfamily Centriscoidea. 

They have been observed to &quot;walk&quot; along sandy sea floors while looking for crustaceans, other small invertebrates and small fish by using their pelvic fins. Like the true gurnards (sea robins), to which they may be related, they possess a swim bladder with two lobes and a &quot;drumming muscle&quot; that can beat against the swim bladder to produce sounds. They have heavy, protective scales and the undersides of their huge pectoral fins are brightly coloured, perhaps to startle predators.

Most species are in the Indo-Pacific genus &quot;Dactyloptena&quot;, but the single member of &quot;Dactylopterus&quot; is from warmer parts of the Atlantic. The adults live on the sea bottom, but many species have an extended larval stage, which floats freely in the oceans.

==Taxonomy==
Morphological traits uniting the flying gurnards (Dactylopteridae) and the Syngnathiformes have long been noted. Most authors placed them with the Scorpaeniformes, but DNA sequence data quite consistently support the view that the latter are paraphyletic with the Gasterosteiformes &quot;sensu lato&quot;. Flying gurnards are particularly close to the Aulostomidae (trumpetfish) and Fistulariidae (cornetfish), and would have to be included with these.

<text>NI Railways, also known as Northern Ireland Railways (NIR; and for a brief period Ulster Transport Railways; UTR), is the railway operator in Northern Ireland. NIR is a subsidiary of Translink, whose parent company is the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (NITHCo), and is one of nine publicly owned train operators in the United Kingdom, the others being Direct Rail Services, Caledonian Sleeper, Northern Trains, Transport for Wales Rail, Southeastern, LNER, ScotRail, and TransPennine Express. It has a common Board of Management with the other two companies in the group, Ulsterbus and Metro (formerly Citybus).

The rail network in Northern Ireland is not part of the National Rail network of Great Britain, nor does it use standard gauge, instead using Irish gauge in common with the Republic of Ireland. Also, NIR is the only commercial non-heritage passenger operator in the United Kingdom to operate a vertical integration model, with responsibility of all aspects of the network including running trains, maintaining rolling stock and infrastructure, and pricing. Since the Single European Railway Directive 2012, the company has allowed open access operations by other rail operators, although no operator has started such a service. In 2019, NI Railways carried over 15 million passengers.

NIR jointly runs the Enterprise train service between Belfast and Dublin with Iarnród Éireann. There is no link to the rail system in Great Britain; proposals have been made, but allowances would have to be made for the different rail gauge in use in Britain (standard gauge) and Ireland (Irish gauge).

==History==
From the early 20th century until 1948, the three main railway companies in Northern Ireland were the Great Northern Railway Ireland (GNRI), which had around one half of its network north of the border; the Northern Counties Committee (NCC), owned by the Midland Railway of England and later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS); and the small Belfast and County Down Railway (BCDR). The Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1948 created the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA), which took over the BCDR later that year, followed by the NCC in 1949 as a result of the Ireland Act 1949. In 1958, the GNRI was dissolved and its lines north of the border were also taken over by the UTA. Under the UTA&#x27;s management, the railway network of Northern Ireland shrank from 900 miles (1,450 km) to 225 miles (362 km). The UTA was split into rail and road operations in 1967, and the rail operations were taken over by the present company Northern Ireland Railways (NIR).
Suffering frequent disruption and damage to infrastructure caused by the Troubles and starved of investment by successive political administrations, the NIR network had become badly run down by the 1960s, with old rolling stock and poorly maintained track. NIR&#x27;s last steam locomotives were withdrawn in 1970.
In 1970, NIR re-launched the once-popular &quot;Enterprise&quot; between Dublin and Belfast with three new NIR Class 101 diesel locomotives built by Hunslet in England and Mark 2B carriages built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL). Despite frequent interruptions due to bomb scares, the service has remained a more or less constant feature of the NIR network.

As older trains became obsolete in the 1970s, the Class 80 slam-door diesel-electric multiple unit was introduced. BREL built these units between 1974 and 1977 to British Rail&#x27;s Mark 2 design with some trailer cars rebuilt from hauled stock. The power cars were powered by an English Electric 4SRKT engine, nicknamed &#x27;Thumpers&#x27; due to their characteristic sound, and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. These entered service on the suburban lines around Belfast, becoming a stalwart on the whole network. They remained in service until 2012, latterly primarily on the Larne-Belfast line and the Coleraine-Portrush Line. In the early 1980s, NIR purchased one of the prototype LEV Railbuses built to test the railbus concept. This was intended for the Coleraine-Portrush branch, but was withdrawn due to the capacity constraints of a single car. A plan was mooted to use it on the Lisburn-Antrim line to prevent it from being closed. This proposal failed, again because of the limited capacity.

NIR has three EMD class 111 locomotives, 111–113, for freight and passenger use, built in October 1980 (111–112) and December 1984 (113). During the eighties it was apparent that additional trains would be needed. BREL built nine 450 Class sets on former Mark 1 underframes between 1985 and 1987. The power cars had an English Electric 4SRKT engine recovered from former 70 Class units (except 459, which used the engine recovered from 80 Class power car 88) and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. The sets were three-car diesel-electric multiple units, based on a more modern British design, with air-operated sliding doors. They were withdrawn from service in 2012 and replaced by new 4000 Class diesel multiple units. In 1994, NIR bought two EMD 208 Class locomotives identical to Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s 201 Class. These haul the cross-border &quot;Enterprise&quot; dedicated trains of modern carriages.

Since 2002, NIR has modernised its rolling stock, with a full fleet replacement of new trains built by the Spanish company CAF. 23 Class 3000 diesel multiple units made up the first batch of trains ordered at a cost of £80million. They offered greater capacity, performance and accessibility than their predecessors when they were delivered in 2004 and 2005. The next order was for 20 Class 4000s, built 2010–2012. These offered similar benefits to the Class 3000s and completed the fleet replacement. Additionally, NIR has purchased 23 new carriages, via an option in the existing Class 4000 train procurement contract, these are to be used to extend Seven trains from three cars to six cars, which will add much more capacity and will also allow only one guard to be needed on a six-car train, which required two before.

In 2021, Translink announced it would change all of its iconic logos (used for the previous 25 years in the Translink brand and sub brands such as NI Railways, Ulsterbus &amp; Metro) to a new design. The design was intended to focus to &quot;modernise and simplify the brand presence&quot;. The creation of the logo cost £15,000 and was created by Belfast based company McCadden Design in partnership with Translink.

==Performance==
The latest performance figures for NIR according to Translink are 99% of trains arriving at the final destination within five minutes and 100% within ten minutes of the scheduled time. Among other accolades, NIR won the UK Rail Business of the Year Award for 2008.
NIR carried 13.4million passengers in 2014–15 (up from 10.4million in 20102011), representing 417million passenger-km and earning £43.6million in ticket sales.

In 20182019, NIR recorded 15.8million passenger journeys, the largest in the company&#x27;s 50-year history.
== Rolling stock ==

=== Current fleet ===

NIR also owns half of the 28 De Dietrich stock coaches used by Enterprise, the international service between Belfast and Dublin. These units have their own unique livery, and do not operate under NIR branding or on any other services in Northern Ireland or the Republic. In 2005, NIR investigated obtaining seven Class 222 DEMUs built for British operator Midland Mainline to use for Enterprise, but these entered service with their intended operator. They would have required significant modification to enable NIR to use them, including conversion from standard gauge to Irish gauge.

NIR retained one Class 80 unit (three power cars and two driving trailers) as its sandite train during the 2012-2017 leaf fall seasons. It was planned that a Class 450 unit was to be used for this role. However, in 2015, Translink awarded a contract to Windhoff Bahn AG to procure a new double ended multi-purpose vehicle to undertake sandite and high-pressure water spraying, as well as weed killing operations.

==== &quot;New Trains&quot; fleet replacement ====

In 2004/2005, NIR received 23 Class 3000 diesel multiple units from CAF of Spain in a £80million order. The final unit, 3023, arrived in Belfast Harbour on Monday 18 July 2005. All units had entered service by 24 September 2005. A maintenance contract with CAF for these vehicles was extended in May 2020 for another 15 years.

In 2007, NIR announced plans to purchase up to 20 trains under its &quot;New Trains 2010&quot; proposal following the confirmation of its expected budget. This fleet replaced the remaining Class 80 and Class 450 trains by March 2012. Renamed as &quot;New Trains Two&quot;, this project went out to tender in late 2007. In March 2009 it was announced that CAF had been selected to build the new fleet, named Class 4000. The first units were delivered in March 2011, with entry into service in September 2011

In December 2018, NIR, announced that 21 additional carriages would be purchased from CAF at the cost of £50million, via an option in the existing Class 4000 train procurement contract. The first of the new carriages arrived in Belfast in March 2021, they were integrated onto Unit 4017 and tested throughout the summer, until being put into service on 29 September 2021.

===Past fleet===
==Routes==
NIR maintains the following lines:
* Bangor Line. Commuter line running northeast from Belfast. Travels along the north Down coast to the seaside town of Bangor. The only remaining line from the historical Belfast &amp; County Down Railway.
* Derry~Londonderry Line. The only inter-city line located entirely within Northern Ireland. Longest route by time and length. This line is sometimes referred to the Maiden City Flyer, joining the two main cities of Northern Ireland.
* Dublin Line. Inter-city line running south over the Irish border to Dublin. All services operate under the brand Enterprise. This service is operated in conjunction with Iarnród Éireann, who are responsible for the line south of the border.
* Larne Line. Commuter line running north from Belfast. Most of this line is coastal, with a terminus at Larne Harbour, allowing interchange with the ferry service to Cairnryan.
* Newry Line. Commuter line running southwest from Belfast. Travels through several urban centres in Counties Down and Armagh.
* Portrush Line. A generally-rural branch line connecting the Causeway coast towns of Coleraine and Portrush. The shortest line on the NIR network, with only four stations, and the only line not to enter Belfast.
* Lisburn–Antrim line. The former route for Derry~Londonderry Line trains south of Antrim between 1976 and 2001. Currently mothballed, with no scheduled passenger service operating since 2003. Has rarely been used as a diversion for Derry~Londonderry Line trains. A study is now underway to understand the feasibility of reopening the track with a link to Belfast International Airport.

The track from Grand Central to is shared by the Bangor, Derry~Londonderry and Larne lines. Beyond this, the Derry~Londonderry and Larne lines share track as far as . On the other side of the city, the track from Grand Central to is shared between the Dublin and Newry lines. The Portrush Line shares a small amount of track with the Derry~Londonderry Line at .

Signalling is controlled from Coleraine (Coleraine to Portrush), Portadown (the border to Lisburn), and Belfast Lanyon Place (From Lisburn to Belfast and the rest of the network).

===Services===
NIR operates regular passenger trains along the following routes during the weekday inter-peak:
=== Suspended routes ===
Following the re-opening of the Antrim – Bleach Green line in June 2001, which had been closed since 1978, NIR ceased passenger operations between Lisburn and Antrim on 29 June 2003. Combined with the new Dargan Bridge across the River Lagan in Belfast, the Bleach Green route offered faster journeys between Derry, Coleraine, Ballymena, Antrim and Belfast.

The Lisburn-Antrim railway line is still maintained, and occasional crew training operations are performed. While it is also available as a diversionary route, Knockmore, Ballinderry, Glenavy, Crumlin stations remain closed to the public. The passing loops at Ballinderry and Crumlin have been removed.

== Future ==

The development of railways in Northern Ireland has been linked to the future economic growth of the region, and as a way of reducing road congestion. One of the major challenges that NIR has faced is the limited number of trains available for service at peak times. The limited fleet size has led to services being cancelled due to failures or delays. This can lead to widespread disruption across the network and potentially a huge loss in revenue. Upon its establishment in 1998, the Northern Ireland Assembly put in place an investment programme costing £100million to bring about major improvements. This saw projects including the purchase of the 3000 Class trains, the complete relaying of the Belfast-Larne line and the construction of a new maintenance depot. Following completion of this, as part of its long-term investment programme for NIR Translink conducted a &quot;Strategic Rail Review&quot; in 2004, an independent review of rail services to determine its funding request under the Comprehensive Spending Review. This report determined that so-called &quot;lesser used lines&quot; were an important and economically viable part of the total network, and that investment should be consistent rather than in the &quot;stop-go&quot; manner of previous years.

A debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday 14 May 2007 raised several proposals as to how the railway network could be improved:
* Reopening of existing but closed infrastructure, notably the Lisburn-Antrim line
* Improvement of the infrastructure on the Belfast-Derry~Londonderry line through, at the very least, the installation of passing loops to allow service frequency to be increased, and upgrading the track to allow higher speeds.

Pressure groups have advocated the protection of former routes, where the track has been lifted but the trackbed remains intact, to enable these to be reinstated for commuter traffic as an alternative to increased road building.

In October 2007, following the CSR that provided funding allocation to the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department for Regional Development announced its draft budget. Conor Murphy, the Regional Development Minister, stated that approximately £137million could be allocated from for investment in the railways for the period 2008–2011.

In June 2008, Brian Guckian, an independent transport researcher from Dublin, presented a wide-ranging proposal to Translink for a £460million expansion of the network called &quot;Northern Ireland Network Enhancement&quot; (NINE). This proposes the return of the network to several towns that have not had access to rail services for many years; the main part of the proposal would see the Derry~Londonderry-Portadown line re-opened, which would link Omagh, Strabane and Dungannon, with branches to Enniskillen and Armagh. However, none of these enhancements are programmed to go to planning over the course of the next decade as of early 2013.

Translink have plans to introduce a new ticketing system in 2018 similar to the system utilised by Irish Rail. This includes the introduction of ticket vending machines, allowing customers to purchase tickets via an electronic interface at the station (as opposed to the current system in which customers must pay staff for the ticket, who in turn print the customer&#x27;s ticket for them), a &#x27;smart card&#x27; &#x27;tap on, tap off&#x27; system similar to the Leap Card and contactless payments.

=== Infrastructure ===
The rail network is focused on Greater Belfast. Both the Bangor and Larne lines have been re-laid in recent years, enabling timetable improvements to be delivered. The only significant &quot;inter-city&quot; routes are the main line between Belfast and Dublin, which covers services to Newry; and the Belfast-Derry line. This line is single track with crossing loops north of Mossley West and single track only west of , which limits the service in both frequency and speed; in the current timetable the train takes 2hr4m while the bus takes 1hr50m. The pressure group &quot;Into the West&quot;, which campaigns for improved rail links to the North West region, has stated that the need for a quality rail service, as part of a larger integrated transport policy, is vital to the economic development not just for the city of Derry but for the wider cross-border region.

On 21 November 2007, the Regional Development Minister announced that the investment strategy being considered by the NI Executive included the relaying of the Belfast-Londonderry line north of Coleraine, planned to include new signalling and a new crossing loop, allowing more trains. The total cost was £64million, and began in 2011, lasting five years. Prior to the major relaying of the Coleraine-Londonderry section, £12million was spent on improving the section between Ballymena and Coleraine. This saw the stretch between Ballymena and Coleraine closed completely for four months, with a replacement bus service. Trains continued to run between Derry~Londonderry, Coleraine and Portrush, with a small fleet stabled at Coleraine – four trains were stabled instead of the three previously reported. Once the project was completed in 2016, there is a further proposal to add two trains per day, enabling journey times between Belfast and Derry~Londonderry to be reduced by up to 30 minutes. As part of this plan, Translink envisages an hourly service to Derry~Londonderry, half-hourly to Ballymena. There have been proposals to improve the Belfast-Dublin line between Knockmore and Lurgan, enabling journey times to be reduced and frequency increased. This will improve NIR&#x27;s services and allow an hourly Enterprise service to Dublin.

In May 2008, the Regional Development Minister announced that his department would commission a study, in conjunction with Donegal County Council, to investigate the effects a resurrection of railway services in the north-west of Ireland with a long-term projection of building a railway line connecting Derry~Londonderry with Sligo through County Donegal.

As part of NIR&#x27;s original plans for its new rolling stock, it has built a new traincare depot next to Adelaide station on the site of the old freight yard. As a means of improving timings of its services, it would have seen former station Belfast Great Victoria Street undergo a major refurbishment that will see the platforms lengthened and the curves reduced, together with the addition of a new fifth platform, all planned to bring about the transfer of Enterprise services from .

Further plans are afoot to double the track from Monkstown to Templepatrick, to further increase capacity on the Derry~Londonderry line.

====Portadown to Armagh====
In 2013, the then Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy, indicated that a restoration of the route between and was under active consideration in the long term, pointing out the commercial opportunities for the city of Armagh and its hinterland to be reconnected to the railway network.

==== Airport links ====

Speculation remains that the Lisburn-Antrim route could re-open, potentially to offer an alternative Antrim – Lisburn – Belfast service. The line is maintained both for crew training and as a diversionary route, and passes close to Belfast International Airport at Aldergrove. For a number of years there have been suggestions for a station to serve the airport. The airport has marked the building of a new station in its list of future plans, while EasyJet, which is the largest operator into Belfast International, have been strong in advocating an airport rail link. The reopening of the Lisburn-Antrim line is seen not simply in terms of provision of a link to the airport – it would also allow for the further economic development of the area, which has seen increases in population as people use the towns in South Antrim as dormitory settlements for Belfast. In May 2009, the Minister for Regional Development stated that a proposal had been received from a private developer, the Kilbride Group, to restore the Knockmore line, indicating that he would be prepared to part fund a study into this if the local authorities provided the rest of the funding. The route was also included in a wider study of the development of the Northern Rail Corridor published at the end of 2009

The Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan 2015 identifies the need to improve transport links to George Best Belfast City Airport from the city centre. The BMAP proposed a light rail line from the city centre that would have interchanged with a new railway station at Tillysburn, serving both the airport and the Holywood Exchange retail development. However, in April 2008 the decision was taken not to proceed with the light rail project, with the DRD choosing to implement a new bus-based network. The pressure group &quot;Rail 21&quot; has stated that the Tillysburn proposal is insufficient for what the new station is expected to provide – a link to the airport, transport provision for Holywood Exchange and a park and ride facility. Instead it proposes a dedicated airport station, similar to , connected directly to the terminal, with Tillysburn half a mile away serving Holywood Exchange, instead of Tillysburn providing the link to the airport.

There have also been calls, as part of the wider upgrade of the rail route to Derry, for a railway station connecting to City of Derry Airport, which is close to the railway line. However, the Government has determined that the number of passengers using the airport is not sufficient to justify a station.

=== Rolling stock ===
Although the introduction of the Class 3000 trains was a success, they were a like-for-like replacement for the Class 80 units rather than an expansion of the fleet. Due to the limited number of new units, some of NIR&#x27;s older rolling stock was retained, notably the entire Class 450 on the Belfast-Larne route. To enable NIR to maintain its levels of service, it upgraded some of its older rolling stock. In 2005, the Class 450 fleet was refurbished to a standard close to that of the Class 3000 units, which saw them through to their withdrawal in 2012. Three four-car Class 80 units were refurbished and a number of locomotives and coaches were converted to push-pull operation with the addition of the DBSO obtained from &#x27;one&#x27;, to ensure that passenger rolling stock levels were maintained up to the introduction of new rolling stock in 2011 and 2012.

One of the major projects instigated by Translink was &quot;New Trains Two&quot; (formerly &quot;New Trains 2010&quot;), which saw the purchase of a new batch of rolling stock. At minimum, this was to be like-for-like replacement of the Class 450 trains, which were withdrawn in 2012. However, it was determined that to deliver improved frequency of service on the network the size of NIR&#x27;s fleet had to be increased, and with that must come associated infrastructure improvements. The announcement of the investment programme confirmed &quot;New Trains 2010&quot;, which procured 20 new trains to both replace the remaining Class 80 and Class 450 units and provide additional capacity. The specification given by the DRD stated that the new trains are to provide both inner and outer suburban commuter services and express services between Belfast and Dublin. The Class 4000 fleet entered service on Thursday 29 September 2011. Twenty three-car units have been specified with an option to purchase an additional 20 vehicles, allowing the units to be lengthened to six cars.

In 2021, following the procurement of 21 additional vehicles purchased to extend a number of its Class 4000 units to six-cars, Translink published a new strategy indicating its intention to provide a zero emission service by 2040. As part of this, NI Railways will begin a process to purchase new rolling stock from 2026 to 2027. The intention is to procure or part procure two fleets - a total of 15 three-car units planned to be either bi-mode or tri-mode for NI Railways&#x27; own domestic services, and a fleet of 9 eight-car sets for use by Enterprise, the business case for which will be based on zero- or low-carbon technologies.

<text>Phineas Redux is a novel by Anthony Trollope, first published between 1873 and 1874 as a serial in &quot;The Graphic&quot;. It is the fourth of the &quot;Palliser&quot; series of novels and is a sequel to the second book of the series, &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;.

==Plot summary==
His beloved wife Mary having died during pregnancy, Phineas Finn finds Irish society and his modest government position in Ireland dull and unsatisfying after the excitement of his former career as a Member of Parliament. Back in England, the Liberals are determined to overturn the Conservative majority in Parliament. As Finn had been considered the most promising of the younger set, he is encouraged to stand for Parliament again, and he takes the risk of giving up his salaried position.

Returning to London, he renews his acquaintance with the wealthy widow Madame Max Goesler. In the past, she had offered to marry him and had been gently turned down; after an awkward first encounter, they renew their friendship.

In the political arena, Finn loses the election by a narrow margin, but his luck does not desert him. On appeal, it is found that his opponent had bribed some of the voters; their disqualification is enough to give Finn the victory.

He makes an enemy within his own party. Mr Bonteen makes disparaging remarks about his political trustworthiness, referring to an incident, described in &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, when Finn voted with his conscience rather than his party about Irish tenant rights. The conflict spirals out of control when neither man will back down, and they become bitter foes.

When Bonteen is murdered, suspicion falls on two men. One is the Reverend Mr Emilius, estranged husband of Lady Eustace (the main character of &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot;). At Lady Eustace&#x27;s urging, Bonteen had travelled to Prague and found evidence that Emilius was still married to another woman when he wedded Lady Eustace, thus making the marriage invalid and safeguarding her wealth. The other suspect is Finn. He and Bonteen had been seen to quarrel publicly on the night of the murder and the circumstantial evidence points to him, while Emilius did not have a key to exit his lodgings with. Finn therefore is brought to trial. Not unexpectedly, the murder of one Member of Parliament allegedly by another quickly becomes a public sensation.

During the trial, Madame Max travels to Prague in search of evidence against Emilius, and she finds a locksmith who had made a duplicate key for Emilius. This, along with other developments, convinces everyone that Finn is innocent and Emilius guilty. It is not enough to convict the latter, but Finn is acquitted.

Afterwards, Finn, worn out by the ordeal and disillusioned with politics, refuses an invitation to take office in the government, and marries Madame Max.

==Trollope&#x27;s pro-Irish sentiments==
Victorian literature was generally anti-Irish. &quot;Phineas Redux&quot; and its companion, &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, are cited as counterexamples. Trollope, who had earlier worked in Ireland for the General Post Office, also wrote a number of novels set there.

Lady Glencora, the wife of Plantagenet Palliser, the Duke of Omnium, dies unexpectedly, leaving the devastated Duke to deal with their grownup children, with whom he has had a somewhat distant relationship. As the government in which he is Prime Minister has also fallen, the Duke is left bereft of both his beloved wife and his political position.

Before her death, Lady Glencora had given her private blessing to her daughter Mary&#x27;s courtship by a gentleman of modest means, Frank Tregear, who is a friend of Mary&#x27;s older brother, Lord Silverbridge. Mrs Finn, Lady Glencora&#x27;s dearest friend and confidante, somewhat uneasily remains after the funeral at the Duke&#x27;s request as a companion and unofficial chaperone for Lady Mary. Once she becomes aware of the seriousness of the relationship between Mary and Frank, Mrs Finn insists that the Duke be informed; he is strongly opposed to the match.

Managing the Duke&#x27;s two sons also proves troublesome. Lord Silverbridge intends to follow the wishes of his father by entering Parliament but as a Conservative Party candidate rather than standing for the seat on behalf of the Liberal Party. He proposes to Lady Mabel Grex, whom he has known all his life, and of whom the Duke approves. However, she turns Silverbridge down, due to his immaturity, albeit with a hint of a more welcoming answer another time. However, Silverbridge becomes enamoured of American heiress Isabel Boncassen. She agrees to marry him only if the Duke is willing to welcome her into the family. At first, the Duke disapproves. To add to his troubles, Gerald, his younger son, gets sent down from Cambridge after attending the Derby without permission.

However, by the end of the book, the Duke grows closer to all three of his children; he assents to the engagements of his oldest son and daughter, and he is invited once more to take a part in the government.

==Historical setting==
Marriages of rich American young women to British aristocrats had just begun to take place when Trollope wrote this book. One of the first such marriages had been that of Lord Randolph Churchill to Jennie Jerome, five years before the book was written—a love match, as is that of Silverbridge and Isabel Boncassen. One difference is that, in the novel, Silverbridge will be very rich in his own right; whereas many Anglo-American marriages transpired in order to import much-needed American money into financially stressed British aristocratic families.

==Critical reception==
A 2017 book review by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; summarised the book as &quot;A thoroughly satisfying classic for those who love long, slow Victorian family dramas.&quot; Reviewing the extended and restored version of the book in 2015 for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Charles McGrath wrote, &quot;The new version will most likely not change anyone’s view of “The Duke’s Children,” and yet all those tiny excisions do add up. The restored version is a fuller, richer book.&quot;

<text>Daniel Deronda is a novel by English author George Eliot, pen name of Mary Ann Evans, first published in eight parts (books) February to September 1876. It was the last novel she completed and the only one set in the Victorian society of her day. The work&#x27;s mixture of social satire and moral searching, along with its sympathetic rendering of Jewish proto-Zionist ideas, has made it the controversial final statement of one of the most renowned Victorian novelists.

The novel has been adapted for film three times, once as a silent feature and twice for television. It has also been adapted for the stage, notably in the 1960s by the 69 Theatre Company in Manchester with Vanessa Redgrave cast as the heroine Gwendolen Harleth.

The novel has two main strands of plot, and while the &quot;story of Gwendolen&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the masterpieces of English fiction&quot;, that part concerned with Daniel Deronda has been described as &quot;flat and unconvincing&quot;. All the same Daniel&#x27;s story has had a significant influence on Zionism.

==Plot==

&quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; contains two main strains of plot, united by the title character. The novel begins in September 1865 with the meeting of Daniel and Gwendolen Harleth in the fictional town of Leubronn, Germany. Daniel finds himself attracted to, but wary of, the beautiful, stubborn, and selfish Gwendolen, whom he sees losing all her winnings in a game of roulette. The next day, Gwendolen receives a letter from her mother telling her that the family is financially ruined and asking her to come home. Gwendolen pawns a necklace and debates gambling again to make her fortune. However, her necklace is returned to her by a porter, and she realises that Daniel had seen her pawn the necklace and had redeemed it for her. From this point, the plot breaks off into two separate flashbacks; one gives us Gwendolen&#x27;s history and the other Daniel&#x27;s.

In October 1864, soon after the death of Gwendolen&#x27;s stepfather, Gwendolen and her family move to a new neighborhood. It is here that she meets Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt, a taciturn and calculating man who proposes marriage shortly after their first meeting. At first she is open to his advances, but upon discovering that Grandcourt has several children with his mistress, Lydia Glasher, she eventually flees to the German town where she meets Daniel. This portion of the novel sets Gwendolen up as a haughty and selfish, yet affectionate, daughter admired for her beauty but suspected by many in society because of her satirical observations and somewhat manipulative behaviour. She is also prone to fits of terror that shake her otherwise calm and controlling exterior.

Daniel has been raised by a wealthy gentleman, Sir Hugo Mallinger. Daniel&#x27;s relationship to Sir Hugo is ambiguous, and it is widely believed, even by Daniel, that he is Sir Hugo&#x27;s illegitimate son, though no one is certain. Daniel is an intelligent and compassionate young man who cannot quite decide what to do with his life, and this is a sore point between him and Sir Hugo, who wants him to go into politics. One day in late July 1865, as he is boating on the Thames, Daniel rescues a young Jewish woman, Mirah Lapidoth, from attempting to drown herself. He takes her to the home of some of his friends, where they learn that Mirah is a singer. She has come to London to search for her mother and brother after running away from her father, who had kidnapped her when she was a child and had forced her into an acting troupe. She finally ran away from him after discovering that he had pledged her in marriage to a wealthy patron. Moved by her tale, Daniel undertakes to help her look for her mother (who turns out to have died years earlier) and brother; through this, he is introduced to London&#x27;s Jewish community. Mirah and Daniel grow closer and Daniel, anxious about his growing affection for her, leaves for a short time to join Sir Hugo in Leubronn, where he and Gwendolen first meet.

From here, the story picks up in &quot;real time&quot;. Gwendolen returns from Germany in early September 1865 because her family has lost its fortune. She is unwilling to marry (the only respectable way in which a woman could achieve real financial security); and she is also reluctant to become a governess, because it would drastically lower her social status from being a member of the wealthy landed gentry to being almost a servant. She hits upon the idea of pursuing a career in singing or on the stage, but a prominent musician tells her she does not have the talent. Finally, to save herself and her family from relative poverty, she marries the wealthy Grandcourt, despite having promised Mrs. Glasher she would not, and despite fearing that it is a mistake. She believes she can manipulate him to maintain her freedom to do what she likes; however, Grandcourt has shown every sign of being cold, unfeeling, and manipulative himself.

Daniel, searching for Mirah&#x27;s family, meets a consumptive visionary named Mordecai. Mordecai passionately proclaims his wish for the Jewish people to retain their national identity and to be restored one day to the Promised Land. Because he is dying, he wants Daniel to become his intellectual heir and continue to pursue his dream to be an advocate for the Jewish people. Although Daniel is strongly drawn to Mordecai, he hesitates to commit himself to a cause that seems to have no connection to his own identity. Daniel&#x27;s desire to embrace Mordecai&#x27;s vision becomes stronger when they discover Mordecai is Mirah&#x27;s brother Ezra. Daniel feels affection and respect for Mordecai/Ezra, but does not feel able to pursue a life of advocacy for Jewish causes, since he does not believe that he himself is a Jew.

Meanwhile, Gwendolen has been emotionally crushed by her cold, self-centred, and manipulative husband. She is consumed with guilt for having possibly disinherited Lydia Glasher&#x27;s children by marrying their father. On Gwendolen&#x27;s wedding day, Mrs. Glasher curses her and tells her that she will suffer for her treachery, which only exacerbates Gwendolen&#x27;s feelings of dread and terror. During this time, Gwendolen and Daniel meet regularly, and Gwendolen pours out her troubles to him at each meeting. During a trip to Italy, Grandcourt is knocked from his boat into the water, and after some hesitation, Gwendolen jumps into the Mediterranean in a futile attempt to save him. She is consumed with guilt because she had long wished he would die and fears her hesitation had caused his death. Coincidentally, Daniel is also in Italy, having learned from Sir Hugo that his mother lives there. He comforts Gwendolen and advises her. Gwendolen is in love with Daniel, and hopes for a future with him, but he urges her onto a path of righteousness, encouraging her to alleviate her suffering by helping others.

Daniel meets his mother and learns that she was a famous Jewish opera singer with whom Sir Hugo was once in love. She tells him that her father, a physician and strict Jew, had forced her to marry her cousin, whom she did not love. She resented the rigid piety of her childhood. Daniel was the only child of that union, and on her husband&#x27;s death, she asked Sir Hugo to raise her son as an English gentleman, never to know that he was Jewish. Upon learning of his true origins, Daniel finally feels comfortable with his love for Mirah, and on his return to England in October 1866, he tells Mirah this and commits himself to be Ezra/Mordecai&#x27;s disciple. Before Daniel marries Mirah, he goes to Gwendolen to tell her about his origins, his decision to go to &quot;the East&quot; (per Ezra/Mordecai&#x27;s wish), and his betrothal to Mirah. Gwendolen is devastated, but it becomes a turning point in her life, inspiring her to finally say, &quot;I shall live.&quot; She is aware of the &quot;terrible moment&quot; when &quot;the great movements of the world, the larger destinies of mankind… enter like an earthquake into their own lives&quot;. According to A. Sanders: &quot;Gwendolen&#x27;s is a crisis resultant from &#x27;feeling the pressure of a vast mysterious movement&#x27; whose mystery remains unsolved, perhaps unsolvable&quot;. She sends Daniel a letter on his wedding day, telling him not to think of her with sadness but to know that she will be a better person for having known him. The newlyweds are all prepared to set off for &quot;the East&quot; with Mordecai, when Mordecai dies in their arms, and the novel ends.

==Characters==

* Daniel Deronda – The ward of the wealthy Sir Hugo Mallinger and hero of the novel, Deronda has a tendency to help others at a cost to himself. At the start of the novel, he has failed to win a scholarship at Cambridge because of his focus on helping a friend, has been travelling abroad, and has just started studying law. He often wonders about his birth and whether or not he is a gentleman. As he moves more and more among the world-within-a-world of the Jews of the novel he begins to identify with their cause in direct proportion to the unfolding revelations of his ancestry. Eliot used the story of Moses as part of her inspiration for Deronda. As Moses was a Jew brought up as an Egyptian who ultimately led his people to the Promised Land, so Deronda is a Jew brought up as an Englishman who ends the novel with a plan to do the same. Deronda&#x27;s name presumably indicates that his ancestors lived in the Spanish city of Ronda, prior to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.
* Gwendolen Harleth – The beautiful, spoiled daughter of a widowed mother. Much courted by men, she is flirtatious but ultimately self-involved. Early in the novel, her family suffers a financial crisis, and she is faced with becoming a governess to help support herself and her family. Seeking an escape, she explores the idea of becoming an actress and singer, but Herr Klesmer tells her that she has started too late, that she does not know the meaning of hard work, training, and sacrifice. Gwendolen marries the controlling and cruel Henleigh Grandcourt, although she does not love him. Desperately unhappy, she seeks help from Deronda, who offers her understanding, moral support and the possibility of a way out of her guilt and sorrow. As a psychological study of an immature egoist struggling to achieve greater understanding of herself and others through suffering, Gwendolen is for many Eliot&#x27;s crowning achievement as a novelist and the real core of the book. F. R. Leavis famously felt that the novel would have benefited from the complete removal of the Jewish section and the renaming of it as &quot;Gwendolen Harleth&quot;. It is true that though the novel is named after Deronda, a greater proportion is devoted to Gwendolen than to Deronda himself.
* Mirah Lapidoth – A beautiful Jewish girl who was born in England but taken away by her father at a young age to travel the world as a singer. Realising, as a young woman, that her father planned to sell her as a mistress to a European nobleman, to get money for his gambling addiction, she flees from him and returns to London to look for her mother and brother. When she arrived in London she found her old home destroyed and no trace of her family. Giving in to despair, she tries to commit suicide. Rescued by Daniel, she is cared for by his friends while searching for her family and work, so that she can support herself.
* Sir Hugo Mallinger – A wealthy gentleman; Sir Hugo fell in love with the operatic diva Maria Alcharisi when she was young and agreed, out of love for her, to raise her son Daniel Deronda.
* Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt – Sir Hugo&#x27;s nephew and heir-presumptive, a wealthy, manipulative, sadistic man. Grandcourt marries Gwendolen Harleth and then embarks upon a campaign of emotional abuse. He has a mistress, Lydia Glasher, with whom he has several children. He had promised to marry Lydia when her husband died but reneged on the promise to marry Gwendolen instead.
* Thomas Cranmer Lush – Henleigh Grandcourt&#x27;s slavish associate. He and Gwendolen take an immediate dislike to one another.
* Lydia Glasher – Henleigh Grandcourt&#x27;s mistress, a fallen woman who left her husband for Grandcourt and had his children. She confronts Gwendolen, hoping to persuade her not to marry Grandcourt and protect her children&#x27;s inheritance. To punish both women, Grandcourt takes the family diamonds he had given to Lydia and gives them to Gwendolen. He forces Gwendolen to wear them despite her knowing that they had been previously worn by his mistress.
* Ezra Mordecai Cohen – Mirah&#x27;s brother. A young Jewish visionary suffering from consumption who befriends Daniel Deronda and teaches him about Judaism. A Kabbalist and proto-Zionist, Mordecai sees Deronda as his spiritual successor and inspires him to continue his vision of creating a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Named after the biblical character Mordecai, who delivers the Jews from the machinations of Haman in the &quot;Book of Esther&quot;
* Herr Julius Klesmer – A German-Jewish musician in Gwendolen Harleth&#x27;s social circle; Klesmer marries Catherine Arrowpoint, a wealthy girl with whom Gwendolen is friendly. He also advises Gwendolen not to try for a life on the stage. Thought to be partly based on Franz Liszt or Anton Rubinstein.
* The Princess Halm Eberstein – Daniel Deronda&#x27;s mother. The daughter of a physician, she suffered under her father&#x27;s dominance; he saw her main purpose was to produce Jewish sons. To please him, she agreed to marry her cousin, knowing he adored her and would let her do as she wished after her father died. When her father was dead, she became a renowned singer and actress. After her husband died, she gave her son to Sir Hugo Mallinger to be raised as an English gentleman, free of all the disadvantages she felt she had had as a Jew. Later when her voice seemed to be failing, she converted to Christianity to marry a Russian nobleman. Her voice recovered, and she bitterly regretted having given up her life as a performer. Now ill with a fatal disease, she begins to fear retribution for having frustrated her father&#x27;s plans for his grandson. She contacts Daniel through Sir Hugo, asking him to meet her in Genoa, where she travels under pretense of consulting a doctor. Their confrontation in Italy is one of the novel&#x27;s important scenes. Afterwards, she tells Deronda where he can recover a chest full of important documents related to his Jewish heritage, gathered by her father.

== The depiction of Jews == 
The depiction of Jews contrasted strongly with those in other novels such as Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Despite there being a Jewish-born Prime Minister (Benjamin Disraeli was baptised as a boy into the Church of England following his father&#x27;s renunciation of Judaism), the view of Jews among non-Jewish Britons at the time was often prejudiced, sometimes to the point of derision or revulsion. In 1833 when the Jewish Civil Disabilities Bill came before Parliament the whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King William IV was against the bill, which is reflected in opinions expressed by several of the non-Jewish Meyrick family in Chapter 32.

=== Influence on Jewish Zionism ===
On its publication, &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; was immediately translated into German and Dutch and was given an enthusiastic extended review by the Austrian Zionist rabbi and scholar David Kaufmann. Further translations soon followed into French (1882), Italian (1883), Hebrew (1893), Yiddish (1900s) and Russian (1902).

Written during a time when Restorationism (similar to 20th century Christian Zionism) had a strong following, Eliot&#x27;s novel had a positive influence on later Jewish Zionism. It has been cited by Henrietta Szold, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, and Emma Lazarus as having been influential in their decision to become Zionists.

== Plot structure ==
In 1948, F. R. Leavis in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot; gave the opinion that the Jewish sections of the book were its weakest, and that a truncated version called &quot;Gwendolen Harleth&quot; should be printed on its own. Conversely, some Zionist commentators have advocated the opposite truncation, keeping the Jewish section, with Gwendolen&#x27;s story omitted.

Contemporary readers might ask themselves whether the seemingly bifurcated structure of the novel arose from a wish to contrast inward-looking (Gwendolen) and outward-looking (Deronda, on the Jewish &#x27;question&#x27;) moral growth, with Deronda himself the fulcrum.

==Adaptations==
===Books===
An abridged (119 page) version for younger readers, by Philip Zimmerman, focusing on the Jewish elements, was published in 1961 by Herzl Press.

===Films===
Film adaptations include:
* &quot;Gwendolin&quot; (1914), an American short film directed by Travers Vale.
* &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (1921), a British silent drama film starring Reginald Fox, Ann Trevor and Clive Brook. Walter Courtney Rowden made the film at Teddington Studios by Master Films.
* &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (1970), a six-episode BBC TV drama written by Alexander Baron, produced by David Conroy and directed by Joan Craft. John Nolan starred as Daniel Deronda, with Martha Henry as Gwendolen and Robert Hardy as Grandcourt.
* &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (2002), a four-episode BBC One serial drama written by Andrew Davies, directed by Tom Hooper and starring Hugh Dancy in the title role. The show won two British Academy Television Craft Awards, a Banff Rockie Award, and a Broadcasting Press Guild Award.

<text>Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve (; 23 December 1804 – 13 October 1869) was a French literary critic.

==Early life==
He was born in Boulogne, educated there, and studied medicine at the Collège Charlemagne in Paris (1824–27). In 1828, he served in the St Louis Hospital. Beginning in 1824, he contributed literary articles, the &quot;Premier lundis&quot; of his collected &quot;Works&quot;, to the newspaper &quot;Globe&quot;, and in 1827 he came, by a review of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Odes et Ballades&quot;, into close association with Hugo and the Cénacle, the literary circle that strove to define the ideas of the rising Romanticism and struggle against classical formalism. Sainte-Beuve became friendly with Hugo after publishing a favourable review of the author&#x27;s work but later had an affair with Hugo&#x27;s wife, Adèle Foucher, which resulted in their estrangement. Curiously, when Sainte-Beuve was made a member of the French Academy in 1845, the ceremonial duty of giving the reception speech fell upon Hugo.

==Career==
Sainte-Beuve published collections of poems and the partly autobiographical novel &quot;Volupté&quot; in 1834. His articles and essays were collected the volumes &quot;Port-Royal&quot; and &quot;Portraits littéraires&quot;.
During the rebellions of 1848 in Europe, he lectured at Liège on &quot;Chateaubriand and his literary circle&quot;. He returned to Paris in 1849 and began his series of topical columns, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot; (&#x27;Monday Chats&#x27;) in the newspaper, &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot;. When Louis Napoleon became Emperor, he made Sainte-Beuve professor of Latin poetry at the Collège de France, but anti-Imperialist students hissed him, and he resigned.

===&quot;Port-Royal&quot;===
After several books of poetry and a couple of failed novels, Sainte-Beuve began to do literary research, of which the most important publication resulting is &quot;Port-Royal&quot;. He continued to contribute to &quot;La Revue contemporaine&quot;.

&quot;Port-Royal&quot; (1837–1859), probably Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s masterpiece, is an exhaustive history of the Jansenist abbey of Port-Royal-des-Champs, near Paris. It not only influenced the historiography of religious belief, i.e., the method of such research, but also the philosophy of history and the history of esthetics.

He was made Senator in 1865, in which capacity he distinguished himself by his pleas for freedom of speech and of the press. According to Jules Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, &quot;Sainte-Beuve was a clever man with the temper of a turkey!&quot; In his last years, he was an acute sufferer and lived much in retirement.

One of Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s critical contentions was that, in order to understand an artist and his work, it was necessary to understand that artist&#x27;s biography. Marcel Proust took issue with this notion and repudiated it in a set of essays, &quot;Contre Sainte-Beuve&quot; (&quot;Against Sainte-Beuve&quot;). Proust developed the ideas first voiced in those essays in &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (In Search of Lost Time).

==Reception==
In 1880 Friedrich Nietzsche, though an avowed opponent of Sainte-Beuve, prompted the wife of his friend Franz Overbeck, Ida Overbeck, to translate the &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot; into German. Until then, Sainte-Beuve was never published in German despite his great importance in France, since it was considered representative of a French way of thinking detested in Germany. Ida Overbeck&#x27;s translation appeared in 1880 under the title &quot;Die Menschen des XVIII. Jahrhunderts&quot; (&quot;Men of the 18th Century&quot;). Nietzsche wrote to Ida Overbeck on August 18, 1880: &quot;An hour ago I received the &quot;Die Menschen des XVIII. Jahrhunderts&quot;, [...] It is just a marvellous book. I think I&#x27;ve cried.&quot; Ida Overbeck&#x27;s translation is an important document of the cultural transfer between Germany and France in a period of strong tension, but it was largely ignored. It was not until 2014 that a critical and annotated edition of this translation appeared in print.

Sainte-Beuve died in Paris, aged 64.

<doc id="230023" wikidata="Q69478541" url="?curid=230023" title="Enoch Pratt Free Library">
<text>The Enoch Pratt Free Library is the free public library system of Baltimore, Maryland. Its Central Library is located on 400 Cathedral Street (southbound) and occupies the northeastern three quarters of a city block bounded by West Franklin Street (U.S. Route 40 westbound) to the north, Cathedral Street to the east, West Mulberry Street (U.S. Route 40 eastbound) to the south, and Park Avenue (northbound) to the west. Located on historic Cathedral Hill, north of downtown, the library is also in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal neighborhood and cultural and historic district.

The Cathedral Street Main Library is the flagship of the entire Enoch Pratt Free Library system, which includes twenty-one neighborhood branches, it was designated the &quot;Maryland State Library Resource Center&quot; by the General Assembly of Maryland in 1971. Central Library operates as the state library for Maryland.

== History ==
Its establishment began on January 21, 1882, when the longtime local hardware merchant, banking, and steamship company executive and philanthropist Enoch Pratt (1808-1896) offered a gift of a central library, four branch libraries (with two additional shortly afterward), and a financial endowment of more than $1 million to Mayor William Pinkney Whyte and the Baltimore City Council. His intention was to establish a public circulating library that (as he described it) &quot;shall be for all, rich and poor without distinction of race or color, who, when properly accredited, can take out the books if they will handle them carefully and return them.&quot; The grant was soon accepted by the municipal government and approved by the voters on October 25, 1882.

One of the early hires at the library was William A. Williams, the first Black Catholic seminarian in America (who later dropped out due to the prevailing racist attitudes of the day).

From 1993 to August 11, 2016, Dr. Carla Hayden (formerly of the Chicago Public Library) served as the CEO of Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and since has been the Librarian of Congress in Washington, DC. Hayden and the staff of the Pennsylvania Avenue branch were praised for keeping the branch open on Monday April 27, 2015, after protests and the civil strife over the death of Freddie Gray. The library&#x27;s location, at the intersection of Pennsylvania and West North Avenues in the northwest center city Sandtown-Winchester community, found itself at the center of the protests drawing nationwide and international attention, giving community members a safe place during the troubled times.

Following Hayden&#x27;s departure and promotion on August 11, 2016, the acting director of the library has been Gordon Krabbe, who served as the library&#x27;s chief operating officer since 1989.

In July 2017, Heidi Daniel was named the new president and CEO of the public library system. Under Daniel&#x27;s leadership, the Pratt became one of the first fine-free public library system&#x27;s on the East Coast. In 2017, the Enoch Pratt Free Library was named one of Reader&#x27;s Digest and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s Nicest Places in America. Daniel also helped expand the library&#x27;s social impact programs, including Social Worker in the Library, Healthcare in the Library, Peer Navigators, and Housing Navigators. Daniel sits on the Board of the Urban Libraries Council. In September 2024, Chad Helton was named as the library system&#x27;s new president and CEO.

In June 2022, workers across the Pratt Library system voted to form a union named Pratt Workers United with AFSCME Council 67, representing over 300 workers across the system, calling for improved wages, benefits, career advancement, and increased staff input on their work environment. The council would also represent workers at Baltimore Museum of Art and Walters Art Museum if union campaigns at those institutions are successful. Workers within the library system have been organizing for a union since May 2021.

==Central Library building ==

===Original (1886–2015)===

The merchant and financier Enoch Pratt, in a letter to the Baltimore City Council on January 21, 1882, offered to donate and construct a free public library with several neighborhood branches open to all the citizens of the City of Baltimore (and its surrounding environs). After some debate and discussion which was also widely reported in the local newspapers, the mayor and council accepted the gift and the terms of its conditions later that year, which were subsequently approved by the citizens in a referendum held during an election that October, 1882. Pratt’s donation consisted of $250,000 for land and building for the central library; $50,000 for land and building for four branch libraries; and $833,333 in cash for an endowment whose estimated annual return of $50,000, he anticipated, would finance expenses for management of the library system. Construction of the Central Library began 1882; it opened on January 5, 1886 .  The first four branches also opened in 1886. Subsequently, Pratt gave funds for the construction of two more branches; one opened 1888 and the other in 1896. In 1899, Robert Poole, a Baltimore industrialist, built and gave to the City of Baltimore, a seventh branch located in Hampden. In 1905, steel-maker and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie gave $500,000 for the construction of twenty more branches. Because of closings, relocations, and reallocation of space, the Pratt system now has twenty-two active branches.

Designed by Charles L. Carson, &quot;Old Central&quot; occupied a fraction of the same plot of land as its successor 47 years later, facing West Mulberry Street near the corner of Cathedral Street. The structure&#x27;s elaborate Romanesque Revival architecture became a target of criticism from journalists during final years of existence: H. L. Mencken of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, a frequent and prolific user of the branch at Calhoun and Hollins Streets, judged it &quot;so infernally hideous that it ought to be pulled down by the common hangman&quot;.

===Current===
By the late 1920s, Old Central could no longer hold the library&#x27;s continually expanding collection, even though an annex had been added at the rear. Baltimore City voters approved a loan for $3 million by an almost 3-to-1 margin on May 3, 1927. The Central Pratt Library&#x27;s staff, services and 400,000 volumes were relocated to temporary quarters at the old Rouse-Hempstone Building at West Redwood Street and Hopkins Place (now the site of the Royal Farms Arena for a two-year stay during 1931–1933. At this temporary location, the Central Pratt was able to reorganize and plan for its future arrangements of departments and try out its soon-to-be famous &quot;department store windows&quot; displays It was razed in 1931, along with several townhouses facing Cathedral Street, including a significant one formerly owned by Robert Goodloe Harper.

The replacement structure occupies the entire block facing the Old Baltimore Cathedral. Construction began in June 1931, during the darkest, most difficult days of the financial Great Depression and along with other major construction projects occurring at that time with the building of a new U.S. Courthouse and Post Office at Battle Monument Square at North Calvert and East Lexington-Fayette Streets, and the new Municipal Office Building on Holliday Street, across from the old Baltimore City Hall and the new Federal Courthouse/Post Office, offered an important source of desperately needed employment to the hundreds of out-of-work citizens of the city.

The architects were C. and N. Friz, with consulting architects Tilton &amp; Githens from New York. The building was completed in January 1933, and opened to the public on February 3, with a record of not one day of suspended service since the original beginnings of &quot;Enoch Pratt&#x27;s Folly&quot; on January 5, 1886. In Spring of 2016, ground was broken on a $115 million restoration of the historic Central Library. The building remained open to the public. February 11–19, the Central Library closed to the public to relocate departments to the newly renovated upper floors, and to begin renovation of the lower levels. The restoration was completed in Fall of 2019. A Grand Reopening block party drew a crowd of 9,000 people.

In 2020, the Senator Barbara A. Mikulski Room, with mementos and Mikulski&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Freedom, was opened in the Central Library.

===Maryland Department===

The Maryland Department, located on the second floor of the 2004 Annex, contains many of the library&#x27;s prized collections. These include 275,000 mounted documents (mostly newspaper articles), 2100 maps, 6000 pieces of ephemera, and 24,000 photographs, all relevant to Maryland and Maryland history. The Maryland Department also has a room full of books pertaining to Maryland, with an emphasis on Baltimore.

Most materials in the Maryland Department are non-circulating but available for patrons to examine.

==Statistics==

In 2024, The Pratt Library hit a 13-year high for circulation and all-time high for active cardholders. The summer reading program, Summer Break Baltimore also hit a record high with more than 23,000 participants across the city.

<text>The Pentagon Papers, officially titled Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force, is a United States Department of Defense history of the United States&#x27; political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1968. Released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study, they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1971. A 1996 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; had demonstrated, among other things, that Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s administration had &quot;systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress.&quot;

The &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the Vietnam War with coastal raids on North Vietnam and Marine Corps attacks—none of which were reported in the mainstream media. For his disclosure of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property; charges were later dismissed, after prosecutors investigating the Watergate scandal discovered that the staff members in the Nixon White House had ordered the so-called White House Plumbers to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.

In June 2011, the documents forming the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; were declassified and publicly released.

== Contents ==
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara created the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967, for the purpose of writing an &quot;encyclopedic history of the Vietnam War&quot;. McNamara claimed that he wanted to leave a written record for historians, to prevent policy errors in future administrations, although Leslie H. Gelb, then director of Policy Planning at the Pentagon, has said that the notion that they were commissioned as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot; is a motive that McNamara only used in retrospect. McNamara told others, such as Dean Rusk, that he only asked for a collection of documents rather than the studies he received. Motives aside, McNamara neglected to inform either President Lyndon Johnson or Secretary of State Dean Rusk about the study. One report claimed that McNamara had planned to give the work to his friend, Robert F. Kennedy, who was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. McNamara later denied it, though he admitted that he should have informed Johnson and Rusk.

Instead of using existing Defense Department historians, McNamara assigned his close aide and Assistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton to collect the papers. McNamara wanted the study done in three months. McNaughton died in a plane crash one month after work began in June 1967, but the project continued under the direction of Defense Department official Les Gelb.

Thirty-six analysts—half of them active-duty military officers, the rest academics and civilian federal employees—worked on the study. They worked to produce 47 volumes answering a list of 100 questions that McNamara (via his secretaries) had sent them, which included questions such as &quot;How confident can we be about body counts of the enemy? Were programs to pacify the Vietnamese countryside working? What was the basis of President Johnson&#x27;s credibility gap? Was Ho Chi Minh an Asian Tito? Did the U.S. violate the Geneva Accords on Indochina?&quot; Some of the analysts included Daniel Ellsberg, Morton Halperin, Paul Warnke, future generals Paul F. Gorman and John Galvin, historian Melvin Gurtov, economists Hans Heymann and Richard Moorstein, and future top diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who drafted a volume.

The analysts largely used existing files in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. To keep the study secret from others, including National Security Advisor Walt Rostow, they conducted no interviews or consultations with the armed forces, with the White House, or with other federal agencies.

McNamara left the Defense Department in February 1968, and his successor Clark Clifford received the finished study on January 15, 1969, five days before Richard Nixon&#x27;s inauguration, although Clifford claimed he never read it. Gelb said in 1991 that he presented the study to McNamara in early 1969, when the latter was president of the World Bank, but McNamara did not read it then, and as late as 2018 Gelb did not know if McNamara ever read the study later in his life.

The study consisted of 3,000 pages of historical analysis and 4,000 pages of original government documents in 47 volumes, and was classified as &quot;Top Secret – Sensitive&quot;. (&quot;Sensitive&quot; is not an official security designation; it meant that access to the study should be controlled.) The task force published 15 copies; the think tank RAND Corporation received two of the copies from Gelb, Morton Halperin and Paul Warnke, with access granted if at least two of the three approved.

=== Actual objective of the Vietnam War: Containment of China ===


Although President Johnson stated that the aim of the Vietnam War was to secure an &quot;independent, non-Communist South Vietnam&quot;, a January 1965 memorandum by Assistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton stated that an underlying justification was &quot;not to help friend, but to contain China&quot;.

On November 3, 1965, Secretary of Defense McNamara sent a memorandum to Johnson, in which he explained the &quot;major policy decisions with respect to our course of action in Vietnam&quot;. The memorandum begins by disclosing the rationale behind the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965:

McNamara accused China of harboring imperial aspirations like those of the German Empire, Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan and the Soviet Union. According to McNamara, the Chinese were conspiring to &quot;organize all of Asia&quot; against the United States:

To encircle the Chinese, the United States aimed to establish &quot;three fronts&quot; as part of a &quot;long-run effort to contain China&quot;:

However, McNamara admitted that the containment of China would ultimately sacrifice a significant amount of America&#x27;s time, money and lives.

=== Internal affairs of Vietnam ===

Years before the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred on August 2, 1964, the U.S. government was indirectly involved in Vietnam&#x27;s affairs by sending advisers or (military personnel) to train the South Vietnamese soldiers:
* Under President Harry S. Truman, the U.S. government aided France in its war against the communist-led Viet Minh during the First Indochina War.
* Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. government played a &quot;direct role in the ultimate breakdown of the Geneva settlement&quot; in 1954 by supporting the fledgling South Vietnam and covertly undermining the communist country of North Vietnam.
* Under President John F. Kennedy, the U.S. government transformed its policy towards Vietnam from a limited &quot;gamble&quot; to a broad &quot;commitment&quot;.
* Under President Johnson, the U.S. government began waging covert military operations against communist North Vietnam in defense of South Vietnam.

==== Role of the United States in the rise of President Diem ====
In a section of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; titled &quot;Kennedy Commitments and Programs&quot;, America&#x27;s commitment to South Vietnam was attributed to the creation of the country by the United States. As acknowledged by the papers:

In a sub-section titled &quot;Special American Commitment to Vietnam&quot;, the papers emphasized once again the role played by the United States:

More specifically, the United States sent US$28.4 million worth of equipment and supplies to help the Diem regime strengthen its army. In addition, 32,000 men from South Vietnam&#x27;s Civil Guard were trained by the United States at a cost of US$12.7 million. It was hoped that Diem&#x27;s regime, after receiving a significant amount of U.S. assistance, would be able to withstand the Viet Cong.

The papers identified General Edward Lansdale, who served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as a &quot;key figure&quot; in the establishment of Diem as the President of South Vietnam, and the backing of Diem&#x27;s regime thereafter. As written by Lansdale in a 1961 memorandum: &quot;We (the U.S.) must support Ngo Dinh Diem until another strong executive can replace him legally.&quot;

==== Role of the United States in the overthrow of Diem&#x27;s regime ====
According to the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, the U.S. government played a key role in the 1963 South Vietnamese coup, in which Diem was assassinated. While maintaining &quot;clandestine contact&quot; with Vietnamese generals planning a coup, the U.S. cut off its aid to President Diem and openly supported a successor government in what the authors called an &quot;essentially leaderless Vietnam&quot;:

As early as August 23, 1963, an unnamed U.S. representative had met with Vietnamese generals planning a coup against Diem. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this U.S. representative was later identified to be CIA officer Lucien Conein.

=== Proposed operations ===
The Director of Central Intelligence, John A. McCone, proposed the following categories of military action:
* Category 1 – Air raids on major Viet Cong supply centers, conducted simultaneously by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and the United States Air Force (codenamed Farmgate)
* Category 2 – Cross-border raids on major Viet Cong supply centers, conducted by South Vietnamese units and US military advisers.
* Category 3 – Limited air strikes on North Vietnamese targets by unmarked planes flown exclusively by non-US aircrews.

However, McCone did not believe these military actions alone could lead to an escalation of the situation because the &quot;fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists&quot;. In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on July 28, 1964, McCone explained:

Barely a month after the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy warned that further provocations should not be undertaken until October, when the government of South Vietnam (GVN) would become fully prepared for a full-scale war against North Vietnam. In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on September 8, 1964, Bundy wrote:

While maritime operations played a key role in the provocation of North Vietnam, U.S. military officials had initially proposed to fly a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over the country, but this was to be replaced by other plans.

=== Ellsberg meets Sheehan ===
Daniel Ellsberg knew the leaders of the task force well. He had worked as an aide to McNaughton from 1964 to 1965, had worked on the study for several months in 1967, and Gelb and Halperin approved his access to the work at RAND in 1969. Now opposing the war, Ellsberg and his friend Anthony Russo photocopied the study in October 1969 intending to disclose it. Ellsberg approached Nixon&#x27;s National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Senators William Fulbright and George McGovern, and others, but none were interested.

Ellsberg showed some of the documents privately to sympathetic policy experts Marcus Raskin and Ralph Stavins of the Institute for Policy Studies. They declined to publish the papers, but passed on some of them to, and recommended he seek &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Neil Sheehan, whom Ellsberg had first met in Vietnam and was reintroduced to by Raskin and Stavins. After discussing them in February 1971, Ellsberg gave 43 of the volumes to Sheehan on March 2. Ellsberg had initially requested that Sheehan only take notes of the study in Ellsberg&#x27;s apartment; Sheehan disobeyed, frantically copying them in numerous shops in the Boston area at the urging of and with help from his wife Susan Sheehan, and flying with the copies to Washington, where he and an editor there worked in a hotel room at The Jefferson to organize and read them. Editors A. M. Rosenthal and James L. Greenfield had the copies delivered by mail first to Greenfield&#x27;s apartment, then Greenfield and his wife drove them to multiple rooms at the New York Hilton Midtown, where Sheehan, Rosenthal, Greenfield, deputy foreign editors Gerald Gold and Allan M. Siegal, and a team of three writers Fox Butterfield, Hedrick Smith, and E. W. Kenworthy, and researcher Linda Amster worked around the clock to organize and summarize them for publication. Before publication, &quot;The New York Times&quot; sought legal advice. The paper&#x27;s regular outside counsel, Lord Day &amp; Lord, advised against publication, but in-house counsel James Goodale prevailed with his argument that the press had a First Amendment right to publish information significant to the people&#x27;s understanding of their government&#x27;s policy.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; began publishing excerpts on June 13, 1971; the first article in the series was titled &quot;Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces Three Decades of Growing US Involvement&quot;. The study was dubbed the Pentagon Papers during the resulting media publicity. Street protests, political controversy, and lawsuits followed.

=== Entry into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; ===

To ensure the possibility of public debate about the papers&#x27; content, on June 29, US Senator Mike Gravel, an Alaska Democrat, entered 4,100 pages of the papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These portions of the papers, which were edited for Gravel by Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky, and given directly to Gravel by Ben Bagdikian, the then-national editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in a June 26 meeting in front of the Mayflower Hotel at midnight, were smuggled into Gravel&#x27;s congressional office and guarded zealously by disabled Vietnam veterans beforehand, and subsequently published by Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations. A federal grand jury was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report. Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was subpoenaed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. Gravel asked the court (in &quot;Gravel v. United States&quot;) to quash the subpoena on the basis of the Speech or Debate Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the United States Constitution.

That clause provides that &quot;for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Senator or Representative] shall not be questioned in any other Place&quot;, meaning that Gravel could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor, and, by extension, for anything entered to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, allowing the papers to be publicly read without threat of a treason trial and conviction. When Gravel&#x27;s request was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court denied the request to extend this protection to Gravel or Rodberg because the grand jury subpoena served on them related to a third party rather than any act they themselves committed for the preparation of materials later entered into the Congressional Record. Nevertheless, the grand jury investigation was halted, and the publication of the papers was never prosecuted.

Later, Ellsberg said the documents &quot;demonstrated unconstitutional behavior by a succession of presidents, the violation of their oath and the violation of the oath of every one of their subordinates.&quot; He added that he leaked the Papers to end what he perceived to be &quot;a wrongful war&quot;; in an interview in 2015, Neil Sheehan described Ellsberg&#x27;s state of mind at the time as &quot;totally conflicted&quot; between getting the Papers published and not wanting to go to prison.

=== The Nixon administration&#x27;s restraint of the media ===
President Nixon at first planned to do nothing about publication of the study, since it embarrassed the Johnson and Kennedy administrations rather than his; however, Kissinger convinced the president that not opposing the publication set a negative precedent for future secrets. It has also been suggested that Kissinger&#x27;s previous work with Ellsberg at Rand would damage his standing in Nixon&#x27;s eyes and that he therefore sought to distance himself from Ellsberg, in addition Kissinger feared that Ellsberg could leak other defense secrets, including nuclear targeting. The administration argued Ellsberg and Russo were guilty of a felony under the Espionage Act of 1917, because they had no authority to publish classified documents. After failing to persuade &quot;The New York Times&quot; to voluntarily cease publication on June 14, Attorney General John N. Mitchell and Nixon obtained a federal court injunction forcing &quot;The New York Times&quot; to cease publication after three articles. &quot;The New York Times&quot; publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger said:

The newspaper appealed the injunction, and the case &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; quickly rose through the U.S. legal system to the Supreme Court.

On June 18, 1971, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began publishing its own series of articles based upon the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;; Ellsberg had given portions to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter and former RAND Corporation colleague Ben Bagdikian in a Boston-area motel earlier that week. Bagdikian flew with the portions to Washington and physically presented them to executive editor Ben Bradlee at the latter&#x27;s house in the Georgetown neighborhood; Bradlee set up a team of writers, lawyers and editors to hide out in his house and organize the portions. Bagdikian later met with Mike Gravel in front of the Mayflower Hotel on June 26 to give him copies. On June 18, Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Rehnquist asked &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in U.S. district court. Judge Murray Gurfein declined to issue such an injunction, writing that &quot;[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.&quot; The government appealed that decision, and on June 26 the Supreme Court agreed to hear it jointly with &quot;The New York Times&quot; case. Fifteen other newspapers received copies of the study and began publishing it. According to Ellsberg in 2017 and 2021, 19 newspapers in total eventually drew on the &quot;Papers&quot; for their investigative work; the &quot;Post&quot; then-court reporter Sanford J. Ungar wrote in his May 1972 book &quot;The Papers and The Papers&quot; that aside from the &quot;Times&quot; and the &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; had also been brought to court by the Nixon administration over coverage of the &quot;Papers&quot;.

=== The Supreme Court allows further publication ===

On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court decided, 6–3, that the government failed to meet the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint injunction. The nine justices wrote nine opinions disagreeing on significant, substantive matters.

Thomas Tedford and Dale Herbeck summarized the reaction of editors and journalists at the time:

=== Legal charges against Ellsberg ===
Ellsberg surrendered to authorities at the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office in Boston on June 28, and admitted that he had given the papers to the press: &quot;I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision&quot;. He was indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of stealing and holding secret documents. Federal District Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr. declared a mistrial and dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973, after it was revealed that agents acting on the orders of the Nixon administration illegally broke into the office of Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist and attempted to steal files; representatives of the Nixon administration approached the Ellsberg trial judge with an offer of the job of FBI directorship; several irregularities appeared in the government&#x27;s case including its claim that it had lost records of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg conducted by the White House Plumbers in the contemporaneous Watergate scandal. Byrne ruled: &quot;The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case.&quot; Ellsberg and Russo were freed due to the mistrial; they were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act.

In March 1972, political scientist Samuel L. Popkin, then assistant professor of Government at Harvard University, was jailed for a week for his refusal to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; case, during a hearing before the Boston Federal District Court. The Faculty Council later passed a resolution condemning the government&#x27;s interrogation of scholars on the grounds that &quot;an unlimited right of grand juries to ask any question and to expose a witness to citations for contempt could easily threaten scholarly research&quot;.

Gelb estimated that &quot;The New York Times&quot; only published about five percent of the study&#x27;s 7,000 pages. The Beacon Press edition was also incomplete. Halperin, who had originally classified the study as secret, obtained most of the unpublished portions under the Freedom of Information Act and the University of Texas published them in 1983. The National Security Archive published the remaining portions in 2002. The study itself remained formally classified until 2011.

== Impact ==
The &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; revealed that the United States had expanded its war with the bombing of Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which had been reported by the American media. The most damaging revelations in the papers revealed that four administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson) had misled the public regarding their intentions. For example, the Eisenhower administration actively worked against the Geneva Accords. The Kennedy administration knew of plans to overthrow South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem before his death in the November 1963 coup. Johnson had decided to expand the war while promising &quot;we seek no wider war&quot; during his 1964 presidential campaign, including plans to bomb North Vietnam well before the 1964 United States presidential election. President Johnson had been outspoken against doing so during the election and claimed that his opponent Barry Goldwater was the one that wanted to bomb North Vietnam.

In another example, a memo from the Defense Department under the Johnson Administration listed the reasons for American persistence:
* 70% – To avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor).
* 20% – To keep [South Vietnam] (and the adjacent) territory from Chinese hands.
* 10% – To permit the people [of South Vietnam] to enjoy a better, freer way of life.
* ALSO – To emerge from the crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used.
* NOT – To help a friend, although it would be hard to stay in if asked out.

Another controversy was that Johnson sent combat troops to Vietnam by July 17, 1965, before pretending to consult his advisors on July 21–27, per the cable stating that &quot;Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance informs McNamara that President had approved 34 Battalion Plan and will try to push through reserve call-up.&quot;

In 1988, when that cable was declassified, it revealed &quot;there was a continuing uncertainty as to [Johnson&#x27;s] final decision, which would have to await Secretary McNamara&#x27;s recommendation and the views of Congressional leaders, particularly the views of Senator [Richard] Russell.&quot;

Nixon&#x27;s Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold later called the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; an example of &quot;massive overclassification&quot; with &quot;no trace of a threat to the national security&quot;. The Pentagon Papers&#x27; publication had little or no effect on the ongoing war because they dealt with documents written years before publication.

After the release of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, Barry Goldwater said:

Senator Birch Bayh, who thought the publishing of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; was justified, said:

In 1991, Les Gelb said the following:
Gelb reflected in 2018 that many people have misunderstood the most important lessons of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;:

==Full release in 2011==

On May 4, 2011, the National Archives and Records Administration announced that the papers would be declassified and released to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, on June 13, 2011. The release date included the Nixon, Kennedy, and Johnson Libraries and the Archives office in College Park, Maryland.

The full release was coordinated by the Archives&#x27;s National Declassification Center (NDC) as a special project to mark the anniversary of the report. There were still eleven words that the agencies having classification control over the material wanted to redact, and the NDC worked with them, successfully, to prevent that redaction. It is unknown which 11 words were at issue and the government has declined requests to identify them, but the issue was made moot when it was pointed out that those words had already been made public, in a version of the documents released by the House Armed Services Committee in 1972.

The Archives released each volume of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; as a separate PDF file, available on their website.

<doc id="230027" wikidata="Q2122090" url="?curid=230027" title="Quality time">
<text>Quality time is a sociology expression referring to a proactive interaction between individuals, set aside for paying undivided attention, usually to express love or accomplish a shared goal.

Sometimes abbreviated QT, it is an informal reference to time spent with close family, partners, or friends that is in some way important, special, productive or profitable to one or everyone involved. Having conversations, solving jigsaw puzzles, collaborating on projects, and conversing during road trips can be examples of quality time. It may also refer to the effective use of time in educational settings, or time spent alone performing a favorite activity (i.e., self-care).

In his 1992 book, Baptist pastor and Relationship counselor Gary Chapman suggests that quality time is one of five &quot;Love Languages&quot; which are used (more or less, preferentially, by a given individual) to express love and gratitude for another.

==History==
Its use as a noun expression (&quot;quality time&quot;) began in the 1970s. One of the earliest records of this phrase in print was in the Annapolis newspaper &quot;The Capital&quot;, January 1973, in the article &quot;How To Be Liberated&quot;:
In the context of public schooling, the National Commission on Excellence in Education began to use the phrase circa 1983. &quot;Quality time&quot; was described in a 1983 letter by the principal of Hampton High School to U.S. Secretary of Education Terrell Bell. Principal Scholtz wrote, &quot;Quality time will be enhanced by reducing that time spent by teachers on discipline and on administrative duties&quot; and thereby &quot;freeing teachers to do what they do best...teach&quot;.

By 1985, the phrase was in common use in books about parenting and parenting styles. Examples include &quot;A Parents&#x27; Guide to Quality Time with Preschoolers&quot; (1984), &quot;The Quality Time Almanac: A Sourcebook of Ideas and Activities for Parents and Kids&quot; (1986), and &quot;Parentips: Quality Time with Kids&quot; (1986).

Gary Champan&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;The Five Love Languages&quot; defined and popularized the phrase&#x27;s contemporary usage. 

&quot;Quality Time&quot; is also the title of a 1996 fiction (likely romance) novel by British author Norma Curtis.

&quot;The Time Bind&quot;, a 1997 book, was mentioned in Newsweek&#x27;s multi-page feature about &quot;The Myth of Quality Time&quot;. The same issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot; had a full-page review of another 1997 book, &quot;Time for Life&quot;, which emphasizes that most people have a flawed &quot;ability to separate faulty perception of time use from reality.&quot; Author Robinson&#x27;s diary-based research shows that 15 hours per week of &quot;free time&quot; (the greatest category of time used) goes into TV viewing.

<doc id="230033" wikidata="Q653664" url="?curid=230033" title="Battle of Trenton">
<text>The Battle of Trenton was a small but pivotal American Revolutionary War battle on the morning of December 26, 1776, in Trenton, New Jersey. After General George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian auxiliaries garrisoned at Trenton. After a brief battle, almost two-thirds of the Hessian force were captured, with negligible losses to the Americans. The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army&#x27;s waning morale, and inspired re-enlistments.

The Continental Army had previously suffered several defeats in New York and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania. Morale in the army was low; to end the year on a positive note, George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, devised a plan to cross the Delaware River on the night of December 25–26 (Christmas and St. Stephen&#x27;s Day) and surround the Hessians&#x27; garrison.

Because the river was icy and the weather severe, the crossing proved dangerous. Two detachments were unable to cross the river, leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault, 3,000 fewer than planned. The army marched south to Trenton. The Hessians had lowered their guard, thinking they were safe from the Americans&#x27; army, and had no long-distance outposts or patrols. Washington&#x27;s forces caught them off guard, and after a short but fierce resistance, most of the Hessians surrendered and were captured, with just over a third escaping across Assunpink Creek.

Despite the battle&#x27;s small numbers, the victory inspired patriots and sympathizers of the newly formed United States. With the success of the ongoing revolution in doubt a week earlier, the army had seemed on the verge of collapse. The dramatic victory inspired soldiers to believe the war was not a lost cause and serve longer. It also attracted new recruits to the ranks.

==Background==
In early December 1776, American morale was very low. The Americans had been ousted from New York by the British and their Hessian auxiliaries, and the Continental Army was forced to retreat across New Jersey. Ninety percent of the Continental Army soldiers who had served at Long Island were gone. Men had deserted, feeling that the cause for independence was lost. Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, expressed some doubts, writing to his cousin in Virginia, &quot;I think the game is pretty near up.&quot;

At the time a small town in New Jersey, Trenton was occupied by four regiments of Hessian soldiers (numbering about 1,400 men) commanded by Colonel Johann Rall. Washington&#x27;s force comprised 2,400 men, with infantry divisions commanded by Major Generals Nathanael Greene and John Sullivan, and artillery under the direction of Brigadier General Henry Knox.

==Prelude==
===Intelligence===
George Washington had stationed a spy named John Honeyman, posing as a Tory, in Trenton. Honeyman had served with Major General James Wolfe in Quebec at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759, and had no trouble establishing his credentials as a Tory. Honeyman was a butcher and bartender, who traded with the British and Hessians. This enabled him to gather intelligence and to convince the Hessians that the Continental Army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack Trenton. Shortly before Christmas, he arranged to be captured by the Continental Army, who had orders to bring him to Washington unharmed. After being questioned by Washington, he was imprisoned in a hut to be tried as a Tory in the morning, but a small fire broke out nearby, enabling him to &quot;escape&quot;. On the evening before the battle, Hessian commander Rall was celebrating Christmas with his troops at the farm of Abraham Hunt, a wealthy merchant and farmer of Trenton. Hunt played the role of a friendly Loyalist host, giving Rall a false sense of serenity while Washington and his troops were preparing for a surprise attack.

===U.S. plan===
The U.S. plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three directions. General John Cadwalader would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, New Jersey, to block off reinforcements from the south. General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping. The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river north of Trenton and split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch a pre-dawn attack. Sullivan would attack the town from the south, and Greene from the north. Depending on the success of the operation, the Americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on Princeton and New Brunswick.

During the week before the battle, U.S. advance parties began to ambush enemy cavalry patrols, capturing dispatch riders and attacking Hessian pickets. The Hessian commander, to emphasize the danger his men were facing, sent 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to deliver a letter to the British commander at Princeton. Washington ordered Ewing and his Pennsylvania militia to try to gain information on Hessian movements and technology. Ewing instead made three successful raids across the river. On December 17 and 18, 1776, they attacked an outpost of &quot;jägers&quot; and on the 21st, they set fire to several houses. Washington put constant watches on all possible crossings near the Continental Army encampment on the Delaware, as he believed William Howe would launch an attack from the north on Philadelphia if the river froze over.

On December 20, 1776, some 2,000 troops led by General Sullivan arrived in Washington&#x27;s camp. They had been under the command of Charles Lee and had been moving slowly through northern New Jersey when Lee was captured. That same day, an additional 800 troops arrived from Fort Ticonderoga under the command of Horatio Gates.

===Hessian moves===
On December 14, 1776, the Hessians arrived in Trenton to establish their winter quarters. At the time, Trenton was a small town with about 100 houses and two main streets, King (now Warren) Street and Queen (now Broad) Street. Carl von Donop, Rall&#x27;s superior, had marched south to Mount Holly on December 22 to deal with the resistance in New Jersey, and had clashed with some New Jersey militia there on December 23.

Donop, who despised Rall, was reluctant to give command of Trenton to him. Rall was known to be loud and unacquainted with the English language, but he was also a 36-year veteran with a great deal of battle experience. His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General James Grant, who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers. Despite Rall&#x27;s experience, the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander.

Trenton lacked city walls or fortifications, which was typical of U.S. settlements. Some Hessian officers advised Rall to fortify the town, and two of his engineers advised that a redoubt be constructed at the upper end of town and fortifications be built along the river. The engineers went so far as to draw up plans, but Rall disagreed with them. When Rall was again urged to fortify the town, he replied, &quot;Let them come ... We will go at them with the bayonet.&quot;

As Christmas approached, Loyalists came to Trenton to report the Americans were planning action. U.S. deserters told the Hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across the river. Rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense, but privately in letters to his superiors, he said he was worried about an imminent attack. He wrote to Donop that he was &quot;liable to be attacked at any moment&quot;. Rall said that Trenton was &quot;indefensible&quot; and asked that British troops establish a garrison in Maidenhead (now Lawrenceville). Close to Trenton, this would help defend the roads from Americans. His request was denied. As the Americans disrupted Hessian supply lines, the officers started to share Rall&#x27;s fears. One wrote, &quot;We have not slept one night in peace since we came to this place.&quot; On December 22, 1776, a spy reported to Grant that Washington had called a council of war; Grant told Rall to &quot;be on your guard&quot;.

The main Hessian force of 1,500 men was divided into three regiments: Knyphausen, Lossberg and Rall. That night, they did not send out any patrols because of the severe weather.

===Crossing and march===

Before Washington and his troops left, Benjamin Rush came to cheer up the general. While he was there, he saw a note Washington had written, saying, &quot;Victory or Death&quot;. Those words would be the password for the surprise attack. Each soldier carried 60 rounds of ammunition, and three days of rations. When the army arrived at the shores of the Delaware, they were already behind schedule, and clouds began to form above them. It began to rain. As the air&#x27;s temperature dropped, the rain changed to sleet, and then to snow. The Americans began to cross the river, with John Glover in command. The men went across in Durham boats, while the horses and artillery went across on large ferries. The 14th Continental Regiment of Glover manned the boats. During the crossing, several men fell overboard, including Colonel John Haslet. Haslet was quickly pulled out of the water. No one died during the crossing, and all the artillery pieces made it over in good condition.

Two small detachments of infantry of about 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns. They set roadblocks ahead of the main army and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town. One of the groups was sent north of Trenton, and the other was sent to block River Road, which ran along the Delaware River to Trenton.
The terrible weather conditions delayed the landings in New Jersey until 3:00 am; the plan was that they were supposed to be completed by 12:00 am. Washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre-dawn attack. Another setback occurred for the Americans, as generals Cadwalader and Ewing were unable to join the attack because of the weather conditions.

At 4:00 am, the soldiers began to march towards Trenton. Along the way, several civilians joined as volunteers and led as guides (such as John Mott) because of their knowledge of the terrain. After marching through winding roads into the wind, they reached Bear Tavern, where they turned south onto Bear Tavern Road . The ground was slippery, but it was level, making it easier for the horses and artillery. They began to make better time. They soon reached Jacobs Creek, where, with difficulty, the Americans made it across. The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham (now West Trenton), where they split apart, with Greene&#x27;s force heading east to approach Trenton by the Scotch and Pennington roads and Sullivan&#x27;s heading southwest to approach via River Road. Soon after, they reached the house of Benjamin Moore, where the family offered food and drink to Washington. At this point, the first signs of daylight began to appear. Many of the troops did not have boots, so they were forced to wear rags around their feet. Some of the men&#x27;s feet bled, turning the snow to a dark red. Two men died on the march.

As they marched, Washington rode up and down the line, encouraging the men to continue. General Sullivan sent a courier to tell Washington that the weather was wetting his men&#x27;s gunpowder. Washington replied, &quot;Tell General Sullivan to use the bayonet. I am resolved to take Trenton.&quot;

About outside the town, the main columns reunited with the advance parties. They were startled by the sudden appearance of 50 armed men, but they were American. Led by Adam Stephen, they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton and had attacked a Hessian outpost. Washington feared the Hessians would have been put on guard, and shouted at Stephen, &quot;You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard.&quot; Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and that there would be no further action that day.

==Battle==
===U.S. attack===

At 8 am on the morning of December 26, the Hessians established an outpost at a cooper shop on Pennington Road about one mile northwest of Trenton. Washington then led the assault on it, riding in front of his soldiers. As the Hessian commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Andreas Wiederholdt, left the shop, an American fired at him but missed. Wiederholdt immediately shouted, &quot;Der Feind!&quot; (The Enemy!) and other Hessians came out. The Americans fired three volleys, and the Hessians returned one of their own. Washington ordered Edward Hand&#x27;s Pennsylvania Riflemen and a battalion of German-speaking infantry to block the road that led to Princeton. They attacked the Hessian outpost there. Wiederholdt soon realized that this was more than a raiding party; seeing other Hessians retreating from the outpost, he led his men to do the same. Both Hessian detachments made organized retreats, firing as they fell back. On the high ground at the north end of Trenton, they were joined by a duty company from the Lossberg Regiment. They engaged the Americans, retreating slowly, keeping up continuous fire and using houses for cover. Once in Trenton, they gained covering fire from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town. Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid, leaving open the River Road into Trenton. Washington ordered the escape route to Princeton be cut off, sending infantry in battle formation to block it, while artillery formed at the head of King and Queen streets.

Leading the southern U.S. column, General Sullivan entered Trenton by the abandoned River Road and blocked the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek to cut off the Hessian escape. Sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure Greene&#x27;s division had time to drive the Hessians from their outposts in the north. Soon after, they continued their advance, attacking the Hermitage, home of Philemon Dickinson, where 50 jägers under the command of Lieutenant von Grothausen were stationed. Lieutenant von Grothausen brought 12 of his jägers into action against the advanced guard but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of Americans advancing to the Hermitage. Pulling back to the Hessian barracks, he was joined by the rest of the jägers. After the exchange of one volley, they turned and ran, some trying to swim across the creek, while others escaped over the bridge, which had not yet been cut off. The 20 British dragoons also fled. As Greene and Sullivan&#x27;s columns pushed into the town, Washington moved to high ground north of King and Queens streets to see the action and direct his troops. By this time, U.S. artillery from the other side of the Delaware River had come into action, devastating the Hessian positions.

With the sounding of the alarm, the three Hessian regiments began to prepare for battle. The Rall regiment formed on lower King Street along with the Lossberg regiment, while the Knyphausen regiment formed at the lower end of Queen Street. Lieutenant Piel, Rall&#x27;s brigade adjutant, woke his commander, who found that the rebels had taken the &quot;V&quot; of the main streets of the town. This is where the engineers had recommended building a redoubt. Rall ordered his regiment to form up at the lower end of King Street, the Lossberg regiment to prepare for an advance up Queen Street, and the Knyphausen regiment to stand by as a reserve for Rall&#x27;s advance up King Street.

The U.S. cannon stationed at the head of the two main streets soon came into action. In reply, Rall directed his regiment, supported by a few companies of the Lossberg regiment, to clear the guns. The Hessians formed ranks and began to advance up the street, but their formations were quickly broken by the U.S. guns and fire from Mercer&#x27;s men who had taken houses on the left side of the street. Breaking ranks, the Hessians fled. Rall ordered two three-pound cannons into action. After getting off six rounds each, within just a few minutes, half of the Hessians manning their guns were killed by the U.S. cannon. After the men fled to cover behind houses and fences, their cannons were taken by the Americans. Following capture of the cannons, men under the command of George Weedon advanced down King Street.

On Queen Street, all Hessian attempts to advance up the street were repulsed by guns under the command of Thomas Forrest. After firing four rounds each, two more Hessian guns were silenced. One of Forrest&#x27;s howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle. The Knyphausen regiment became separated from the Lossberg and the Rall regiments. The Lossberg and the Rall regiments fell back to a field outside of town, taking heavy losses from grapeshot and musket fire. In the southern part of the town, Americans under command of Sullivan began to overwhelm the Hessians. John Stark led a bayonet charge at the Knyphausen regiment, whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire. Sullivan led a column of men to block off escape of troops across the creek.

===Hessian resistance collapses===
The Hessians in the field attempted to reorganize and make one last attempt to retake the town so they could make a breakout. Rall decided to attack the U.S. flank on the heights north of the town. Rall yelled &quot;Forward! Advance! Advance!&quot;, and the Hessians began to move, with the brigade&#x27;s band playing fifes, bugles and drums to help the Hessians&#x27; spirit.

Washington, still on high ground, saw the Hessians approaching the U.S. flank. He moved his troops to assume battle formation against the enemy. The two Hessian regiments began marching toward King Street but were caught in U.S. fire that came at them from three directions. Some Americans had taken up defensive positions inside houses, reducing their exposure. Some civilians joined the fight against the Hessians. Despite this, they continued to push, recapturing their cannons. At the head of King Street, Knox saw the Hessians had retaken the cannons and ordered his troops to take them. Six men ran and, after a brief struggle, seized the cannons, turning them on the Hessians. With most of the Hessians unable to fire their guns, the attack stalled. The Hessians&#x27; formations broke, and they began to scatter. Rall was mortally wounded. Washington led his troops down from high ground while yelling, &quot;March on, my brave fellows, after me!&quot; Most of the Hessians retreated into an orchard, with the Americans in close pursuit. Quickly surrounded, the Hessians were offered terms of surrender, to which they agreed.

Although ordered to join Rall, the remains of the Knyphausen regiment mistakenly marched in the opposite direction. They tried to escape across the bridge but found it had been taken. The Americans quickly swept in, defeating a Hessian attempt to break through their lines. Surrounded by Sullivan&#x27;s men, the regiment surrendered, just minutes after the rest of the brigade.

===Casualties and capture===
The Hessian forces lost 22 killed in action, including their commander Colonel Johann Rall, 83 wounded, and 896 capturedincluding the wounded. The Americans suffered only two deaths during the march and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal shoulder wound to future president James Monroe. Other losses incurred by the patriots from exhaustion, exposure, and illness in the following days may have raised their fatalities above those of the Hessians.

The captured Hessians were sent to Philadelphia and later Lancaster. In 1777 they were moved to Virginia. Rall was mortally wounded and died later that night at his headquarters. All four Hessian colonels in Trenton were killed in the battle. The Lossberg regiment was effectively removed from the British forces. Parts of the Knyphausen regiment escaped to the south, but Sullivan captured some 200 additional men, along with the regiment&#x27;s cannon and supplies. They also captured approximately 1,000 arms and much-needed ammunition. The Americans also captured their entire store of provisions—tons of flour, dried and salted meats, ale and other liquors, as well as shoes, boots, clothing and bedding—things that were as much needed by the ragtag Continental forces as weapons and horses.

Among those captured by the Patriots was Christian Strenge, later to become a schoolmaster and fraktur artist in Pennsylvania.

===Hessian drinking===
An officer in Washington&#x27;s staff wrote before the battle, &quot;They make a great deal of Christmas in Germany, and no doubt the Hessians will drink a great deal of beer and have a dance to-night. They will be sleepy tomorrow morning.&quot; Popular history commonly portrays the Hessians as drunk from Christmas celebrations. However, historian David Hackett Fischer quotes Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, &quot;I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as I could see, even a piece of bread eaten.&quot; Military historian Edward G. Lengel wrote, &quot;The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk.&quot;

==Aftermath==
After the Hessians&#x27; surrender, Washington is reported to have shaken the hand of a young officer and said, &quot;This is a glorious day for our country.&quot; On December 28, General Washington interviewed Lieutenant (later Colonel) Andreas Wiederhold, who detailed the failures of Rall&#x27;s preparation. Washington soon learned, however, that Cadwalader and Ewing had been unable to complete their crossing, leaving his worn-out army of 2,400 men isolated. Without their 2,400 men, Washington realized he did not have the forces to attack Princeton and New Brunswick.

By noon, Washington&#x27;s force had moved across the Delaware back into Pennsylvania, taking their prisoners and captured supplies with them. Washington would follow up his success a week later in the Battle of the Assunpink Creek and the Battle of Princeton solidifying Patriot gains.

==Legacy==
This small but decisive battle, as with the later Battle of Cowpens, had an effect disproportionate to its size. The Patriot victory gave the Continental Congress new confidence, as it proved colonial forces could defeat the British in the future. It also increased re-enlistments in the Continental Army forces. By defeating a European army, the colonials reduced the fear that the Hessians had caused earlier that year after the fighting in New York. Howe was stunned that the Patriots so easily surprised and overwhelmed the Hessian garrison. Colonial support for the rebellion was further buoyed significantly at this time by writings of Thomas Paine and additional successful actions by the New Jersey Militia.

Two notable U.S. officers were wounded while leading the charge down King Street: William Washington, cousin of General Washington, and Lieutenant James Monroe, the future President of the United States. Monroe was carried from the field bleeding badly after he was struck in the left shoulder by a musket ball, which severed an artery. Doctor John Riker clamped the artery, preventing him from bleeding to death.

The Trenton Battle Monument, erected at &quot;Five Points&quot; in Trenton, stands as a tribute to this U.S. victory. The crossing of the Delaware River and battle are reenacted by local enthusiasts every year (unless the weather is too severe on the river).

Eight current Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn, 103rd Eng Bn, A/1-104th Cav, 111th Inf, 125th QM Co, 175th Inf, 181st Inf and 198th Sig Bn) and one currently-active Regular Army Artillery battalion (1–5th FA) are derived from U.S. units that participated in the Battle of Trenton. There are thirty current units of the U.S. Army with colonial roots.

===Painting===
In 1851, German-American artist Emanuel Leutze painted the second of three paintings depicting Washington crossing the Delaware. It is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and is &quot;one of the most famous American paintings.&quot; At the time of its first exhibition it caused a sensation, in Europe and the United States. Leutze hoped it would stir revolutionary sentiments in Germany. After six months in Germany it was shipped to New York City where the &quot;New-York Mirror&quot; newspaper lauded it with the words, &quot;the grandest, most majestic, and most effective painting ever exhibited in America.&quot; The painting is the center-piece of the collections in the American Wing. It is still one of the most recognizable paintings at the Metropolitan. It is central to the canon of American historical art images, its monumental popularity undimmed in the years since it was first exhibited.

<doc id="230049" wikidata="Q2551656" url="?curid=230049" title="Shozo Shimamoto">
<text>was a Japanese artist. Having studied with Jirō Yoshihara, the future Gutai leader, from 1947, Shimamoto was a key founding member of Gutai along with Yoshihara and fifteen others in August, 1954. He was close to the leader Yoshihara and actively engaged in the early activities and group administrations. He worked with a wide variety of techniques, such as poking holes in layered newspaper, throwing bottles of paint at canvases, experimenting with film and stage performances, and composing sound art. He was particularly noted for his innovative performance art. Indeed, when Yoshihara turned to focus more on painting, upon his meeting with the French art critic Michel Tapié, Shimamoto continued to urge the leader to pursue this direction, wanting to work with Allan Kaprow, for example.

After Gutai, he became known for his mail art activities with the group AU and the continuation of his painting performances which he staged around the world. He died of acute heart failure in Nishinomiya City, Hyōgo prefecture.

== Early years ==
Shimamoto was a student of Yoshihara’s beginning when he was nineteen, in 1947.

In 1950, he graduated from the School of Humanities, Kwansei Gakuin University in 1950.

==Hole Series and early work==
Shimamoto has cited the calligraphy work of Nantembō as an early influence, noting that “The thing that surprised me most when I went to see this master was that he used a very large paintbrush and with this he created much larger works than he contemporaries.” Of his early works from 1950 he has described “a single arrow sign on a piece of paper, a picture of only one circle drawn on the canvas, and a hole made on the center of the canvas, etc.” The latter of these refers to his “Hole” series, in which he perforated the picture plane of the painting. These works were developed out of the economic conditions following the Second World War and his inability to afford canvas. By glueing together layers of newspaper, he created a new kind of support which he called “paper-vas.” The paper-vas was adhered with a glue made from flour and water, onto which a final layer of brown cartridge paper was glued and then painted white. He found that when painting the support would tear where the glue had not dried completely. The tearing of the support inspired him to make a series of works with perforated paper-vas, resulting in artworks like his 1950 &quot;Work (Holes).&quot; In this work, the white, monochromatic surface appears on the verge of crumbling from a series of aggressive pencil gestures. A similar work, &quot;Holes&quot; (1954), is in the collection of the Tate Modern.

Prior to these works, Yoshihara had been little impressed by Shimamoto&#x27;s efforts, discouraging him from pursuing painting as a career after some time. Motivated by the challenge, Shimamoto promised him a painting that hadn&#x27;t been painted before. This caused Shimamoto to create the first paper-vas work, for which Yoshihara enthusiastically praised him. Shimamoto recounted that when he had shown his first Hole work to Yoshihara, they “both felt that something great had been accomplished.” He then locked himself in his room and produced more using the same method to which Yoshihara, according to Shimamoto, “gave them a glance and just told me that he had seen this stuff before.” Yoshihara discouraged him from continuing the series when they first encountered the “buchi” works of Lucio Fontana which also pierce the surface of the painting. Although the works were made contemporaneously and without knowledge of one another (according to Shimamoto), Yoshihara felt that Shimamoto&#x27;s works would inevitably be regarded as derivative due to biases of the art world at the time. As Alexandra Munroe suggests, these works “defiantly opposed established notions of permanence in abstract modernist painting and introduced hin (poverty)—the appreciation of minimal and naturally weathered objects as cultivated in the arts of tea— into the context of contemporary Japanese art.” As such, the Hole series “represents the beginning of a Gutai Style” for Munroe.

==Activities with Gutai Art Association==
In 1954, Shimamoto participated in the “Second Genbi Exhibition,” showcasing the artist of the Gendai Bijutsu Kondankai (Contemporary Art Discussion Group) started by Hiroshi Muramatsu and strongly influenced by Yoshihara. The group sought to rethink hierarchy on every level of the art world. The exhibition, held at the Asahi Biru Gallery in Kobe, brought together many young Kansai-based artists who would soon establish Gutai with Yoshihara. Shimamoto was responsible for proposing the name Gutai, translated from Japanese as “concrete” or “embodied.” Of this name he has explained, “We did not want to show our feeling indirectly or abstractly.” Shimamoto is also responsible for approaching members of the Zero-kai group, Kazuo Shiraga, Saburo Murakami, Atsuko Tanaka, and Akira Kanayama, to join Gutai after some of the initial members left. Shimamoto&#x27;s house became the first headquarters for the group, and is where the first Gutai journal was published.

Shimamoto also contributed to Gutai through his writing, published in the Gutai journal. This attitude toward painting is also shown in his 1957 text “The Idea of Executing the Paintbrush,” in which he writes, “I believe that the first thing we should do is to set paint free from the paintbrush.” He furthermore advocates the recognition that “a color without matiére cannot exist” and that therefore the artist should paint in a manner that “takes advantage of the texture of the paint and gives it a lively feeling.” In one article, “Mambo and Painting,” Shimamoto argued for the destruction of “the values established by the art elite” through the creative incorporation of audience participation. In opposition to the art “elite,” Shimamoto wrote, “it would never due for those elitist to consider a masterpiece a painting made by dancing the mambo on a canvas.”

In July 1955 Shimamoto created his work &quot;Please Walk on Here&quot; as a part of the “Experimental Outdoor Exhibition of Modern Art to Challenge the Midsummer Sun” in Ashiya City. The work consisted of two narrow sets of wooden boards arranged in a straight path. One set was stable to walk on while the other was unstable, akin to a broken rope bridge. At this exhibition Shimamoto also showed a metal giant plate perforated with small holes, a development on his former Hole series though this time as a means to intervene in the viewer&#x27;s engagement with space. The plate was painted white on one side and blue on the other and was illuminated from behinds with a lamp in the evenings. &quot;Please Walk on Here&quot; was reproduced and exhibited on the occasion of the 1993 Venice Biennale.

One aspect of the elitist attitude toward art to which Shimamoto set himself in opposition seems to be the myth of artistic genius and intentionality against which he utilized accidental and incidental forms of mark-making. “I think that superior paintings can be made by paint spilt over after accidentally dropping a ball from the second floor and knocking over a can of paint… in that act there is no superfluous action or ambition.” This rejection of the conventional valorization of the artist or the artwork can also be read when he writes that, “When one’s irrepressible excitement is expressed, and it is linked to the past through direct expression, the value of the art lies not in the artist nor in the work. It lies in the will to create.” As art historian Joan Kee notes, Shimamoto&#x27;s activities in the early years of Gutai are indicative of the group&#x27;s “a singular kind of expression” that is neither easily categorizable as Action Painting nor ‘Happening.’

This experimentation with unconventional materials and methods as a means to painterly originality continued in Shimamoto&#x27;s early Gutai work. In the Gutai Open Air Exhibition of July 1956, Shimamoto built a cannon using acetylene combustion out of which he shot paint on a sheet of red vinyl to produce &quot;Cannon Work&quot;. The performance was accompanied with background music. In October of that same year, he produced &quot;Breaking Open the Object&quot; in which he filled glass bottles with paint and shattered them on an unstretched canvas beneath him. This “Bottle Crash” method of painting, as he called it, would become a signature method of performing his painting. In an interview with Lorenzo Mango, Shimamoto describes one impetus for his initial experiments that led to the use of cannons and the “Bottle Crash” method. As opposed to the athleticism required or Kazuo Shiraga and Saburo Murakami’s activities, Shimamoto says, “I, being physically weaker than them, thought of throwing bottles filled with color paint or making it explode with a cannon.” While he initially was frustrated that media outlets would cover his unconventional process but take less interest in the final painting that resulted, he “started to think differently, both by proposing ideas to change the setting, and by taking on a certain behavior for those occasions.” Following this he notes, “So I can say that the relation between my work and my events have been taught to me by journalists.”

This thinking around an active relation to painting was brought to the stage for Gutai’s May 1957 exhibition &quot;Gutai Art on Stage&quot; at Sankei Hall in Osaka&quot;.&quot; Beginning from a completely dark stage, glass bulbs illuminated with light were lowered from the ceiling. Shimamoto then shattered the globes, extinguishing them by smashing them with a stick. After this, two large, white glass tubes were lowered and as he smashed them they released four thousand ping pong balls. In these works, Shimamoto was concerned with the act of art-making by using processes of destruction. Shimamoto also experimented with film and electronic music at this event. The music was made to accompany his &quot;The Film that Doesn’t Exist Anywhere in the World&quot; (1957), which was an overlapping, double projection of hand-painted animation on film on a single screen. Due to a lack of funds, Shimamoto had one of his junior high school students from his teaching job take discarded film from his work in a movie theater. He then washed the film with vinegar and proceeded to draw a simple animation on the frames. To create the accompanying music, Shimamoto decided to use a tape recorder, which had recently been introduced to the market. The result was similar to musique concréte, a translation of “gutai music.” However, Shimamoto disliked the structure of musique concréte, and therefore tried to make unstructured music using everyday sounds. These included the sounds of water flowing from a tap, a chair being pulled out, and a little being hit. Discouraged by a lack of attention and the daunting comparison with the privileged precedent of John Cage, discouraged Shimamoto and the film and audio sat in a storehouse undisturbed for over forty years. They have since been divided and housed in the collections of the Pompidou in Paris and the Ashiya City Museum of Art and History.

Shimamoto was also the first artist to have a solo exhibition at the Gutai Pincotheca, the Gutai gallery and center in Osaka. The exhibition ran from October 1 to 10, 1962. In the text for the exhibition written by Yoshihara he describes Shimamoto&#x27;s innovative contributions to art, including “a huge work, which I still consider a masterpiece, made by simply using a broom to spread yellow paint across the surface of a large white canvas.” He also remarks on “a sculpture made up almost exclusively of razor blades” made when Shimamoto was a student, a “kaleidoscope projection,” and “a work rolled up like a tunnel and therefore only visible from the inside” which was exhibited at the Second Gutai Exhibition in Tokyo.

Michel Tapié, in his 1957 text “A Mental Reckoning of my First Trip to Japan” originally published in Bijutsu Techo, singled out Shimamoto from the Gutai group along with Yoshihara, Kazuo Shiraga and Atusko Tanaka as “four artists who should appear alongside the most established international figures.” Shimamoto expressed his belief that Gutai would have been more original and experimental had Taipé not influenced the group&#x27;s direction so heavily. He remained a member of Gutai until 1971, a year before the group officially disbanded with the death of Yoshihara. Shimamoto&#x27;s departure stemmed from disagreements over finances within the group over Gutai’s participation in Expo ‘70, the first World’s Fair in Asia and a landmark event for Japanese contemporary art.

==After Gutai==
Shimamoto became the director of the AU (Artist Union and, later, Art Unidentified) in 1967. As he notes, “artists who had studied in prestigious universities and had learned the fundamental techniques, tended to stray away from the group, while other less educated artists and those with physical or mental handicaps became members.” He cites their unconventional perspectives as responsible for art “evolving past the most common artistic sense” in a way that “generates new vigor.” Although Shimamoto had already known about mail art through Gutai’s correspondence with Ray Johnson, it was during his involvement with AU that Shimamoto grew his interest in mail art. This has been attributed to meeting Byron Black in Japan, a Texas video artist who had been involved with the alternative space Western Front where much mail art was produced. Shimamoto’s mail art activities included many irregular shaped cards that he would mail to both artists and regular people, such as cardboard cut in the shape of a hiragana “A” character. This was published on the cover of a magazine that featured some of Shimamoto&#x27;s writing.

In response to his experimentation with the Japanese postal system, people began to send him bizarre items by sticking stamps on them and sending them through the mail. These included a dried squid, a grain of rice affixed with a postal tag for objects smaller than a postcard, and a wooden cabinet for sandals sent in its constituent parts (including the sandals) which had to be subsequently reassembled.

In 1976 Shimamoto made a road of 10,000 newspapers on the back of the Murogawa river. Similarly, he exhibited 10,000 newspapers as a part of the “World Symposium Invitation Show” in Alberta, Canada.

In 1986, on the occasion of Italian mail artist Guglielmo Achille Carvellini’s visit to Japan, Shimamoto shaved his head. From this point he would ask the artists he visited to treat his bald head as a picture plane. Subsequently, his head was used to carry messages and pictures as well as a surface to project slides and films onto.

Throughout his career, Shimamoto was also engaged in the art of children. Of the annual children’s painting exhibition in Ashiya (founded 1949) Shimamoto writes, “Immediately after the war, we members of Gutai created several works using new methods. It is no exaggeration to say that we owe all this to the children and this exhibition.” We may see the influence of children&#x27;s creativity on his own practice in what he sees as an absence of intervening thought. Describing a video of Picasso artistically arranging terracotta pipes found lying in the street, he notes how “he enjoyed himself with the naturalness of a child, without hesitation.” This he links to the importance of useless things in a society mediated by overly rational and teleological conventions of thought, or, as Romano Gasparotti has phrased it, “a) a form of expression not yet conditioned by cultural patterns and preestablished forms, b) holistic attention to the world understood as an undivided whole and which was therefore in contrast with the hyper-analytical attitude typical of the technical-scientific mentality capable only of separating, dividing, and dissecting.” The importance of this direct engagement with material in art can be applied to the kinds of methods that Shimamoto sought in his practice.

Shimamoto&#x27;s post-Gutai career was also marked by his passion for world peace activism, inspired in part by a visit in 1986 from Bern Porter. Porter, a nuclear physicist ho worked on the Manhattan Project and took up a life of austerity and expiation after the nuclear bombing of Japan, would subsequently nominate Shimamoto for a Nobel Peace Prize. In a work produced in 1999, &quot;Heiwa no Akashi&quot; (A Proof of Peace), he dropped glass bottles of paint on a concrete slab while lifted in midair at Shin Nishinomiya Yacht Harbor. The work is supposed to be continued every year for 100 years on the condition that peace remains in Japan, with new artists and members of the public contributing to the painting using Shimamoto&#x27;s glass bottle technique. Similarly, in 2006 he performed A Weapon for Peace at the Piazza Dante in Naples. For this performance, the square was set with an enormous canvas with a grand piano in the center. Shimamoto then entered the area through a tube of white canvas, suggesting a kind of birth. Shimamoto, suspended by a crane from a harness, dropped “strange spheres made up of numerous plastic cups full of coloured paint” onto the canvas and piano below. Throughout the performance, Charlemagne Palestine played a different piano, set to the side of the painting area. Shimamoto has called peace the “theme” of his life.

Shimamoto&#x27;s painting performances would continue in varying forms throughout his later work, including a 2008 performances at the Ducal Palace in Genoa, Certosa do Capri and Punta Campanella. His works are in museum collections such as those of the Tate Gallery and the Tate Modern (in both London and Liverpool) and the Hyōgo Prefectural Museum of Art in Kobe, Japan. &quot;New York Times&quot; art critic Roberta Smith has noted him as one of the most daring and independent experimentalists of the postwar international art scene in the 1950s. In 1997 his mail art works were shown in the solo exhibition &quot;Shozo Shimamoto&#x27;s Gutai &amp; A.U.&quot; in the &#x27;E-mail Art Archives&#x27; of Guy Bleus, Center for Visual Arts, Hasselt, Belgium. In 1954 he won the Association Award at the Modern Art Association in Japan, an association he would join as a member in 1957. He received the competition prize at the 9th Contemporary Art Exhibition of Japan in 1969, a Dark Blue Ribbon Medal in 1999, and the Hyōgo Prefectural Cultural Award in 2000.

::&quot;Perhaps driven by the exhilarating mixture of relief, freedom and despair that followed the end of World War II, artists around the world had been experimenting with newly physical, sometimes violent, cathartic ways of making paintings and sculptures. Others were also staging what they called events, or actions or performances that sometimes were as destructive as they were creative...
::&quot;Some of these artists were doubtlessly influenced by Pollock&#x27;s example... But the same year brought independent experiments: Lucio Fontana, for example, was in Argentina (or Italy), making images by repeatedly puncturing or slashing painted canvases with knives. And in Japan, Shozo Shimamoto was symbolically penetrating the sacrosanct picture plane of painting by throwing himself through several layers of rice paper, leaving traces of the event -- the hole surrounded by jagged shards of paper -- as the work of art.&quot;

<text>Fort Carillon, presently known as Fort Ticonderoga, was constructed by Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, Governor of New France, to protect Lake Champlain from a British invasion. Situated on the lake some south of Fort Saint-Frédéric, it was built to prevent an attack on Canada and slow the advance of the enemy long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

Assigned to remedy Fort Saint Frédéric&#x27;s inability to resist a constant British threat to the south, French King&#x27;s Engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière began construction of Fort Carillon where Lake George, at that time called Lac Saint Sacrement, joins Lake Champlain by the La Chute river. Construction began in October 1755.

==Location==

Fort Carillon was situated south of Lake Champlain and north of Lake George, a natural point of conflict between the French forces, which were advancing south from Quebec City through the Richelieu River towards Lake Champlain and the Hudson Valley, and the British forces, which were hoping to move north. The area was chosen so as to control the southern point of Lake Champlain as well as access to the Hudson Valley. The fort is surrounded by water on three sides, and on half of the fourth side by a moat. The portion remaining was strongly fortified by deep trenches, sustained by three batteries of cannon and, in front of the fort, blocked by trees which had been cut down and the pointed ends strengthened by fire, creating a formidable defensive system.

Handicapped by corruption, the construction continued at a slow pace. By mid-July 1756, four bastions with cannon were placed at a height of . Two of the bastions were directed to the northeast and northwest, away from the lake. They were the Reine and Germaine bastions, with two demilunes (an outwork in front of a fort, shaped like a crescent moon) further extending the works on the land side. The two other bastions provided cover for the landing area outside the fort. They were the Joannes and Languedoc bastions, which overlooked the lake to the south. The walls were high and thick, and the whole works was surrounded by a glacis and a dry moat deep and wide. The fort was armed with cannon brought in from Fort St. Frédéric and Montréal.

By fall, the fort was still not finished when an important discovery was made: as soon as the trees of the peninsula were cut, the French realized that the location they chose did not join well with the junction between the two lakes. To correct this, a second but smaller fort was built closer to the lake, known as &quot;Redoute des Grenadiers.&quot; By January 1757, the fort was still incomplete and composed of earth and moats, mounted by 36 cannon waiting for an attack that the French were anticipating. The French and Canadians did not want to wait passively for the British assault however, and decided to attack first. In April, 8,000 men, under the command of Marquis de Montcalm, mustered at Fort Carillon. In August 1757, they crossed Lake George to take Fort William Henry. The operation was a success and Montcalm brought back his men to Fort Carillon for the summer.

==Lower and upper town of Carillon==

In 1756, the Canadian and French troops developed &quot;le Jardin du Roi&quot; on the sandy plain below the heights. It was intended to feed the summer garrison charged with constructing the new fort.

By 1758, Fort Carillon and its surroundings were composed of a lower town, an upper town, two hospitals, hangars, and barracks for the soldiers. The Upper town itself took the form of a triangle with the fort as its northern tip, and the lower town the southern part of the triangle. There, taverns with wine cellars for the soldiers, bakeries, and nine ovens were located.
It was important to construct batteries for the lower town, and the earth removed for construction of the lower town was taken closer to the fort.

On July 22, 1759, when orders were given to set fire to the town, the Indians could not believe that the French and Canadians would abandon what they had worked so hard to build. Heavy smoke rose from the two hospitals, the hangars of the lower and upper town, and the soldiers&#x27; barracks. All was to be abandoned to the advancing British army. None of the buildings were ever reconstructed as was the case in Louisbourg, Cape Breton.

== Garrison at Fort Carillon ==

===&quot;Les troupes de terre&quot;===

The &quot;troupes de la terre&quot; were composed of professional soldiers of the French Army, sent from France to America, who were disciplined and well trained. At Fort Carillon in 1758, these troops were made up of the second battalions of seven regiments sent from different regions of France. The regiments represented in the garrison were those of La Reine (345 soldiers), Guyenne (470 soldiers), Berry (450 soldiers), Béarn (410 soldiers), La Sarre (460 soldiers), Royal Roussillon (480 soldiers), and Languedoc (426 soldiers). The Berry regiment also had a second battalion, but their numbers were not known. 

The requisite white uniform of the French regular infantry is likely to have been similarly modified for all the battalions. The uniform of the &quot;Régiment de Guyenne&quot; and &quot;Régiment Berry&quot; was a bit like the &quot;Régiment de la Reine&quot;: a white-grey coat with red reversed sleeves with three ornate buttons, red vest, white-grey pants, and black shoes with metallic buckles. However, contrary to &quot;La Reine&quot;, the tricorn hat was black felt with a gold medallion. The uniforms of the other regiments had blue vests and blue cuffs, except for &quot;Régiment de La Sarre&quot; which had red vests and blue cuffs. The French musket was of a smaller caliber than the British musket.

===&quot;Les troupes de la Marine&quot;===

The Troupes de la Marine were led by Chevalier de Lévis with 150 Canadians. There were also about 250 Canadian Indians at Fort Carillon, for a total of 3,500 soldiers. The French and Canadians often made use of guns placed on the walls of the fort, although for the Battle of Carillon, because the fighting took place 3/4 of a mile from the fort, it was essentially a battle of musket and bayonet.

== Fort Carillon 1757 ==
Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, in command of the French troops at Fort Carillon decided to attack Fort William Henry from Fort Carillon. On August 9, 1757, Montcalm, with an army of 7,000 men consisting of French soldiers, Canadian militia, and Indians from various tribes, took Fort William Henry, situated at the southern point of Lake George. The Indians, who thought that an agreement had been made without their consent, revolted. What ensued were violent attacks by the Indians intoxicated by alcohol. There were, according to sources, between 70 and 150 people killed, scalped, and decapitated. After this massacre, the French soldiers accompanied the survivors to Fort Edward to avoid further bloodshed.

After his victory, Montcalm could have taken Fort Edward, but he took instead the destroyed Fort William Henry, and returned to Fort Carillon. The British had been humiliated and Montcalm had shown the compassion of a great general by stopping any further bloodshed by the Indians and accompanying the survivors. However, Montcalm knew that he had to withdraw because of the anger and loss of the Indians as allies, as well as a shortage of provisions.

In 1756, New France had suffered a disastrous crop failure. Montcalm was forced to release the Canadian militiamen who made up more than half of his force. The Canadians were urgently needed to return home for the harvest. However, in 1757, disaster struck again and the harvest was the worst in Canadian history. Conditions were particularly bad around Montreal, which was &quot;the granary of Canada.&quot; By late September, the inhabitants were subsisting on a half-pound of bread a day, and those at Quebec on a quarter-pound of bread. A month later, there was no bread at all. &quot;The distress is so great that some of the inhabitants are living on grass,&quot; Bougainville wrote. There was a feeling of dispirited despair in the colony and the conclusion was that its military prospects would soon become indefensible.

After a string of French victories in 1757, the British were prompted to organize a large-scale attack on the fort as part of a multifaceted campaign strategy against Canada. In June 1758, British General James Abercrombie began amassing a large force at Fort William Henry in preparation for the military campaign directed up the Champlain Valley. These forces landed at the north end of Lake George, only four miles from the fort, on July 6. The French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, who had only arrived at Carillon in late June, engaged his troops in a flurry of work to improve the fort&#x27;s outer defenses. They built, over two days, entrenchments around a rise between the fort and Mount Hope, about three-quarters of a mile (one kilometer) northwest of the fort, and then constructed an abatis (felled trees with sharpened branches pointing out) below these entrenchments. Abercrombie&#x27;s failure to advance directly to the fort on July 7 made much of this defensive work possible. Brigadier General George Howe, Abercromby&#x27;s second-in-command, had been killed when his column encountered a French reconnaissance troop. Abercrombie &quot;felt [Howe&#x27;s death] most heavily&quot; and may have been unwilling to act immediately.

1757 was therefore a bad year for the British in North America, not only because of their defeat in northern New York, but in the Ohio Valley and Nova Scotia as well. That year, British Prime-Minister William Pitt named General James Wolfe commander of the British troops in North America.

== British force sent against Fort Carillon ==
The British force sent against Fort Carillon was made up of regular British regiments and provincial regiments. The British units were the 27th (Enniskillen) Regiment of Foot, the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot, the 44th Regiment of Foot, 46th Regiment of Foot, the 55th Regiment of Foot, the 1st and 4th battalions of 60th (Royal American) Regiment, and Gage&#x27;s Light Infantry.

The British regiments were in their customary red coats with the exception of Gage&#x27;s light infantry, which wore grey. The soldiers were armed with muskets, bayonets, hatchets or tomahawks, and knives. The standard battle issue for British soldiers was 24 rounds of ammunition; Howe may have ordered his soldiers to carry as many rounds as they could. The provincial regiments wore blue, but extensive modification of uniform was made to suit forest warfare with coats being cut back and any form of headgear and equipment permitted. Rogers&#x27; Rangers most likely wore their distinctive green. Along with Rogers&#x27; Rangers, there were regiments from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

== Early preparations to the Battle of Carillon (1758) ==

Although the French government knew that the British had dispatched 8,000 men to North America, Canada had only received 1,800 men, most of whom were assigned to Louisbourg. The army&#x27;s small size forced Major-General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, commander of French forces in Canada, to rely on Indians, and although traditional French allies like the Nipissing, Algonkin, and Abenaki contributed a thousand warriors, it was not enough. Determined to capture both Fort William Henry and Fort Edward, Governor Vaudreuil also recruited a thousand warriors from tribes around the upper Great Lakes. The large number of different tribes meant that there were not enough interpreters, and potentially dangerous tribal rivalries needed attention. Dealing with Indians was never an easy matter, but these Indians did not see themselves as subjects of New France, just temporary allies in search of loot. However, even traditional French allies had scalped wounded British when the garrison at Oswego surrendered, and then forced the French to buy back a number of English prisoners.

While Montcalm and Vaudreuil were raising an army, American rangers proved to be too few to stop Indians from raiding the area around Fort William Henry at will. In late June, a powerful Indian raiding party discovered that the road between the two forts was basically unguarded. The French had a clear picture of the strategic situation in June, but six separate scouting parties were unable to penetrate the Indian screen to learn anything more detailed than that there was a large force at Fort Carillon.

The destruction of Fort William Henry should have guaranteed the safety of Fort Carillon, but the British government had made North America the priority, while France had not, so another attempt was made at Fort Carillon.

==Battle of Fort Carillon==
The British were alarmed by the outcome of losing Fort William Henry, which was their northernmost fort. They decided to prepare for a massive attack against Fort Carillon. Close to 16,000 men (the largest troop deployment ever assembled on the North American continent) was united under the orders of General James Abercrombie, commander in chief of the British forces in North America. The actual officer in charge of the land operation was Brigadier-General Lord Howe. On July 8, 1758, the British army of General James Abercrombie with 16,000 men, (6,000 British soldiers and 10,000 colonials) and their allies the Mohawks (who did not participate in the battle), attacked Fort Carillon commanded by Louis-Joseph de Montcalm with 3,600 soldiers, including 400 Canadians from Lévis and 300 Abenakis. Abercrombie was determined to go ahead with his advancement before he lost the advantage. The British however faced a well-fortified position. While the fort was still under construction, the French forces dug deep trenches flanked by three batteries of cannon. The fort was also defended by a line of sharpened trees pointed towards the exterior and intertwined with branches and spikes installed during the night on orders from Montcalm. Part of the French forces were dispersed in the adjoining forest. The land around the fort gave way to only one opening, since the fort was surrounded on three sides by water and at half of the rear by a moat.
Abercrombie could have gone around the French, but wanting a quick victory, he decided against this maneuver. Informed by his lieutenant that it would be possible to take the French by assault, he opted for a massive frontal attack. However, the French defenses proved to be well prepared and they were not in danger of enemy fire. The French easily decimated the British ranks with cannon fire. (The French were lined up in 3 rows: the first row fired while the third was reloading their rifles, permitting a strong even fire).

The British soldiers had to climb on each other&#x27;s shoulders in order to reach the top of the trenches, so it was easy for the French to repulse them as they arrived near the summit of the defenses. Only one time were the British capable of breaking through the French defenses, only to be repulsed by a charge of bayonets. The British tried to take the fort, but were driven back time and time again by the French artillery. Abercrombie sent his men to assail the fort several times; he lost 551 soldiers, 1,356 were wounded and 77 disappeared. They retreated to Fort William Henry. As for the French and Canadians, they had 104 killed and 273 wounded.

==British capture==

Jeffery Amherst, now commander in chief of the British forces in America with 12,000 soldiers, prepared to move against Fort Carillon on July 21, 1759. On July 22 and 23, Bourlamaque left the fort with 3,600 men and deployed 400 soldiers to set fire to the two hospitals, hangars, barracks, and to the lower part of the town. During four days, from July 23 to 26, the British bombed the fort, using artillery positioned where Captain Hébécourt and his men were retrenched. On July 26, they left at 10 pm, and at midnight, the explosives demolished most of the fort. They then moved out to Fort Saint Frédéric with the regiment of Hébécourt, captain of the La Reine regiment. Bourlamaque did the same to Fort Saint Frédéric on July 31. After that, they moved up to Isle-aux-Noix where Amherst declined to advance against them, preferring to consolidate his forces in the lower Lake Champlain area. In withdrawing, the French used explosives to destroy what they could of the fort and or dumped cannon they did not take with them. The British moved in on July 27 and, though they worked in 1759 and 1760 to repair and improve the fort (which they renamed Fort Ticonderoga), the fort saw no more significant action in the war. After the war, the British garrisoned it with a small number of troops but allowed it to fall into disrepair. Colonel Frederick Haldimand, in command of the fort in 1773, wrote that it was in &quot;ruinous condition&quot;.

==Photos of Fort Carillon==
==Legacy of Fort Carillon==
The importance of Fort Carillon, the Battle of Carillon, and the Flag of Carillon; have long been a source of pride for French Canadians and to the people of Quebec. The Flag of Quebec was modeled after the Carillon flag and the Fort and its history bring honor to Canada as well as the province of Quebec.

<doc id="230061" wikidata="Q93978" url="?curid=230061" title="Antispasmodic">
<text>An antispasmodic (synonym: spasmolytic) is a pharmaceutical drug or other agent that suppresses muscle spasms.

==Smooth muscle spasm==
One type of antispasmodics is used for smooth muscle relaxation, especially in tubular organs of the gastrointestinal tract. The effect is to prevent spasms of the stomach, intestine or urinary bladder.
Both dicyclomine and hyoscyamine are antispasmodic due to their anticholinergic action. Both of these drugs have side effects common to anticholinergics and can worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Papaverine is an opium alkaloid used to treat visceral spasms, particularly those of the intestines. Mebeverine is a papaverine analog and spasmolytic with a strong and selective action on the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly of the colon. Despite being anticholinergic, it does not have the systemic anticholinergic side effects seen in other such drugs.

Peppermint oil has been traditionally used as an antispasmodic, and a review of studies on the topic found that it &quot;could be efficacious for symptom relief in IBS&quot; (as an antispasmodic) although more carefully controlled studies are needed. A later study showed it is an effective antispasmodic when test-applied topically to the intestine during endoscopy.

Bamboo shoots have been used for gastrointestinal and antispasmodic symptoms.

Anisotropine, atropine, clidinium bromide are also the most commonly used modern antispasmodics.

==Skeletal muscle spasm==

Pharmacotherapy may be used for acute musculoskeletal conditions when physical therapy is unavailable or has not been fully successful. Another class of antispasmodics for such treatment includes cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, diazepam, orphenadrine, and tizanidine. Meprobamate is another effective antispasmodic which was first introduced for clinical usage in 1955 mainly as an anxiolytic and soon afterward became a blockbuster psychotropic drug. While clinical usage of meprobamate has largely become obsolete since the development of benzodiazepines due to its liability for developing physical dependence and severe toxicity during instances of acute overdose, it is still manufactured and available by prescription. Carisoprodol is similar to meprobamate as they both belong to the carbamate drug class and meprobamate is a clinically significant active metabolite of carisoprodol, although carisoprodol itself possesses additional antispasmodic properties which are distinct from its metabolites. Effectiveness has not been clearly shown for metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, baclofen, or dantrolene. Applicable conditions include acute back or neck pain, or pain after an injury. Long-term use of muscle relaxants in such cases is poorly supported.

Spasm may also be seen in movement disorders featuring spasticity in neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord disease. Medications are commonly used for spastic movement disorders, but research has not shown functional benefit for some drugs. Some studies have shown that medications have been effective in decreasing spasticity, but that this has not been accompanied by functional benefits. Medications such as baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene have been used.

<text>Skeppsholmen is one of the islands of Stockholm. It is connected with Blasieholmen and Kastellholmen by bridges. It is accessible by foot from Kungsträdgården, past the Grand Hôtel and Nationalmuseum, by bus number 65, or by boat from Slussen, Djurgården or Nybroplan.

Positioned strategically at the Baltic Sea entrance to Stockholm, it has traditionally been the location of several military buildings. Today, the military presence is low, and several museums can be found there instead, such as the Museum of Modern Art (&quot;Moderna museet&quot;), the main modern art museum of Stockholm, the architectural museum in the same building, and the East-Asian museum (&quot;Östasiatiska Muséet&quot;). It is also home to the Teater Galeasen. On the southern shore is the old sailing ship &quot;af Chapman&quot; which is now used as a youth hostel. Stockholm Jazz Festival is a popular annual summer event held on Skeppsholmen.

Eric Ericsonhallen (formerly Skeppsholmen Church) was the venue for an official dinner for foreign royalty, celebrating the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling in June 2010.

<doc id="230072" wikidata="Q5474919" url="?curid=230072" title="Four-force">
<text>In the special theory of relativity, four-force is a four-vector that replaces the classical force.

== In special relativity ==
The four-force is defined as the rate of change in the four-momentum of a particle with respect to the particle&#x27;s proper time. Hence,:

formula_1

For a particle of constant invariant mass formula_2, the four-momentum is given by the relation formula_3, where formula_4 is the four-velocity. In analogy to Newton&#x27;s second law, we can also relate the four-force to the four-acceleration, formula_5, by equation:

formula_6

Here

formula_7

and

formula_8

where formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11 are 3-space vectors describing the velocity, the momentum of the particle and the force acting on it respectively; and formula_12 is the total energy of the particle.

== Including thermodynamic interactions ==
From the formulae of the previous section it appears that the time component of the four-force is the power expended, formula_13, apart from relativistic corrections formula_14. This is only true in purely mechanical situations, when heat exchanges vanish or can be neglected.

In the full thermo-mechanical case, not only work, but also heat contributes to the change in energy, which is the time component of the energy–momentum covector. The time component of the four-force includes in this case a heating rate formula_15, besides the power formula_13. Note that work and heat cannot be meaningfully separated, though, as they both carry inertia. This fact extends also to contact forces, that is, to the stress–energy–momentum tensor.

Therefore, in thermo-mechanical situations the time component of the four-force is &quot;not&quot; proportional to the power formula_13 but has a more generic expression, to be given case by case, which represents the supply of internal energy from the combination of work and heat, and which in the Newtonian limit becomes formula_18.

== In general relativity ==
In general relativity the relation between four-force, and four-acceleration remains the same, but the elements of the four-force are related to the elements of the four-momentum through a covariant derivative with respect to proper time.

formula_19

In addition, we can formulate force using the concept of coordinate transformations between different coordinate systems. Assume that we know the correct expression for force in a coordinate system at which the particle is momentarily at rest. Then we can perform a transformation to another system to get the corresponding expression of force. In special relativity the transformation will be a Lorentz transformation between coordinate systems moving with a relative constant velocity whereas in general relativity it will be a general coordinate transformation.

Consider the four-force formula_20 acting on a particle of mass formula_21 which is momentarily at rest in a coordinate system. The relativistic force formula_22 in another coordinate system moving with constant velocity formula_23, relative to the other one, is obtained using a Lorentz transformation:

formula_24

where formula_25.

In general relativity, the expression for force becomes

formula_26

with covariant derivative formula_27. The equation of motion becomes

formula_28

where formula_29 is the Christoffel symbol. If there is no external force, this becomes the equation for geodesics in the curved space-time. The second term in the above equation, plays the role of a gravitational force. If formula_30 is the correct expression for force in a freely falling frame formula_31, we can use then the equivalence principle to write the four-force in an arbitrary coordinate formula_32:

formula_33

== Examples ==
In special relativity, Lorentz four-force (four-force acting on a charged particle situated in an electromagnetic field) can be expressed as:
formula_34

where 
* formula_35 is the electromagnetic tensor,
* formula_36 is the four-velocity, and
* formula_37 is the electric charge.

<text>The Water Services Regulation Authority, or Ofwat, is the body responsible for economic regulation of the privatised water and sewerage industry in England and Wales. Ofwat&#x27;s main statutory duties include protecting the interests of consumers, securing the long-term resilience of water supply and wastewater systems, and ensuring that companies carry out their functions and are able to finance them.

Ofwat primarily sets limits on the prices charged for water and sewerage services, taking into account proposed capital investment schemes (such as building new wastewater treatment works) and expected operational efficiency gains. The most recent review was carried out in 2019; reviews are carried out every five years, with the next due to take place in December 2024.

The Water Act 2014 extended retail competition to all non-household customers of English water companies from April 2017 and provided for possible future competition in wholesale markets. Ofwat&#x27;s role includes regulating such water and wastewater markets and promoting effective competition wherever appropriate.

Ofwat consists of a board, plus an office of staff which carries out work delegated to them by the board. Ofwat is headquartered in the Centre City Tower in Birmingham.

The Environment Agency is responsible for environmental regulation, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate for regulating drinking water quality. Water in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation, and the supply and treatment is carried out by the government-owned Northern Ireland Water. There is no separate charge for water for residents or companies in Northern Ireland. Instead, water is paid for by the rates system. The water industry regulator in Scotland is the Water Industry Commission for Scotland.

== History ==
Ofwat was set up in 1988, at the same time as 10 water authorities in England and Wales were privatised by flotation on the stock market. Its duties and powers are defined by the Water Industry Act 1991. The resulting companies are known as &quot;water and sewerage companies&quot;; this distinguishes them from around a dozen smaller companies which only provide water services, which were already in private hands in 1989 (having remained in private ownership since their creation in the 19th century). The water-only companies provide water to around 25% of the population in England and Wales.

Before 1 April 2006, all regulatory powers rested with the Director General of Water Services. The staff who supported the role of the Director General were collectively known as the &quot;Office of Water Services&quot;, which was abbreviated to &quot;Ofwat&quot;. Ian Byatt was the Director General between 1989 and 2000; Philip Fletcher was Director General until 2006 and chairman until 2012. On 1 April 2006, the Director General was replaced by the Water Services Regulation Authority. The name &quot;Office of Water Services&quot; is no longer used, as it had no legal basis.

== Key people ==
The current chairman is Iain Coucher, who took up his position in July 2022, replacing Johnson Cox who had held the position since November 2012. Initially taking over from Rachel Fletcher as interim chief executive in April 2021, the current chief executive is David Black who was fully appointed to the role in April 2022.

== Price reviews ==
Every five years, Ofwat set limits on the prices which water companies in England and Wales can charge to their customers; this process is known as a price review or periodic review. Ofwat has carried out six price reviews so far – in 1994 (PR94), 1999 (PR99), 2004 (PR04), 2009 (PR09), 2014 (PR14), 2019 (PR19) and 2024 (PR24). The most recent, PR24, sets price limits for 2025–2030. Ofwat sets a so-called &quot;K factor&quot; in companies&#x27; licences which determine the average value of price rises above the rate of inflation (RPI) for the next five year asset management plan period.

<text>August Teodor Palm (5 February 1849 – 14 March 1922) was a Swedish socialist activist and a key person in introducing the then revolutionary social democratic labour movement in Sweden.

==Life==

===Early activism===
The son of a school teacher near Malmö, he was orphaned at the age of 10, after which he was trained to be a tailor. At the age of 18, he made an educational trip through Denmark and Germany, after which, in 1874, he settled as a tailor in Haderslev in Northern Schleswig. Also in 1874 he married Johanna Larsson.

During his travels in Germany, he learnt about socialist ideas, and in 1877 he was expelled from that country because of his socialist agitation. He then stayed in Storheddinge in Denmark until 1881, when he returned to his native Sweden. On 6 November of the same year, while in Malmö, Palm gave the first socialist speech ever in Sweden, and started on a political tour to Gothenburg and Stockholm.

===Agitator===
In March 1882, Palm started the newspaper &quot;Folkviljan&quot; (&quot;Will of the People&quot;) in Malmö, and acted as its editor until 1885, when it was discontinued. Palm moved to Stockholm and on 25 September 1885 began printing the newspaper &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; (&quot;The Social Democrat&quot;), acting as its editor for its first year. From the fall of 1886, Hjalmar Branting took over as editor-in-chief. The government sent him to prison for three months in 1889 on account of statements made in the socialist press.

Palm&#x27;s greatest contribution was as an agitator for trade union and socialist ideas, constantly touring around the country, often making speeches by the roadside - since he was barred from using lecture halls. Another of his messages, and perhaps the most important, was to expose the liberal middle-class discourse, with its claim to originate with &quot;friends of the workers&quot;, as self-seeking and power-hungry careerism. Palm&#x27;s constant argument was that working-class members were fully competent to look after their own interests.

===Visit to the US===
In 1900, August Palm was invited by the Scandinavian club of the Socialist Labor Party of America in Providence, Rhode Island, in co-operation with similar clubs in New York City and Brooklyn, to visit the United States, as a means to attract more members to these clubs. The trip started on 1 September 1900 and is described in the Swedish book &quot;Ögonblicksbilder från en tripp till Amerika&quot; (&quot;Snapshots from a Trip to America&quot;), published in 1901.

<text>Alahärmä is a former municipality of Finland. It was consolidated, together with Kortesjärvi and Ylihärmä, to Kauhava on 1 January 2009.

It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Southern Ostrobothnia region. The municipality had a population of 4,661 (as of 31 December 2008) and covered a land area of . The population density was .

Alahärmä stands in connection with the coast and the Gulf of Bothnia by the river Lapuanjoki. It was probably in combination with the fertile earth important for the first settlers in the area. The municipality, situated northeast of the town Vaasa, is dominated by the beautiful countryside and nature, but there are also small villages filled with activities. The companies are mainly within the metal industry, fur-farming, starch and milk production. The unemployment rate is one of the lowest in Finland.

There is also a supply of cultural activities for instance the annual folk festival &quot;Härmälääset Häjyylyt&quot;, theatre, art exhibitions, concerts. The local greystone church was built in 1903.

Alahärmä is also the home of the northernmost wooden rollercoaster in the world, named Thunderbird at PowerPark resort and amusement park. The resort area also has hotels, camping area, restaurants, the largest indoor go-kart track in Europe and The Mika Salo Circuit outdoor go-kart track (designed by Mika Salo)

The municipality, which is unilingually Finnish, abuts areas in Ostrobothnia with mixed Swedish and Finnish speaking population.

<doc id="230079" wikidata="Q1094542" url="?curid=230079" title="Cross-cultural communication">
<text>Cross-cultural communication is a field of study investigating how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to communicate across cultures. Intercultural communication is a related field of study.

Cross-cultural deals with the comparison of different cultures.  In cross-cultural communication, differences are understood and acknowledged, and can bring about individual change, but not collective transformations. In cross-cultural societies, one culture is often considered “the norm” and all other cultures are compared or contrasted to the dominant culture.

== Origins and culture==
During the Cold War, the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the East and the West. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to global capitalism. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer language training to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad. With this also came the development of the Foreign Service Institute, or FSI, through the Foreign Service Act of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts. There began also implementation of a &quot;world view&quot; perspective in the curriculum of higher education.
In 1974, the International Progress Organization, with the support of UNESCO and under the auspices of Senegalese President Léopold Sédar Senghor, held an international conference on &quot;The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations&quot; (Innsbruck, Austria, 27–29 July 1974) which called upon United Nations member states &quot;to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world&quot; and &quot;to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy.&quot;

There has become an increasing pressure for universities across the world to incorporate intercultural and international understanding and knowledge into the education of their students. International literacy and cross-cultural understanding have become critical to a country&#x27;s cultural, technological, economic, and political health. It has become essential for universities to educate, or more importantly, &quot;transform&quot;, to function effectively and comfortably in a world characterized by close, multi-faceted relationships and permeable borders. Students must possess a certain level of global competence to understand the world they live in and how they fit into this world. This level of global competence starts at ground level- the university and its faculty- with how they generate and transmit cross-cultural knowledge and information to students.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together the relatively unrelated fields of cultural anthropology with established areas of communication. At its core, cross-cultural communication involves understanding the ways in which culturally distinct individuals communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication requires an interdisciplinary approach. It involves literacy in fields such as anthropology, cultural studies, psychology and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by co-cultural populations, i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one&#x27;s own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages&#x27; methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as &quot;an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context&quot;. It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar and prosody of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant. One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication. There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can overgeneralize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations. A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.

== Global rise ==
With increasing globalization and international trade, it is unavoidable that different cultures will meet, conflict, and blend together. People from different culture find it is difficult to communicate not only due to language barriers, but also are affected by culture styles. For instance, in individualistic cultures, such as in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, an independent figure or self is dominant. This independent figure is characterized by a sense of self relatively distinct from others and the environment. In interdependent cultures, usually identified as Asian, Latin American, African, and Southern European cultures, an interdependent figure of self is dominant. There is a much greater emphasis on the interrelatedness of the individual to others and the environment; the self is meaningful only (or primarily) in the context of social relationships, duties, and roles. In some degree, the effect brought by cultural difference override the language gap. This culture style difference contributes to one of the biggest challenges for cross-culture communication. Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging. Cultures provide people with ways of thinking—ways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different cultures, even when they speak the &quot;same&quot; language. When the languages are different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for misunderstandings increases. The study of cross-cultural communication is a global research area. As a result, cultural differences in the &quot;study&quot; of cross-cultural communication can already be found. For example, cross-cultural communication is generally considered part of communication studies in the US, but is emerging as a sub-field of applied linguistics in the UK.

== Cross-cultural communication in the workplace ==
Corporations have grown into new countries, regions, and continents around the world, which has caused people of various cultures to move and learn to adapt to their environment. This has led to cross-cultural communication becoming more important in the work environment. From nonverbal to spoken communication, it is critical for a company or organizations performance. The entire company or organization will face drastic hardships when their communication is restricted. Over the past few decades, many Western corporations have expanded into Sub-Saharan Africa. James Baba Abugre conducted a study on western expatriates who have moved to work in Ghana. Abugre interviewed both the expatriates and Ghanaians, and found that cultural competence is essential to working with others of different cultures in order to avoid conflict between the Western and Eastern cultural norms. It is important that workers understand both verbal and non-verbal communication styles. Expatriates who move to work in a culture that is not their own should be prepared, be properly trained, and have access to educational resources to help them succeed and to appreciate the culture they have moved into, in order to navigate it effectively. Abugre&#x27;s main finding is that cultural competency is important to cross-cultural communication. Paula Caligiuri has proposed training of international workers in cultural agility techniques as a way to improve such communication.

Yaila Zotzmann, Dimitri van der Linden, and Knut Wyra looked at Asia, Europe, and North America. Together they had a focus on employees in each continent with a focus on error orientation. The authors define this as &quot;one&#x27;s attitude toward dealing with, communicating about, and learning from errors&quot;. They studied employees from China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and Vietnam. Country differences, cultural values, and personality factors were also accounted for. The study was quantitative and looked at a single organization that had offices in eight countries. Results showed error orientation varied based on the culture they were in. Americans tend to be more open to errors and learn from them as well as speaking about their mistakes, whereas Japanese subjects had the lowest tolerance for errors. The Japanese showed concern about how it may impact those around them and the organization. The study also referred to Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions theory. The findings show a potential relationship between error orientation and an employee&#x27;s culture. Other important factors are the country they live in or personality dimensions.

Cross-cultural communications and boundaries are present in all sectors. In Europe, cross-cultural communication in primary care is important, for example in dealing with migrants in the present European migrant crisis. Maria van den Muijsenbergh conducted a study on primary care in Europe as well as a new program, RESTORE. The program stands for: &quot;Research into implementation STrategies to support patients of different ORigins and language background in a variety of European primary care settings&quot;. The countries participating are Ireland, England, Scotland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Greece. Muijsenbergh found in her study that there was a range of issues in primary care for migrants in Europe. There are both language and culture barriers between medical professionals and patients, which has an impact on their communication. Even with the translation methods that technology provides, language barriers remain to fall fast. The study also found that migrants were more likely to use emergency services, which was consistent in countries with a steady influx of migrants or few migrants, and during times of economic prosperity or recession. Muijsenbergh found that migrants have worse health than native Europeans, with her findings suggesting that this is a result of the language and cultural barriers. She recommends medical professionals use different training and educational resources in order to become cross-cultural communicators.

== Cross-cultural communication in lateral teams ==

=== Feedback in Lateral Cross-Cultural Team Dynamics ===
Lateral feedback, or feedback exchanged among team members at the same hierarchical level, plays a pivotal role in enhancing team creativity and innovation. Studies highlight its dual-edged nature: while positive feedback fosters an environment conducive to creativity by reducing team relationship conflicts (Liu et al., 2022), negative feedback can harm team dynamics and individual creativity by triggering psychological states that detract from collaboration (Kim &amp; Kim, 2020). The effectiveness of this communication is significantly influenced by the cultural context, suggesting the need for a strategic approach that respects individual and cultural differences in communication styles and feedback reception.

Research indicates that the impact of lateral feedback is complex, affecting various team performance dimensions differently. For instance, this communication can lead to increased individual performance and team effort but may not necessarily improve overall team performance, highlighting the importance of complex communication practices that acknowledge the sophisticated dynamics of team interactions (Tavoletti et al., 2019; Wisniewski et al., 2020). The application of Feedback Intervention Theory (FIT) emphasizes focusing feedback on task-related aspects rather than personal attributes to optimize its effectiveness (Kluger &amp; DeNisi, 1996).

Given the global nature of modern teams, tools like GlobeSmart Profiles and Erin Meyer&#x27;s Cultural Mapping offer valuable insights for tailoring feedback in culturally intelligent ways, thereby enhancing team performance across diverse settings (Lane &amp; Maznevski, 2019; Meyer, 2024). Emphasizing constructive, culturally informed, and task-related dialogue is essential for fostering an environment that leverages lateral feedback as a tool for continuous improvement, collaboration, and enhanced creativity within teams.

== Incorporation into college programs ==
The application of cross-cultural communication theory to foreign language education is increasingly appreciated around the world. Cross-cultural communication classes can now be found within foreign language departments of some universities, while other schools are placing cross-cultural communication programs in their departments of education.

With the increasing pressures and opportunities of globalization, the incorporation of international networking alliances has become an &quot;essential mechanism for the internationalization of higher education&quot;. Many universities from around the world have taken great strides to increase intercultural understanding through processes of organizational change and innovations. In general, university processes revolve around four major dimensions which include: organizational change, curriculum innovation, staff development, and student mobility. Ellingboe emphasizes these four major dimensions with his own specifications for the internationalization process. His specifications include: (1) college leadership; (2) faculty members&#x27; international involvement in activities with colleagues, research sites, and institutions worldwide; (3) the availability, affordability, accessibility, and transferability of study abroad programs for students; (4) the presence and integration of international students, scholars, and visiting faculty into campus life; and (5) international co-curricular units (residence halls, conference planning centers, student unions, career centers, cultural immersion and language houses, student activities, and student organizations).

Above all, universities need to make sure that they are open and responsive to changes in the outside environment. In order for internationalization to be fully effective, the university (including all staff, students, curriculum, and activities) needs to be current with cultural changes, and willing to adapt to these changes. As stated by Ellingboe, internationalization &quot;is an ongoing, future-oriented, multidimensional, interdisciplinary, leadership-driven vision that involves many stakeholders working to change the internal dynamics of an institution to respond and adapt appropriately to an increasingly diverse, globally focused, ever-changing external environment&quot;. New distance learning technologies, such as interactive teleconferencing, enable students located thousands of miles apart to communicate and interact in a virtual classroom.

Research has indicated that certain themes and images such as children, animals, life cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and may be used in international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).

Many Master of Science in Management programs have an internationalization specialization which may place a focus on cross-cultural communication. For example, the Ivey Business School has a course titled Cross Cultural Management.

Jadranka Zlomislić, Ljerka Rados Gverijeri, and Elvira Bugaric study inter-cultural competency of students. As globalization progresses the world has become more interconnected, leading to job and study opportunities abroad in different countries and cultures, where the students are surrounded by a language that is not their mother tongue. Findings suggest that the internet is helpful but, not the answer; students should enroll in language and inter-cultural courses in order to fight stereotypes and develop inter-cultural competence and make them into better cross-cultural communicators.

Cross-cultural communication gives opportunities to share ideas, experiences, and different perspectives and perception by interacting with local people.

== Challenges in cross-language qualitative research ==
Cross-language research refers to research involving two or more languages. Specifically, it can refer to: 1) researchers working with participants in a language that they are not fluent in, or; 2) researchers working with participants utilizing a language that is neither of their native languages, or; 3) translation of research or findings in another language, or; 4) researchers and participants speak the same language (not English). However, the research process and findings are directed to an English-speaking audience.

Cross-language issues are of growing concern in research of all methodological forms, but they raise particular concerns for qualitative research. Qualitative researchers seek to develop a comprehensive understanding of human behavior, using inductive approaches to investigate the meanings people attribute to their behavior, actions, and interactions with others. In other words, qualitative researchers seek to gain insights into life experiences by exploring the depth, richness, and complexity inherent to human phenomenon. To gather data, qualitative researchers use direct observation and immersion, interviews, open-ended surveys, focus groups, content analysis of visual and textual material, and oral histories. Qualitative research studies involving cross-language issues are particularly complex in that they require investigating meanings, interpretations, symbols, and the processes and relations of social life.

Although a range of scholars have dedicated their attention to challenges in conducting qualitative studies in cross-cultural contexts, no methodological consensus has emerged from these studies. For instance, Edwards noticed how the inconsistent or inappropriate use of translators or interpreters can threaten the trustworthiness of cross-language qualitative research and the applicability of the translated findings on participant populations. Researchers who fail to address the methodological issues translators/interpreters present in a cross-language qualitative research can decrease the trustworthiness of the data as well as compromise the overall rigor of the study Temple and Edwards also describe the important role of translation in research, pointing out that language is not just a tool or technical label for conveying concepts; Indeed, language incorporates values and beliefs and carries cultural, social, and political meanings of a particular social reality that may not have a conceptual equivalence in the language into which will be translated. In the same veing, it has also been noted that the same words can mean different things in different cultures. For instance, as Temple et al. observe, the words we choose matter. Thus, it is crucial to give attention to how researchers describe the use of translators and/or interpreters since it reflects their competence in addressing language as a methodological issue.

===Historical discussion of cross-language issues and qualitative research===

In 1989, Saville-Troike was one of the first to turn to apply the use of qualitative research (in the form of ethnographic investigation) to the topic of cross-cultural communication. Using this methodology, Saville-Troike demonstrated that for successful communication to take place, a person must have the appropriate linguistic knowledge, interaction skills, and cultural knowledge. In a cross-cultural context, one must be aware of differences in norms of interaction and interpretation, values and attitudes, as well as cognitive maps and schemata. Regarding cross-cultural interviews, subsequently Stanton argued in 1996 that in order to avoid misunderstandings, the interviewer should try to walk in the other person&#x27;s shoes. In other words, the interviewer needed to pay attention to the point of view of the interviewee, a notion dubbed as &quot;connected knowing,&quot; which refers to a clear and undistorted understanding of the perspective of the interviewee.

===Relationship between cross-language issues and qualitative research===

As one of the primary methods for collecting rich and detailed information in qualitative research, interviews conducted in cross-cultural linguistic contexts raise a number of issues. As a form of data collection, interviews provide researchers with insight into how individuals understand and narrate aspects of their lives. Challenges may arise, however, when language barriers exist between researchers and participants. In multilingual contexts, the study of language differences is an essential part of qualitative research. van Ness et al. claim that language differences may have consequences for the research process and outcome, because concepts in one language may be understood differently in another language. For these authors, language is central in all phases of qualitative research, ranging from data collection to analysis and representation of the textual data in publications.

In addition, as van Ness et al. observe, challenges of translation can be from the perspective that interpretation of meaning is the core of qualitative research. Interpretation and representation of meaning may be challenging in any communicative act; however, they are more complicated in cross-cultural contexts where interlingual translation is necessary.). Interpretation and understanding of meanings are essential in qualitative research, not only for the interview phase, but also for the final phase when meaning will be represented to the audience through oral or written text. Temple and Edwards claim that without a high level of translated understanding, qualitative research cannot shed light on different perspectives, circumstances that could shut out the voices of those who could enrich and challenge our understandings.

===Current state of affairs of cross-language studies in qualitative research===

According to Temple et al., a growing number of researchers are conducting studies in English language societies with people who speak little or no English. However, few of these researchers acknowledge the influence of interpreters and translators. In addition, as Temple et al. noticed, little attention is given to the involvement of interpreters in research interviews and even less attention to language difference in focus group research with people who do not speak English. An exception would be the work of Esposito. There is some work on the role of interpreters and translators in relation to best practice and models of provision, such as that of Thomson et al., However, there is a body of literature aimed at English speaking health and social welfare professionals on how to work with interpreters.

Temple and Edwards point out the absence of technically focused literature on translation. This is problematic because there is strong evidence that communication across languages involves more than just a literal transfer of information. In this regard, Simon claims that the translator is not someone who simply offers words in a one-to-one exchange. Rather, the translator is someone who negotiates meanings in relation to a specific context. These meanings cannot be found within the language of translation, but they are embedded in the negotiation process, which is part of their continual reactivation. For this reason, the translator needs to make continuous decisions about the cultural meanings language conveys. Thus, the process of meaning transfer has more to do with reconstructing the value of a term, rather than its cultural inscription.

===Significant contributions to cross-language studies in qualitative research===

Jacques Derrida is widely acknowledged to be one of the most significant contributors to the issue of language in qualitative social research. The challenges that arise in studies involving people who speak multiple languages have also been acknowledged.

Today, the main contributions concerning issues of translation and interpretation come from the field of health care, including from transcultural nursing. In a globalized era, setting the criteria for qualitative research that is linguistically and culturally representative of study participants is crucial for improving the quality of care provided by health care professionals. Scholars in the health field, like Squires, provide useful guidelines for systematically evaluating the methodological issues in cross-language research in order to address language barriers between researchers and participants.

===Cross-language concerns in qualitative research===

Squires defines cross-language as the process that occurs when a language barrier is present between the researcher and participants. This barrier is frequently mediated using a translator or interpreter. When the research involves two languages, interpretation issues might result in loss of meaning and thus loss of the validity of the qualitative study. As Oxley et al. point out, in a multilingual setting interpretation challenges arise when researcher and participants speak the same non-English native language, but the results of the study are intended for an English-speaking audience. For instance, when interviews, observation, and other methods of gathering data are used in cross-cultural environments, the data collection and analysis processes become more complicated due to the inseparability of the human experience and the language spoken in a culture Oxley et al. (2017). Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to be clear on what they know and believe. In other words, they should clarify their position in the research process.

In this context, positionality refers to the ethical and relational issues the researchers face when choosing a language over another to communicate their findings. For example, in his study on Chinese international students in a Canadian university, Li considers the ethical and relational issues of language choice experienced when working with the Chinese and English language. In this case, it is important that the researcher offers a rationale behind his/her language choice. Thus, as Squires observes, language plays a significant role in cross-cultural studies; it helps participants represent their sense of self.

Similarly, qualitative research interviews involve a continuous reflection on language choices because they may impact the research process and outcome. In his work, Lee illustrates the central role that reflexivity plays in setting researcher&#x27;s priorities and his/her involvement in the translation process. Specifically, his study focuses on the dilemma that researchers speaking the same language of participants face when the findings are intended to an English-speaking audience only. Lee introduces the article by arguing that &quot;Research conducted by English-speaking researchers about other language speaking subjects is essentially cross-cultural and often multilingual, particularly with QR that involves participants communicating in languages other than English&quot; (p. 53). Specifically, Lee addresses the problems that arise in making sense of interview responses in Mandarin, preparing transcriptions of interviews, and translating the Mandarin/Chinese data for an English-speaking/reading audience. Lee&#x27;s work then, demonstrates the importance of reflexivity in cross-language research since the researcher&#x27;s involvement in the language translation can impact the research process and outcome.

Therefore, in order to ensure trustworthiness, which is a measure of the rigor of the study, Lincoln &amp; Guba, Sutsrino et al. argue that it is necessary to minimize translation errors, provide detail accounts of the translation, involve more than one translator, and remain open to inquiry from those seeking access to the translation process. For example, in research conducted in the educational context, Sutsrino et al. recommend bilingual researchers the use of inquiry audit for establishing trustworthiness. Specifically, investigators can require an outside person to review and examine the translation process and the data analysis in order to ensure that the translation is accurate, and the findings are consistent.

==International educational organizations==
===The Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research===

SIETAR is an educational membership organization for those professionals who are concerned with the challenges and rewards of intercultural relations. SIETAR was founded in the United States in 1974 by a few dedicated individuals to draw together professionals engaged in various forms of intercultural learning and engagement research and training. SIETAR now has loosely connected chapters in numerous countries and a large international membership.

===WYSE International===

WYSE International is a worldwide educational charity specializing in education and development for emerging leaders established in 1989. It is a non-governmental organization associated with the Department of Public Information of the United Nations.

Over 3000 participants from 110 countries have attended their courses, they have run in 5 continents. Its flagship International Leadership Programme is a 12-day residential course for 30 people from on average 20 countries (aged 18 – 35).

WYSE International&#x27;s website states its aims are to:

===Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow===

Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow is an innovative educational initiative aimed at creating a common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders. Israeli and Palestinian students are selected through an application process and work in small bi-national teams to develop technology and business projects for local impact. Through this process of cross-cultural communication, students build mutual respect, cultural competence and understanding of each others.
I need to be more open to people and limit my mind in order to get clues about stereotypes, race, religion, and media. I should give people enough time to speak so I can figure out what my mind is missing about a particular group of people. By being open, I mean having healthy conversations with people, which should begin gradually depending on the situation and people involved. Allowing myself some time to reflect on these elements, where I am going wrong, and where I need to improve. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m updating my mental knowledge based on the authentic information I&#x27;m gaining through experiential learning.

==Theories==

The main theories for cross-cultural communication are based on the work done looking at value differences between different cultures, especially the works of Edward T. Hall, Richard D. Lewis, Geert Hofstede, and Fons Trompenaars. Clifford Geertz was also a contributor to this field. Also Jussi V. Koivisto&#x27;s model on cultural crossing in internationally operating organizations elaborates from this base of research.

These theories have been applied to a variety of different communication theories and settings, including general business and management (Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner) and marketing (Marieke de Mooij, Stephan Dahl). There have also been several successful educational projects which concentrate on the practical applications of these theories in cross-cultural situations.

These theories have been criticized mainly by management scholars (e.g. Nigel Holden) for being based on the culture concept derived from 19th century cultural anthropology and emphasizing on culture-as-difference and culture-as-essence. Another criticism has been the uncritical way Hofstede&#x27;s dimensions are served up in textbooks as facts (Peter W. Cardon). There is a move to focus on &#x27;cross-cultural interdependence&#x27; instead of the traditional views of comparative differences and similarities between cultures. Cross-cultural management is increasingly seen as a form of knowledge management. While there is debate in academia, over what cross-cultural teams can do in practice, a meta-analysis by Günter Stahl, Martha Maznevski, Andreas Voigt and Karsten Jonsen on research done on multicultural groups, concluded &quot;Research suggests that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction.&quot;

==Aspects==
There are several parameters that may be perceived differently by people of different cultures:

* High- and low-context cultures: context is the most important cultural dimension and also difficult to define. The idea of context in culture was advanced by the anthropologist Edward T Hall. He divides culture into two main groups: High and Low context cultures. He refers to context as the stimuli, environment or ambiance surrounding the environment. Depending on how a culture relies on the three points to communicate their meaning, will place them in either high or low- context cultures. For example, Hall goes on to explain that low-context cultures assume that the individuals know very little about what they are being told, and therefore must be given a lot of background information. High-context cultures assume the individual is knowledgeable about the subject and has to be given very little background information.
* Nonverbal, oral and written: the main goal behind improving intercultural audiences is to pay special attention to specific areas of communication to enhance the effectiveness of the intercultural messages. The specific areas are broken down into three sub categories: nonverbal, oral and written messages.

Nonverbal contact involves everything from something as obvious as eye contact and facial expressions to more discreet forms of expression such as the use of space. Experts have labeled the term kinesics to mean communicating through body movement. Huseman, author of &quot;Business Communication&quot;, explains that the two most prominent ways of communication through kinesics are eye contact and facial expressions.

Eye contact, Huseman goes on to explain, is the key factor in setting the tone between two individuals and greatly differs in meaning between cultures. In the Americas and Western Europe, eye contact is interpreted the same way, conveying interest and honesty. People who avoid eye contact when speaking are viewed in a negative light, withholding information and lacking in general confidence. However, in the Middle East, Africa, and especially Asia, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and even challenging of one&#x27;s authority. People who make eye contact, but only briefly, are seen as respectful and courteous.

Facial expressions are their own language by comparison and universal throughout all cultures. Dale Leathers, for example, states that facial expression can communicate ten basic classes of meaning.

The final part to nonverbal communication lies in our gestures, and can be broken down into five subcategories:
* Emblems
Emblems refer to sign language (such as, thumbs up, one of the most recognized symbols in the world) 
* Illustrators 
Illustrators mimic what is spoken (such as gesturing how much time is left by holding up a certain number of fingers). 
* Regulators 
Regulators act as a way of conveying meaning through gestures (raising up a hand for instance indicates that one has a certain question about what was just said) and become more complicated since the same regulator can have different meanings across different cultures (making a circle with a hand, for instance, in the Americas means agreement, in Japan is symbolic for money, and in France conveys the notion of worthlessness). 
* Affect displays 
Affect displays reveal emotions such as happiness (through a smile) or sadness (mouth trembling, tears). 
* Adaptors
Adaptors are more subtle such as a yawn or clenching fists in anger.

The last nonverbal type of communication deals with communication through the space around people, or proxemics. Huseman goes on to explain that Hall identifies three types of space:
# Feature-fixed space: deals with how cultures arrange their space on a large scale, such as buildings and parks. 
# Semifixed feature space: deals with how space is arranged inside buildings, such as the placement of desks, chairs and plants.
# Informal space: the space and its importance, such as talking distance, how close people sit to one another and office space are all examples. A production line worker often has to make an appointment to see a supervisor, but the supervisor is free to visit the production line workers at will.

Oral and written communication is generally easier to learn, adapt and deal with in the business world for the simple fact that each language is unique. The one difficulty that comes into play is paralanguage, how something is said.

== Differences between westerners and indigenous Australians ==

In the view of Australian linguists, such as Michael Walsh and Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, conversations between people from western cultures are usually: &quot;dyadic&quot; – i.e. a dialogue between two specific people; direct eye contact is important; whichever person is speaking at a particular point in time controls the interaction, and; conversations are &quot;contained&quot;, in a relatively short, well-defined time frame.

Indigenous Australian conversational interactions – in contrast to those of westerners – tend to be: &quot;communal&quot; or multilateral, i.e. they involve several people simultaneously; direct eye contact is not important (or even deliberately minimised); listeners control the interaction, and; conversations are &quot;continuous&quot; or episodic, spread over a longer, less definite timeframe.

== Challenges ==
Different spoken languages

Spoken language is the most important communication tool between people. Spoken language is seen as people&#x27;s natural production tool, more common and normal, while written language is seen as intricate because of its broad rules. The same language has different meanings in different contexts. When two countries that use the same language communicate, there may also be some misunderstandings due to some dialects. American English and British English is an example for when two different of cross-cultural communication.

<text>Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), now known as Nasdaq PHLX, is the first stock exchange established in the United States and the oldest stock exchange in the nation. The exchange is owned by Nasdaq, which acquired it in 2007 for $652 million, and is headquartered in Philadelphia.

The exchange was founded in 1790 and originally named the Board of Brokers of Philadelphia and sometimes referred to as the Philadelphia Board of Brokers. In 1875, the Board of Brokers changed its name to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.

In 1949, the exchange merged with the Baltimore Stock Exchange and was renamed the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange. In 1954, it merged with the Washington Stock Exchange and was renamed the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange, often abbreviated PBW. In 1969, the exchange acquired the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.

==History==
===1790–1875: Board of Brokers===
Over its more than 200 years in existence, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange has had various titles and has been located in various buildings around Philadelphia. Founded in 1790 as the &quot;Board of Brokers,&quot; it was located at the Merchants Coffee House, now known as the City Tavern, at the corner of Second and Walnut Streets.

In 1831, Stephen Girard’s Bank had formed the &quot;Philadelphia Merchant’s Exchange Company&quot; to erect a new building to house the Board of Brokers and other groups. The Board of Brokers moved into the Merchants Exchange Building at 3rd and Dock Streets in 1834 following a fire at the coffee house.

On June 20, 1857, the Board of Brokers of Philadelphia transacted no business in the stock board, as their annual dinner was held that day.

As of January 1, 1874, the par price for membership in the Philadelphia Board of Brokers was $1,000, with 198 seats, and &quot;not others are attainable under $2,000 each.&quot; The board represented a market capital of around $350,000.
===1875–1949: Philadelphia Stock Exchange===
In 1875, the Board of Brokers changed its name to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.

In 1876, the exchange moved to the rear of the Girard Bank Building, formerly the First Bank of the United States. It stayed there until 1888. From 1888 to 1902, the exchange moved to the Drexel Building which was located near Fifth Street and Chestnut. Between 1902 and 1912, the exchange returned to the Merchants Exchange Building. In 1913, it moved to a building at 1411 Walnut Street, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1951, the exchange moved to the Central Penn Bank Building at 1401 Walnut Street. It stayed there until 1966 when it moved to a newly constructed building (currently the Sofitel Hotel) at 17th and Sansom. The 1700 block of Ionic Street, a narrow thoroughfare just north of this building, was renamed Stock Exchange Place and was still signed as such as of 2017.

In December 1968, in response to a fiscal crisis, Philadelphia imposed a $0.05 per share stock transfer tax for all transactions on the PHLX. On January 2, 1969, the PHLX moved its trading floor to an office building, then known as the Decker Building, just across a street from the city boundaries in Bala Cynwyd to avoid the tax. In February, a court ruled that the tax was illegal, and the PHLX moved its trading floor back to its headquarters in the city.

In 1981, the exchange moved to 19th and Market, where it stayed until 2017 when it moved to its current location in the newly built FMC Tower.

===1949–present: Mergers===
The exchange merged with the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1949. The exchange was then named the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange. The Baltimore Stock Exchange then migrated out of its Baltimore Stock Exchange Building, later renamed the Totman Building, to a new home base in Philadelphia.

The exchange merged with the Washington Stock Exchange in 1954. The exchange was known as the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange (often abbreviated as PBW) after those mergers. In 1969, the exchange acquired the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and maintained an auxiliary trading floor in Pittsburgh until 1974.

On October 22, 1981, trading was halted on both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange after anonymous callers said bombs had been placed in those buildings.

In 2005, a number of large financial firms purchased stakes in the exchange as a hedge against growing consolidation of stock trading by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. These firms—Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Citadel LLC—collectively owned about 89% of the exchange.

On October 20, 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the exchange was for sale by a group of its shareholders, and was expected to be sold for about $600 million.

On November 7, 2007, NASDAQ announced a &quot;definitive agreement&quot; to purchase PHLX for $652 million, with the transaction expected to close in early 2008. On July 24, 2008, the acquisition was completed, creating the third-largest options market in the U.S.

On October 29, 2012, the stock exchange was shut down for two days due to Hurricane Sandy. The last time the stock exchange was closed due to weather for a full two days was on March 12 and 13, 1888.

As of 2014, the exchange handles trades for approximately 3,600 equity options, 15 index options, and a number of FX options. The PHLX has more than 16% of United States market share in exchange-listed stock and ETF options trading.

In March 2020, the PHLX announced plans to temporarily move to all-electronic trading on March 23, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with the NYSE and the BSE, the PHLX reopened on May 26, 2020.

<doc id="230088" wikidata="Q4458741" url="?curid=230088" title="Pacific Exchange">
<text>The Pacific Exchange was a regional stock exchange in California, from 1956 to 2006. Its main exchange floor and building were in San Francisco, California, with a branch building in Los Angeles, California.

In 1882, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange was founded; and in 1899 the Los Angeles Oil Exchange was founded. In 1956, these two exchanges merged to create the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, with trading floors maintained in both cities.

In 1973, it was renamed the Pacific Stock Exchange. The Pacific Exchange was bought by Archipelago Holdings in 2005, which merged with the New York Stock Exchange in 2006. Pacific Exchange equities and options trading now take place exclusively through the NYSE Arca platform.

==History==
Two separate exchanges were founded; the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange in 1882 and the Los Angeles Oil Exchange in 1899. In 1956, they merged to create the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, though separate trading floors were maintained in both cities. In 1973, it was renamed the Pacific Stock Exchange and it began trading options three years later in 1976.

In 1999, the exchange became the first U.S. stock exchange to demutualize. The trading floor in Los Angeles was closed in 2001, followed by the floor in San Francisco a year later. 2003 saw the exchange launch PCX Plus, an electronic options trading platform.

By 2005, the Pacific Exchange was bought by the owner of the ArcaEx platform, Archipelago Holdings, which then merged with the New York Stock Exchange in 2006. The New York Stock Exchange conducts no business operations under the name Pacific Exchange, essentially ending its separate identity. Pacific Exchange equities and options trading now takes place exclusively through the NYSE Arca (formerly known as ArcaEx) platform, an Electronic communication network (ECN), as NYSE Arca Equities and NYSE Arca Options, respectively.

==San Francisco Pacific Exchange building history==

The San Francisco Pacific Exchange building, which once housed the equities trading floor, is located on Pine Street at the corner of Sansome Street in the Financial District in San Francisco. The building was initially designed in a neoclassical style by architect Milton Dyer in 1915. 

It was remodeled in 1930 by the firms Miller and Pflueger, architects James Rupert Miller and Timothy Pflueger; and the interior design was done by architect Michael Goodman. The exterior building sculptures were created in Yosemite granite by artist Ralph Stackpole. Sketches made by Pflueger for the remodel of this building can be found in the permanent collection at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. After the 1930 remodeling, the building was in an Art Deco Moderne style, with its street facade was clad in Yule marble.

The building was sold to private developers and converted by Equinox Fitness into a fitness center.

==Mills Building==

An options trading floor in the city of San Francisco still operates in the adjacent Mills Building on the second floor. It was originally connected to the main building and underwent an expansion in September 1984 and expanded again in the mid-1990s with major changes to the layout.

<doc id="230089" wikidata="Q2492950" url="?curid=230089" title="Nine Princes in Amber">
<text>Nine Princes in Amber is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, the first in the &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series. It was first published in 1970, and later spawned a computer game of the same name. The first (Doubleday hardcover) edition of the novel is unusually rare; the publisher pulped a significant part of the original print run in error when the order went out to destroy remaining copies of Zelazny&#x27;s older book &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness&quot;.

In the story, Carl Corey wakes up in a secluded New York hospital with amnesia. He escapes and investigates, discovering the truth, piece by piece: he is really Prince Corwin, of Amber, the one true world of which the Earth is just a shadow. He is one of nine men who might rule Amber, if he can fight his way past the armies of his older brother Eric.

==Plot==
Corwin wakes up from a coma in a hospital in New York with amnesia. He soon discovers that he is part of a superhuman royal family who can wander among infinite parallel worlds (called &quot;shadows&quot;), and who rule over the one true world, Amber. He meets members of this newly rediscovered family, and then later is shown and walks in the Pattern, a labyrinth inscribed in the dungeons of Castle Amber which gives the multiverse its order. Walking in the Pattern of Rebma (a city in Shadows that mirrors the true city of Amber, down to the smallest detail, including the pattern) restores Corwin&#x27;s memory and his abilities to travel through Shadows. In alliance with his brother Bleys, he attempts to conquer Amber, which is ruled by his elder brother Eric. Eric took power after the disappearance of their father, Oberon. Their attempt fails. Bleys falls from the side of the Kolvir mountain and Corwin is captured, blinded and imprisoned. Thanks to his genetic regenerative ability, his eyes regrow, and he regains his vision. Dworkin Barimen, the mad sorcerer who created the pattern, enters Corwin&#x27;s prison through the walls of Corwin&#x27;s prison cell, and eventually draws on the wall the door through which Corwin escapes.

==Characters==

The Machiavellian royal family of Amber is headed by Oberon, the former king, now absent. His five daughters are Florimel, Deirdre, Fiona, Llewella, and Coral (who doesn&#x27;t come into play until book 9) but the major players of the novel are the nine princes of the title:

* Benedict. The oldest surviving prince, uninvolved in the current struggle for the crown, he is the master tactician of the family and a man who seldom smiles. He is presumed to be dead by the rest of the family.
* Corwin. The protagonist. A cross between a cruel rogue and a reluctant poet, his years on Earth seem to have softened him somewhat: &quot;And remember who it was who gave you your life where another would have taken it&quot;.
* Eric. The arrogant yet competent would-be king of Amber; he commands the loyalty of Julian, Caine and Gérard.
* Caine. Calculating and realistic.
* Bleys. Dashing and charming; Corwin&#x27;s other ally in his fight against Eric.
* Brand. Like Oberon, mysteriously unavailable. 
* Julian. A sinister hunter. 
* Gérard. Physically strongest of the nine, affable and liked even by his enemies.
* Random. A sneaky rascal albeit Corwin&#x27;s ally. A gambler and the youngest of Oberon&#x27;s children.

== Adaptations ==
A three-part comic adaptation was done by Terry Bisson in 1996. A film adaptation was first planned in 1998, with Mark Canton and Akiva Goldsman producing and Ed Neumeier adapting. In 2016, the creators of the &quot;Walking Dead&quot; TV series announced that they were producing a TV adaptation of &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot;, and in 2023 it was announced that Stephen Colbert will be an executive producer, via his Spartina Productions company.

<doc id="230091" wikidata="Q15048" url="?curid=230091" title="Elio Di Rupo">
<text>Elio Di Rupo (; born 18 July 1951) is a Belgian politician who has served as the minister-president of Wallonia since 2019. He is affiliated with the Socialist Party. Di Rupo previously served as the prime minister of Belgium from 6 December 2011 to 11 October 2014, heading the Di Rupo Government. He was the first francophone to hold the office since Paul Vanden Boeynants in 1979, and the country&#x27;s first socialist prime minister since Edmond Leburton left office in 1974. Di Rupo was also Belgium&#x27;s first prime minister of non-Belgian descent, and the world&#x27;s second openly gay person and first openly gay man to be head of government in modern times.

==Background and early life==
Di Rupo was born in Morlanwelz, Wallonia, to Italian parents. His father was born in San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore. While Di Rupo was born in Belgium, his brothers and sisters were all born in Italy. When he was one year old, his father died in a car crash and his mother was unable to raise all seven children. Due to the poor financial state of his family, three of his brothers were raised in a nearby orphanage.

When he was 12, he attended boarding school. Due to medical issues, Di Rupo had to re-do his first year of high school twice, but eventually excelled in science at the end of his high school years. This led him to pursue a degree in chemistry at the University of Mons, where he eventually obtained a PhD in Chemistry, after being a part-time lecturer at Leeds University as well.

==Political career==
Di Rupo came in contact with the socialist movement for the first time during his studies in Mons, where he first obtained a master&#x27;s degree and afterwards a PhD in chemistry. He went during the preparation of his doctorate to the University of Leeds (United Kingdom), where his function was that of lecture member of staff in 1977–1978.

He started his political career as an attaché at the cabinet of Jean-Maurice Dehousse in 1980–81. His first political mandate came in 1982, when he was Councillor of Mons (until 1985, and again from 1988 until 2000). In 1986, he was mayor of health, urban renewal and social affairs. Professionally, Di Rupo was at the same time cabinet member and then Deputy Head of Cabinet of the minister of finance of that time of the Walloon region and consequently Deputy Head of Cabinet of the minister of finance and energy of the Walloon region at that time Philippe Busquin (1981–85) and superintendent of the energy-inspection of the ministry of the Walloon region.

He is a deputy (MP) for the Arrondissement of Mons in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. He once described François Mitterrand as being &quot;a character from a novel&quot;.

In 2000, he became the mayor of Mons, which is the capital of the province of Hainaut.

In 1987, he got his national political breakthrough. He was elected as member of the Chamber of Deputies and went two years later for a short time to the European Parliament.

In 1991, Di Rupo was chosen as a senator, but shortly afterwards (1992), he took in the French-speaking community his first ministerial function in Education and later also Media. These were his responsibilities until Guy Coëme, who was mentioned in the Agusta-scandal, resigned and Di Rupo went to the federal government in 1994 as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Traffic and Governmental companies. Following the elections in 1995, he remained the Vice-Prime Minister of Belgium and was appointed minister of Economics and Telecommunications. In 1995 he signed the merger of the Belgian airline Sabena with Swiss Air that eventually led to the bankruptcy of Sabena with thousands of unemployed employees as result.

In 1996, at the time of the Dutroux affair, Olivier Trusgnach, a prostitute, alleged that Di Rupo paid him for sex while Trusgnach was still a minor. This accusation could have meant the end of his political career. Di Rupo denied the accusations.

After the federal and regional elections of June 1999 in which, due to the Dioxin Affair, the Christian-Democrats lost many of their votes, Di Rupo negotiated with the Flemish socialists of sp.a, the Liberals and Green Party to form a &quot;purple-green&quot; government. Di Rupo himself was in charge of the function of minister-president of the Walloon region, but already in October of the same year the members of the party chose him as president and in April 2000, he was succeeded in his function of minister-president by Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe.

As new president of the party, Di Rupo was forced to make a generation change within the PS and go down a new path. During the regional and federal elections of 1995 and 1999, the PS lost many of its votes, partly because of corruption scandals in the 1990s (named Agusta-scandal and UNIOP-affair), in which the most prominent PS-politicians were involved. PS had been in the government subsequently since 1988 (in the regional government and in the federal government), but the liberal PRL (now MR) became in the 1999-elections as strong as the PS. Apart from those two, Ecolo also became an important political party. Di Rupo realised that drastic action was required to regain the position of the PS. By several measures, such as &quot;Contrat d&#x27;avenir pour la Wallonie&quot; (Contract for the Future of Wallonia) and a new generation of party leaders, by which Marie Arena was important, he tried to reassemble the left wing-forces around him. Successfully, because in the elections of 2003, PS regained the electoral score of 1991 and was by far the most important political party before MR. During the regional elections of 2004, it also became the most important party in the Brussels capital region.
Di Rupo changed, in 2004, the liberal coalition partner for the Christian-democratic party, in the Walloon Government and in the Brussels Capital Government (in the last also the green party Ecolo was part of the government). By doing this, coalitions were made which differed from the federal coalition at that time. In October 2005, he became Minister-President of Wallonia after Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe resigned amid a corruption scandal, involving several members of Di Rupo&#x27;s party. He continued as party leader though and has had to deal with the PS&#x27;s ICDI affair that emerged in May 2006.

In 2006 and 2007, Di Rupo and his party appeared unsuccessful in trying to clean out corruption. This was probably instrumental in the party&#x27;s losing its first place amongst French community parties 2007 federal election. Di Rupo then decided to take a firmer stance against corruption in Charleroi: he virtually took control of the city&#x27;s Socialist Party and ordered the Socialist mayor and aldermen to resign.

After former PS president Guy Spitaels urged him to choose between the presidency of the party and of the Walloon Government, Di Rupo decided to organise internal elections for party president in July 2007 rather than in October of that year and announced that he would resign from his mandate as Minister-President if re-elected. On 11 July 2007, he was re-elected president of the Socialist Party with 89.5% of the votes.

===Prime Minister of Belgium===

Following the 2010 Belgian general election, in which the PS emerged as the largest of the Francophone parties and the second largest political party in Belgium, speculation emerged as to whether Di Rupo could be the Prime Minister in a new government. The RTBF raised questions, however, about whether Di Rupo&#x27;s limited fluency in Dutch would be a stumbling block in seeking that office; every prime minister since 1979 had been a Fleming.

In May 2011, he was appointed Formateur by King Albert II, which gave Di Rupo the task of forming a government. Traditionally, the Formateur also becomes the Prime Minister of the government he forms. He became prime minister of the Di Rupo I Government on 6 December 2011.

With Di Rupo&#x27;s appointment, Belgium ended 589 days without a government, believed to be the longest such streak ever for a country in the developed world. Yves Leterme had resigned on 26 April 2010 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister since then.

==Board of directors==
Between 2004 and 2005, Elio Di Rupo was on the board of directors of what was then Dexia bank, currently Belfius.

==Personal life==

Di Rupo describes himself as an &quot;atheist, rationalist, and Freemason.&quot; He is fluent in Italian, French and English. After becoming Prime Minister, he took Dutch lessons to address his previous limited fluency in the language and this improved enough for him to be able to address the parliament in Dutch and conduct TV interviews in the language.

Di Rupo came out as gay in 1996, and when asked by a confrontational &quot;media pack&quot; if he was gay, he responded, &quot;Yes. So what?&quot; He is the first openly gay man to lead a sovereign state, and the first openly gay person to win the position through an election.

Between Di Rupo&#x27;s election and 2013, he was one of the only three openly gay or lesbian national heads of government, the other ones being Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, and Luxembourgish Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.

<doc id="230092" wikidata="Q2996611" url="?curid=230092" title="The Guns of Avalon">
<text>The Guns of Avalon is fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, the second book in the &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series. The book continues straight from the previous volume, &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;, although it includes a recapitulation.

==Plot summary==
Corwin has escaped the dungeons of Amber, where he was imprisoned by his hated brother Eric, who had seized the throne of Amber. All of Corwin&#x27;s siblings believe that guns cannot function in Amber, as gunpowder is inert there. But Corwin has secret knowledge: in the shadow world of Avalon, where he once ruled, there exists a jeweler&#x27;s rouge that will function in Amber as gunpowder should. Corwin plans to raise a legion of shadow soldiers and arm them with automatic rifles from the shadow world Earth. While gathering these forces Corwin discovers a more sinister problem growing among the shadows. He meets Dara, a woman claiming to be his great-grandniece, and later discovers a threat to Amber: a black road which runs across universes from the Courts of Chaos to Amber. With his newly trained army, Corwin marches on Castle Amber only to find it already under siege. Eric is mortally wounded and passes the Jewel of Judgment to Corwin, making Corwin Regent. The immediate danger passes, but Dara threatens greater peril after walking the Pattern and revealing herself to be a creature of the Courts of Chaos, intent on destroying both Amber and the Shadows.

== Reception ==
Avram Davidson gave the novel a lukewarm review, complaining that he did not &quot;feel for any of [its] characters the slightest empathy, sympathy, or even osteopathy&quot; and concluding that &quot;there is nothing outrageously &quot;bad&quot; in [this] book of magic, intrigue, and warfare, but very little that is very good&quot;.

== Deleted scene ==
Roger Zelazny wrote an explicit sex scene (by 1970s American publishing standards) between Corwin and Dara and was amused when the book&#x27;s editor asked him to remove it so that sales to libraries would not be jeopardized. That deleted scene has never appeared with the novel but has been printed for the first time in &quot;The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain&quot;.

== Adaptation ==
A three-part comic adaptation was done by Terry Bisson and drawn by Christopher Schenck and Andrew Pepoy in 1996, published by Dark Horse Comics.

<text>Sign of the Unicorn is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, the third book in the &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series. It was first published in serial format in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
Eric is dead, and Corwin now rules Amber as Regent — but someone has murdered Caine and framed Corwin. Random tells his part of the story. Corwin decides to find out what happened to Brand who is either missing or dead, and begins to find his obsession with the throne is a two-edged sword that may cost him his life, as it has his brothers&#x27;.

== Plot summary==
Corwin returns to Castle Amber bearing the body of one of the spined, bloodshot-eyed humanoid creatures that had pursued Random to Flora&#x27;s house on Earth—one that had moments earlier killed his brother, Caine. Fearing that he has been framed for Caine&#x27;s murder, Corwin summons Random, who tells him the story how he came to be chased across shadow to end up in New York City:

Random had been enjoying life out in a shadow, Texorami, that he had selected/created to be an ideal place to gamble, hang-glide and especially play the drums. One day he received an unusual Trump call in the form of the Jack of Diamonds, that spoke to him as his brother, Brand, asking for help to escape from an unfamiliar shadow.

Random set out to rescue Brand from the shadow, a land lit without a sun, where boulders orbit each other in complicated patterns. He found the tower where Brand was imprisoned, but could not overcome its guardian, a transparent, glass, prismatic, dragon-like creature. Spined humanoids pursued Random through shadow. Seeking an ally, he headed for Earth, hoping to exploit Flora, but finds Corwin instead. Since Corwin had been missing for so long. Random assumes the creatures belonged to him, and though confused when Corwin fights the creatures, is sufficiently frightened to aid Corwin in getting to Amber.

After hearing Random&#x27;s story, Corwin descends to the chamber of the Pattern, to attune himself to the Jewel of Judgement, a powerful artifact given to Corwin by Eric as he lay dying, which gives its wearer among other powers control of weather in Amber. He walks the pattern, and then commands it to project him into the Jewel. He is metaphysically carried through a higher-dimensional Pattern within the Jewel, emerging with what he describes as a &quot;higher octave&quot; of awareness.

Corwin then teleports himself to a high tower of the castle. After testing his new attunement to the Jewel, he summons Flora. He learns that most of his brothers had sought him in shadow during his absence — some to try to find him; some to implicate Eric in their father, Oberon&#x27;s death.

Gérard accompanies Corwin to the Grove of the Unicorn, where Caine was killed. Gérard fights Corwin, and later threatens him physically while all of the siblings are watching through trumps and is told that if he turns out to be responsible for Caine&#x27;s death, Gérard will kill him, and that if Gérard is killed, the siblings will know Corwin did it. Corwin points out that if someone wants to kill Corwin and free themselves from suspicion, they now only have to kill Gérard. Gérard, angered, accuses him of trying to complicate matters. The two brothers return to Caine&#x27;s body, and see a glimpse of the Unicorn.

Corwin then arranges a family meeting, allowing Random to re-tell his tale. While not entirely convinced of Corwin&#x27;s innocence, they agree to attempt to recover the one remaining person who has seen these creatures — Brand. With their combined efforts, they are able to contact Brand through the trump, and pull him through to Amber. Although Brand was relatively intact in his cell, they find he has been stabbed as he is brought to them. Gérard pushes the others aside and gives first aid to Brand, while the others realize the implications of the stabbing — one of them must have tried to kill their brother.

The siblings guardedly discuss who the would-be murderer might be. Fiona points out that only she and Julian are sensible suspects — and she is &quot;innocent of all but malice&quot;. She also warns Corwin that the Jewel is more than just a weather-control device; in truth, it is an artifact of great power which draws upon its bearer&#x27;s life force — and may well have been what killed Eric. She says that when people around the bearer seem to be statue-like, the bearer is near death.

Corwin heads for his rooms, discussing matters with Random, who has a hard time keeping up with Corwin. Corwin enters his room, but notices too late a figure poised to stab him. However the stab itself appears to be so slow that it only grazes him. Corwin blacks out.

He awakens in his former home on Earth, bleeding and nearing death. He drops a pillow, but it hangs in the air. He realizes that the Jewel is killing him, so he hides it in the house&#x27;s compost heap and heads for the road, hoping to hitch-hike to a hospital where he can recover. He is eventually picked up by Bill Roth, a lawyer who recognizes him as Carl Corey, the name Corwin had used in the past to pass for a human. In hospital, he learns that his car accident happened during his escape from a mental asylum, where he had been committed by a Dr. Hillary &quot;B. Rand&quot; by his brother &quot;Brand&quot;on Corey. He is contacted via Trump by Random, who returns him to Amber, saying that Brand has woken up and wishes to speak to him.

Brand gradually tells Corwin about how he, Bleys and Fiona had removed Oberon and tried to claim the throne, but were opposed by the triumvirate of Eric, Julian and Caine. He says that after he objected to Bleys and Fiona&#x27;s plan to ally with the forces of Chaos, he was pursued and came to Earth seeking Corwin as an ally—trying to restore his memories with shock therapy—but was captured and imprisoned in the tower where Random found him. During the conversation, Brand displays pyrokinetic abilities.

Corwin then heads to Tir-na Nog&#x27;th, the mysterious, moonlit Amber-in-the-sky where he hopes to gain insight into the situation. His sword Grayswandir has special properties in the moonlit city, having been forged upon the stairway to Tir-na Nog&#x27;th. With Random and Ganelon watching him from mount Kolvir, he ascends to Tir-na Nog&#x27;th, and in the throne room sees Dara as queen, flanked by Benedict wearing a metallic arm. This dream-version of Dara tells him her origins and the ghostly Benedict is able to reach Corwin with the arm. A fight ensues. Corwin cuts off the arm, and is trumped back to Kolvir by Random, with the arm still clutching his shoulder.

The three set off for Amber, but are drawn through shadow — which should be impossible this close to Amber — and come to an enlarged version of the Grove of the Unicorn, where they see the eponymous beast. They are led back to where Amber should stand, but instead there is a plateau on which there is a copy of the Pattern. With a shock, Corwin and Ganelon realize that this is the true, Primal Pattern, of which the one in Amber is but the first shadow.

==Reception==
Charlotte Moslander of &quot;Luna Monthly&quot; called the novel the &quot;best of the three books.&quot; Alexei and Cory Panshin of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; called it &quot;Zelazny&#x27;s best book since Lord of Light&quot; and wrote that while it &quot;could stand a second draft&quot;, the characters &quot;begin to take on form and weight and individuality&quot; and the last two chapters &quot;toss away all the certainties and selfprotections that Zelazny has bounded himself with — that crucial move that Smith and Bishop and Russ could not make.&quot; Richard E. Geis of &quot;The Science Fiction Review&quot; called it a &quot;failure as a self-contained novel&quot; and that it is &quot;still incomplete, still the preamble to the final, climactic book(s?) of the series.&quot;

Corwin explores the true Amber, and finds the source of the Black Road, in the damaged primal Pattern. He learns that to repair the damage will require the Jewel of Judgement, which he must retrieve from Earth.

==Plot summary==
Corwin, Random and Ganelon go down to the Primal Pattern and see that it is damaged, with a dark stain obscuring the pattern from the center to one edge, in the shape of the corrupted Vale of Garnath. They also see a pair of objects at the pattern&#x27;s centre. While Corwin and Random discuss whether it would be safe to walk a damaged pattern, Ganelon runs through the stain to the center and retrieves the objects - a dagger, and a pierced Trump card. A purple griffin-like beast emerges from a cave, and Random&#x27;s horse runs onto the pattern. The horse is consumed/ripped apart by a rainbow-coloured tornado.

Ganelon discusses what it was like to run on the stain, and asks Random to drop a small amount of blood on the pattern. The blood drop stains the pattern in the same way, and they realize that the trump must have been used to spill blood onto the pattern by someone at its centre. Random recognizes the trump as that of his Rebman son, Martin. Corwin recognises the style of the trump as that of Brand.

Ganelon proposes that Corwin use the Trumps to contact Benedict, who transports them to the slopes of mount Kolvir. Random and Benedict, who had known and was fond of Martin, set off through shadow to find him, or if necessary avenge his death. Corwin returns to Amber to inform Random&#x27;s wife, Vialle, that Random will be gone for a while. Discussing matters with her, he realizes that now Eric is dead he no longer wants the throne - but he still loves Amber and wishes to repair the damage, even though he is no longer sure it is his fault.

Corwin then descends into the depths of the castle to find his former cell in the dungeons. On the way to his cell, Corwin meets Roger Zelazny, who makes an appearance in his own book. The author describes himself as a &quot;...lean, cadaverous figure... smoking his pipe, grinning around it&quot;. In his dialogue with Corwin, Roger states that he is &quot;...writing a philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity&quot;. This may or may not be a not-so-subtle description of the entire &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series.

Once in his former cell, Corwin uses the trump that Dworkin drew on the wall to project himself to the mad sorcerer&#x27;s chambers. Dworkin incorrectly assumes that Corwin is Oberon, and reveals to him in a vaguely metaphoric manner that he, Dworkin, is Oberon&#x27;s father (and that the mother was the Unicorn), and that he drew the Pattern using the &quot;Jewel of Judgement&quot;, which was given to him by the Unicorn after he fled from Chaos. Dworkin then describes how the damage to the Pattern could be fixed if he destroyed himself, erasing the pattern and allowing Oberon to draw another.

Dworkin takes Corwin to the Primal Pattern, past the purple griffin, Wixer. Dworkin then realizes that it is Corwin, and explains that there is a way to mend the Pattern using the Jewel of Judgement, though that would be more difficult, and probably fatal to the person who attempted it. Dworkin then loses control of his madness, transforming into a monstrous beast and pursuing Corwin back into his chambers. Corwin escapes via a Trump which he finds there.

He finds himself in the Courts of Chaos, a great castle which looks out over the Abyss, a swirling black/white hole, under a half-colored-stripy, half-black-swirly sky. Corwin remembers being brought here as a child by Oberon, to see that this is in fact the true source of all creation, not Amber. A strange, pale rider attacks Corwin, but is defeated. A familiar-seeming man approaches with a crossbow, but spares Corwin after recognizing him by his blade.

Corwin contacts Gérard via Trump, and learns that because of the time differential between Amber and Chaos he has been missing for eight days.

Corwin takes the pierced trump of Martin to Brand, who admits stabbing Martin through the trump in order to damage the pattern, as part of his cabal&#x27;s scheme to capture Oberon. He tries to persuade Corwin to use the Trump to kill Bleys and Fiona, as he was stabbed. He asks for the Jewel to help him to restrain them, but Corwin is unconvinced.

Ganelon, who is with Benedict, contacts Corwin via Trump. Benedict is now wearing the metallic arm from Tir-na Nog&#x27;th. Corwin gives Benedict the trump of the Courts.

Gérard arrives via Trump. Brand has gone missing, and his room is covered in blood. Gérard becomes convinced that Corwin has finished Brand off, and starts to fight Corwin. Ganelon stops Gérard&#x27;s punch and knocks him unconscious with several blows, giving Corwin time to escape.

Corwin flees into the forest of Arden, hoping to retrieve the Jewel from Earth. A manticora pursues him, but Julian arrives and kills it. Julian explains that the Eric-Julian-Caine triumvirate arose only to oppose Brand&#x27;s cabal, taking the throne to prevent Bleys from claiming it. When Corwin arrived with Bleys, they assumed he had joined the cabal, but when (after his capture) they realized he only wanted the throne, Julian suggested blinding him as an alternative to killing him. Julian tells Corwin how Brand has acquired strange powers, including becoming a &quot;living Trump&quot;, capable of teleporting himself or other objects through shadow.

Corwin proceeds to Earth, musing on his new-found respect for Julian. He arrives to find that the compost heap where he hid the Jewel of Judgment is gone. With the help of Bill Roth, he tracks down the heap, but the Jewel has already been taken from it by a man matching Brand&#x27;s description.

Corwin contacts Amber and has guards posted on the Patterns in Amber and Rebma, hoping to prevent Brand from using them to attune himself to the Jewel. Fiona contacts him via Trump, and projects herself to Earth. She then leads Corwin to the Primal Pattern, taking a short-cut through a starry tunnel. She explains that she and Bleys had imprisoned Brand because he had decided to destroy the Pattern and re-create, reshaping the multiverse according to his own liking. They kept him alive because they believed he might be helpful in repairing the damage. She also explains that Brand tried to kill Corwin on Earth because he saw a vision in Tir-na Nog&#x27;th that Corwin would defeat him. Fiona confirms that Bleys survived the fall from the cliff in the first book.

They arrive to find Brand already on the Primal Pattern. Corwin follows, hoping to slay Brand while he is distracted, but he realises that slaying Brand would further damage the Pattern. He instead gets close enough to ask the Jewel to summon a tornado, of the sort that destroyed Random&#x27;s horse, but Brand escapes into shadow.

Leaving Fiona to guard the Primal Pattern, Corwin goes to his tomb to meet Random and Martin, who have just arrived. Martin tells Corwin how he was attacked by Brand, and how he met Dara in shadow. Ganelon contacts Corwin to tell him that Tir-na Nog&#x27;th will appear tonight, along with its version of the Pattern. Reasoning that Brand will attempt to attune himself there, Ganelon asks Benedict to walk the Pattern in Amber, ready to teleport himself directly to Tir-na Nog&#x27;th&#x27;s pattern when the city appears, and tells Corwin to keep permanent contact with Benedict through the Trump to teleport him out in case the city becomes immaterial.

Corwin rides to the top of Kolvir and contacts Benedict via the Trump. Tir-na Nog&#x27;th appears, and Benedict teleports himself there. Brand appears shortly afterwards, and tries to persuade Benedict to allow him to re-create the Pattern. Benedict refuses and Brand, partly attuned to the Jewel from his earlier partial walk through the primal Pattern, uses it to freeze Benedict in place and prevent Corwin from interfering through the trump. Brand makes to stab the paralyzed Benedict, but at the last moment, Benedict&#x27;s mechanical arm moves apparently of its own accord, snatching the Jewel and choking Brand by its chain. Defeated, Brand teleports away, leaving the Jewel.

Corwin and Benedict decide that the arm being the right weapon in the right place at the right time is too convenient a happenstance to be some sort of coincidence, and so it must have been arranged by some guiding force — Oberon. Together, they try Oberon&#x27;s Trump, and find that contact comes easily. They are answered by a grinning Ganelon.

==Authorial appearance==
Roger Zelazny (or possibly one of his doppelgängers) makes a cameo in his own novel as &quot;Roger&quot; — a cadaverous, grinning, pipe-smoking guard in Amber&#x27;s dungeon who is writing a &quot;philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity&quot;. Some of the themes of the series as a whole are shadows, doubles and the nature of reality.

<text>The Courts of Chaos is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, the fifth book in the &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series. It was first published in serial format in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;.

This book ends the original series narrated by Corwin. The next series begins with &quot;Trumps of Doom&quot; following his son, Merlin, as the protagonist.

Corwin must ride the entire length of the multiverse, from Amber to the Courts of Chaos, while Oberon attempts to repair the Pattern. All the while, Brand pursues him, trying to steal the Jewel of Judgement.

==Plot summary==
Corwin sulks in Castle Amber&#x27;s library while Oberon gives the family orders. Random persuades Corwin to leave, but they encounter a real-life scene mirroring Corwin&#x27;s earlier experience in Tir-na Nog&#x27;th: prevented from interfering by an invisible force, they watch as Corwin&#x27;s sword appears and chops off Benedict&#x27;s new arm.

Dara and Martin are with Benedict. Corwin learns from Martin&#x27;s trumps that the crossbowman who spared him is Merlin. Dara tells how Brand bargained with the Courts of Chaos. They wished to replace him with Merlin, but Dara feared that neither would keep their word.

Still unconvinced, Corwin contacts Fiona. She confirms Dara&#x27;s authority, and says that Oberon is about to repair the Pattern. Hoping to save Oberon, Corwin grabs the Jewel and attempts to walk the primal pattern himself, but he is stopped by Oberon or Dworkin. Oberon has a final talk with his son. Corwin explains that he no longer wants to rule.

Once Corwin confirms Dara&#x27;s authority, Benedict uses the trump of the Courts of Chaos to begin his attack. Dara talks to Corwin. Dara then leaves to give the rest of the family their orders. Gérard is ordered to stay and guard Amber, while Julian and Random are to stay in Arden.

Oberon arrives, and asks Corwin for some of his blood. He breathes life into the blood, and it becomes a red raven. Oberon tells Corwin that the raven will follow him through shadow. Corwin&#x27;s orders are to hellride towards Chaos as fast as possible. He must bear the Jewel through shadow.

Corwin says goodbye to his father, and sets off. Now that he knows that Amber is just the first Shadow, he finds he can shift shadow there more easily. As he rides towards Chaos, he follows the Black Road. After a time, he notices the black road begin to come apart; shortly after, the raven arrives and gives him the Jewel. Corwin is unsure whether this means that Oberon has succeeded or failed.

Brand traps Corwin in a small shadow, telling him that he saw through shadow, watching Oberon fail, and that Corwin must now give him the Jewel so he can create a new Pattern. Corwin refuses, and escapes from the shadow by traveling in a circle instead of straight. He notices an unusually large storm following him, and takes refuge in a cave. The cave&#x27;s other occupant, a nameless stranger who has also sought shelter from the storm, casually mentions some local legends about the Archangel Corwin, who, according to scripture will ride before a storm at the end of the world. The real Corwin dismisses this story as unhelpful and commands the Jewel to quell the storm. Eventually, he falls asleep.

When he wakes, his horse has been kidnapped. He says goodbye to the stranger and tracks his horse to a cave, blocked off by a large boulder, which he shatters. Inside, leprechauns are celebrating a feast. Observing his great strength, they return his horse and invite him to join them. Succumbing to their odd charm, he starts to fall asleep, but rouses himself in time to see them preparing to slaughter him. He awakes and rushes outside. As he leaves, the leader of the wee folk recognizes him as the Archangel Corwin from local legends, mentioned before by the nameless stranger.

He starts to move into shadow, but as he moves further from the cave where he slept the universe starts to come apart around him. He realizes that the storm was a wave of Chaos, moving away from Amber as the multiverse is destroyed. He begins to doubt whether Oberon was successful.

Using the jewel, he is able to return to the diminishing multiverse. A strange lady dines with him and attempts to seduce him, but remembering his encounter with the pale lady on the black road (who may or may have not been a copy of Dara), and that he&#x27;s working to a deadline, he declines.

Brand ambushes him with a crossbow, accidentally mortally wounding his horse but, after a fight, the blood raven reappears, plucks out one of Brand&#x27;s eyes, and they both vanish. Corwin puts down his horse and continues striding through shadow on foot.

Corwin cuts a branch off a tree as a walking aid. The tree complains, but when it learns that he is Oberon&#x27;s son it gives him its blessing: Oberon planted the tree in Amber&#x27;s distant past to mark the boundary between Order and Chaos. It tells him to plant the staff somewhere it will have the chance to grow.

A talking raven named Hugi (of the usual color) arrives, tells him that the tree&#x27;s name was Ygg, and tries to distract Corwin with fatalistic philosophy. It shows Corwin the head of a mostly-drowned Giant, who will not even allow the possibility of rescue. A mythological jackal offers to lead Corwin on a shortcut to the Courts, but instead leads him to its lair, where Corwin kills it in self-defense. He finally finds a shadow with the Courts&#x27; sky, but is aghast to discover that the Courts still lie across a huge wasteland. The raven Hugi returns and pointedly tells him it knew all along, so he kills it for his dinner.

As the metaphysical storm approaches Chaos, Corwin decides that Oberon must have failed, so he plants his staff and begins to use the Jewel to inscribe a new Pattern. The process evokes memories of his former life in Paris, France, and is given the impression that these somehow shape the new Pattern. He finishes, but is exhausted, and he collapses at the new Pattern&#x27;s center. Brand projects himself to Corwin and steals the Jewel. Corwin loses consciousness.

Corwin awakes to find the area surrounding his Pattern transformed. The sky is now white, and the staff has grown into a tree. Corwin realises that he is at the center of a Pattern, and commands it to teleport him to the Courts.

He arrives in the courts, only to be challenged to single combat by someone who introduces himself as Borel. Corwin recognizes him as Master at Arms of the Courts of Chaos and the teacher of Dara in swordsmanship. Borel removes his armour to make the fight fair, but Corwin, having no time for a fair fight, tries to run away, and slays Borel with underhanded tactics when he pursues. He does feel slightly guilty about it afterward.

Corwin finds Brand with Fiona, Random and Deirdre, at the edge of the Abyss. Fiona is keeping him psychically bound, but Brand has Deirdre as a hostage. Suddenly an image of Oberon fills the sky, telling them that Corwin must use the Jewel to save them from the oncoming Chaos storm, leaves the question of succession &quot;[up to] the horn of the Unicorn&quot;, and gives them a blessing. Corwin makes use of the distraction and his attunement to the jewel to burn Brand, but Brand realizes what&#x27;s happening and starts to cut Deirdre. She pulls herself free, and Brand is shot in the throat and then chest with a bow. He staggers and grabs Deirdre&#x27;s hair. They both fall into the Abyss. Corwin tries to follow her and Random has to knock him out.

Corwin wakes up to see Caine there, alive and well. Caine explains how he wanted &quot;to get to the root of the trouble in Amber&quot; and, unsure whether Corwin or Brand was responsible, faked his own death (by killing one of his own shadows) to investigate more freely and tried to frame Corwin for it to get him pinned down. Caine then kept himself appraised of developments by spying on the others through the Trumps. It was he who shot Brand, using silver-tipped arrows, just in case, and also he who stabbed Corwin earlier.

They watch Amber&#x27;s armies crush the forces of Chaos while the storm continues to advance. A funeral procession, led by Dworkin, emerges from the storm front, accompanied by all sorts of fantastic beasts. Fiona appears with Dara and Corwin&#x27;s son, Merlin. Corwin discusses with Fiona the possibility that two Patterns now exist; she can&#x27;t decide whether that is good or bad. Dara arrives, angry with Corwin for killing Borel, and then leaves. Merlin arrives with her, but stays, eager to learn more about his father, Corwin.

The Unicorn appears from the Abyss somehow, wearing the Jewel of Judgement. It examines each of the Amberites in turn, then kneels in front of Random, presenting him the Jewel, and in accordance with Oberon&#x27;s message, the succession. The rest of the family kneel in front of him too, and pledge their allegiance to him as the new King. Random takes the Jewel, and Corwin is able to guide him through its attunement process. Corwin is exhausted, and stays with Random while the others go to the Courts, where they think they should be safe. Merlin stays, and asks to hear about his father&#x27;s adventures. Corwin begins narrating the Chronicles to his son.

Random is successful, and the Trumps become active. They contact Gérard, who tells them that the multiverse is fine, although seven years have passed. Corwin reflects on his changed attitudes towards his family, and on the changes in himself.

<doc id="230098" wikidata="Q1364848" url="?curid=230098" title="George Grote">
<text>George Grote (; 17 November 1794 – 18 June 1871) was an English political radical and classical historian. He is now best known for his major work, the voluminous &quot;History of Greece&quot;.

==Early life==
George Grote was born at Clay Hill near Beckenham in Kent. His grandfather, Andreas, originally a Bremen merchant, was one of the founders (on 1 January 1766) of the banking-house of Grote, Prescott &amp; Company in Threadneedle Street, London (the name of Grote did not disappear from the firm until 1879). His father, another George, married (1793) Selina, daughter of Henry Peckwell (1747–1787), minister of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s chapel in Westminster, and his wife Bella Blosset (descended from a Huguenot officer Salomon Blosset de Loche who left the Dauphiné on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes), and had one daughter and ten sons, of whom George was the eldest. His brothers were the moral philosopher John Grote and the colonial administrator Arthur Grote. (John Russell RA painted portraits of Henry Peckwell and Bella Blosset.)

Educated at first by his mother, George Grote was sent to Sevenoaks grammar school (1800–1804) and afterwards to Charterhouse School (1804–1810), where he studied under Dr Raine in company with Connop Thirlwall, George and Horace Waddington and Henry Havelock. In spite of Grote&#x27;s school successes, his father refused to send him to university and sent him to work at the bank. He spent all his spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and political economy and in learning German, French and Italian. Driven by his mother&#x27;s Puritanism and his father&#x27;s contempt for academic learning, he sought other friends, one of whom was Charles Hay Cameron, who strengthened him in his love of philosophy. 

Through another friend, George W. Norman, he met his wife, Harriet Lewin (1792–1878), a writer and later the biographer of the artist Ary Scheffer. After various difficulties the marriage took place on 5 March 1820, and was a happy one. His wife&#x27;s nephews were the actor William Terriss (the father of Ellaline Terriss) and administrator Thomas Herbert Lewin.

==Work and writing==
Meanwhile, Grote had finally decided his philosophic and political attitude. In 1817 he came under the influence of David Ricardo, and through him of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham. He settled in 1820 in a house attached to the bank in Threadneedle Street, where his only child died a week after its birth. During Mrs Grote&#x27;s convalescence at Hampstead, he wrote his first published work, the &quot;Statement of the Question of Parliamentary Reform&quot; (1821), in reply to Sir James Mackintosh&#x27;s article in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, advocating popular representation, vote by ballot and short parliaments. In April 1822 he published in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; a letter against George Canning&#x27;s attack on Lord John Russell, and edited, or rather re-wrote, some discursive papers of Bentham, which he published under the title &quot;Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind by Philip Beauchamp&quot; (1822). The book was published in the name of Richard Carlile, then in gaol at Dorchester. Though not a member of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Utilitarian Society (1822–1823), he took a great interest in a society for reading and discussion, which met from 1823 onwards in a room at the bank before business hours, twice a week.

Mrs Grote claimed to have first suggested the &quot;History of Greece&quot; in 1823; but the book was already in preparation in 1822. In April 1826 Grote published in &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; a criticism of William Mitford&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot;, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From 1826 to 1830 he was hard at work with John Stuart Mill and Henry Brougham in the organization of University College London. He was a member of the council which organized the faculties and the curriculum. In 1830, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the philosophical chairs (Grote objected to John Hoppus), he resigned his position. He rejoined the council in 1849 and was appointed Treasurer in 1860, then President in 1868. In his will Grote left £6,000 as an endowment for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London.

He went abroad in 1830, and spent some months in Paris with the Liberal leaders. Recalled by his father&#x27;s death (6 July), he became manager of the bank, and took a leading position among the City Radicals. In 1831 he published his important &quot;Essentials of Parliamentary Reform&quot; (an elaboration of his previous &quot;Statement&quot;), and, after refusing to stand as parliamentary candidate for the City of London in 1831, changed his mind and was elected head of the poll, with three other Liberals, in December 1832. As an MP, Grote spent much of his time unsuccessfully advocating for the secret ballot. After serving in three parliaments, he resigned in 1841, by which time his party (&quot;the Philosophical Radicals&quot;) had dwindled away.
During these years of active public life, his interest in Greek history and philosophy had increased, and after a trip to Italy in 1842, he severed his connection with the bank and devoted himself to literature. In 1846 the first two volumes of the &quot;History&quot; appeared. The remaining ten appeared between 1847 and the spring of 1856. In 1845, with William Molesworth and Raikes Currie, he gave money to Auguste Comte, then in financial difficulties. The formation of the Sonderbund (20 July 1847) led him to visit Switzerland and study for himself a condition of things in some sense analogous to that of the ancient Greek states. This visit resulted in the publication in &quot;The Spectator&quot; of seven weekly letters, collected in book form at the end of 1847 (see a letter to de Tocqueville in Mrs Grote&#x27;s reprint of the &quot;Seven Letters&quot;, 1876). Grote was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1853.

In 1856, Grote began to prepare his works on Plato and Aristotle. &quot;Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates&quot; (3 vols.) appeared in 1865. That work made him known by some as &quot;the greatest nineteenth-century Plato scholar&quot;. The work on Aristotle he did not complete. He had finished the &quot;Organon&quot; and was about to deal with the metaphysical and physical treatises when he died at his home in Mayfair, London, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. A marble bust of Grote was subsequently placed in the Abbey. The house, No. 12 Savile Row, now has a commemorative brown plaque on it.

He is said, in some estimations, to have been a man of strong character and self-control, unfailing courtesy and unswerving devotion to what he considered the best interests of the nation. Other historians, such as Guy MacLean Rogers, consider he can reasonably be accused of anti-clerical bias. Grote&#x27;s time on the Council at University College London was characterised by his contentious approach to two liberal nonconformists: John Hoppus and James Martineau, both of whom found ways to work around his opposition. Grote&#x27;s life has attracted a wide variety of biographical comment due to his strong views.

<text>NYSE Chicago, formerly known as the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX), is a stock exchange in Chicago, Illinois, US. The exchange is a national securities exchange and self-regulatory organization, which operates under the oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) acquired CHX in July 2018 and the exchange rebranded as NYSE Chicago in February 2019.

In 2025, NYSE announced plans to move the exchange to Dallas and rebrand as NYSE Texas.

==History==
===1882–1900===

The Chicago Stock Exchange was founded in a formal meeting on March 21, 1882. At this time, Charles Henrotin was elected the chairman and president. In April that year, a lease was taken out at 115 Dearborn Street for the location of the exchange and during that year 750 memberships were sold. On May 15, 1882, the Chicago Stock Exchange officially became public and opened its offices, with Henrotin being the first to promote it along with some business associates.

In 1894, the Chicago Stock Exchange moved its trading floor to the old Chicago Stock Exchange building, designed by the firm of Adler &amp; Sullivan, which was located at corner of Washington and LaSalle streets. The old Chicago Stock Exchange building was demolished in 1972, but the original trading floor and main entrance can now be found at the Art Institute of Chicago. The exchange began to flourish significantly in the late 1880s, with the rate of transactions of stocks and bonds increasing and earning them big profits.

===1901–2000===
In July 1914, the Exchange closed as a result of World War I, and remained closed until December 11. In October 1915, the basis of quoting and trading in stocks changed from percent to par value to dollars. On April 26, 1920, the Chicago Stock Exchange Stock Clearing Corporation was established. On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashed, resulting in a very difficult time period for the Chicago Stock Exchange, and the stock market in general.

In 1949, the CHX merged with the exchanges of St. Louis, Cleveland and Minneapolis/St. Paul to form the Midwest Stock Exchange, which kept its headquarters in Chicago. In 1959, the New Orleans Stock Exchange became part of the Midwest Stock Exchange, and in the early 1960s the Midwest Stock Exchange Service Corporation was established to provide centralized accounting for member firms.

In April 1978, the Chicago Stock Exchange launched an Intermarket Trading System (ITS), a system that allowed orders to be sent from one exchange to another to ensure that customers received the best execution available. In the 1980s, the Chicago Stock Exchange made several technological advancements to improve trading. In 1982, the CHX launched the MAX system, which allowed CHX to be one of the first stock exchanges to provide fully automated order execution. In 1987, the CHX implemented programs to trade Nasdaq securities.

In the 1990s, the Exchange had a rebirth, and in 1993 changed its name back to the Chicago Stock Exchange, reflecting its roots and identity within the Chicago financial community. In 1997 the Chicago Stock Exchange began trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

===2001–present===

At the beginning of the new millennium, several major changes occurred. In 2005, the SEC approved a change of the ownership structure of the CHX from a not-for-profit, member-owned company to a for-profit, public stockholder-owned corporation (demutualization). The CHX now operates as a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of CHX Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Later in 2005, the CHX implemented the Electronic Book trading platform; the predecessor technology of the New Trading Model&#x27;s Matching System. In 2006, the Exchange announced regulatory and shareholder approval of an investment in CHX by Bank of America Corporation, Bear Stearns (acquired by JP Morgan Chase in 2008), E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. In the same year, the CHX announced that it had completed the migration to the New Trading Model platform (the CHX Matching System).

The National Stock Exchange ceased trading operations on May 30, 2014, bringing the number of active stock exchanges in the United States to 11. Wrote &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, that left &quot;just one public exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange Inc., that isn&#x27;t owned Bats, Nasdaq OMX Group or IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc.&quot;

On February 5, 2016, Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, a Chinese-led investment group, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent corporation of the Chicago Stock Exchange, for an undisclosed amount, which is subject to regulatory approvals. The privately held Casin Group was founded in 1997. A minority ownership position is held by Bank of America, E-Trade, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. The acquisition is valued to be less than $100 million. However, the deal was questioned by then-candidate Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, Congressman Robert Pittenger urged the United States Department of the Treasury to look into the Casin Group&#x27;s background. By August 2017, the deal was still pending, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing reservations. The sale was blocked by the government in February 2018.

The New York Stock Exchange&#x27;s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., agreed to acquire the 136-year-old market for an undisclosed amount. CHX will continue to operate as a registered national securities exchange till the end of 2019 when CHX will cease to exist.

==Trading on the CHX==
The CHX Matching System was designed for full electronic trade matching. Publicly traded companies do not need to be listed on the CHX to be traded at CHX; SEC rules allow the CHX to trade stocks listed on other exchanges.

In 2016, CHX rolled out its on-demand auction product, CHX SNAP (Sub-second Non-displayed Auction Process), which received regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2015 and a thorough review from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. CHX SNAP is designed to facilitate bulk trading of securities on a lit market and to minimize speed and information advantages enjoyed by only a few market participants.

<text>Matteo Pérez de Alesio (1547–1628) was an Italian painter of devotional, historical and maritime subjects during the Mannerist period. He was also known as Matteo da Lecce by virtue of his hometown of Lecce. He spent the majority of his entire artistic career in Peru, where he lived more than 40 years, between 1588 and 1628.

== Biography ==

Matteo Pérez was the son of Antonio de Alessio and Madama Lucente. He was born in Lecce in the Apulia region.

=== Italy, Malta and Seville ===

He studied under Michelangelo, working on the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican, painting the &quot;Fall of the Angels&quot; in the facade facing Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot;. He was a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He also painted an altarpiece for &quot;Sant&#x27;Eligio degli Orefici&quot;.

He travelled to Naples where he met the artist Pablo Moron, who became his long standing assistant. Perez&#x27;s works in Rome include the fresco &quot;The Dispute over the Body of Moses&quot; (circa 1574) in the Sistine Chapel; frescoes in the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli and the Villa Mondragone in Frascati. He also worked in Malta (from 1576), Seville (in the 1580s) and Lima (from 1589), where he died.

The Hall of St Michael and St George, also known as the Throne Room, of the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace, Valletta, is decorated with 13 of his frescoes showing the events of the great siege of Malta by the Turks in 1565. He is credited with having introduced mannerism to Malta with his frescoes. These were painted from 1575 to 1581, at the same time as the oil paintings of the same scene, four of which can be found in the Cube Room of the Queen&#x27;s House, Greenwich, London. Among his other works in Malta there is the Baptism of Christ which was originally the titular painting of the St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral.

He migrated to Spain in 1583. He completed a monumental fresco, in 1584, in the cathedral of Seville, representing a giant &quot;St. Christopher carrying the Infant Saviour on his shoulder&quot;. He painted in 1587 the same subject for the church of San Miguel, and he also painted in other public edifices at Seville.

=== Peru ===

Pérez de Alesio came to Lima from Rome, accompanied by his disciple and helper Pedro Pablo Morón whom he had contracted as an apprentice in 1583. Morón was to serve him as a helper with a salary of 200 ducados for the 10 years that the contract would last. In 1593, Pérez de Alesio renewed the contract for another 2 and a half years, giving Morón three times the original agreed upon amount. He renewed the contract again for another two years in 1595.

Contracts dating from 1588 to 1628 place Pérez de Alesio in Lima. He brought with him a collection of prints by Dürer and opened a workshop that attracted a number of students and disciples, including Pedro Pablo Morón but also Francisco García (in 1595); the Augustinian friar Francisco Bejarano (in 1599); Domingo Gil from 1600 to 1603; Cosme Ferrero Figueroa and later his son Adriano; forming what Rubén Vargas Ugarte described as one of the first art academies in Lima. In 1590 he painted a portrait of the viceroy García Hurtado de Mendoza, the fourth Marques of Cañete, and as a result he signed a document as &quot;Painter of his Lordship the Lord Viceroy.&quot; In 1592 he achieved the degree of Gentleman of the Company of Arcabuz Horsemen of the &quot;Guard of this Kingdom of Peru&quot; 

According to a document dated 1591 from the Peruvian Nacional Archive, recorded by the scribe Córdova [f. 376] he contracted to make several paintings for the general Don Antonio Picado for 300 pesos, among these paintings an image of the Virgin Mary on a copper plate; and a full-length portrait of Picado&#x27;s wife, Doña Mayor Bravo de Saravia. Antonio Picado was procurador for the city of Arequipa, where Pérez de Alesio made the main altarpiece of the church of Saint Dominic. He carved an altarpiece for the Mercedarian church of Huánuco as well.

In 1595 Pérez de Alesio acquired from Francisco López, for 350 pesos, 50 portraits of figures that López had brought from Castille. Aside from his art, Pérez de Alesio also tried to make his fortune in the gold and silver mines of Vilcabamba (Cusco) and Huancavelica. Many documents of mercantile and business exchanges survive that attest to his activity in these areas; these documents rarely mention his artistic facet.

In 1600 he was charged with the adornment of the main chapel of the church of Saint Dominic of Lima, along with Morón, but some documents suggest that this work had already begun between 1593 and 1594 thanks to a donation from Don Alonso Picado in support of Pérez de Alesio&#x27;s work.

In 1606, at the request of Juan de Vega, he painted seven paintings for one of the churches of Huánuco. The paintings were of relatively small size and included as themes &quot;Christ with the Cross on his back and his Holy Mother&quot; and another representing Jesus in on the cross.

Many biographies describe him as dying in 1616, but a contract of 1628 rejects this theory; in that year he sold an image of the Virgin Mary to the friar Francisco Puche of the order of Saint Benito for the church of Monserrate. In the same year he also decorated, with Morón, the funerary chapel of Captain Bernardo de Villegas and his wife Marcela de Montoya in the church of La Merced in Lima.

<text>The Boston Stock Exchange (now NASDAQ BX, formerly &quot;BSE&quot;) was a regional stock exchange formerly located in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1834, making it the third-oldest stock exchange in the United States. On October 2, 2007, NASDAQ agreed to acquire BSE for $61 million.

== History ==
===Creation===

Originally known as the Boston Brokers&#x27; Board, the Boston Stock Exchange was founded on October 13, 1834, when thirteen brokers agreed to meet for a half-hour daily to compare their offerings. P.P.F. Degrand was described by Clarence W. Barron and Joseph G. Martin as &quot;the man to whose indomitable energy and foresight the existence of the Boston Stock Exchange is largely due&quot;. The other founding members were:
*Henry Andrews
*Matthew Bolles
*Benjamin Brown Jr.
*J. W. Clark
*Samuel Gilbert Jr.
*Enoch Martin
*Edmund Munroe
*Thomas R. Sewell
*John E. Thayer
*George M. Thatcher
*Samuel G. Williams
The first officers of the exchange were Samuel Dana (president), George W. Pratt (vice president), and Thomas R. Sewell (secretary and treasurer).

===19th century===
When it first opened the only available securities on the exchange were stocks in banks, insurance companies, local mills, canal projects, small mining operations, and various public debts. As the exchange grew it dealt in iron, coal, and copper stocks. The exchange was used by the Lake Superior copper mines during the United States&#x27; first copper boom. The textile mills of Lowell, Lawrence, Manchester, and Lewiston that were a part of the exchange in its early years were almost totally absent by 1893, as the business was mostly held by auctioneers.

The Boston Stock Exchange played an important role in the development of railroads in New England by providing a market for their securities. Railroads that used the exchange included the Boston and Providence Railroad, Boston and Lowell Railroad, and Boston and Worcester Railroad. The BSE also provided early capital for the American American Bell Telephone Company, United Shoe Machinery Corporation, United Fruit Company, Union Pacific Railroad, and Calumet and Hecla Mining Company.

By 1844 the number of members had grown from 13 to 36. In 1855 it had grown to 75 members. An economic boom in 1879 resulted in a high demand for membership so the BSE voted to cap its membership at 150, where it stood for many years.

On November 9, 1885, the Boston Stock Exchange held its first continuous session. Prior to this there was a morning board and afternoon board. The morning board would start at 10:30 AM and the afternoon board would begin at 2 PM. Both would adjourn whenever brokers had completed their orders, which could take anywhere between one and three hours.

===20th century===
The Boston Stock Exchange closed from June 30 to December 10, 1914, due to chaos created by the start of World War I. It was the first time the exchange had ever suspended operations.

During World War II, women were permitted to work on the BSE floor due to the lack of young men available to work as pages.

In 1965, the BSE switched from having an unsalaried president elected from the exchange&#x27;s membership to having a full-time salaried president as part of a modernization plan.

The BSE grew in the mid-1960s when institutions began utilizing regional exchanges for &quot;give-ups&quot; or the sharing of commissions between brokers. In 1967, a record 67 million shares were traded and the cost of a seat on the exchange had grown to $14,000 (up from $2,000 three years earlier). On December 5, 1968, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission outlawed &quot;give-ups&quot;, which cut the number of trades on the BSE down to 24.6 million shares in 1970.

In 1981, the BSE hired Charles J. Mohr, a 34-year-old vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, to serve as its first full-time paid chairman and CEO.
Increased computer trading in the early 1990s resulted in the BSE losing business to NASDAQ and similar exchanges. At the same time, the BSE and other regionals were harmed by rise of large institutional investors, who preferred the New York Stock Exchange to regionals. By 1992, the BSE and Philadelphia Stock Exchange were tied as the nation&#x27;s smallest regional.

In 1998, a proposed merger with the Cincinnati Stock Exchange fell through when the two sides could not come to an agreement.

===21st century===
In its later years, the BSE served as an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange for the area&#x27;s mutual fund companies. In 2001, the BSE reached its peak of 100 million shares a day.

In 2002, the BSE co-founded the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), an automated equity options exchange, with partners the Montreal Exchange (MX), a derivatives exchange, and Interactive Brokers, a discount brokerage. By 2005 the BOX controlled 6% of the market.

As a result of BOX&#x27;s success, Fidelity Investments and several Wall Street brokerage houses invested $20 million to help develop an electronic stock trading platform for the BSE. The electronic system handled less than half a percent of the daily US stock transactions and it was shut down in September 2007.

In 2007, NASDAQ acquired the Boston Stock Exchange for $61 million ($38 million cash and $23 million in debt). The deal gave NASDAQ BSE&#x27;s clearing license, which allowed it to settle trades made on its exchange rather than pay a third party to clear its transactions. It also allowed NASDAQ to offer companies symbols with one to three letters, which would allow companies to move from the New York Stock Exchange to NASDAQ without changing their symbols. The sale did not include the Boston Options Exchange, which was sold later that year to the Montreal Exchange.

==Locations==
The Boston Stock Exchange&#x27;s original headquarters was on the third floor of the Washington Bank Building at 47 State Street. In 1844, the BSE moved to the fourth floor of the Merchants Exchange. On March 28, 1853, the exchange moved to the Union Bank Building at 40 State Street. The exchange moved again ten years later, this time to the Howe Building at 13 Exchange Street. On November 9, 1885, the BSE moved back to the Merchants Exchange building, this time to the hall known as the Reading Room. The exchange temporarily moved back to the Howe Building in 1890 when the Merchants Exchange building was demolished. The exchange moved to the new Merchants Exchange building on April 20, 1891. In April 1911, the exchange moved to a two-story domed building at 53 Congress Street. In 1980 it moved to the 38th floor of One Boston Place. In 1999 the BSE moved to the old Boston Safe Deposit and Trust building at 100 Franklin Street. When the BSE was sold to NASDAQ the Boston office was closed and operations were consolidated in New York.

<text>Richard Rothe (28 January 1799 – 20 August 1867) was a German Lutheran theologian.

==Biography==
Richard Rothe was born at Posen, then part of Prussia. He studied theology in the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin (1817–20) under Karl Daub, Schleiermacher and Neander, the philosophers and historians G. W. F. Hegel, Friedrich Creuzer and F. C. Schlosser exercising a considerable influence in shaping his thought. From 1820 to 1822 he was in the clerical seminary at Wittenberg. In the autumn of 1823 he was appointed chaplain to the Kingdom of Prussia embassy in Rome, of which Baron Bunsen was the head. This post he exchanged in 1828 for a professorship in the Wittenberg theological seminary, of which in 1832 he became also second director and ephorus, and hence in 1837 he removed to Heidelberg as professor and director of a new clerical seminary; in 1849 he accepted an invitation to Bonn as professor and university preacher, but in 1854 he returned to Heidelberg as professor of theology, and afterwards became a member of the &quot;Oberkirchenrath&quot;, a position he held until his death. He died in Heidelberg.

==Theology==
As a youth Rothe had a bent towards a supernatural mysticism; his chosen authors were those of the romantic school, and Novalis remained throughout his life a special favourite. In Berlin and Wittenberg he came under the influence of Pietism as represented by such men as Rudolf Stier and Friedrich Tholuck, though Tholuck pronounced him a &quot;very modern Christian.&quot; He afterwards confessed that, though he had been a sincere Pietist, he was never a happy one. In Rome, under the broadening influence of classical and ecclesiastical art, he learned to look at Christianity in its human and universalistic aspects, and began to develop his great idea, the inseparable relation of religion and morals. He began then, and particularly after the revolution of July 1830, likewise to give a more definite form to his peculiar view of the relations of church and state. He thus became out of harmony with the pietistic thought and life of Wittenberg. His removal to Heidelberg and the publication of his first important work, &quot;Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung&quot; (1837), coincide with the attainment of the principal theological positions with which his name is associated. During the middle period of his career (1837–61) he led the life of a scholastic recluse. During the last six years of his life he came forward as the advocate of a free theology and of the &quot;Protestantenverein&quot;.

Rothe was one of the most profound and influential of modern German theologians. Like Schleiermacher he combined with the keenest logical faculty an intensely religious spirit, while his philosophical tendencies were in sympathy rather with Hegel than with Schleiermacher, and theosophic mysticism was more congenial to him than the abstractions of Spinoza, to whom Schleiermacher owed so much. He classed himself among the theosophists, and claimed to be a convinced and happy supernaturalist in a scientific age. His system, though it may seem to contain doubtful or even fantastic elements, is in its general outlines a noble massive whole, constructed by a profound, comprehensive, fearless and logical mind. A peculiarity of his thought was the realistic nature of his spiritualism: his abstractions are all real existences; his spiritual entities are real and corporeal; his truth is actual being. Hence Rothe, unlike Schleiermacher, lays great stress, for instance, on the personality of God, on the reality of the worlds of good and evil spirits, and on the visible second coming of Christ. Hence his religious feeling and theological speculation demanded their realization in a kingdom of God coextensive with man&#x27;s nature, terrestrial history and human society.

===&quot;Theologische Ethik&quot;===
Thus Rothe&#x27;s theological system became a &quot;Theologische Ethik&quot;, as he entitled one of his books (3 vols., 1845-1848). It is on this work that Rothe&#x27;s permanent reputation as a theologian and ethical writer rests. The first edition remained twelve years out of print before the second (5 vols., 1867–71) appeared. It was the author&#x27;s purpose to rewrite the whole, but he died when he had completed the first two volumes. The remainder was reprinted from the first edition by Professor Heinrich Holtzmann, with the addition of some notes and emendations left by the author.

The &quot;Theologische Ethik&quot; begins with a general sketch of the author&#x27;s system of speculative theology in its two divisions, theology proper and cosmology, cosmology falling into the two subdivisions of Physik (the world of nature) and Ethik (the world of spirit). It is the last subdivision with which the body of the work is occupied. After an analysis of the religious consciousness, which yields the doctrine of an absolute personal and spiritual God, Rothe proceeds to deduce from his idea of God the process and history of creative development, which is eternally proceeding and bringing forth, as its unending purpose, worlds of spirits, partially self-creative and sharing the absolute personality of the Creator.

Rothe regards the natural man as the consummation of the development of physical nature, and obtains spirit as the personal attainment, with divine help, of those beings in whom the further creative process of moral development is carried on. His theory leaves the natural man, without hesitation, to be developed by the natural processes of animal evolution. The attainment of the higher stage of development is the moral and religious vocation of man; this higher stage is self-determination, the performance of every human function as a voluntary and intelligent agent, or as a person, having as its cosmical effect the subjection of all material to spiritual existences. This personal process of spiritualization is the continuation of the eternal divine work of creation. Thus the moral life and the religious life coincide, and when normal are identical; both have the same aim and are occupied with the same task, the accomplishment of the spiritualization of the world. &quot;Piety, that it may become truth and reality, demands morality as its fulfilment, as the only concrete element in which the idea of fellowship with God is realized; morality, that it may find its perfect unfolding, requires the aid of piety, in the light of which alone it can comprehend its own idea in all its breadth and depth.&quot;

The process of human development Rothe regards as necessarily taking an abnormal form and passing through the phase of sin. This abnormal condition necessitates a fresh creative act, that of salvation, which was, however, from the first, part of the divine plan. As a preparation for this salvation supernatural revelation was required for the purifying and revivification of the religious consciousness, and the Saviour Himself had to appear in human history as a fresh miraculous creation, born of a woman but not begotten by a man. In consequence of His supernatural birth the Saviour, or the second Adam, was free from original sin. By His own moral and religious development He made possible a relation of perfect fellowship between God and man, which was the new and highest stage of the divine creation of mankind. This stage of development inaugurated by the Saviour is attained by means of His kingdom or the community of salvation, which is both moral and religious, and in the first instance and temporarily only religious—that is, a church. As men reach the full development of their nature, and appropriate the perfection of the Saviour, the separation between the religious and the moral life will vanish, and the Christian state, as the highest sphere of human life representing all human functions, will displace the church. &quot;In proportion as the Saviour Christianizes the state by means of the church must the progressive completion of the structure of the church prove the cause of its abolition.&quot; The decline of the church is therefore not to be deplored, but recognized as the consequence of the independence and completeness of the Christian life. It is the third section of his work—the &quot;Pflichtenlehre&quot;—which is generally most highly valued, and where his full strength as an ethical thinker is displayed, without any mixture of theosophic speculation.

===Other works===
Since Rothe&#x27;s death several volumes of his sermons and of his lectures (on dogmatics, the history of homiletics) and a collection of brief essays and religious meditations under the title of &quot;Stille Stunden&quot; (Wittenberg, 1872) have been published. Jane Stoddart&#x27;s translation of his work was called &quot;Still Hours&quot; when it was published in 1886.

<text>The Grey Cup () is both the championship game of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of professional Canadian football. The game is contested between the winners of the CFL&#x27;s East and West divisional playoffs and is one of Canadian television&#x27;s largest annual sporting events. Since 2022, the game was held on the third Sunday of November. The Toronto Argonauts have the most Grey Cup wins (19) since its introduction in 1909, while the Edmonton Elks (formerly the Edmonton Eskimos) have the most Grey Cup wins (11) since the merger in 1958. The latest, the 111th Grey Cup, took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on November 17, 2024, when the Toronto Argonauts defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 41–24.

The Grey Cup is Canada&#x27;s largest annual sports and television event, regularly drawing a Canadian viewing audience of about 4 million. Two awards are given for play in the game: the Most Valuable Player and the Dick Suderman Trophy as most valuable Canadian player. In 2019, Andrew Harris was the first player to win both the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Canadian and Most Valuable Player the same year, playing for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

The trophy was commissioned in 1909 by The Earl Grey, then Canada&#x27;s governor general, who originally hoped to donate it for the country&#x27;s senior amateur hockey championship. After the Allan Cup was donated for that purpose, Grey instead made his trophy available to the winner of the Canadian Dominion Football Championship, the national championship of Canadian football. The trophy has a silver chalice attached to a large base on which the names of all winning teams, players and executives are engraved. The Grey Cup has been broken on several occasions, stolen twice, and held for ransom. It survived a 1947 fire that destroyed numerous artifacts housed in the same building.

The Grey Cup was first won by the Toronto Varsity Blues of the University of Toronto. Play was suspended from 1916 to 1918 due to the First World War and in 1919 due to a rules dispute. The game has typically been contested in an east-versus-west format since the 1920s. The game was always played on a Saturday until 1968, but since 1969 (except for 1970) has always been on a Sunday. Held in late November (in some years in early December, most recently in 2021), and mostly in outdoor stadiums, the Grey Cup has been played in inclement weather at times, including the 1950 &quot;Mud Bowl&quot;, in which a player reportedly came close to drowning in a puddle, then the 1962 &quot;Fog Bowl&quot;, when the final minutes of the game had to be postponed to the following day due to a heavy fog, and the 1977 &quot;Ice Bowl&quot;, contested on the frozen-over artificial turf at Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. Most recently, in the 2017 game snow fell, at times heavily, throughout the game.

The then-Edmonton Eskimos formed the Grey Cup&#x27;s longest dynasty, winning five consecutive championships from 1978 to 1982. Competition for the trophy has been exclusively between Canadian teams, except for a three-year period from 1993 to 1995, when an expansion of the CFL south into the United States resulted in the Baltimore Stallions winning the 1995 championship and taking the Grey Cup south of the border for the only time in its history.

==History==

===National championships before 1909===
Serious efforts to organize a national governing body and eventually a Dominion championship for what at that time was still a game called and practically identical to rugby union began in the early 1880s, culminating in the creation of the Canadian Rugby Union in 1891 and the first CRU-recognized national championship the following year. After that, national championship games were held every year prior to the creation of the Grey Cup except 1899, 1903 and 1904.

===Creation and early years (1909–1921)===

While the Stanley Cup was created in 1893 as the Canadian amateur hockey championship, professional teams were openly competing for the trophy by 1907. Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, the Governor General of Canada, planned to donate a new trophy to serve as the senior amateur championship; however, Sir Montague Allan donated the Allan Cup before he could finalize his plans. Grey instead offered an award for the Canadian amateur rugby football championship beginning in 1909. He initially failed to follow through on his offer; the trophy was not ordered until two weeks prior to the first championship game.

The first Grey Cup game was held on December 4, 1909, between two Toronto clubs: the University of Toronto Varsity Blues defeated the Parkdale Canoe Club 26–6 before 3,800 fans. The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game, and the Varsity Blues did not receive it until March 1910. They retained the trophy in the following two years, defeating the Hamilton Tigers in 1910 and the Toronto Argonauts in 1911. The University of Toronto failed to reach the 1912 Grey Cup, which was won by the Hamilton Alerts over the Argonauts. The Varsity Blues refused to hand over the trophy on the belief they could keep it until they were defeated in a title game. They kept the trophy until 1914 when they were defeated by the Argonauts, who made the trophy available to subsequent champions.

Canada&#x27;s participation in World War I resulted in the cancellation of the championship from 1916 to 1918, during which time the Cup was forgotten. &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; writer Bob Dunn claimed that the trophy was later rediscovered as &quot;one of the family heirlooms&quot; of an employee of the Toronto trust company where it had been sent for storage. The Grey Cup game was also cancelled in 1919 due to a lack of interest from the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) and the intercollegiate unions, along with rules conflicts between the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) and the western union; Canada was still struggling in its recovery from the Spanish flu epidemic that occurred during the last months of World War I. Competition finally resumed in 1920 with the 8th Grey Cup game, won 16–3 by the Varsity Blues over the Argonauts. It was the University of Toronto&#x27;s fourth, and final, championship.

===Western participation (1922–1932)===
Competition for the Grey Cup was limited to member unions of the CRU, the champions of which petitioned the league body for the right to challenge for the national championship. The Western Canada Rugby Football Union (WCRFU) was formed in 1911, but the CRU did not come to a participation agreement with it until 1921, allowing the Edmonton Eskimos (no lineage to the team that used that name 1949–2020) of the WCRFU to challenge. Facing the Argonauts in the 9th Grey Cup, the Eskimos became the first western teamand the first from outside Toronto or Hamiltonto compete for the trophy. The Argonauts entered the game with an undefeated record, having outscored their opposition 226 to 55 during the season. They dominated Edmonton, recording the first shutout in Grey Cup history with a 23–0 victory. Multi-sport star Lionel Conacher was Toronto&#x27;s top player, scoring 15 of his team&#x27;s points before leaving the game after the third quarter to join his hockey team for their game. The same Edmonton team (renamed as Elks for that single season) challenged for the trophy again in 1922, but lost 13–1 to their eastern opposition, the Queen&#x27;s University Golden Gaels. For Queen&#x27;s, it was the first of three consecutive titles.

Western teams continued to vie for the trophy, but were consistently outclassed for several years. Eastern teams and critics felt the quality of the western game was inferior to theirs, and when Queen&#x27;s defeated the Regina Rugby Club 54–0 in the 1923 final, the critics felt they deliberately ran up the score to prove that point. Regina was western Canada&#x27;s dominant team, appearing in the Grey Cup on six occasions between 1928 and 1934, but lost to their eastern opponents each time. Regina helped revolutionize Canadian football in 1929, however, as they attempted the first forward pass in Grey Cup history. The Winnipeg &#x27;Pegs (now the Blue Bombers) became the first western Grey Cup champion in 1935 when they defeated the Hamilton Tigers, 18–12. While the Grey Cup was slow to achieve national popularity, the advent of the east versus west format helped make the game the nation&#x27;s largest sporting event.

===Progress towards professionalism (1933–1956)===

As the quality of senior football improved, university teams realized they were no longer able to compete on equal footing and withdrew from competition for the Grey Cup in 1933. By 1938, only three unions continued to compete under the banner of the CRU: the IRFU (now commonly known as the Big Four) and the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) in the east, and the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) in the west. The CRU experimented with a two-game, total points series to determine the champion in 1940. The Ottawa Rough Riders won both games against Toronto&#x27;s Balmy Beach, 8–2 and 12–5. The Grey Cup returned to its one-game format the following year.

Both the Big Four and WIFU suspended operations in 1942 due to the Second World War. Grey Cup play was expected to be suspended along with the unions; however, the military felt the game and sport would serve as a morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country. For the following three years, Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams, and in the 1942 Grey Cup, the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes defeated the Winnipeg RCAF Bombers 8–5 to become the first non-civilian team to win the national championship. Two years later, the St. Hyacinthe–Donnacona Navy defeated the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, 7–6; no Grey Cup championship since then has featured two eastern teams. The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams; the Big Four resumed play in 1945, and the WIFU the following year.

A push by the sport&#x27;s organizers to adopt an increasingly professional attitude dominated the post-war period: poor field conditions, previously accepted as part of the game, resulted in numerous complaints against the CRU following the 1949 and 1950 Grey Cups. Field conditions at Toronto&#x27;s Varsity Stadium were so poor in 1950 that the game has since gained infamy as the &quot;Mud Bowl&quot;. Deep ruts in the field and poor weather in the days leading up to the game resulted in a sloppy field covered in large puddles of water. The game also gained notoriety for the near drowning of Winnipeg&#x27;s Buddy Tinsley, who was found face down in a large puddle, apparently unconscious. Tinsley later said that he had not lost consciousness, but his leg had gone numb from a hard hit to a preexisting injury. Toronto won the game 13–0, the last time a team has been shut out in a Grey Cup game.
The ORFU, the last purely amateur union competing for the Grey Cup, withdrew from Cup competition in 1954. Although the Big Four and WIFU champions had faced each other in the Grey Cup final since 1945, the ORFU&#x27;s withdrawal left the IRFU and WIFU unchallenged as Canada&#x27;s top football unions. The Eskimos faced the Montreal Alouettes in three consecutive Grey Cups in the mid-1950s, winning all three. Edmonton&#x27;s first title in 1954 ended in bizarre fashion after Jackie Parker scored a touchdown (converted by Bob Dean) from a fumble recovery late in the game that gave Edmonton a 26–25 lead. At the time in Canadian football, touchdowns were only worth 5 points. Parker&#x27;s 90-yard fumble return was the longest in league history until Toronto&#x27;s Cassius Vaughn returned a Calgary fumble 109 yards in the 2017 Grey Cup game which was won by Toronto. The 1954 game also marked the end of the amateur era as the top teams completed their transition to professional organizations.

As the 1950s wore on, the Big Four and WIFU distanced themselves from the CRU, forming the Canadian Football Council in 1956 to administer the game at the professional level. Two years later, on January 18, 1958, the CFC withdrew from the CRU and the Big Four &amp; WIFU merged into the Canadian Football League (CFL). The new league formally assumed control of the Grey Cup from the CRU.

===Canadian Football League kicks off (1957–1969)===
In the CFL&#x27;s initial seasons, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats were the league&#x27;s dominant team, appearing in nine Grey Cups and winning four titles between 1957 and 1967. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opposed Hamilton on six of those occasions, winning four titles. The two teams were involved in a series of bizarre incidents, the first occurring during the 1957 Grey Cup. Toronto-based lawyer and fan David Humphrey had talked his way past stadium security and had been allowed to watch the game from the sidelines. Ten minutes into the fourth quarter, Hamilton&#x27;s Ray Bawel intercepted a pass and it appeared he would return the ball for a touchdown when Humphrey stuck his leg out and tripped Bawel as he ran up the sideline. Unsure how to handle the situation as there was no rule designed to cover it, referee Paul Dojack invented one on the spot. He placed the ball half the distance to the Winnipeg goal line from the point Bawel was tripped. The incident did not affect the final score, as Hamilton won 32–7. The league also created a new rule during the 1961 Grey Cup as it was the first in history to end regulation time in a tie: CFL Commissioner Sid Halter determined the teams would play an overtime period that consisted of two five-minute halves. That rule remained the CFL standard into the 2000s. Winnipeg scored the lone touchdown in overtime to defeat Hamilton 21–14.

Winnipeg and Hamilton met again in 1962, the 50th Grey Cup, immortalized as the &quot;Fog Bowl&quot;. The game was held at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium, and began on Saturday, December 1, 1962. The fog rolled in early in the second quarter and became increasingly dense as the game progressed. By the fourth quarter, the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play. The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners listened for the sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience. With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28–27 lead, officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day. Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game, it lifted in time for the contest to resume. Around 15,000 of the original 32,655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team. It was the first title game completed on a Sunday; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969; however, the game was played on a Saturday for the last time in 1970.

The Saskatchewan Roughriders won their first ever Grey Cup in 1966 when they defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders 29–14 at Empire Stadium in Vancouver before 36,553 fans.

===Eskimos&#x27; dynasty (1970–1988)===
The Montreal Alouettes&#x27; 1970 Grey Cup championship, an upset win over the favoured Calgary Stampeders, served as a morale booster for the city of Montreal, which was reeling in the aftermath of the October Crisis. The 1970s belonged to the Edmonton Eskimos, however, as they ended the decade as one of the most dominant teams in CFL history, reaching the Grey Cup nine times between 1973 and 1982. The team competed in three consecutive finals early in the decade, losing to Ottawa in 1973 and Montreal in 1974, before winning the franchise&#x27;s fourth championship in 1975. The 1975 championship was held in Calgary and was the first Grey Cup played on the Canadian Prairies. A young woman infamously streaked across the field during the national anthem despite frigid temperatures well below freezing. The only time the Eskimos did not reach the Grey Cup final during this span was in 1976, when the Saskatchewan Roughriders met the Ottawa Rough Riders, in the final all-&quot;Roughriders&quot; Grey Cup game. Both teams fought a see-saw battle, which was decided in the dying seconds of the game when Ottawa quarterback Tom Clements threw to Tony Gabriel, which stood out as the winning touchdown, 23–20. The 1977 Grey Cup was the first held at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, contested by the home town Alouettes and the Eskimos in front of a record crowd of 68,318. The game became known as the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot;, as low temperatures froze snow on the field that had been melted by groundskeepers with salt, making the artificial turf extremely slippery. The Alouettes adapted to the field conditions by affixing staples to the soles of their shoes, improving their traction, and won the game by a 41–6 score.

Upset at losing the 1977 game under poor weather conditions, the Eskimos hoped for a rematch with Montreal in 1978. Both teams reached the final game, which Edmonton won 20–13. It was the first of five consecutive championships, a streak that remains unmatched in the history of the Grey Cup. The Eskimos&#x27; dynasty dominated the league, losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981. The 1981 Grey Cup was expected to be yet another easy win for Edmonton, who posted a 14–1–1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the surprise Eastern champions, the 5–11 Ottawa Rough Riders. The first half did not go as Edmonton hoped, though, as Ottawa, led by rookie quarterback J.C. Watts, emerged with a 20–1 lead. Quarterback Warren Moon led the Eskimos back in the second half, and with the game tied at 23, Dave Cutler kicked the game-winning field goal with just three seconds remaining.

Edmonton&#x27;s championship run came to an end in 1983 when they lost in the West Semi-Final game; the Argonauts defeated the BC Lions to win the championship that year, ending the team&#x27;s 31-year Grey Cup title drought. Despite Toronto&#x27;s win, the CFL felt that the overall quality of play in the East Division had deteriorated compared to that of the West. In 1986, it altered the playoff format to allow the first non-playoff team in one division to take the last playoff spot, but stay in their division if they had a better record. The consequences of the new rules were felt immediately, as the league gave a playoff spot to the Stampeders having a better record than the Alouettes, and decided the East Division Final would be a 2-game-total-point Final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who finished first and second, respectively. The crossover, if necessary, would begin in 1987. In financial difficulty, the loss of the playoff spot was disastrous for Montreal, which ceased operations one year later. The crossover rule was eliminated and not revisited until a decade later due to Montreal&#x27;s folding (ironically, the crossover rule returned with the Alouettes&#x27; revival). Reduced to eight teams, the CFL shifted Winnipeg to the East Division, making the 1988 Grey Cup between the Blue Bombers and Lions the first championship game between two western Canadian teams.

===CFL USA (1989–1995)===
The 1989 Grey Cup is considered one of the finest games in Canadian football history: The Saskatchewan Roughriders won their second championship by defeating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 43–40 in the highest scoring Grey Cup game of all time. Saskatchewan kicker Dave Ridgway&#x27;s last-second field goal won the game and made him a legend in the prairie province.

Declining interest in the CFL during the 1990s left the league in financial difficulty. Hoping to restore the league&#x27;s credibility with fans, a new ownership group featuring Bruce McNall, hockey player Wayne Gretzky and actor John Candy purchased the Toronto Argonauts in 1991 and lured American college standout Rocket Ismail to Canada with a four-year, $26.2 million contract which made him the highest paid player in football history at that time. The Argonauts reached the 1991 Grey Cup and defeated the Calgary Stampeders 36–21. With 261 all-purpose yards on the game, including a then-Grey Cup record 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, Ismail was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player.

The potential for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct United States Football League approached the CFL about merging the two leagues. The league showed little interest at the time, but as it continued its decline, the CFL reevaluated its position. In 1992, the CFL announced that it would expand into the United States. The Sacramento Gold Miners joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup. The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.

The lone successful American market was in Baltimore, home to the Stallions. The team averaged over 35,000 fans per game in its inaugural season, nearly double that of Toronto or Hamilton. They matched that success on the field by becoming the first American team to play in the Grey Cup. The BC Lions kept the Grey Cup in Canada with a 26–23 victory in the 1994 final. Baltimore returned to the title game one year later and became the only American team to win the trophy by defeating the Calgary Stampeders, 37–20. The establishment of the National Football League&#x27;s Baltimore Ravens in 1996 caused the Stallions to seek a new city to avoid direct competition with an NFL team. The team moved to Montreal, forming the current incarnation of the Alouettes franchise and ending the CFL&#x27;s excursion into the United States.

===Renaissance (1996–present)===

The league approached the 1996 Grey Cup in dire financial straits: the American expansion had been a failure, the 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased operations at the conclusion of the regular season, and out of the eight remaining teams, seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league to stay afloat. The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players&#x27; families to the championship game. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship, won by Toronto over Edmonton, would be the final Grey Cup.

While the league struggled, the Grey Cup game itself retained its popularity and remained a national institution. The strength of the contest allowed the league to endure its challenges. The CFL survived into 1997 and was buoyed by an interest-free loan from the NFL, a new television deal with The Sports Network which, along with the launch of its popular &quot;Friday Night Football&quot; program, has been credited with saving the league. That year&#x27;s Grey Cup, held in Edmonton and won by Toronto, drew nearly 22,000 more fans than the previous year. The CFL restored its reputation over time, enjoying new popularity into the 2000s such that it no longer had to rely on an exciting Grey Cup final to achieve stability for the next season.

In 2000, the 8–10 BC Lions made history when they defeated the Montreal Alouettes, 28–26, becoming the first team in history to win the Grey Cup with a losing record in the regular season. In the game, 25-year veteran Lui Passaglia ended the longest career in CFL history by kicking what was ultimately the game-winning field goal. The Calgary Stampeders matched the Lions&#x27; feat the next year by becoming the second 8–10 team to win the Grey Cup, defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 27–19 score in front of 65,255 fans, the second largest crowd in the game&#x27;s history.

The 2005 Grey Cup was the second overtime game in Grey Cup history, and the first one using the league&#x27;s shootout overtime format (introduced in 2000). Both the Eskimos and Alouettes scored touchdowns on their first possessions, while Edmonton scored a field goal in its second and held Montreal scoreless to win the game by a 38–35 score. The game was played in the middle of a stretch of eight Grey Cup appearances by the Alouettes between 2000 and 2010. In 2009, they defeated the Roughriders in dramatic fashion: placekicker Damon Duval missed a last-second field goal attempt that appeared to give Saskatchewan the victory. However, the Riders were penalized for having too many men on the field, allowing Duval a second opportunity. His second attempt was successful, giving Montreal a 28–27 victory.

The 100th Grey Cup game was played on November 25, 2012, at the Rogers Centre in Toronto between the Toronto Argonauts and the Calgary Stampeders. The Toronto Argonauts won the Grey Cup with a score of 35–22.

As per a new title sponsorship deal with Shaw Communications announced in May 2015, the event was thenceforth known as the Grey Cup presented by Shaw.

The 104th Grey Cup game was played at BMO Field in Toronto, which became the new home of the Argonauts beginning in the 2016 season. The 104th turned out to be one of the most memorable, with the Ottawa Redblacks winning their first Grey Cup by a score of 39–33 over the heavily favoured Calgary Stampeders as Henry Burris passed to Ernest Jackson for a touchdown in overtime—only the third overtime game in the history of the Grey Cup. After having been promised the 102nd Grey Cup game as an incentive to rejoin the league, Ottawa hosted the 105th Grey Cup at TD Place Stadium in 2017, as part of celebrations to mark 150 years of Confederation. The 55th Grey Cup, played at the end of the 1967 CFL season, was also held in Ottawa as part of celebrations to mark 100 years of Confederation.

In May 2020, due to postponement of the regular season and other factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the 108th Grey Cup festivities in Regina, Saskatchewan (which were to be the first to be hosted by the new Mosaic Stadium) had been cancelled and postponed to 2022, and that the site of the game, if held, would be based on regular season records rather than as a neutral site. The Grey Cup itself was later cancelled in August along with the 2020 CFL season, which was the first year that the Grey Cup was not contested since 1919.

==Trophy==

The trophy was commissioned in 1909 at a cost of $48. The chalice is made of sterling silver and stands tall. Its original base was made of wood, with silver shields listing each championship year and winning team&#x27;s name, beginning with the University of Toronto Varsity Blues. The players of the 1915 championship Hamilton team, apparently as revenge for Toronto&#x27;s refusal to relinquish the trophy in 1912 and 1913, added a shield for the 1908 Tigers team to give the appearance that their organization had won the first Grey Cup.

A 1947 fire destroyed the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts in the clubhouse melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail attached to a surviving wall when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos&#x27; player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton&#x27;s Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the chalice broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 when one of the handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; in 2014 when the chalice broke away from its base again as the Calgary Stampeders celebrated their win. The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008.

The Grey Cup has been stolen on two occasions: it disappeared for three days in 1967 when it was taken from the Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park. The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to replace it with a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy&#x27;s recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto&#x27;s Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.
The current design of the Grey Cup&#x27;s base was introduced in 1987, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the first Grey Cup championship. The base stands high and is made of black-lacquered aluminum with silver plates engraved with the names of each winning team&#x27;s players and executives since 1909. The trophy, one of Canada&#x27;s best known symbols, ran out of room for new additions following the 2012 Grey Cup. The league announced that the base would be redesigned but remain similar in shape to its current design. In 2020 the new base required the removal of the 1909 plaque. To accommodate all the plaques within the base of the Grey Cup, they were redesigned using laser etching and a modern typeface that allowed for vertical reduction of the characters and letters that had improved legibility. The trophy is customarily escorted to the new champions by two members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and presented by the commissioner of the CFL. Like the National Hockey League where the Conn Smythe Trophy was presented before the Stanley Cup, the presentation of the trophy has been typically preceded by the presentations of the Dick Suderman Trophy and the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player awards, in contrast to the other three leagues who usually present the World Series MVP, NBA Finals MVP, and Super Bowl MVP awards, respectively, after their championship trophy.

Similar to the more famous Stanley Cup used exclusively today by the NHL, members of the winning teams are allowed time to celebrate with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada. The board of directors for the Canadian Football Hall of Fame act as the Grey Cup&#x27;s trustees and control its rental for events. The trophy is accompanied by a designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all times. Like the Stanley Cup, but unlike the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl, a new trophy is not made every year for the winning team to keep; rather, the Grey Cup is loaned to the winning team for a year.

==Languages==
English and French are the official languages of the game.

==Grey Cup festival==
Each year, the host city organizes numerous events as part of the annual Grey Cup festival. Gala concerts, parties, and fan festivals are held in the days leading up to the championship game. The CFL hands out its annual awards during the festival, and an annual Grey Cup parade is held. Historically, the festival also featured the &quot;Miss Grey Cup&quot; beauty pageant; this was discontinued in 1992. The game itself includes a performance of the Canadian national anthem (usually sung in both English and French, the official languages of the game) and a halftime show, often featuring performances by well-known Canadian musical acts such as Nickelback, who performed at the 2011 game. In recent years, a former football player, a celebrity, or another special guest participates in the coin toss ceremony to recognize their community involvement or significance.

Nicknamed Canada&#x27;s &quot;Grand National Drunk&quot;, the Grey Cup party originated in the 1948 championship when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team&#x27;s first appearance in the game. Bringing chuckwagons and horses, the fans organized a pancake breakfast – a staple of the Calgary Stampede – for bewildered Torontonians. According to historian Hugh Dempsey, &quot;The Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event.&quot; The Stampeders won the game on the strength of the &quot;sleeper play&quot;, a touchdown scored by Norm Hill after he hid himself from the Ottawa defence by lying down on the sidelines, as if asleep. He received the pass from quarterback Keith Spaith while still on his back. The victory completed the only undefeated season in the history of Canadian professional football. The boisterous celebrations that followed the win gave rise to the legend of Calgary alderman and future mayor Don Mackay riding his horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel. This event was repeated in the 2012 Grey Cup game in Toronto to much of the delight of the fans of both teams. The Calgary Grey Cup Committee maintains the tradition of organizing a pancake breakfast at each year&#x27;s championship.

A 2012 survey found that Canadians consider the Grey Cup to be the most important annual event to attend. Fans of all teams converge at the game venue, including some who have attended 60 or more Grey Cups. The influx of people from across the country is estimated to have an economic impact of over $120 million for the region hosting the championship game.

==Champions==
The Toronto Argonauts have won the most Grey Cup championships (19), followed by the Edmonton Eskimos (now Elks) (14) and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (12). The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have made the most Grey Cup appearances (30). The Tiger-Cats remain the only team yet to win this millennium. Since the merger and creation of the Canadian Football League began in 1958, the Eskimos have won the most Grey Cup Championships (11) and have made the most Grey Cup appearances (19). The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have the most losses in Grey Cup play (19). The defending champions are the Toronto Argonauts who won the 111th Grey Cup in 2024, their second title in 3 years. Six teams in CFL history have won the Grey Cup at home, the 2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders, the 2012 Toronto Argonauts, the 2011 BC Lions, the 1994 BC Lions, the 1977 Montreal Alouettes, and 1972 Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

Individually, three players have won seven Grey Cups: Jack Wedley (Toronto, Montreal Navy), Bill Stevenson (Edmonton) and Hank Ilesic (Edmonton, Toronto). Ilesic is one of seven players to appear in nine Grey Cup games. Among quarterbacks, Anthony Calvillo appeared in a record eight games, winning three. Five coaches share the record for Grey Cup championships at five: Wally Buono (the CFL&#x27;s all-time leader in total games won), Don Matthews, Frank Clair, Hugh Campbell and Lew Hayman.

Two individual awards are handed out following each game. The Most Valuable Player award is given to the top performer in the Grey Cup. Between 1974 and 1990, the league named both offensive and defensive most valuable players. Three people have been named MVP on three occasions: Doug Flutie, Damon Allen and Sonny Wade. The Dick Suderman Trophy is given to the most valuable Canadian. It is named in honour of Dick Suderman, who died of a brain hemorrhage in 1972 while an active player for the Edmonton Eskimos. Dave Sapunjis and Don Sweet have each won the award three times (however, Sapunjis is the only player to win the award in back-to-back years). Andrew Harris was the first person to win both awards in the 107th Grey Cup for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

==Venue==
===Host cities===
The city of Toronto has hosted the most Grey Cup games with 48, including 30 of the first 45 games played. The first game was held on December 4, 1909, at Rosedale Field. Hamilton and Ottawa hosted several early games while Sarnia and Kingston each hosted one as the game&#x27;s early years were dominated by teams in southern Ontario. The Grey Cup game and champion first left the province in 1931, when Montreal hosted the event and the Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers won the 19th Grey Cup. The game did not leave central Canada until 1955 when the 43rd Grey Cup was played in Vancouver. That contest achieved what was at the time an all-time Canadian football attendance record of 39,491. It was the first of 16 games hosted by the British Columbia city, second among all host cities.

The four highest attended Grey Cup games have been held at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, with an all-time record of 68,318 set in 1977.
The 1940 Grey Cup was a two-game series. Toronto and Ottawa each hosted a game.

===Stadiums===
22 separate stadiums have hosted the Grey Cup. The following lists stadiums which have hosted Grey Cups. Scheduled future Grey Cups are noted in italics.


The 1940 Grey Cup was a two-game series. Varsity Stadium and Lansdowne Park each hosted a game.

==Broadcasting==
The Grey Cup game was first broadcast on radio in 1928. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) carried radio coverage of the game for 51 years until 1986, when a network of private broadcasters took over.

Canadian television was in its infancy in 1952 when Toronto&#x27;s CBLT paid $7,500 for the rights to carry the first televised broadcast of a Grey Cup game. Within two years, it was estimated that 80 percent of the nation&#x27;s 900,000 television sets were tuned into the game, even though the first national telecast did not occur until 1957. The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada&#x27;s most-viewed sporting events. The 1962 &quot;Fog Bowl&quot; game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television.

The CBC carried the first national telecasts exclusively, but the CTV Television Network purchased rights to the 1962 game. The move sparked concern across Canada as the newly formed network was not yet available in many parts of the country. The debate over whether an &quot;event of national interest&quot; should be broadcast by the publicly funded the CBC or private broadcasters reached the floor of Parliament as members of the federal government weighed in. It was decided that both networks would carry the game. The two networks continued with the simulcast arrangement until 1986 when CTV ceased its coverage.

The CFL operated the Canadian Football Network, a coalition of private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990. The CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel The Sports Network (TSN) and its French-language sister station Réseau des sports (RDS), a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access. Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1 million Canadians watching the game in its entirety, and over 14 million viewing at least part of the contest. Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.

<text>Stephen Hopkins (March 7, 1707 – July 13, 1785) was a Founding Father of the United States. He served as governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and was a signer of both the Continental Association and Declaration of Independence. Hopkins was from a prominent Rhode Island family. His grandfather, William Hopkins, was an influential colonial politician, while his great-grandfather Thomas Hopkins was among the original settlers of Providence Plantations. Thomas sailed from England in 1635 alongside his cousin, Benedict Arnold, who later became the first governor of the Rhode Island colony under the Royal Charter of 1663.

As a child, Hopkins was a voracious reader, becoming a serious student of the sciences, mathematics, and literature. He became a surveyor and astronomer and was involved in taking measurements during the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun. He began his public service at age 23 as a justice of the peace in the newly established town of Scituate, Rhode Island. He soon became a justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, while also serving at times as the speaker of the House of Deputies and president of the Scituate Town Council. While active in civic affairs, he also was part owner of an iron foundry and was a successful merchant who was portrayed in John Greenwood&#x27;s 1750s satirical painting &quot;Sea Captains Carousing in Surinam&quot;. In May 1747, Hopkins was appointed as a justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, serving until May 1749. He became the third chief justice of this body in May 1751, serving until May 1755. In 1755, he was elected to his first term as governor of the colony, and he served in this capacity for 9 out of the next 15 years.

One of the most contentious political issues of his day was the use of paper money versus hard currency. His bitter political rival Samuel Ward championed hard currency, whereas Hopkins advocated the use of paper money. The rivalry between the two men became so heated that Hopkins sued Ward for £40,000, but he lost the case and had to pay costs. By the mid-1760s, the contention between the two men became a serious distraction to the government of the colony, and they attempted to placate each other—initially without success. Ultimately, both agreed to not run for office in 1768, and Josias Lyndon was elected governor of the colony as a compromise candidate.

In 1770, Hopkins once again became chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and he became a principal player in the colony&#x27;s handling of the 1772 Gaspee Affair, when a group of irate Rhode Island citizens boarded a British revenue vessel and burned it to the waterline. In 1774, he was given an additional important responsibility as one of Rhode Island&#x27;s two delegates to the First Continental Congress, his former rival Samuel Ward being the other. Hopkins had become well known in the Thirteen Colonies ten years earlier when he published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Rights of Colonies Examined&quot; which was critical of British Parliament and its taxation policies.

Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence in the summer of 1776 with worsening palsy in his hands. He signed it by holding his right hand with his left and saying, &quot;My hand trembles, but my heart does not.&quot; He served in the Continental Congress until September 1776, when failing health forced him to resign. He was a strong backer of the College of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (later named Brown University) and became the institution&#x27;s first chancellor. He died in Providence in 1785 at age 78 and is buried in the North Burial Ground there. Hopkins has been called Rhode Island&#x27;s greatest statesman. In 1774, Hopkins owned six or seven slaves, making him among the top five percent of slaveholders in Providence at the time.

== Ancestry and early life ==

Hopkins was born in Providence in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the second of nine children of William and Ruth (Wilkinson) Hopkins. His grandfather William Hopkins was very prominent in colonial affairs, having served for more than 40 years as a deputy from Providence, speaker of the House of Deputies, and major. His grandmother Abigail Whipple Hopkins was a daughter of Providence settler John Whipple, sister of wealthy Providence merchant Joseph Whipple, and aunt to Deputy Governor Joseph Whipple Jr. His great-grandfather was Thomas Hopkins, one of the earliest settlers of Providence Plantations. Thomas Hopkins was orphaned and raised by his uncle William Arnold, and he sailed to New England in 1635 with his Arnold relatives, including his cousin Benedict Arnold, who became the first governor of the colony under the Royal Charter of 1663.

The early part of Hopkins&#x27;s life was spent in the wooded northern part of Providence known as Chopmist Hill, an area that became Scituate, Rhode Island. There were no schools in this area at the time, but the books belonging to the family were supplemented by a small circulating collection and provided him with reading material, which he consumed voraciously. Historian Irving Richman refers to Hopkins as &quot;a close and severe student, filling up all the spare hours of his life with reading.&quot; John Sanderson writes, &quot;He attached himself in early youth to the study of books and men.&quot; Hopkins gained skills in surveying from his grandfather Samuel Wilkinson. He used his surveying skills to revise the streets and create a map of Scituate, and later he did the same for Providence. His father gave him of land when he was 19 because of his responsibility as a youth, and his grandfather Hopkins gave him an additional .

Hopkins was interested in astronomy and other scientific endeavors, and he was involved in the observation of the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun on June 3, 1769. Joseph Brown had obtained a complete set of the necessary instruments, including a reflecting telescope, a micrometer, and a sextant, and an observatory was erected on a hill in Providence (later named &quot;Transit Street&quot; in honor of the event). Brown was assisted by a group that included Hopkins, Benjamin West, and others who were also interested in science. The observation enabled them to very accurately determine the latitude of Providence to the nearest second of arc, after which the longitude was determined by comparing observations of the Moons of Jupiter with similar observations made in Cambridge, England. He was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1768.

== Political and mercantile pursuits ==

Hopkins began his public service in 1730 at age 23 when he became a justice of the peace in the newly formed town of Scituate, a position that he held until 1735. He also became the clerk of Scituate in 1731 which he held for 11 years until moving to Providence in 1742. Following his tenure as justice of the peace, he became a justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and General Sessions from 1736 to 1746, serving as the clerk of the court for the last five of those years. Other positions that he held during this time period included president of the Town Council, deputy, and speaker of the House of Deputies. In 1744, he was elected as a deputy from Providence, which he held for seven years, and he was the speaker of the House of Deputies during two of those years.

In 1742, Hopkins sold his farm in Scituate and moved to the settled part of Providence. Here he devoted much energy to commercial interests which helped Providence grow. He became a merchant who built, owned, and outfitted ships, and he was part owner of the privateering vessel &quot;Reprisal&quot; in 1745, in partnership with John Mawney, sheriff of Providence and son of Colonel Peter Mawney. In the mid-1750s, Boston portraitist John Greenwood was commissioned by a group of sea captains and merchants, including Hopkins, to create a satirical painting. The men were stopped at a major trading port in Suriname on the north coast of South America where Greenwood was living at the time. Greenwood concocted a 22-figure tavern scene, showing himself among the affluent traders, many of whom were caricatured as intoxicated.

One of Hopkins&#x27;s enterprises later in life was as a manufacturer, and he became a partner with brothers Moses, Nicholas, Joseph, and John Brown in establishing the Hope Furnace. This enterprise was concerned with iron works which made pig iron and cannons for use during the Revolutionary War. Hopkins&#x27;s son Rufus managed the business for four decades.
=== Governorships ===

In 1755, Hopkins was elected to his first term as governor, defeating his predecessor William Greene by a small margin. The year was mostly occupied with legislation and work related to the pending war with France. Braddock&#x27;s defeat and the occupation of Crown Point led the colony to send forces to Albany. Late in the previous year, Hopkins and his Attorney-General Daniel Updike were delegates from Rhode Island to the Albany Congress, which convened to discuss the common defense of the collective colonies and to hold a conference with the five Indian tribes to secure their assistance in thwarting French encroachment. He and others considered Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s early plan for uniting the colonies, but the principles of the plan were rejected in both the colonies and Great Britain. As the war with France developed in February 1756, the General Assembly ordered the raising of 500 Rhode Island men for the expedition to Lake George in New York.

After two years in office, Hopkins was defeated by William Greene for the governorship, but Greene died in office in February 1758, and Hopkins once again became governor. The most divisive political issue of the day was the use of hard money, or specie, versus the use of paper money, and Hopkins sided with paper. Another issue was Newport interests versus Providence interests. For several years, Hopkins was locked in a bitter rivalry with Samuel Ward of Westerly, a strong supporter of hard currency and also a champion of Newport, and Hopkins sued Ward for slander, putting damages at £40,000. The case was moved to Massachusetts for a fair trial; the judgment went against Hopkins by default in 1759, and he paid the costs.

For ten years, the two men went back and forth as Governor of the colony, each at the head of a powerful party. Ward led the wealth and conservatism of Newport, Narragansett, and Kent County, while Hopkins represented the growing strength of Providence and Bristol Counties. The two men had been likened to gladiators in an arena, thirsting for each other&#x27;s life. Hopkins eventually lost to Ward, who was finally elected Governor in 1762.

In 1763, Hopkins won back the governorship, and signs of reason between the two men appeared the following year when Ward wrote to Hopkins proposing that both resign their &quot;pretensions to the chief seat of government.&quot; On the same day, without the knowledge of this letter, Hopkins wrote to Ward inviting him to accept the position of deputy governor, which had just been vacated by the death of John Gardner. Neither man accepted the proposal of the other, but the stage had been set for future cooperation.

In early 1765, the Stamp Act was passed by both houses of Parliament in England. This act was a scheme for taxing the colonies, directing that all commercial and legal documents must be written on stamped paper sold at fixed prices by governmental officers, and also directing that a duty be applied to newspapers. Parliament assumed the right to tax the colonies and put additional duties on sugar, coffee, and other articles, and required that lumber and iron from the colonies only be exported to England.

The news of the act infuriated Americans, and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts invited all the colonies to a congress of delegates to meet in New York to discuss relief from the unjust taxes. The Rhode Island General Assembly passed resolutions in August 1765 following the lead of Patrick Henry of Virginia. Rhode Island&#x27;s appointed stamp distributor was Attorney General Augustus Johnson, who refused to execute his office &quot;against the will of our Sovereign Lord the People.&quot; The Rhode Island General Assembly met again at East Greenwich in September 1765, choosing delegates to the New York congress and appointing a committee to consider the Stamp Act. The committee reported six resolutions that pointed to absolving all allegiance to the British Crown unless the grievances were removed. The Stamp Act was repealed in 1766, with news reaching America in May to public rejoicing.

In 1764, an act was passed incorporating the college in Rhode Island. Ward and Hopkins both strongly supported an institution of higher learning within the colony, and both became trustees of Rhode Island College. Hopkins also became one of the school&#x27;s most generous supporters and the school&#x27;s first chancellor, which position he held until his death in 1785.

Rhode Island&#x27;s election of 1767 was as hotly contested as ever, but Hopkins beat Ward by the widest margin of any of their previous elections. In 1768, Hopkins proposed to Ward that the two men should relinquish their claims on the elections and agree to a compromise candidate. Ward accepted the proposal, Josias Lyndon was elected as governor, and Ward and Hopkins met and united in a cordial friendship for the remainder of their lives.

=== &quot;The Rights of Colonies Examined&quot; ===

In November 1764, the Rhode Island General Assembly published Hopkins&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;The Rights of Colonies Examined&quot;. This pamphlet was directed primarily at the Stamp Act and helped build Hopkins&#x27;s reputation as a revolutionary leader, with its broad distribution and criticism of taxation and Parliament. The text begins, &quot;Liberty is the greatest blessing that men enjoy, and slavery the heaviest curse that human nature is capable of;&quot; it goes on to present a clear and logical review of the relationship of the American colonies with England. The paper received widespread circulation and brought hearty approval from throughout the colonies. Historian Thomas Bicknell called it &quot;the most remarkable document that was issued during the period preceding the War of the Revolution.&quot; Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson wrote of the paper, &quot;it was conceived in a higher strain than any that were sent out by other colonies.&quot; It was printed widely, and Hopkins became recognized as one of the leaders of public opinion in the colonies.

=== Chief Justice ===

In May 1747, Hopkins was first appointed as a justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court, whose long title was the &quot;Superior Court of Judicature, Court Of Assize, and General Gaol Delivery.&quot; In 1751, he became the third Chief Justice of this court, which he held until 1755 when he became governor. Hopkins was once again appointed as Chief Justice of the court in 1770 after a total of nine years as governor; he served until October 1775 while simultaneously serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

One of the most important events with which Hopkins dealt during his final tenure as Chief Justice was the Gaspee Affair. In March 1772, Deputy Governor Darius Sessions in Providence sent a letter of concern to Governor Joseph Wanton in Newport, having consulted with Chief Justice Hopkins. Sessions expressed alarm that the British schooner &quot;Gaspee&quot; had been cruising the Narragansett Bay, disrupting the traffic by stopping and searching commercial ships. Sessions wrote:

Sessions went on to request that the governor take measures to bring the ship&#x27;s commander to account. A chain of threatening correspondence ensued between the governor and &quot;Gaspee&quot; commander Lieutenant William Dudingston, and Dudingston&#x27;s superior Admiral John Montagu. On the night of June 9–10, a party of incensed colonists attacked the vessel and burned it to the waterline. Officially, Sessions was outraged at the incident and offered the colony&#x27;s assistance in bringing the perpetrators to justice. To ameliorate retribution by the British authorities, Rhode Island officials took visible steps to find the culprits who burned the ship. Behind the scenes, however, Sessions and Hopkins did all they could to thwart any attempts to identify the attackers.

A royal commission was appointed by the British to investigate the incident, and they demanded that any indicted person be sent to England for trial. This egregious threat to local liberty prompted the colonists to form the Committees of Correspondence. Loyalist Massachusetts Governor Hutchinson further aggravated the colonists&#x27; sensitivities by urging Britain to rescind the Rhode Island Royal Charter.

Sessions conferred with Chief Justice Hopkins, lawyer John Cole, and Moses Brown, and the four men drafted a letter to Massachusetts&#x27; statesman Samuel Adams. Adams replied by urging Rhode Island to remain defiant, or at least to stall matters by appealing the creation of the royal commission. Governor Wanton was put at the head of this commission but was compliant with Sessions&#x27; and Hopkins&#x27;s attempts to frustrate the aims of the commission. Sessions, Hopkins, and others coordinated their efforts to lose evidence, threaten potential witnesses, and discredit those who testified. The vast majority of Rhode Island&#x27;s citizens were supportive of the attackers and kept quiet about their identities. A year after the incident, the royal commission was terminated without a single indictment.

=== Continental Congress ===

In 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, and both Ward and Hopkins were chosen as the delegates from Rhode Island. Hopkins, at age 68, was senior to every delegate there, and only he and Benjamin Franklin had attended the Albany Congress 20 years earlier. Over the previous several years, Hopkins had developed palsy in his hands, and this greatly affected his ability to write. At the seating of this congress, Henry Arniett Brown wrote, &quot;yonder sits the oldest of them all. His form is bent, his thin locks, fringing a forehead bowed with age and honorable service, and his hands shake tremulously as he folds them in his lap. It is Stephen Hopkins.&quot;

The congress was called to protest the actions of Great Britain and to secure the rights and privileges of the 13 colonies. Both Hopkins and Ward had already predicted that independence would only come with war. Hopkins told his associates in Congress, &quot;Powder and ball will decide this question. The gun and bayonet alone will finish the contest in which we are engaged, and any of you who cannot bring your minds to this mode of adjusting the quarrel, had better retire in time.&quot;

Hopkins was again elected as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress which met on May 10, 1775, following the April attacks on Concord and Lexington. This congress convened to manage the war effort, and eventually declared independence from Great Britain. In July 1775, they adopted a national postal system that was devised by William Goddard, with Benjamin Franklin appointed as the first Postmaster General. This was an idea that had already been implemented in Rhode Island a month earlier. In December 1775, Hopkins was on a committee to report a plan for furnishing the colonies with naval armament. His knowledge of the shipping business made him particularly useful as a member of the naval committee established by Congress to purchase, outfit, man, and operate the first ships of the new Continental Navy. Hopkins was instrumental in framing naval legislation and drafting the rules and regulations necessary to govern the fledgling organization during the American War for Independence. The first American naval squadron was launched on February 18, 1776. Hopkins used his influence to secure the position of commander in chief of the new navy for his brother Esek Hopkins, an appointment that proved to be unfortunate.

The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations declared its absolute independence from Great Britain by a nearly unanimous vote on May 4, 1776; the Continental Congress adopted the United States Declaration of Independence two months later on July 2. Hopkins had to support his palsied right hand with his left as he signed the document, remarking, &quot;my hand trembles, but my heart does not.&quot; The gathering of the Founding Fathers was depicted in John Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;, where Hopkins is pictured standing in the back wearing a hat.

John Adams appreciated Hopkins&#x27;s contributions during the congressional sessions:

== Hopkins and slavery ==

Stephen Hopkins was a slave owner, like the majority of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and he mentioned five slaves in his 1760 will consisting of a man, woman, and three boys. They were bequeathed to close members of his family with instructions for their care; this was highly unusual for any slave owner. The woman was named Fibbo (or Phibo, Phebe) and was to go to his wife Anne and be treated &quot;so that Servitude may not be a Burthen to her&quot;; the man was named Saint Jago and was to go to his oldest son Rufus and be treated &quot;so that his Life may be rendered easy and comfortable.&quot; The will was never proved because Hopkins lived another 25 years, and circumstances changed its provisions.

On October 28, 1772, Hopkins freed Saint Jago and wrote the following in the manumission document:

Hopkins felt that the bondage of self-sufficient &quot;rational creatures&quot; was against God&#x27;s will; he also thought that unconditional freedom for some slaves would be irresponsible on his part. To this end, he refused to free his woman slave Fibbo, even though it cost him his membership in the Quaker meeting. His rationale was that &quot;she had Children that needed the Immediate Care of a Mother.&quot; It appears that Hopkins&#x27;s remaining slaves were not freed until after his death, but at least two of them (Primus and Bonner Jr.) had been living semi-independently for several years before his death.

Hopkins introduced a bill in 1774 while serving in the Rhode Island Assembly which prohibited the importation of slaves into the colony. This became one of the first anti-slave trade laws in the United States. There were several pressures occurring in the colony which led to greater restrictions on the slave trade, the greatest of which was the pressure applied by the Quakers, who were a large percentage of Rhode Island&#x27;s population.

== Death and legacy ==

In September 1776, poor health forced Hopkins to resign from the Continental Congress and return to his home in Rhode Island, though he remained an active member of Rhode Island&#x27;s general assembly from 1777 to 1779. He died at his home in Providence on July 13, 1785, at age 78, and he is buried in the North Burial Ground there.

Hopkins helped to found the Providence Library Company in 1753, and he was a member of the Philosophical Society of Newport. The town of Hopkinton, Rhode Island was named after him. The SS &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; is a liberty ship named in his honor, and it was the first U.S. ship to sink a German surface warship in World War II.

Hopkins was instrumental in the establishment of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now Brown University) as a founding trustee. He served as Brown&#x27;s first chancellor from 1764 to 1785. His home was originally located at the corner of Hopkins and South Main Streets in Providence, but it was moved twice after his death, both times to other locations on Hopkins Street. It is now located at 15 Hopkins Street, at the corner of Benefit Street, on the edge of the Brown University campus, and is a National Historic Landmark.

In his diary, the Reverend Ezra Stiles wrote of Hopkins, &quot;I well knew Gov. Hopkins. He was a man of penetrating astutious Genius, full of Subtlety, deep Cunning, intriguing &amp; enterprizing.&quot; Stiles added that Hopkins was a &quot;man of a Noble fortitude &amp; resolution&quot; and &quot;a glorious Patriot!&quot; Hopkins has been given strong accolades from numerous historians, including Sanderson, Arnold, and Bicknell, but Richman simply called him &quot;the greatest statesman of Rhode Island.&quot;

== Family ==
Hopkins married Sarah Scott in 1726, the daughter of Sylvanus Scott and Joanna Jenckes and a descendant of Providence Plantations settlers Richard Scott and Katharine Marbury; Marbury was the youngest sister of Anne Hutchinson. Richard Scott was the first Quaker in Providence.

Hopkins had seven children, five of whom lived to maturity. His wife died on September 9, 1753, at age 46, and Hopkins married Anne Smith, the daughter of Benjamin Smith. They did not have children together. Hopkins&#x27;s younger brother Esek Hopkins became the first commander in chief of the Continental Navy, and his brother William became a celebrated merchant. Hopkins&#x27;s cousin was Quaker preacher Jemima Wilkinson, with whom he was friends.

<doc id="230109" wikidata="Q7075017" url="?curid=230109" title="Object-oriented operating system">
<text>An object-oriented operating system is an operating system that is designed, structured, and operated using object-oriented programming principles.

An object-oriented operating system is in contrast to an object-oriented user interface or programming framework, which can be run on a non-object-oriented operating system like DOS or Unix.

There are already object-based language concepts involved in the design of a more typical operating system such as Unix. While a more traditional language like C does not support object-orientation as fluidly as more recent languages, the notion of, for example, a file, stream, or device driver (in Unix, each represented as a file descriptor) can be considered a good example of objects. They are, after all, abstract data types, with various methods in the form of system calls which behavior varies based on the type of object and which implementation details are hidden from the caller.

Object-orientation has been defined as objects + inheritance, and inheritance is only one approach to the more general problem of delegation that occurs in every operating system. Object-orientation has been more widely used in the user interfaces of operating systems than in their kernels.

== Background ==
An object is an instance of a class, which provides a certain set of functionalities. Two objects can be differentiated based on the functionalities (or methods) they support. In an operating system context, objects are associated with a resource. Historically, the object-oriented design principles were used in operating systems to provide several protection mechanisms.

Protection mechanisms in an operating system help in providing a clear separation between different user programs. It also protects the operating system from any malicious user program behavior. For example, consider the case of user profiles in an operating system. The user should not have access to resources of another user. The object model deals with these protection issues with each resource acting as an object. Every object can perform only a set of operations. In the context of user profiles, the set of operations is limited by privilege level of a user.

Present-day operating systems use object-oriented design principles for many components of the system, which includes protection.

== Examples ==
; Athene
:Athene is an object-based operating system first released in 2000 by Rocklyte Systems. The user environment was constructed entirely from objects that are linked together at runtime. Applications for Athene could also be created using this methodology and were commonly scripted using the object scripting language Dynamic Markup Language (DML). Objects could have been shared between processes by creating them in shared memory and locking them as needed for access. Athene&#x27;s object framework was multi-platform, allowing it to be used in Windows and Linux environments for developing object-oriented programs. The company went defunct and the project abandoned sometime in 2009.
; BeOS
:BeOS was an object-oriented operating system released in 1995, which used objects and the C++ language for the application programming interface (API). The kernel was written in C with C++ wrappers in user space. The OS did not see mainstream usage and proved commercially unviable, however it has seen continued usage and development by a small enthusiast community.
; Choices
:Choices is an object-oriented operating system developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. It is written in C++ and uses objects to represent core kernel components like the central processing unit (CPU), processes, and so on. Inheritance is used to separate the kernel into portable machine-independent classes and small non-portable dependent classes. Choices has been ported to and runs on SPARC, x86, and ARM.
; ETHOS
:ETHOS was an experimental object oriented version of the Oberon System (see below) created by Clemens Szyperski for his PhD Thesis written in Oberon-2
; GEOS
:PC/GEOS is a light-weight object-oriented multitasking graphical operating system with sophisticated window and desktop management featuring scalable fonts. It is mostly written in an object-oriented x86 assembly language dialect and some C/C++ and is designed to run on DOS (similar to Microsoft Windows up to Windows Me). GEOS was developed originally by Berkeley Softworks in 1990, which later became GeoWorks Corporation, and it is continued to be maintained by BreadBox Computer Company. Related software suites were named &quot;Ensemble&quot; and &quot;New Deal Office&quot;. Adaptations exist for various palmtops, and 32-bit systems with non-x86-CPUs.
; Haiku
:Haiku (originally named &quot;OpenBeOS&quot;), is an open-source replacement for BeOS. It reached its first development milestone in September 2009 with the release of Haiku R1/Alpha 1. The x86 distribution is compatible with BeOS at both source and binary level. Like BeOS, it is written primarily in C++ and provides an object-oriented API. It is actively developed.
; IBM i (OS/400, i5/OS) 
:IBM introduced OS/400 in 1988. This OS ran exclusively on the AS/400 platform. Renamed IBM i in 2008, this operating system and runs exclusively on Power Systems which also can run AIX and Linux. IBM i uses an object-oriented methodology and integrates a database (Db2 for i). The IBM i OS has a 128-bit unique identifier for each object.
; IBM OS/2 2.0
:IBM&#x27;s first priority based pre-emptive multitasking, graphical, windows-based operating system included an object-oriented user shell. It was designed for the Intel 80386 that used virtual 8086 mode with full 32-bit support and was released in 1992. ArcaOS, a new OS/2 based operating system initially called Blue Lion is being developed by Arca Noae. The first version was released in May 2017.
; IBM TopView
:TopView was an object-oriented operating environment that loaded on a PC on DOS, and then took control from DOS. At that point it effectively became an object-oriented operating system with an object-oriented API (TopView API). It was IBM&#x27;s first multi-tasking, window based, object-oriented operating system for the PC led by David C. Morrill and released in February 1985.
; Java-based
:Given that Oracle&#x27;s (formerly Sun Microsystems&#x27;) Java is today one of the most dominant object-oriented languages, it is no surprise that Java-based operating systems have been attempted. In this area, ideally, the kernel would consist of the bare minimum needed to support a Java virtual machine (JVM). This is the only component of such an operating system that would have to be written in a language other than Java. Built on the JVM and basic hardware support, it would be possible to write the rest of the operating system in Java; even parts of the system that are more traditionally written in a lower-level language such as C, for example device drivers, can be written in Java.
:Examples of attempts at such an operating system include JavaOS, JOS, JNode, and JX.
; Lisp-based
:An object-oriented operating system written in the Lisp dialect Lisp Machine Lisp (and later Common Lisp) was developed at MIT. It was commercialized with Lisp machines from Symbolics, Lisp Machines Inc. and Texas Instruments. Symbolics called their operating system Genera. It was developed with the Flavors object-oriented extension of Lisp, then with New Flavors, and then with the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).
:Xerox developed several workstations with an operating system written in Interlisp-D. Interlisp-D provided object-oriented extensions like LOOPS and CLOS.
:Movitz and Mezzano are two more recent attempts at operating systems written in Common Lisp.
; Medos-2
:Medos-2 is a single user, object-oriented operating system made for the Lilith line of workstations (processor: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 2901), developed in the early 1980s at ETH Zurich by Svend Erik Knudsen with advice from Niklaus Wirth. It is built entirely from modules of the programming language Modula-2. It was succeeded at ETH Zurich by the Oberon system, and a variant named &quot;Excelsior&quot; was developed for the Kronos workstation, by the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, Siberian branch, Novosibirsk Computing Center, Modular Asynchronous Developable Systems (MARS) project, Kronos Research Group (KRG).
; Microsoft Singularity
:Singularity is an experimental operating system based on Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework. It is comparable to Java-based operating systems.
; Microsoft Windows NT
:Windows NT is a family of operating systems (including Windows 7, 8, Phone 8, 8.1, Windows 10, 10 Mobile, Windows 11 and Xbox) produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released in July 1993. It is a high-level programming language-based, processor-independent, multiprocessing, multi-user operating system. It is best described as object-based rather than object-oriented as it does not include the full inheritance properties of object-oriented languages.
:The Object Manager is in charge of managing NT objects. As part of this responsibility, it maintains an internal namespace where various operating system components, device drivers, and Win32 programs can store and lookup objects. The NT Native API provides routines that allow user space (mode) programs to browse the namespace and query the status of objects located there, but the interfaces are undocumented. NT supports per-object (file, function, and role) access control lists allowing a rich set of security permissions to be applied to systems and services. WinObj is a Windows NT program that uses the NT Native API (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display information on the NT Object Manager&#x27;s name space.
:; Component Object Model
::On the user mode side of Windows, the Component Object Model (COM) is an application binary interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in a large range of programming languages. COM is the basis for several other Microsoft technologies and frameworks, including Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+, Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), the Windows shell, DirectX, and Windows Runtime. OLE is a proprietary technology developed by Microsoft that allows embedding and linking to documents and other objects. On a technical level, an OLE object is any object that implements the &quot;IOleObject&quot; interface, possibly along with a wide range of other interfaces, depending on the object&#x27;s needs. Its primary use is for managing compound documents, but it is also used for transferring data between different applications using drag and drop and clipboard operations.
:; Compound File Binary Format
::Compound File Binary Format (CFBF) is a file format for storing many files and streams within one file on a disk. CFBF is developed by Microsoft and is an implementation of Microsoft COM Structured Storage. Structured storage is widely used as main file format in Microsoft Office applications including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Access and is the basis of Advanced Authoring Format.
:; Object Linking and Embedding
::Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) was part of a grander plan named Cairo, the code name for a project at Microsoft from 1991 to 1996. Its charter was to build technologies for a next generation operating system that would fulfill Bill Gates&#x27; vision of &quot;information at your fingertips&quot;. Cairo never shipped, although parts of its technologies have since appeared in other products. The Windows 95 graphical user interface was based on the initial design work that was done on the Cairo user interface. The remaining component is the object-based file system. It was once planned to be implemented in the form of Windows Future Storage (WinFS) as part of Windows Vista. WinFS is the code name for data storage and management system project based on relational databases, running on the Windows NT file system (NTFS), which is object-oriented in that it can store the NT objects including its NT object identifier. Each NTFS object has an object identifier; a shortcut with a target that&#x27;s on an NTFS volume also records the object identifier of the shortcut target, and the object identifier of the drive. WinFS was first demonstrated in 2003 as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. WinFS development was cancelled in June 2006, with some of its technologies merged into other Microsoft products such as Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and Microsoft SharePoint. It was subsequently confirmed in an interview with Bill Gates that Microsoft planned to migrate applications like Windows Media Player, Windows Photo Gallery, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc., to use WinFS as the data storage back-end.
; NeXTSTEP
:During the late 1980s, Steve Jobs formed the computer company NeXT. One of NeXT&#x27;s first tasks was to design an object-oriented operating system, NeXTSTEP. They did this by adding an object-oriented framework on Mach and BSD using the Objective-C language as a basis. It achieved a niche status in the computing market, notably used by Tim Berners-Lee developing the first implementation of the World Wide Web.
:NeXTStep later evolved into OpenStep and the Cocoa API on macOS and iOS (iPadOS, watchOS).
:OpenStep was provided as an API layer on many operating systems, namely HP-UX, NextStep, Solaris, and Windows.
; Oberon System
:Oberon System is a single user, object-oriented operating system made for the Ceres line of workstations (processor: National Semiconductor NS32000), developed in the later 1980s at ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht. It is built entirely from modules of the programming language Oberon. There are two successors of the Oberon System, ETHOS (see above) and, as of 2023 still maintained, an evolution named &quot;Active Object System&quot; (AOS), then renamed &quot;Bluebottle&quot;, then renamed &quot;A2&quot;.
; OOSMOS
:The Object-Oriented State Machine Operating System (OOSMOS), written in C, promotes object-oriented encapsulation and implements a full table-driven hierarchical state machine architecture. It generates C code directly from state charts drawn with the open source tool UMLet. OOSMOS also supports a unique feature call &#x27;state threads&#x27; which allows a thread of execution per state. OOSMOS operates on a bare board or in cooperation with an existing operating system.
; Phantom OS
:Phantom OS adheres to a principle where &quot;everything is an object&quot; and eliminates the concept of a file entirely, instead transparently persisting virtual memory to storage.
; ReactOS
:ReactOS is an open-source operating system intended to be binary compatible with application software and device drivers made for Microsoft Windows NT versions. Written from scratch, it aims to follow the architecture of Windows NT designed by Microsoft from the hardware level right through to the application level. This is &quot;not&quot; a Linux-based system, and shares &quot;none&quot; of the unix architecture.
; Smalltalk
:Smalltalk was invented at Xerox in the 1970s. The Smalltalk system is fully object-oriented and needs very little support by BIOS and the run-time system.
; Syllable
:Syllable makes heavy use of C++ and for that reason is often compared to BeOS.
; Symbolics Genera
:Genera from Symbolics is an operating system for Lisp machines written in ZetaLisp and Symbolics Common Lisp. It makes heavy use of Flavors (an early object-oriented extension to Lisp) and the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). Development began in the mid 70s at MIT.
; Taligent
:Taligent was an object-oriented operating system project, begun by Apple Inc. and jointly developed with IBM in the 1990s. It was later spun off to an IBM subsidiary and transformed from an operating system to a programming environment.

<text>St Giles Circus is a road junction in the St Giles district of the West End of London at the eastern end of Oxford Street, where it connects with New Oxford Street, Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road, which it is more often referred to owing to the location of Tottenham Court Road Underground station directly under the junction. It is near to Soho, Covent Garden, Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia.

== Formation ==

The circus derives its name from the nearby church of St Giles-in-the-Fields, after which the area is named. From the Middle Ages until the fifteenth century, gallows were located at St Giles Circus alongside a cage for prisoners, and a cattle enclosure known as St Giles&#x27;s Pound. The area was an infamous rookery until it was cleared in the mid-19th century with the creation of New Oxford Street parallel to St Giles High Street by clearances.

Tottenham Court Road Underground station was opened in July 1900 as part of the Central London Railway, with the platforms under Oxford Street to the west of St Giles Circus, and the station opening on the south west side of the circus, on Oxford Street. The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway joined the station with what is now part of the Northern Line in September 1908, with station entrance on the south east side of the circus. The main station ticket hall was later moved underground, built below the circus in the 1920s. The junction became known as St Giles Circus in 1921.

== Modern development ==
The area today is dominated by Centre Point Tower, located on the south-east corner on New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road. Built between 1963 and 1966 by developer Harry Hyams, the brutalist tower was London&#x27;s first &quot;skyscraper&quot;, and is now a Grade II listed building.
St Giles Circus has been since 2009 the site of construction for Crossrail, which have disrupted road flows and led to several buildings being demolished.

The Dominion Theatre is close to the north-east corner, on Tottenham Court Road just above New Oxford Street. The London Astoria theatre was on the south west side. A new theatre to replace the Astoria, @sohoplace, opened in October 2022, the first new West End theatre in half a century. An auditorium/gallery is planned for the south-east corner.

<text>Antibes (, , ; ) is a seaside city in the Alpes-Maritimes department in Southeastern France. It is located on the French Riviera between Cannes and Nice; its cape, the Cap d&#x27;Antibes, along with Cap Ferrat to the northeast, is one of the best known landforms in the area. The capes house the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc and Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat respectively, widely considered two of the most exclusive hotels in the world.

The town of Juan-les-Pins is in the commune of Antibes; the Sophia Antipolis technology park is northwest of it. In 2020, the commune had a population of 74,709, making it Alpes-Maritimes&#x27;s second-most populated.

==History==
===Origins===
Traces of occupation dating back to the early Iron Age have been found in the areas of the castle and cathedral. Remains beneath the Holy Spirit Chapel show there was an indigenous community with ties with Mediterranean populations, including the Etruscans, as evidenced by the presence of numerous underwater amphorae and wrecks off Antibes. However, most trade was with the Greek world, via the Phocaeans of Marseille.

===Greek colony of Marseille===

Antibes was founded as a Greek colony by Phocaeans from Massalia. They named it Antipolis (Greek: &#x27;,  &quot;Opposite-City&quot;) from its position on the opposite side of the Var estuary from Nice (Greek: &#x27;).

Current research suggests that Antipolis was founded relatively late in classical Greek period (4th century BC), to benefit from the protection of Marseille with its trade routes along the coast and strongholds like Olbia at Hyères, and trading posts such as Antipolis itself and later Nikaia; it is mentioned by Strabo.

The exact location of the Greek city is not well known. Given Greek colonial practices, it is likely that it was set at the foot of the rock of Antibes, in today&#x27;s old city. 

===Late Antiquity===
The Bishopric of Antibes was established c.450 by Pope Leo I, the first two bishops being Armentarius and Agroecius.

===Middle Ages===
The dust eventually settled to leave Antibes within the territory of the County of Provence, itself part of the Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles and from 1033 the Holy Roman Empire. In the tenth century the coastal areas of Provence were menaced by &#x27;Saracen&#x27; raiders from Muslim Spain, who were finally driven out when Count William I of Provence captured their stronghold at Fraxinetum in 975. William rewarded the knights who had fought for him in this campaign by enfeoffing them with the liberated lands in southern Provence. One of these knights was a certain Rodoald, who became Lord of Antibes.

Rodoald&#x27;s great-grandson Raimbaud appears to have relocated inland to Grasse around 1050, and sold the Lordship of Antibes to the bishopric during the episcopate of Bishop Bertrand (fl.1166-76).

During this period Antibes was still being raided periodically by Saracen pirates, and in 1124 they burned down Antibes Cathedral. The marauders continued to prey on the town over the following century, and in 1244 the Prince-Bishops of Antibes moved to Grasse to escape their depredations. They remained there for the next five centuries, despite an attempt to lure them back to Antibes by rebuilding the cathedral in 1250.

When the Western Schism began in 1378, splitting the Catholic world between two rival popes, the Bishop of Grasse backed Pope Urban VI even though Marie de Blois, mother of and regent to the infant Count Louis II of Provence, was a supporter of Urban&#x27;s enemy Antipope Clement VII. In 1383 Marie therefore confiscated the Lordship of Antibes from the Bishops of Grasse and two years later awarded it to the brothers Marc and Luc Grimaldi, of the Genoese House of Grimaldi. The new Grimaldi lords built the Château Grimaldi as their residence in the town.

After the deaths of the Grimaldi brothers (Marc in 1398 and Luc in 1409), control of the Lordship of Antibes passed to five co-heirs. As a result of this fragmentation of power, the actions of individual local lords became increasingly irrelevant to the town&#x27;s history, with the higher authority of the Count of Provence assuming greater significance instead.

===Early Modern era===

With the death in 1481 of Count Charles III, Provence was inherited by King Louis XI of France and thereby annexed to France. As Antibes was in the far southeast of the County of Provence it therefore became the border town at France&#x27;s southeastern extremity, guarding the frontier with the County of Nice, which was part of the Savoyard state. As such it was on the front line during the Italian Wars waged by France against Emperor Charles V, and was sacked in 1536 by Andrea Doria, a Genoese admiral in imperial service. Henry II of France therefore ordered the construction of Fort Carré in 1550 to guard the town against any future attacks, and the citadel was later reinforced by the renowned French military engineer Vauban.

In December 1746, during the War of the Austrian Succession, an Austro-Savoyard army under the command of Maximilian Ulysses Browne invaded France and besieged Antibes, subjecting the town to a heavy bombardment. The arrival of French reinforcements, and a revolt against the Austrian garrison at Genoa, obliged Browne to lift the siege on 1 February 1747, but by that point his guns had levelled 350 houses and also destroyed the cathedral again. The latter was subsequently rebuilt by Louis XV of France, and this version of the building is the one that has survived to the present day.

===Modern era===
On 1 March 1815, Napoléon Bonaparte landed on the beach at Golfe-Juan, 5 km southwest of Antibes, having escaped exile on the island of Elba. He hoped for a warm welcome in Antibes, which had been supportive of his regime, but the townspeople closed their gates to him and he was therefore obliged to move on northward without stopping. He successfully reached Paris and seized power again, only to be conclusively defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Today Golfe-Juan marks the beginning of the Route Napoléon, which traces the path taken by the emperor on his return from exile. The Hôtel de Ville was erected in Cours Masséna in 1828.

Antibes was transferred from its former department of Var to the new one of Alpes Maritimes in 1860. The harbor was again used for a &quot;considerable&quot; fishing industry and the area exported dried fruit, salt fish, and oil.

By the First World War, it had been connected by rail with Nice and most of its fortifications had been demolished to make way for new residential districts. In 1926, the old Château Grimaldi was bought by the local municipality and later restored for use as a museum. For six months in 1946, it was the home of the famous artist Pablo Picasso.

==Culture==
===Conservation===
On 25 May 1999, the town was the first in the department to sign the State Environment Charter, which pledges to actively conserve the natural environment.

===Sports===
Sport is an important part of the local culture; the town hosts the National Training Centre for basketball. The now demolished Jean Bunoz Sports Hall hosted several games of the 1999 FIBA EuroBasket. The city is home to Olympique Antibes, a professional basketball team of France&#x27;s top division LNB Pro A, which plays its home games at the Azur Arena Antibes.

The local football team is FC Antibes, who play at the Stade du Fort Carré, best known for when it hosted one game of the 1938 World Cup, between Sweden and Cuba.

The town is also home to the Antibes 6 Day Race and the Antibes Yacht Show.

The town has various athletic associations and host a fair in September at Fort Carré that allows residents to meet the various athletic associations and explore their offerings.

===Theatre and music===
The Théâtre Antibea, Théâtre des Heures Bleues and Café Théâtre la Scène sur Mer all offer a variety of performances from orchestra music to dramatic plays. Music of all types, from live jazz to DJs spinning techno, can be found in the bars and nightclubs and there are a number of festivals and special outdoor concerts during the summer. Jazz is still the speciality around here.

M83 (an electronic band) hails from Antibes.

===Festivals===

Antibes and Juan les Pins host a number of festivals, mainly during the summer months. There&#x27;s not much in the way of traditional cultural festivals in Antibes; most of the festivals focus on music and contemporary activities.
* Jazz à Juan Since its inception in 1960, the festival has attracted many jazz artists each year to play outdoors. (July).
* Antibes Yacht Show
* The Antique Show of Antibes attracts thousands of collectors for two weeks in April.
* Voiles d&#x27;Antibes is one of the world&#x27;s biggest gatherings of old teak and brass sailing vessels. They converge on the port for one of the most regal regattas in the Mediterranean (June).
* The Saint Peter Celebrations is the annual celebration of the patron saint of fishermen. A colourful procession through the town is followed by all the local fishermen adorning their boats and floating along the coast (June).
* The Festival of Notre Dame de Bon Port begins on the first Thursday of July and continues to the following Sunday, celebrating Notre Dame de Bon Port, the local manifestation of the Virgin Mary. At sunrise on the Thursday a mass is held in the chapel next to the Garoupe lighthouse and fishermen dressed in traditional sailors&#x27; outfits subsequently carry the statue of Notre Dame de Bon Port from the chapel (where it resides for most of the year) down the Chemin de Calvaire to Antibes Cathedral at the head of a large procession. The statue remains in the cathedral for the remaining four days of the festival, which includes multiple masses, a torchlit procession through the town on the Saturday evening, and parties at which pissaladière is traditionally eaten.
* The Festival of Sacred Music takes place in Antibes Cathedral, which has renowned acoustics. Sacred music is the theme of this popular festival, which attracts huge crowds each year (January).

===Beaches===


There are 48 beaches along the of coastline that surround Antibes and Juan les Pins.

===Museums===
; Archaeology Museum: This museum sits atop the Promenade Amiral de Grasse in the old Bastion St Andre, a 17th-century fortress. The museum&#x27;s collection focuses on the classical history of Antibes. Many artifacts, sculptures and amphorae found in local digs and shipwrecks from the harbour are displayed here.
; Naval Museum of Napoleon: Housed in a 17th-century stone fort and tower, this museum presents a collection of Napoleonic memorabilia, paintings and naval models. Several wall paintings show historic moments in Napoleon&#x27;s reign and there are also pieces of his clothing including one of the hats he wore.
; Picasso Museum: The Picasso Museum houses one of the world&#x27;s greatest Picasso collections: 24 paintings, 44 drawings, 32 lithographs, 11 oils on paper, 80 pieces of ceramics, two sculptures and five tapestries.
; La Tour Museum: This small museum in the centre of town brings the contemporary history of Antibes to life through its exhibit of costumes, tools, photographs and other objects used by the local people.
; Absinthe Museum: The Absinthe Museum is located in a basement in the Roman foundations of Old Antibes. It is dedicated to the manufacture and appreciation of this green liqueur.

===Parks and gardens===

; The Exflora Park: The Exflora Park is a five-hectare () garden open to the public. Next to the large olive grove, there are different styles of Mediterranean gardens, from ancient Rome to the exuberant Riviera of the 19th century. Fountains and ponds stretch along the terrace, making a waterway long. Antibes is renowned for rose production, and rose bushes line the path leading to the sea. The exotic garden and palm grove is reminiscent of the belle époque, when English gardeners succeeded in planting flowers that bloom in winter, the season when the aristocracy visited the Côte d&#x27;Azur.
: A little further on is the Théâtre de Verdure, inspired by Italian gardens, and a panoramic viewpoint with a view of the sea and the Iles des Lerins. In the style of Provençal gardens of the 18th century, there is a maze with sculpted hedges. Further on, Islamic gardens are featured, with an orange grove where the ground is patterned with terracotta irrigation pipes similar to those in the celebrated Seville Cathedral in Spain. The vegetable gardens and orchards in the Arsat are planted in hollows as in Morocco to protect them from the sun and maximise shadow and humidity. A representation of a Moroccan house pays homage to the painter Majorelle, creator of the blue garden in Marrakesh. In another area, the winter garden contains plants that flower in winter, such as mimosa and camellias.
; The Eilenroc Gardens: Villa Eilenroc was built on a rock in the middle of a virtual desert. The area was transformed into a garden through the patience and talent of Jacques Greber, landscape architect and consultant to the Great Exhibition in New York City in 1939. He was commissioned by Mr Beaumont to create this park of .
: The gardens lie thirty metres above the sea with a view across the bay of the Cap. Planted with traditional Mediterranean species such as marine and parasol pines, Alep and Canary pines, cypress, oaks, olive trees, arbutus, lavender, thyme, rosemary, eucalyptus, ficus etc., as well as three kilometres () of pittosporum hedges, a whole part of the park has been created with plants found in the Antibes area in 1920.
; Thuret Park: In 1857, Gustave Thuret discovered the Cap d&#x27;Antibes and bought five hectares () of land where he built a villa and began the creation of a park. Bequeathed to the state by his heirs, the Jardin botanique de la Villa Thuret is now managed by the INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Research). The collection of trees and exotic plants, and the rich earth, provide many opportunities for learning, and the cross-fertilisation of plant species that grow on the Mediterranean coast.
; Marineland: In 1970, Roland de la Poype created this animal exhibition park called Marineland in Antibes. First, it was a small oceanarium with a few pools and animals, but now it is one of the biggest in the world and receives more than 1,200,000 visitors per year. It is the only French sea park featuring two cetacean species: killer whales and dolphins.

===Garoupe Lighthouse===

The old lighthouse of Antibes provides views from its lofty hilltop. To get here, you must walk about one kilometre up the Chemin de Calvaire from the Plage de la Salis.

===Church of the Immaculate Conception (Antibes Cathedral)===

The Antibes Cathedral was first built by Bishop Armentarius in the fifth century. It was destroyed multiple times during its history, notably by Saracen pirates in 1124 and by Austrian bombardment during the 1746-7 Siege of Antibes. Its current façade dates to the rebuilding that followed the latter catastrophe, and blends Latin classical symmetry and religious fantasy. The interior houses some impressive pieces such as a Baroque altarpiece and life-sized wooden carving of Christ&#x27;s death from 1447.

===Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc===
This large villa, set in &quot;a forest&quot; at the tip of the Cap d&#x27;Antibes peninsula, re-creates a 19th-century château. Since 1870 (then called Villa Soleil) the glamorous white-walled Hôtel du Cap on the French Riviera has been one of the most storied and luxurious resorts in the world. Guests who flocked there included Marlene Dietrich, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Winston Churchill. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton conducted an affair and honeymooned there.
===Ports===

There are many yachting harbours which provide moorings for a range of ships ranging from fishing vessels to full sized yachts.

* Port Vauban: The largest yachting harbour in Europe, with more than 2,000 moorings, can accommodate craft of more than 100 metres. This old port was the heart of the ancient Greek city of Antipolis and has a long and colourful history which includes Ligurians, Romans and Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. Today, it is the largest marina in Europe, serving both local fishing boats and luxury yachts.

<text>Friedrich Christoph Schlosser (17 November 1776 – 23 September 1861) was a German historian, Professor of History at the University of Heidelberg and a Privy Councillor in Prussia.

==Early years==

He was born at Jever in the District of Friesland. He studied theology, mainly at Göttingen, and then tutored privately. Turning to the study of history, he became and remained for a quarter of a century the most popular German historian.

==Work==
In 1807, inspired by his study of Dante, he published his first work &quot;Abélard und Dulcin&quot;, a defence of scholasticism and medieval thought. Two years later biographical studies of Theodore Beza and Peter Martyr Vermili (&quot;Leben des Theodor de Bela und des Peter Martyr Vermili&quot;, Heidelberg, 1809) revealed more great scholarship. In 1812 his &quot;History of the Iconoclastic Emperors of the East&quot; (&quot;Geschichte der bilderstürmenden Kaiser des oströmischen Reichs&quot;) was published, in which he contradicted some points in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s highly opinionated work and sought to avoid painting the past in present-day colours. It won him the favour of Archbishop Karl Theodor Dalberg and secured him a Professorship in the Frankfurt Lyceum.

In 1815 the first volume of his &quot;World History&quot; (&quot;Weltgeschichte in zusammenhängender Erzählung&quot;) was published. This work, though never completed, extended through many volumes, bespeaking an inexhaustible energy and a vast erudition. A translation of the pedagogical handbook of Vincent of Beauvais and the accompanying monograph are still considered of value.

The next noteworthy work was a history of antiquity and its culture (&quot;Universalhistorische Übersicht der Geschichte der alten Welt und ihrer Kultur&quot;, 1st part, 1826; 2nd part, 1834), which, while revealing little knowledge of the new criticism of sources inaugurated by F.A. Wolf and B.G. Niebuhr, won its way by its unique handling of the subject and its grand style. In 1823 he published in two volumes a &quot;Geschichte des 18ten Jahrhunderts&quot;. This work, enlarged and improved, appeared in six volumes as &quot;Geschichte des 18ten Jahrhunderts und des 19ten bis zum Sturz des französischen Kaiserreichs&quot; (1836–1848). The history had a most extraordinary success, especially among the common people, since the author boldly and sternly sat in judgment upon men and events, and in his judgments voiced the feelings of the German nation in his day. It has been translated into English by D. Davison (8 vols, 1843–1852). Finally, Schlosser undertook a popular &quot;World History for the German People&quot; (&quot;Weltgeschichte für das deutsche Volk&quot;, 1844–1857), which also enjoyed the favour of those for whom it was written.

He left Frankfurt in 1819 to become professor of history at Heidelberg where he resided until his death. He was an elected member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences of Copenhagen, and of the Society of Literature of Leyden and other learned societies.

===Works in English translation===
* &quot;History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth Century Till the Overthrow of the French Empire,&quot; volumes 1–8, Chapman and Hall. London, 1843–1852.

==Criticism==
Schlosser stands apart from the movement towards scientific history in Germany in the 19th century. Refusing to limit himself to political history, as did Leopold von Ranke, he never learned to handle his literary sources with the care of the scientific historian. History was to him, as it had been to Cicero, a school for morals; but he had perhaps a juster conception than Ranke of the breadth and scope of the historian&#x27;s field.

<text>The Sesame Street Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson, many for the purpose of appearing on the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Henson&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney, one of the creators of the show, met in the summer of 1968, at one of the show&#x27;s five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should &quot;make do without puppets&quot;.

Henson was originally reluctant but agreed to join &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in support of its social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (renamed to the Sesame Workshop in 2000), the series&#x27; non-profit producer. The Muppets were a crucial part of the show&#x27;s popularity and it brought Henson national attention. The Muppet segments of the show were popular since its premiere, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.

During the production of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show&#x27;s appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. The results were &quot;generally very positive&quot;; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and children&#x27;s attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children&#x27;s attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the &quot;Street&quot; segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.

The Street scenes were &quot;the glue&quot; that &quot;pulled the show together&quot;, so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers&#x27; advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show&#x27;s most enduring characters. These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called &quot;the essence of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults&quot;. Since 2001, the full rights for the Muppets created for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (which do not include Kermit the Frog) have been owned by Sesame Workshop; Sesame continues to license the trademarked term &quot;Muppet&quot; from The Muppets Studio for their characters.

<text>Friedrich Georg &quot;Fritz&quot; Houtermans (January 22, 1903 – March 1, 1966) was a Dutch-Austrian-German atomic and nuclear physicist and Communist born in Zoppot (now Sopot) near Danzig (now Gdańsk), West Prussia to a Dutch father, who was a wealthy banker. He was brought up in Vienna, where he was educated, and moved to Göttingen when he was 18 to study. It was in Göttingen where he obtained his Ph.D. under James Franck.

==Education==
Houtermans began his studies at the University of Göttingen in 1921, and he received his doctorate under James Franck in 1927, the same year Robert Oppenheimer received his doctorate under Max Born. He completed his Habilitation under Gustav Hertz at Technische Universität Berlin, in 1932. Hertz and Franck were Nobel Prize laureates; they shared the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics.

While at Göttingen, Houtermans met Enrico Fermi, George Gamow, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, and Victor Frederick Weisskopf. Houtermans and Gamow did pioneering work on quantum tunneling in 1928. Houtermans, in 1929, with Robert d&#x27;Escourt Atkinson, made the first calculation of stellar thermonuclear reactions. Their pioneering calculations were the impetus for Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Hans Bethe, in 1939, to put forth the correct theory of stellar thermonuclear energy generation.

Charlotte Riefenstahl, who received her doctorate in physics at the University of Göttingen in 1927, the same year as Houtermans and Robert Oppenheimer, was courted by both men. In 1930, she left her teaching position at Vassar College and went back to Germany. During a physics conference at the Black Sea resort of Batumi, Riefenstahl and Houtermans were married in August 1930, in Tbilisi, with Wolfgang Pauli and Rudolf Peierls as witnesses to the ceremony.

==Career==
From 1932 to 1933, Houtermans taught at Technische Universität Berlin and was an assistant to Hertz. While there, he met Patrick Blackett, Max von Laue, and Leó Szilárd.

Houtermans was a Communist; he had been a member of the German Communist Party since the 1920s. After the election of Adolf Hitler in 1933, Charlotte Houtermans insisted that they leave Germany. They went to Great Britain, near Cambridge, where he worked for the EMI (Electrical and Musical Instruments, Ltd.) Television Laboratory. In 1935 Houtermans emigrated to the Soviet Union, as the result of a proposal by Alexander Weissberg, who had emigrated to there in 1931. Houtermans took an appointment at the Kharkov Physico-Technical Institute and worked there for two years with the Russian physicist Valentin P. Fomin. In the Great Purge, Houtermans was arrested by the NKVD in December 1937. He was tortured and confessed to being a Trotskyist plotter and German spy, out of fear from threats against Charlotte. However, Charlotte had already escaped from the Soviet Union to Denmark, after which she went to England and finally the USA. After the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, Houtermans was turned over to the Gestapo in May 1940 and imprisoned in Berlin. Through efforts of Max von Laue, Houtermans was released in August 1940, whereupon he became employed &quot;Forschungslaboratorium für Elektronenphysik&quot;, a private laboratory of Manfred Baron von Ardenne, in Lichterfelde, a suburb of Berlin. In 1944, Houtermans took a position as a nuclear physicist at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt.
While imprisoned in the Soviet Union, a cellmate of Houtermans was the Kiev University historian Konstantin Shteppa. They would later write a book together, &quot;Russian Purge and the Extraction of Confession&quot;, under the pseudonyms of Beck and Godin to protect their many friends and colleagues back in the USSR.

At the Forschunsinstitut Manfred von Ardenne, Houtermans showed that transuranic isotopes, such as neptunium and plutonium, could be used as fissionable fuels in substitution for uranium. In an act of espionage against his country, Houtermans sent a telegram from Switzerland to Eugene Wigner at the Met Lab warning the USA&#x27;s Manhattan Project of German work on fission: &quot;Hurry up. We are on the track.&quot;

During Houtermans&#x27;s employment at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), he got himself into serious trouble as a result of his habit of being a chain-smoker and suffering great distress if he did not have a supply of tobacco. On official PTR stationery, he wrote to a Dresden cigarette manufacturer to obtain a kilogram of Macedonian tobacco, claiming that he could extract heavy water from the tobacco, and thus that it was &quot;kriegswichtig&quot;, i.e., important for the war effort. When he had smoked the tobacco, he again wrote for more, however, the letter fell into the hands of an official at the PTR, who had him fired. Werner Heisenberg and Carl Weizsäcker came to the rescue of Houtermans and arranged an interview for him with Walter Gerlach, the plenipotentiary (Bevollmächtiger) for German nuclear research under the Reich Research Council. As a result, Houtermans moved to Göttingen in 1945, where Hans Kopferman and Richard Becker got him positions at the Institut für Theoretische Physik and II. Physikalisches Institut der Universität Göttingen.

From 1952, Houtermans took a position as ordinarius professor of physics at the University of Bern. During his tenure there, he founded &quot;Berner Schule&quot;, whose thrust was the application of radioactivity to astrophysics, cosmochemistry, and geosciences.

==Personal==
Houtermans was married four times. Charlotte was his first and third wife in four marriages. They had two children, a daughter Giovanna (born in Berlin, 1932) and a son Jan (born in Kharkov, 1935), and they were divorced the first time in 1943, due to a new law in Germany and enforced wartime separation. In February 1944, Houtermans married Ilse Bartz, a chemical engineer; they worked together during the war and published a paper. Houtermans and Ilse had three children, Pieter, Elsa, and Cornelia. In August 1953, again with Pauli standing as a witness, Charlotte and Houtermans were again married, but they divorced again in only a few months. In 1955, Houtermans married Lore Müller, sister of his stepbrother, Hans. She brought her four-year-old daughter to the marriage, and she and Houtermans had a son, Hendrik, born in 1956.

Houtermans died of lung cancer on 1 March 1966.

==Internal report==
Houtermans authored a report which was published in (&quot;Research Reports in Nuclear Physics&quot;), an internal publication of the German &quot;Uranverein&quot;. Reports in this publication were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

<text>Karl Daub (20 March 176522 November 1836) was a German Protestant theologian.

==Biography==
He was born at Kassel. He studied philosophy, philology and theology at Marburg in 1786, and eventually (1795) became professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained until his death. He became rector of the university in 1816 and 1824. He was married in 1801 to Sophie Wilhelmine Charlotte Blum.

Daub was one of the leaders of a school which sought to reconcile theology and philosophy, and to bring about a speculative reconstruction of orthodox dogma. In the course of his intellectual development, he came successively under the influence of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich von Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel, and on account of the different phases through which he passed he was called the Talleyrand of German thought. There was one great defect in his speculative theology: he ignored historical criticism. His purpose was, as Otto Pfleiderer says,

&quot;to connect the metaphysical ideas, which had been arrived at by means of philosophical dialectic, directly with the persons and events of the Gospel narratives, thus raising these above the region of ordinary experience into that of the supernatural, and regarding the most absurd assertions as philosophically justified. Daub had become so hopelessly addicted to this perverse principle that he deduced not only Jesus as the embodiment of the philosophical idea of the union of God and man, but also Judas Iscariot as the embodiment of the idea of a rival god, or Satan.&quot;
The three stages in Daub&#x27;s development are clearly marked in his writings. His &quot;Lehrbuch der Katechetik&quot; (1801) was written under the spell of Kant. His &quot;Theologumena&quot; (1806), his &quot;Einleitung in das Studium der christlichen Dogmatik&quot; (1810), and his &quot;Judas Ischarioth&quot; (2 vols., 1816, 2nd edition, 1818), were all written in the spirit of Schelling, the last of them reflecting a change in Schelling himself from theosophy to positive philosophy. Daub&#x27;s &quot;Die dogmatische Theologie jetziger Zeit oder die Selbstsucht in der Wissenschaft des Glaubens&quot; (1833), and &quot;Vorlesungen über die Prolegomena zur Dogmatik&quot; (1839), are Hegelian in principle and obscure in language.

He died in Heidelberg.

==Legacy==
Søren Kierkegaard is notable among those who were prominently influenced by Daub&#x27;s thought. In &quot;From the Papers of One Still Living&quot;, Kierkegaard wrote:

There must come a moment, I say, when as Daub observes, life is understood backward through the idea…
Some years later, Kierkegaard expanded on this idea in his journal, in a passage that is often quoted or paraphrased:

Philosophy is perfectly right in saying that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other claim – that it must be lived forwards.

<text>Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz (April 23, 1805 – July 14, 1879) was a German philosopher and pedagogue.

==Life==
Born in Magdeburg, he read philosophy at Berlin, Halle and the University of Königsberg, devoting himself mainly to the doctrines of Hegel and Schleiermacher. After holding the chair of philosophy at Halle for two years, he became, in 1833, professor at Königsberg. In his last years he was blind.

He died in Königsberg.

==Philosophy==
Throughout his long professorial career, and in all his numerous publications he remained, in spite of occasional deviations on particular points, loyal to the Hegelian tradition as a whole. In the great division of the Hegelian school, he, in company with Michelet and others, formed the &quot;centre,&quot; midway between Erdmann and Gabler on the one hand, and the &quot;extreme left&quot; represented by Strauss, Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer.

<doc id="230149" wikidata="Q34807" url="?curid=230149" title="Foie gras">
<text>; (, ) is a specialty food product made of the liver of a duck or goose. According to French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by gavage (force feeding).

Foie gras is a delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavour is rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole or is prepared as mousse, parfait, or pâté, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states, &quot;Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France.&quot;

The technique of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began confining anatid birds to be forcedly fed to be fattened as a food source. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though there are producers and markets worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.

Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial, due mainly to animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding and the production, import, or sale of foie gras.

==History==
===Ancient times===
As early as 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced overfeeding and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in the tomb of Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks to push food down their throats. Tables are positioned to one side, piled with food pellets and a flask for moistening them before feeding the geese.

The practice of goose fattening spread from Egypt to the Mediterranean. The earliest reference to fattened geese is from the 5th-century BC Greek poet Cratinus, who wrote of geese-fatteners, yet Egypt maintained its reputation as the source for fattened geese. When the Spartan king Agesilaus visited Egypt in 361 BC, he noted that Egyptian farmers fattened geese and calves.

It was not until the Roman period, however, that foie gras is mentioned as a distinct food, which the Romans named &quot;iecur ficatum&quot;; &quot;iecur&quot; means liver, and &quot;ficatum&quot; derives from &quot;ficus&quot;, meaning fig in Latin. The emperor Elagabalus fed his dogs foie gras during the four years of his reign. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) credits his contemporary Roman gastronome Marcus Gavius Apicius with feeding dried figs to geese to enlarge their livers:

Hence the term &quot;iecur ficatum&quot;, fig-stuffed liver; feeding figs to enlarge a goose&#x27;s liver may derive from Hellenistic Alexandria, since much of Roman luxury cuisine was of Greek inspiration. &quot;Ficatum&quot; was closely associated with animal liver and it became the root word for &quot;liver&quot; in each of these languages: &quot;foie&quot; in French, &quot;hígado&quot; in Spanish, &quot;fígado&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;fegato&quot; in Italian, &quot;fetge&quot; in Catalan and Occitan, and &quot;ficat&quot; in Romanian, all meaning &quot;liver&quot;; this etymology has been explained in different manners.

===Postclassical Europe===
After the fall of the Roman empire, goose liver temporarily vanished from European cuisine. Some claim that Gallic farmers preserved the foie gras tradition until the rest of Europe rediscovered it centuries later, but the medieval French peasant&#x27;s food animals were mainly pigs and sheep. Others claim that the tradition was preserved by the Jews, who learned the method of enlarging a goose&#x27;s liver during the Roman colonisation of Judea or earlier from Egyptians. The Jews carried this culinary knowledge as they migrated farther north and west to Europe.

As Jews became established in Western and Central Europe, they soon encountered difficulties in finding a suitable cooking fat for use in dishes containing meat or to be served with meat. Lard was widely available, but Judaic dietary law, Kashrut, completely forbids it because it comes from an animal considered unclean. Butter, also commonly available, was not in itself proscribed, but it could not be used with or in meals containing meat because kashrut also prohibited mixing meat and dairy products. Jewish cuisine used olive oil in the Mediterranean and sesame oil in Babylonia, but neither cooking medium was readily available in Western and Central Europe. Jews in these regions therefore turned to poultry fat (known in Yiddish as &quot;schmaltz&quot;), which could be abundantly produced by overfeeding geese, where fat was needed with meat. 

The delicate taste of the fattened goose&#x27;s liver was soon appreciated; Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof of Kassel wrote in 1562 that the Jews raise fat geese and particularly love their livers. Some rabbis were concerned that eating forcibly overfed geese violated Jewish food restrictions. Some rabbis contended that it is not a forbidden food (treyf) as none of its limbs are damaged and the geese do not feel any pain in their throats from the process. This matter remained a debated topic in Jewish dietary law until the Jewish taste for goose liver declined in the 19th century. Another kashrut matter, still a problem today, is that even properly slaughtered and inspected meat must be drained of blood before being considered fit to eat. Usually, salting achieves that; however, as the liver is regarded as &quot;(almost) wholly blood&quot;, broiling is the only way of kashering. Properly broiling foie gras while preserving its delicate taste is difficult, and therefore rarely practised. Even so, there are restaurants in Israel that offer grilled goose foie gras. Foie gras also resembles the Jewish food staple, chopped liver.
Appreciation of fattened goose liver spread to gastronomes outside the Jewish community, who could buy in the local Jewish ghetto of their cities. In 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, chef de cuisine to Pope Pius V, published his cookbook &quot;Opera&quot;, wherein he writes that &quot;the liver of [a] domestic goose raised by the Jews is of extreme size and weighs [between] two and three pounds&quot;. In 1581, Marx Rumpolt of Mainz, chef to several German nobles, published the massive cookbook &quot;Ein Neu Kochbuch&quot;, describing that the Jews of Bohemia produced livers weighing more than three pounds; he lists recipes for it, including one for goose liver mousse. János Keszei, chef to the court of Michael Apafi, the prince of Transylvania, included foie gras recipes in his 1680 cookbook &quot;A New Book About Cooking&quot;, instructing cooks to &quot;envelop the goose liver in a calf&#x27;s thin skin, bake it and prepare [a] green or [a] brown sauce to accompany it. I used goose liver fattened by Bohemian Jews; its weight was more than three pounds. You may also prepare a mush of it.&quot;

==Production and sales==
In the 21st century, France is the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed in several other countries worldwide, particularly in some other European nations, the United States, and China. Approximately 30,000 people work in the French foie gras industry, with 90% of them residing in the Périgord (Dordogne), Aquitaine in the southwest, and Alsace in the east. The European Union recognizes the foie gras produced according to traditional farming methods (&quot;label rouge&quot;) in southwestern France with a protected geographical indication.

Hungary is the world&#x27;s second-largest foie gras (&quot;libamáj&quot;) producer and the largest exporter (although Bulgaria sometimes had a higher production in recent years, see table above). France is the principal market for Hungarian foie gras – mainly exported raw. Approximately 30,000 Hungarian goose farmers are dependent on the foie gras industry. French food companies spice, process, and cook the foie gras so it may be sold as a French product in its domestic and export markets.

===2005===
In 2005, France produced 18,450 tonnes of foie gras (78.5% of the world&#x27;s estimated total production of 23,500 tonnes), of which 96% was duck liver and 4% goose liver. Total French consumption of foie gras this year was 19,000 tonnes. In 2005, Hungary, the world&#x27;s second-largest foie gras producer, exported 1,920 tonnes, and Bulgaria produced 1,500 tons of foie gras.

The demand for foie gras in the Far East is such that China has become a sizeable producer. Madagascar is a small but rapidly growing producer of high-quality foie gras.

===2011===
In 2011, in Bulgaria (which started production in 1960), five million mule ducks were raised for foie gras on 800 farms, making Bulgaria the second-largest European producer.

===2012===
In 2012, France produced approximately 19,000 tonnes of foie gras, representing 75% of the world&#x27;s production in that year. This required the force-feeding of around 38 million ducks and geese. World production in 2015 is estimated as 27,000 tonnes.

===2014–2015===
In 2014, the whole of the EU produced approximately 25,000 tonnes of foie gras – 23,000 tonnes of duck foie gras and 2,000 tonnes of goose foie gras. The same year, France was producing 72% of world foie gras production, of which 97% was from ducks.

In 2014, France produced 19,608 tons of foie gras (74.3% of the world&#x27;s estimated total production).

In 2015, it was reported that in France, sales of foie gras may be waning, and an OpinionWay poll found that 47% of the French population supported a ban on force-feeding.

===2015–2016===
In 2016, it was reported that France produces an estimated 75% of the world&#x27;s foie gras and southwestern France produces approximately 70% of that total. In 2016, it could retail for upwards of $65 a pound.

In late 2015, there were several outbreaks of the highly contagious H5N1 bird flu in France, which escalated in 2016. This led to Algeria, China, Egypt, Japan, Morocco, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia banning French poultry exports, including foie gras, and France to initiate increased bio-security protocols which cost an estimated 220 million euros. One of these measures was the halting of production in southwestern France from early April 2016 for an anticipated period of three months to reduce the spread of the virus. Exports of foie gras from France are expected to decrease from 4,560 tonnes in 2015 to 3,160 in 2016.

The largest producer in the United States is Hudson Valley Foie Gras in New York, which processes approximately 350,000 ducks annually.

==Forms==


In France, foie gras exists in different, legally defined presentations, ordered by expense:

* (&quot;whole foie gras&quot;), made of one or two whole liver lobes; either (&quot;cooked&quot;), (&quot;semi-cooked&quot;), or (&quot;fresh&quot;);
* , made of pieces of livers reassembled together;
* , a fully cooked, moulded block composed of 98% or more foie gras; if termed (&quot;with pieces&quot;), it must contain at least 50% foie gras pieces for goose, and 30% for duck.

Additionally, there is , (either must contain 50% or more foie gras), (must contain 75% or more foie gras), and other preparations (no legal obligation established).

Fully cooked preparations are generally sold in either glass containers or metal cans for long-term preservation. Whole, fresh foie gras is usually unavailable in France outside Christmas, except in some producers&#x27; markets in the producing regions. Frozen whole foie gras sometimes is sold in French supermarkets.

Whole foie gras is readily available from gourmet retailers in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Argentina and regions with a sizeable market for the product. In the US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest in fat and especially suited for low-temperature preparation because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared. Grade C livers are generally reserved for making sauces as well as other preparations where a higher proportion of blood-filled veins will not impair the appearance of the dish.

==Production methods==

===Species, breeds, and sex used===

====Geese====
Traditionally, foie gras was produced from special breeds of geese. However, by 2004, geese accounted for less than 10% of the total global foie gras production and by 2014 only 5% of total French production. Goose breeds used in modern foie gras production are primarily the grey Landes goose (&quot;Anser anser&quot;) and the Toulouse goose.

In 2016, Hungary was producing 80% of the world&#x27;s goose foie gras; however, production rates are likely to drop in 2017 due to outbreaks of bird flu.

====Ducks====
In 2014, ducks accounted for 95% of foie gras production. The breeds primarily used are the Muscovy duck (&quot;Cairina moschata&quot;) (also called the Barbary duck) and the hybrid cross of a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos domestica&quot;) called the Mulard duck. This hybrid is sterile and is, therefore, sometimes referred to as a &quot;mule&quot; duck. Mulards are estimated to account for about 35% of all foie gras consumed in the US. About 95% of duck foie gras production from France comes from force-fed Mulards and the remaining 5% from the Muscovy duck.

After hatching, the Mulard ducklings are sexed. Males put on more weight than females, so the females are slaughtered. A new method has been recently developed, allowing to identify the sex of the duck in the egg, based on its eye colour. This new method should replace the slaughter of females after hatching within a few years.

===Physiological basis===
The basis of foie gras production is the ability that some waterfowl have to expand their esophagus and to gain weight, particularly in the liver, in preparation for migration. Wild geese may consume 300 grams of protein and another 800 grams of grasses per day. Farmed geese allowed to graze on carrots adapt to eating 100 grams of protein but may consume up to 2500 grams of carrots per day. The increasing amount of feed given before force-feeding and during the force-feeding itself cause the expansion of the lower part of the esophagus. However, the primary birds used for foie gras, the Mulard and Muscovy duck, cannot fly well and therefore do not migrate.

====Pre-feeding phase====
The pre-force feeding phase consists of three stages.
* The first stage (&quot;start-up&quot;) lasts from 1 to 28 days of age (0–4 weeks). During this stage, the young birds are housed in large, indoor groups (e.g. 2,100), usually on straw.
* The second stage (&quot;growth&quot;) lasts from 28 to 63 days of age (4–9 weeks). The birds are moved outside to feed on grasses &quot;ad libitum&quot;. The birds are given additional feed, but access to this is limited by time. This stage aims to take advantage of the natural dilation capacity of the esophagus of some wildfowl.
* The third stage (&quot;pre-fattening&quot;) lasts from 63 to 81 days of age (9–12 weeks). The birds are brought inside for gradually longer periods while introduced to a high-starch diet. This is a feeding transition where the food is distributed by meals, first in restricted amounts and time and, after that, greatly increased.

====Feeding phase====
The next production phase, which the French call or , or &quot;completion of fattening&quot;, involves forced daily ingestion of controlled amounts of feed for 10 to 12 days for ducks (10.5 on average) and 15 to 18 days with geese. During this phase, ducks are usually fed twice daily, while geese are usually fed three times daily. To facilitate the handling of ducks during gavage, these birds are housed throughout this phase in one of the following systems:

* Elevated collective cages indoor
* Elevated collective pens indoor
* Ground pens indoor

Individual cages (&quot;épinettes&quot; in French) have been banned in Europe.

Typical foie gras production involves force-feeding birds more food than they would eat in the wild, and much more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.
In modern production, the bird is typically fed a controlled amount of feed, depending on the stage of the fattening process, the bird&#x27;s weight, and the amount of feed the bird last ingested. At the start of production, a bird might be fed a dry weight of of food per day and up to (in dry weight) by the end of the process. The actual amount of food force-fed is much greater because water is added to the dry feed. For pellets, the typical composition is about 53% dry and 47% liquid (by weight). This is the equivalent of around 1,900 grams per day in total mass. For whole grain, the cooked weight is about 1.4 times the dry weight.

The feed is administered using a funnel fitted with a long metal or plastic tube (20–30 cm long), which forces the feed into the bird&#x27;s esophagus. If an auger is used, the feeding takes about 45 to 60 seconds, however, modern systems usually use a tube fed by a pneumatic pump with an operation time of 2 to 3 seconds per duck. During feeding, efforts are made to avoid damaging the bird&#x27;s esophagus, which could cause injury or death, although researchers have found evidence of inflammation of the walls of the proventriculus after the first session of force-feeding. There is also an indication of inflammation of the esophagus in the later stages of fattening. Several studies have also demonstrated that mortality rates can be significantly elevated during the gavage period.

The feed, usually corn boiled with fat (to facilitate ingestion), deposits large amounts of fat in the liver, thereby producing the buttery consistency sought by some gastronomes.

Ducks reared for foie gras are typically slaughtered at 100 days of age, although modern production methods with shortened pre-feeding and force feeding phases allow for an earlier slaughter, around 93 days. For geese, slaughter typically takes place at 112 days. The bird&#x27;s liver is 6 to 10 times its ordinary size at this time. Storage of fat in the liver produces steatosis of the liver cells.

===Alternative production===
Ethical concerns have driven a recent interest in alternative production methods that produce fattened liver without gavage, and, , at least 16 producers offered a meat-based foie gras alternative. The resulting products do not conform to the French legal standard for &quot;foie gras&quot;, but can be labeled &quot;fatty goose liver&quot; inside France. Outside France, they may be marked as &quot;ethical foie gras&quot; or &quot;humane foie gras&quot;, although these terms also describe gavage-based foie gras production tempered by concern with the animal&#x27;s welfare (e.g., feeding through rubber hoses instead of steel pipes). 

These alternative methods are controversial, in part because substitutes for gavage do not produce the same results. 

The current method, developed in Extremadura, Spain, involves timing the slaughter to coincide with the winter migration, when the livers naturally fatten. Prior to slaughter, the birds are allowed to eat freely, termed . For this innovation, the producer, Patería de Sousa, won the award at the 2006. Because gavage fattens goose livers to substantially larger than their natural size, de Sousa&#x27;s technique is less efficient at producing a fixed mass of foie gras, and composes a small fraction of the market. 

To achieve similar efficiency per mass to gavage, the British supermarket chain Waitrose sells a product which it calls (but see ), made from free-range British goose or duck liver blended with additional fat. Subsequently, researchers at the German and the company GMT developed a process to apply additional fat to duck liver meat at high pressure. Even trained chefs struggle to distinguish the result from traditional foie gras. 

More radical approaches are possible. A duck or goose with damaged ventromedial nucleus in the hypothalamus will feel less satiety after eating and therefore eat more. In lesioning experiments, this effect more than doubled the bird&#x27;s food consumption. Alternatively, human microbiome studies on obesity led French researchers at Aviwell develop a probiotic preparation that produces fatty livers in geese over six months without gavage.

===Vegan alternatives===
A Spanish company began selling a vegan alternative to &quot;foie gras&quot; called Fuah, in 2022. The product is made from cashew nuts, coconut oil, and beetroot. The American product Faux Gras is a vegan, nut-based spread. In , an animal welfare non-governmental organization found at least 14 producers of vegetarian or vegan alternatives to foie gras.

==Preparations==
Generally, French preparations of foie gras are made over low heat, as fat melts faster from the traditional goose foie gras than the duck foie gras produced in most other parts of the world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck foie gras, have more recipes and dish preparations for serving foie gras hot rather than cool or cold.

In Hungary, goose foie gras is traditionally fried in goose fat, which is then poured over the foie gras and left to cool; it is also eaten warm, after being fried or roasted, with some chefs smoking the foie gras over a cherry wood fire.

In other parts of the world, foie gras is served in dishes such as foie gras sushi rolls, in various forms of pasta or alongside steak tartare or atop a steak as a garnish.

===Cold preparations===
Traditional low-heat cooking methods result in terrines, &quot;pâtés&quot;, parfaits, foams, and mousses of foie gras, often flavored with truffle, mushrooms, or brandy such as cognac or armagnac. These slow-cooked forms of &quot;foie gras&quot; are cooled and served at or below room temperature.

In a very traditional form of terrine, &quot;au torchon&quot; (&quot;in a towel&quot;), a whole lobe of foie is molded, wrapped in a towel and slow-cooked in a &quot;bain-marie&quot;. For added flavor (from the Maillard reaction), the liver may be seared briefly over a fire of grape vine clippings (&quot;sarments&quot;) before slow-cooking in a bain-marie; afterwards, it is pressed and served cold, in slices.

Raw foie gras is also cured in salt (&quot;cru au sel&quot;) and served slightly chilled.

===Strasbourg pie===
A pastry containing fatty goose liver and other ingredients is known as the &quot;Strasburg pie&quot; since Strasbourg was a major producer of foie gras.

The Strasburg pie is mentioned in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as being popular with the diplomatic corps.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ad-Dressing of Cats&quot;, part of &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; and also the last song in its musical adaptation &quot;Cats&quot;, contains the line &quot;And you might now and then supply/Some caviar or Strasbourg pie&quot;.

Capt. Aubrey and Dr. Maturin enjoy a &quot;Strasburg pie&quot; in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s 1988 Napoleonic sea adventure &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot;.

===Hot preparations===
Given the increased internationalization of cuisines and food supply, &quot;foie gras&quot; is increasingly found in hot preparations in the United States, France, and elsewhere. Duck foie gras (&quot;&quot;foie gras de canard&quot;) has a slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperatures than goose foie gras (&quot;foie gras d&#x27;oie&quot;&quot;), but chefs have been able to cook goose &quot;foie gras&quot; employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.

Raw foie gras can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (&quot;poêlé&quot;), or (with care and attention) grilled. As foie gras has high-fat content, contact with heat needs to be brief and, therefore, at a high temperature, lest it burns or melts. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25 mm (½ – 1 inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve the integrity of the fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the &quot;foie gras&quot; on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.

Hot foie gras requires minimal spices, typically black pepper, paprika (in Hungary) and salt. Chefs have used fleur de sel as a gourmet seasoning for hot foie gras to add an &quot;important textural accent&quot; with its crunch.

===Consumption===
Foie gras is regarded as a gourmet luxury dish. In France, it is mainly consumed on special occasions, such as Christmas or New Year&#x27;s Eve &quot;réveillon&quot; dinners, though the recent increased availability of foie gras has made it a less exceptional dish. In some areas of France, &quot;foie gras&quot; is eaten year-round.

Duck foie gras is the slightly cheaper and, since a change of production methods in the 1950s to battery, by far the most common kind, particularly in the US. The taste of duck foie gras is often referred to as musky with a subtle bitterness. Goose foie gras is noted as less gamey and smoother, with a more delicate flavour.

==Animal welfare==

Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial due to the animal welfare consequences of the force-feeding procedure, intensive housing and husbandry, an enlarged liver and the potential for being detrimental to human health. Some countries find foie gras to be &quot;morally objectionable&quot;. One EU committee report noted that up to 1998, there was only a small number of scientific studies on the welfare of birds used for foie gras production; however, the Committee found sufficient evidence to conclude that &quot;force-feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds&quot;. The industry repeatedly faces accusations of torture and cruelty.

===Suitability of breeds and species===
The production of foie gras occurs on the argument that migrating wildfowl seasonally eat such that their liver naturally enlarges. However, the bird used predominantly in foie gras production is a hybrid of a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck. It has been noted that the Muscovy duck is non-migratory, and both the Pekin and the mulard hybrid cannot fly. Domestic ducks (including the Pekin) are derived from the mallard duck, which is sometimes migratory and sometimes not. Therefore, although the domestic goose might be adapted to store food before migration, it is less likely that the Mulard hybrid duck has the same potential.

===Force-feeding procedure===

====Fear====
Geese and ducks show avoidance behaviour (indicating aversion) toward the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure. The AVMA (Animal Welfare Division) when considering foie gras production stated &quot;The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems to be more prone than its parent breeds to fear of people&quot;. Although in 1998 the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare reported seeing this aversion, they noted that at the time, there was no &quot;conclusive&quot; scientific evidence on the aversive nature of force-feeding.

====Injury====
That same EU Scientific Committee also reported that there was usually clear evidence of tissue damage in the esophagus of birds which had been gavage fed, although one 1972 study cited by the report observed no alteration of the esophageal tissue. More recent scientific studies have shown that the esophagus of birds can be injured or inflamed by gavage feeding.

====Stress====
After measuring a range of physiological parameters in male Mulard ducks, it was concluded in one study that the acute stress caused by force-feeding is similar at the beginning and end of the commercial production of foie gras. A similar study on Muscovy ducks found that gavage feeding was related to an increase in panting behaviour and serum corticosterone levels, indicating increased stress attributable to this feeding method.

===Housing and husbandry===
In France, at the end of 2015, individual cages were prohibited to improve animal welfare. They were to be replaced by cages housing 4 to 5 birds.

====Behavioural restriction====
During the force-feeding period, the birds are kept in individual cages with wire or plastic mesh floors or sometimes in small groups on slatted floors. Individual caging restricts movements and behaviours by preventing the birds from standing erect, turning around, or flapping their wings. Birds cannot carry out other natural waterfowl behaviours, such as bathing and swimming. Ducks and geese are social animals, and individual cages prevent such interactions. According to a 2023 European food safety authority (EFSA) report, even the collective cages and pens currently in use in Europe do not offer enough space to the birds for them to express their natural behaviour.

During the force-feeding period, when the birds are not being fed, they are sometimes kept in near-darkness; this prevents normal investigatory behaviour and results in poor welfare.

====Injury====
Lesions can occur on the sternum of the birds due to necrosis of the skin. This is observed more frequently in birds reared in cages rather than on the floor. The prevalence is higher in Mulard ducks (40–70%) compared to under 6% in Muscovy ducks. This is due to the larger pectoralis profundus major and minor muscles in Muscovy ducks compared to Mulards. The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems more prone to developing lesions in the area of the sternum when kept in small cages and to bone breakage during transport and slaughter.

Where ducks are fattened in group pens, it has been suggested that the increased effort required to capture and restrain ducks in pens might cause them to experience more stress during force-feeding. Injuries and fatalities during transport and slaughter occur in all types of poultry production; fattened ducks are more susceptible to conditions such as heat stress.

===Enlarged liver===
Foie gras production results in the bird&#x27;s liver being swollen. In some ducks, liver size changes seasonally, increasing by as much as 30% to 50%, with more pronounced changes in females. However, foie gras production enlarges the livers ten times their normal size. This impairs liver function due to the obstruction of blood flow and expands the abdomen, making it difficult for the birds to breathe. Death occurs if the force-feeding is continued.

===Mortality rates===
The mortality rate in force-fed birds varies from 2% to 4%, compared with approximately 0.2% in age-matched, non-force-fed drakes. Mortality rates do not differ between the force-feeding period and the previous rearing phase, with both being approximately 2.5%.

==Controversy==
The controversial nature of foie gras production was identified in a paper that juxtaposed the views of &quot;foie gras production as the apotheosis of murderous meat production, and those who consider it to be a co-production between humans and animals&quot;.

Animal rights and welfare advocates such as Animal Equality, PETA, Viva!, the Humane Society of the United States, and FOUR PAWS contend that foie gras production methods, and force-feeding in particular, constitute cruel treatment of animals.

An Ipsos MORI poll found that 63% of the UK population would like to see a complete ban on the sale of foie gras in the UK.

In 2011 and 2012, Animal Equality conducted investigations inside four foie gras farms in France and five in Spain, exposing the cruelty of force-feeding. The footage collected reveals ducks covered in blood with broken and torn beaks, birds kept in small metal cages with no room to turn around, and ducks and geese desperately struggling to avoid force-feeding.

In April–May 2013, an investigator from Mercy for Animals recorded an undercover video at Hudson Valley Foie Gras farm in New York state. The footage showed workers forcefully pushing tubes down ducks&#x27; throats. One worker said of the force-feeding process: &quot;Sometimes the duck doesn&#x27;t get up, and it dies. There have been times that 20 ducks were killed.&quot; Hudson Valley operations manager Marcus Henley replied that the farm&#x27;s mortality statistics are not above average for the poultry industry. Because Hudson Valley provides foie gras to Amazon.com, Mercy for Animals began a campaign urging Amazon to stop selling foie gras, a move that has already been made by Costco, Safeway, and Target.

In November 2013, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published a report based on the video they obtained depicting cruelty towards ducks in a farm owned by French firm Ernest Soulard, which is a supplier to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s restaurants. The restaurant chain suspended purchasing from the supplier following the exposé.

===Animal research===
The process of force-feeding can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption of which has been found to induce amyloidosis in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too, and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.

===Legislation and bans===
Several countries and regions have laws against force-feeding or the sale or importation of foie gras; even where it is legal, some retailers have ceased selling it.

In Switzerland, foie gras production has been prohibited since 1978 and force-feeding is explicitly banned since 2008.

In Europe, force-feeding is only legal in 5 of the 27 member states: France, Belgium, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain. In 2017, foie gras production was banned in Brussels, a largely symbolic measure because of the small number of producers within the city limits.

In 2019, New York City instituted a foie gras ban but was struck down in 2022 by an order from the New York&#x27;s Agriculture and Markets Department stating in the order that the ban was &quot;unusual&quot;, &quot;unreasonabl[e]&quot;, and &quot;legislative overreach&quot;.

In November 2022, the Buckingham Palace household wrote to the PETA campaign group that foie gras was not bought or served in royal residences. &quot;There will be no foie gras served in royal residences&quot;, a letter from Buckingham Palace to animal rights campaigners confirmed.

Force-feeding is also prohibited in Israel, Turkey and Australia. Foie gras import is prohibited in India. Foie gras production and sale is prohibited in California.
