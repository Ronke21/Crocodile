<text>Mahmoud Abbas (; born 15 November 1935), also known by the kunya Abu Mazen (, ), is a Palestinian politician who has been serving as the second president of the State of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) since 2005. He has been the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) since 2004, PNA president since January 2005, and State of Palestine president since May 2005. Abbas is also a member of the Fatah party and was elected chairman in 2009.

Abbas was elected on 9 January 2005 to serve as President of the Palestinian National Authority until 15 January 2009, but extended his term until the next election in 2010, citing the PLO constitution, and on 16 December 2009 was voted into office indefinitely by the PLO Central Council. As a result, Fatah&#x27;s main rival, Hamas, initially announced that it would not recognize the extension or view Abbas as the rightful president. Nonetheless, Abbas is internationally recognized in his position(s) and Hamas and Fatah conducted numerous negotiations in the following years, leading to an agreement in April 2014 for a Unity Government (which lasted until October 2016) and to the recognition of his office by Hamas. Abbas was also chosen as the president of the State of Palestine by the PLO Central Council on 23 November 2008, a position he had held unofficially since 8 May 2005.

Abbas served as the first prime minister of the Palestinian Authority from March to September 2003. Before being named prime minister, Abbas led the PLO Negotiations Affairs Department. Abbas has been subject to both criticism and controversy, having been accused of corruption, as well as distorting Jewish history and engaging in Holocaust denial. Abbas was a key player in negotiations for peace and in talks laying the groundwork for the Israel-Palestine two-state solution.

==Early and personal life==

Mahmoud Rida Abbas was born on 15 November 1935 in Safed, in the Galilee region of Mandatory Palestine (now Israel). His family fled to Syria during the 1948 Palestine war. Before going to Egypt, Abbas graduated from the University of Damascus, where he studied law.

Abbas later entered graduate studies at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, where he earned a Candidate of Sciences degree (the Soviet equivalent of a PhD). His doctoral dissertation was &quot;The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism&quot;.

He is married to Amina Abbas, and together they had three sons. The eldest, Mazen Abbas, ran a building company in Doha and died in Qatar of a heart attack in 2002 at the age of 42. The kunya of Abu Mazen means &quot;father of Mazen.&quot; Their second son is Yasser Abbas, a Canadian businessman who was named after former PA leader Yasser Arafat. The youngest son is Tareq, a business executive. Abbas has eight grandchildren, six of whom are part of the Seeds of Peace initiative bringing them in touch with young Israelis.

==Political activism and career==
In the mid-1950s, Abbas became heavily involved in underground Palestinian politics, joining a number of exiled Palestinians in Qatar, where he was Director of Personnel in the emirate&#x27;s Civil Service. While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States.

According to Abu Daoud, part of the funds raised by Abbas were used, without the latter&#x27;s knowledge, to implement the 1972 Munich massacre. He was among the first members of Fatah to call for talks with moderate Israelis, doing so in 1977. In a 2012 interview, he recalled, &quot;[...] because we took up arms, we were in a position to put them down with credibility.&quot;

In 1977, Abbas called for the repatriation of Arab Jews to their countries of origin, receiving the approval of Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, and Sudan.

Abbas has performed diplomatic duties, presenting a moderating contrast to the PLO&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary&quot; policies. Abbas was the first PLO official to visit Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War in January 1993 to mend fences with the Gulf countries after the PLO&#x27;s support of Iraq during the Persian Gulf War strained relations. In the Oslo I Accord, Abbas was the signatory for the PLO on 13 September 1993. He published a memoir, &quot;Through Secret Channels: The Road to Oslo&quot; (1995).

In 1995, he and Israeli negotiator Yossi Beilin wrote the Beilin–Abu Mazen agreement, which was meant to be the framework for a future Israeli–Palestinian peace deal.

It emerged in September 2016 that Abbas may have once worked for the KGB, as early as 1985 in Damascus, according to a document uncovered in the Mitrokhin Archive, where he is registered as agent &quot;Krotov&quot;. Palestinian officials replied that at the time in question, the PLO collaborated with Moscow, and that Abbas was their liaison man in the Palestinian-Soviet friendship foundation.

===Prime minister===

By early 2003, as Israel and the United States refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat, it was thought that Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas&#x27;s reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of Abbas as a Quisling.

A struggle for power between Arafat and Abbas ensued. Abbas&#x27;s term as prime minister was characterised by numerous conflicts between him and Arafat over the distribution of power. The United States and Israel accused Arafat of undermining Abbas and his government. Abbas hinted he would resign if not given more control over the administration. In early September 2003, he confronted the Palestinian parliament over this issue.

Abbas came into conflict with Palestinian militant groups, notably the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement and Hamas because his pragmatic policies were opposed to their hard-line approach. Initially, he pledged not to use force against the militants in the interest of avoiding a civil war, and attempted negotiation. This was partially successful, resulting in a pledge from the two groups to honor a unilateral Palestinian cease-fire. However, continuing violence and Israeli &quot;targeted killings&quot; of known leaders forced Abbas to pledge a crackdown in order to uphold the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s side of the Road map for peace. This led to a power struggle with Arafat over control of the Palestinian Security Services; Arafat refused to release control to Abbas, thus preventing him from using them on the militants. Abbas resigned as prime minister on 6 September 2003, citing lack of support from Israel and the United States as well as &quot;internal incitement&quot; against his government.

===2005 presidential election===
After Yasser Arafat&#x27;s death, Abbas was seen, at least by Fatah, as his natural successor. On 25 November 2004, Abbas was endorsed by Fatah&#x27;s Revolutionary Council as its preferred candidate for the presidential election, scheduled for 9 January 2005. On 14 December, Abbas called for an end to violence in the Second Intifada and a return to peaceful resistance. Abbas told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that &quot;the use of arms has been damaging and should end.&quot; However, he refused, or was not able, to disarm Palestinian militants and use force against groups designated as terrorist organisations.

With Israeli forces arresting and restricting the movement of other candidates, Hamas&#x27;s boycott of the election, and his campaign being given 94% of the Palestinian electoral campaign coverage on TV, Abbas&#x27;s election was virtually ensured, and on 9 January Abbas was elected with 63% of the vote as President of the Palestinian National Authority.

In his speech, he addressed a crowd of supporters chanting &quot;a million shahids&quot;, stating: &quot;I present this victory to the soul of Yasser Arafat and present it to our people, to our martyrs and to 11,000 prisoners&quot;. He also called for Palestinian groups to end the use of arms against Israelis.

===Presidency and PLO leadership===
Despite Abbas&#x27;s call for a peaceful solution, attacks by militant groups continued after his election, in a direct challenge to his authority. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine launched a raid in Gaza on 12 January 2005, that killed one and wounded three Israeli military personnel. On 13 January, Palestinians from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, Hamas, and the Popular Resistance Committees launched a suicide attack on the Karni crossing, killing six Israelis. As a result, Israel shut down the damaged terminal and broke off relations with Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, stating that Abbas must now show a gesture of peace by attempting to stop such attacks. Abbas was formally sworn in as the President of the Palestinian National Authority in a ceremony held on 15 January, in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

In February 2005, Abbas met with Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon at the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit to end the Second Intifada, and they both reaffirmed their commitment to the Roadmap for peace process. Sharon also agreed to release 900 Palestinian prisoners of the 7,500 being held at the time, and to withdraw from West Bank towns.

On 9 August 2005, Abbas announced that legislative elections, originally scheduled for 17 July 2005, would take place in January 2006. On 20 August, he set the elections for 25 January. On 15 January 2006, Abbas declared that, despite unrest in Gaza, he would not change the election date, unless Israel were to prevent Palestinians in East Jerusalem from voting. The elections took place on 25 January 2006, and resulted in a decisive Hamas victory.

In January 2006, in the context of Fatah&#x27;s election loss and Hamas&#x27; presumed future one party government, Abbas said that he would not run for office again at the end of his term. However, following international sanctions against a Hamas one party government, political and military conflicts between Hamas and Fatah, and the division of the country, which made new elections impossible, Abbas stayed president after the expiration of his four-year term on 15 January 2009. He extended his term for another year, using another interpretation of the Basic Law and the Election Law, so he could align the next presidential and parliamentary elections. Pointing to the Palestinian constitution, Hamas disputed the validity of this move, and considered Abbas&#x27;s term to have ended, in which case Abdel Aziz Duwaik, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, would have become acting president.

In December 2009, the leadership of the Palestinian Central Council announced an indefinite extension of Abbas&#x27;s term as president. Since then, Abbas has remained president of the Fatah-controlled areas of the Palestinian territories. In April 2014, Hamas withdrew its objection, in order to form a Unity Government with Fatah.

Abbas has supported the blockade of the Gaza Strip as a means of weakening Hamas. In 2010, Abbas declared that he opposed lifting the Israeli naval blockade of the Gaza Strip because this would bolster Hamas. Egypt also supported this position. In 2014 and subsequent years, Abbas supported Egypt&#x27;s crackdown on smuggling tunnels and welcomed the flooding of the tunnels by Egypt in coordination with the PA. In 2016, Abbas objected to the entrance of Qatari fuel to the Gaza electricity plant via Israel, because his PA would be unable to collect taxes on the fuel.

In December 2014, Abbas signed an application for Palestine to join the International Criminal Court, just one day after the UN Security Council voted against a resolution demanding the end of Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and statehood for Palestine by 2017. The threat of joining the ICC and suing Israel for war crimes had been considered by Palestinian officials for years prior, but the move was seen as a diplomatic &quot;last resort.&quot; The decision came as Abbas&#x27;s administration dealt with allegations of corruption and mismanagement, potential political challenges from rival parties and other Fatah members, and low approval ratings.
In August 2015, Abbas announced his resignation as chairman of the executive committee of the PLO, and subsequently called for an emergency meeting of the PNC to hold an election. The announcement drew criticisms and speculation as to his motives. His proposed special session of the PNC was postponed indefinitely, and he remains acting chairman of the PLC as of October 2023.

In 2021, local elections in Palestine were held amidst a rift between Abbas and Hamas. This was after he had indefinitely postponed the presidential election and parliamentary elections.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Abbas rejected &quot;practices of killing civilians or abusing them on both sides because they contravene morals, religion and international law.&quot; He called for the &quot;release of civilians, prisoners and detainees&quot; and expressed concern about the consequences of Israel&#x27;s total blockade of the Gaza Strip. Abbas declared three days of mourning following the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion and canceled a planned meeting with U.S. president Joe Biden. In February 2024, he called the Al-Rashid humanitarian aid incident an &quot;ugly massacre&quot; that was perpetrated by the &quot;Israeli occupation army.&quot; 

==Political relations==

===With Israel===
In January 2005, Israeli radio reported that Abbas had secured a thirty-day ceasefire from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. On 12 February, lone Palestinians attacked Israel settlements and Abbas quickly fired some of his security officers for not stopping the attacks during the ceasefire.

In April 2005, Abbas said that the killing of three Palestinians in southern Gaza by Israeli soldiers was a deliberate violation of the declared ceasefire deal. &quot;This violation is made on purpose,&quot; Abbas said in a written statement sent to reporters in the West Bank capital of Ramallah. Abbas made the statement shortly after three Palestinian teenage boys were shot dead by Israeli troops in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Israel claimed they thought the boys were attempting to smuggle weapons, while Palestinians claimed a group of boys were playing soccer and three of them went to retrieve the ball near the border fence.

In July 2005, he announced that he would move his office to Gaza until the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops in order to coordinate the Palestinian side of the withdrawal, mediating between the different factions.

In March 2008, Abbas stated he was suspending peace talks with Israel, while Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert vowed to press on with military operations against militants who have been launching home-made rockets into southern Israel.

In May 2008 Abbas said he would resign from his office if the current round of peace talks had not yielded an agreement in principle &quot;within six months&quot;. He also said that the current negotiations were, in effect, deadlocked: &quot;So far, we have not reached an agreement on any issue. Any report indicating otherwise is simply not true.&quot;

Abbas has since confirmed that he turned down an Israeli offer for a Palestinian state on nearly 95% of the West Bank. In September 2008, Olmert had presented him with a map that delineated the borders of the proposed PA state, for which Israel would annex 6.3 percent of the West Bank and compensate the Palestinians with 5.8 percent (taken from pre-1967 Israel), which Abbas stated he rejected out of hand, insisting instead to demarcate the 4 June 1967 borders of Palestine. He said that Olmert did not give a map of the proposal and that he could not sign without seeing the proposal. Abbas also said that he was not an expert on maps and pointed to Olmert&#x27;s corruption investigation (he was later convicted). Abbas said in October 2011 that he made a counteroffer to let Israel annex 1.9% of the West Bank.

In 2012, Abbas floated the idea of accepting a two-state solution which outlined Palestine as existing within the 1967 borders with a capital in East Jerusalem. In an interview with Israeli Channel 2 TV, Abbas said, &quot;It is my right to see [the Israeli city of Safed], but not to live there.&quot; The negative reaction to these words forced Abbas to backpedal.

According to an International Crisis Group report, most Israeli officials &quot;do not see [Abbas] as a peace partner but consider [him] a nonthreatening, violence-abhorring, strategic asset.&quot;

In June 2016, Abbas repeated to the European Parliament a false press report that rabbis in Israel were calling for Palestinian wells to be poisoned. Abbas retracted the statement the following day, acknowledging that the claim was not true and stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t intend to do harm to Judaism or to offend Jewish people around the world&quot;. Israel&#x27;s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Abbas&#x27;s statement spread a &quot;blood libel&quot;.

===With Hamas===
In May 2006, Abbas gave Hamas a ten-day deadline to accept the 1967 ceasefire lines.

In December 2006, Abbas called for new legislative elections, to bring an end to the parliamentary stalemate between Fatah and Hamas in forming a national coalition government.

In March 2007, a unity government was formed incorporating members of both Hamas and Fatah, with Ismail Haniyeh as prime minister and independent politicians taking many key portfolios.

In June 2007, Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led unity government of Haniyeh, declared a state of emergency, and appointed Salam Fayyad in his place. This followed action by Hamas armed forces to take control of Palestinian Authority positions controlled by Fatah militias. The appointment of Fayyad to replace Haniyeh has been challenged as illegal, because under the Palestinian Basic Law, the president may dismiss a sitting prime minister, but may not appoint a replacement without the approval of the Palestinian Legislative Council. According to the law, until a new prime minister is thus appointed, the outgoing prime minister heads a caretaker government. Fayyad&#x27;s appointment was never placed before, or approved by the Legislative Council. For this reason, Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister has continued to operate in Gaza, and is recognised by a large number of Palestinians as the legitimate acting prime minister. Anis al-Qasem, a constitutional lawyer who drafted the Basic Law, is among those who publicly declared Abbas&#x27;s appointment of Fayyad to be illegal.

In June 2007, the European Union promised to resume direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, and Abbas dissolved the National Security Council, a sticking point in the defunct unity government with Hamas. That same day, the United States decided to end its fifteen-month embargo on the Palestinian Authority and resume aid, attempting to strengthen Abbas&#x27;s West Bank government. A day later, the Fatah Central Committee cut off all ties and dialogue with Hamas, pending the return of Gaza.

In July 2023, Abbas met with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Behind the meeting was Turkey&#x27;s effort to reconcile Fatah with Hamas.

===With foreign leaders===
In May 2009, he welcomed Pope Benedict XVI to the West Bank, who supported Abbas&#x27;s goal of a Palestinian State. Also in May 2009, Abbas made a visit to Canada, where he met with foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The same year Abbas visited Venezuela and met Hugo Chávez.

In February 2010, Abbas visited Japan for the third time as Palestinian president. In this visit he met Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. He also visited Hiroshima, the first such visit by a Palestinian leader, and spoke about the suffering of Hiroshima, which he compared to the suffering of the Palestinians.

In July 2012, Abbas accused former U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice of fabricating a conversation between them and denied such a conversation took place. The specific quote he denied was, &quot;I can&#x27;t tell four million Palestinians only five thousand of them can go home,&quot; regarding the issue of Palestinian refugees. Abbas further said, &quot;I&#x27;m not calling her a liar... I am saying we never had that conversation.&quot; In response, Rice denied that she fabricated it. Her chief of staff, Georgia Godfrey, wrote, &quot;Dr. Rice stands by her account of the conversation and what she wrote in her book.&quot;

In January 2019, Abbas accepted the chairmanship of the United Nations&#x27; Group of 77, a coalition of 134 mainly developing nations and China, on behalf of Palestine, which is a non-member observer state of the UN. He was handed the gavel by Egypt&#x27;s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, the outgoing chairman.

Abbas made a state visit to China in 2023, and held talks with President Xi Jinping and met with Premier Li Keqiang.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Corruption allegations===
Citing the 2012 corruption report by the Coalition for Accountability and Integrity, &quot;Al-Monitor&quot; characterized corruption in the Palestinian Authority as being &quot;still rampant inside public Palestinian institutions despite the progress during the past year&quot;.

In 2003, CBS News reported that Yasser Arafat, Abbas&#x27;s mentor and predecessor, had diverted nearly $1 billion in public funds to &quot;insure his political survival&quot;. In a 2006 report, the Congressional Research Service characterised the Palestinian public&#x27;s dissatisfaction with institutional corruption as a factor that contributed to a win by Hamas in the January 2006 parliamentary election. It noted that Fatah leaders had been accused of siphoning funds from ministry budgets, passing out patronage jobs, accepting favors and gifts from suppliers and contractors.

The source for specific allegations against Abbas was one of Arafat&#x27;s most trusted aides, Mohammed Rashid, accused by the PA of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars, who threatened to expose corruption scandals in the Palestinian Authority. For many years, Rashid served as Arafat&#x27;s financial advisor and was given a free hand to handle hundreds of millions of dollars that were poured on the Palestinian Authority and the PLO by the US, the EU and Arab donors. According to Rashid, Abbas&#x27;s net worth was  million.

On 10 July 2012, Abbas and his sons were attacked, in the US Congress, for their alleged corruption. The debate was entitled &quot;Chronic Kleptocracy: Corruption Within the Palestinian Political Establishment.&quot; In his testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Middle East and South Asia, Elliott Abrams stated that &quot;Corruption is an insidious destroyer not only of Palestinian public finance but of faith in the entire political system. And it has certainly had an impact on potential donors. I can tell you from my own experience, as an American official seeking financial assistance for the PA from Gulf Arab governments, that I was often told &#x27;why should we give them money when their officials will just steal it?&#x27;&quot;

The conspicuous wealth of Abbas&#x27;s own sons, Yasser and Tarek, has been noted in Palestinian society since at least 2009, when Reuters first published a series of articles tying the sons to several business deals, including a few that had U.S. taxpayer support. In a &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article, author Jonathan Schanzer suggested four ways in which the Abbas family has become rich. They include monopolies on American-made cigarettes sold in the territories; USAID funding; public works projects, such as road and school construction, on behalf of the Palestinian Authority; and special preferences for retail enterprises. It was strongly implied that the sons&#x27; lineage was the main credential in receiving these contracts.

One of his sons, Yasser Abbas (but not brother Tarek or father Mahmoud), filed a  million libel lawsuit in the United States District Court, District of Columbia, in September 2012 against Foreign Policy Group LLC and Schanzer alleging &quot;false and defamatory statements. It seems every statement will be challenged, in a jury trial, if the court accepts jurisdiction.&quot; Abbas also accused Schanzer of not contacting him for comment and of relying on untrustworthy sources of information. Abbas accused Schanzer of acting with malice and pursuing an agenda against the brothers, even though he also contended that he&#x27;s a private citizen and not a public figure, so we wouldn&#x27;t need to prove actual malice to win.

Some analysts believed the Abbas family would not proceed with the case as it would allow &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; and Schanzer to dig in too deep into the PA&#x27;s secret finances and records. However, the case proceeded.

In September 2013, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan dismissed the suit using D.C.&#x27;s anti-SLAPP measure. Sullivan determined the lawsuit intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandoned their criticisms or opposition. The decision has been appealed.

As part of the 2016 Panama Papers data leak, it was revealed that Abbas&#x27;s son Tareq Abbas holds million in shares of an offshore company associated with the Palestinian Authority.

In June 2021, hundreds of Palestinians held protests against the Abbas administration&#x27;s corruption and brutality in central Ramallah (including one held at the president&#x27;s headquarters) after anti-corruption activist Nizar Banat died in government custody.

One of the common claims made by detractors against his government is that it works effectively as a subcontractor for the Israeli government; in spite of his strong verbal criticism of the Israeli government, there is widespread disdain for his administration within the Palestinian Authority.

===Published works and statements about the Holocaust===

&quot;The Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement 1933–1945&quot; is the title of Abbas&#x27;s CandSc thesis, which was completed in 1982 at the Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia, and defended at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.The dissertation and book discussed topics such as the Haavara Agreement, in which the Jewish Agency signed a pact with Nazi Germany to facilitate Jewish emigration to Palestine. Some content of his thesis has been considered as Holocaust denial by some Jewish groups, especially where he disputed the accepted number of Jews murdered in the Holocaust and claimed Zionist agitation had been the cause of the Holocaust.

In 1984, he published a book titled &quot;The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Al-Wajh al-Ākhar: Al-&#x27;Alāqat aL-Sirriyya bayn al-Nāzīyya wa al-Sahyūniyya&quot;) based on the dissertation. In the book Abbas dismissed as a &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;fantastic lie&quot; that six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, writing that the real figure was at most &quot;890,000&quot; or &quot;a few hundred thousand&quot;. The number of such deaths, he claimed, had been exaggerated for political purposes, writing &quot;it seems that the interest of the Zionist movement ... is to inflate this figure so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism. Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions—fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand.&quot; When asked about this assertion in his book, Abbas replied some 10 years later that he had written the book when the Palestinians were at war with Israel, adding that &quot;today I would not have made such remarks.&quot; In a March 2006 interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Abbas stated:
I wrote in detail about the Holocaust and said I did not want to discuss numbers. I quoted an argument between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12 million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.

In August 2022, during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, Abbas was asked by an attending journalist if he would apologize for the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Palestinian terrorists. He responded that &quot;If we want to go over the past, go ahead. I have 50 slaughters that Israel committed… 50 massacres, 50 slaughters, 50 holocausts.&quot; In an interview afterwards with the &quot;Bild&quot; tabloid, Scholz condemned Abbas&#x27;s statements as a trivialization of the Holocaust. The remarks were also condemned by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Following an offense report for &quot;relativizing the Shoah&quot;, in Berlin a criminal investigation was opened by police to determine if Abbas is guilty of Volksverhetzung. The investigation was closed because Abbas enjoys diplomatic immunity.

In August 2023, during a speech to the Fatah Revolutionary Council, Abbas claimed that Hitler killed Jews because of their &quot;social role&quot; as moneylenders, rather than out of antisemitism, and that Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of Khazars. His comments were condemned by the United States, European Union, France, and Germany, while Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo rescinded Abbas&#x27;s Medal of the City of Paris in response.

==Public image==
In 2012 and 2014, Abbas&#x27; approval ratings peaked at 64%. Since then, his ratings slowly declined. In 2017, Abbas&#x27; approval ratings was 45%, before eventually rising to 50% in 2018. From 2019 onwards, his ratings started to decline again and by 2021, nearly 80% of Palestinians wanted Abbas to resign.

In 2022, Abbas&#x27; approval ratings were at 40% before falling to 32% in 2023. According to a poll released that same year, nearly 90% of Palestinians wanted Abbas to resign as support for Hamas grew. In 2024, Abbas&#x27; ratings hit an all time low of 29%, with 59% of Palestinians disapproving of him.

<text>Gonorynchus is a genus of long thin gonorynchiform ray-finned fish, commonly called beaked salmon or beaked sandfish. They live on sandy bottoms near shorelines of the temperate &amp; subtropical Southern Hemisphere and East Asia. There are five known extant species which are placed in this genus. All have a distinctive angular snout (hence the name) that the fish use to dig themselves into the sand. A swim bladder is absent.

They are the last surviving members of the ancient family Gonorynchidae, which was much more diverse in the past. Unlike other gonorynchids, there have been no known fossil remains of &quot;Gonorynchus&quot; identified, although they are assumed to have diverged from their closest relative (the extinct &quot;Notogoneus&quot;) during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous.

The most widespread species is &quot;Gonorynchus gonorynchus&quot;, found in scattered locations worldwide. It can reach up to in length. It is a nocturnal fish, feeding on invertebrates at night and burrowing into sand or mud during the day.

Beaked salmon are fished commercially in some areas. The flesh of &quot;Gonorynchus greyi&quot;, found around Australia and New Zealand, is reported to be &quot;firm and of good flavour&quot;.

<text>Gonorynchidae is a family of ray-finned fish in the order Gonorynchiformes, which has a number of fossil taxa and one extant genus, &quot;Gonorynchus&quot;, the beaked salmons. They are an ancient group, with fossils known from as far back as the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous.

It is to be noted that Richardson is the original author of the family.

==Taxonomy==

The following genera are known:

* †&quot;Charitopsis&quot; 
* †&quot;Charitosomus&quot; 
* †&quot;Gonorynchidarum&quot; [otolith]
* &quot;Gonorynchus&quot; - beaked salmons
* †&quot;Hakeliosomus&quot; (possibly synonymous with &quot;Ramallichthys&quot;)
* †&quot;Judeichthys&quot; (possibly synonymous with &quot;Ramallichthys&quot;)
* †&quot;Lecceichthys&quot; 
* †&quot;Notogoneus&quot; (=†&quot;Anormurus&quot; , †&quot;Protocatostomus&quot; )
* †&quot;Sapperichthys&quot; 
* †&quot;Ramallichthys&quot; 
An indeterminate gonorynchid (previously classified in &quot;Charitosomus&quot;) is known from fossil remains from the late Albian or early-mid Cenomanian Kwango Group of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<doc id="232599" wikidata="Q2123570" url="?curid=232599" title="1950s quiz show scandals">
<text>The 1950s quiz show scandals were a series of scandals involving the producers and contestants of several popular American television quiz shows. These shows&#x27; producers secretly gave assistance to certain contestants in order to prearrange the shows&#x27; outcomes while still attempting to deceive the public into believing that these shows were objective and fair competitions. Producers fixed the shows sometimes with the free consent of contestants and out of various motives: improving ratings, greed, and the lack of regulations prohibiting such conspiracy in game show productions.

The scandals took place at a time when television was still emerging as a medium and had yet to become the established cultural force in American society that it is today. When the behavior of the producers and contestants was exposed, the public reacted with shock. Many expressed concern about the potential for the young medium of television to harm society.

In response to the scandals, the government was widely pressured to impose stricter regulations on broadcasters. As a direct consequence, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit networks from prearranging the outcomes of quiz shows. In the United States, it has since become standard industry practice for game show producers to monitor their own shows closely for cheating and to ensure fairness in play and compliance with broadcasting law to the highest degree possible.

==Summary==
The popularity of radio quiz shows between 1938 and 1956 led to the creation of television quiz shows. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that radio and television quiz shows could give prizes to contestants, provided the contestants did not contribute any of their own money.

In September 1956, the game show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, hosted by Jack Barry, premiered on NBC, its first show being played legitimately with no manipulation of the game by the producers at all. That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer Dan Enright, &quot;a dismal failure&quot;, as the two contestants were so lacking in the required knowledge that they answered a large number of the questions incorrectly. Show sponsor Geritol, upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results and said in no uncertain terms that they did not want to see a repeat performance.

Three months into its run, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; featured a contestant, Herb Stempel, who had been coached by Enright to allow his opponent, Charles Van Doren, to win the game. Stempel took the fall as requested. A year later, Stempel told the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;″s Jack O&#x27;Brian that his winning run as champion on the series had been choreographed to his advantage, and that the show&#x27;s producer then ordered him to purposely lose his championship to Van Doren. With no proof, an article was never printed.

Stempel&#x27;s statements gained more credibility when fixing in another game, &quot;Dotto,&quot; was publicized in August 1958. Quiz show ratings across the networks plummeted and several were cancelled amid allegations of fixing. The revelations were sufficient to initiate a nine-month-long New York County grand jury. Although contest-rigging was not a criminal offense, several producers and dozens of contestants chose, rather than publicly admit they were frauds, to perjure themselves before the grand jury by denying they participated in fixing the shows. No indictments were handed down, but, in an unusual move, the judge ordered the findings and testimony sealed. This aroused public suspicion that corruption was involved, which in turn attracted the attention of the US Congress. A formal congressional subcommittee investigation began in August 1959. The producers and contestants did not dare to perjure themselves before Congress. Enright was revealed to have rigged &quot;Twenty-One&quot;; Van Doren also eventually came forth with revelations about how he was persuaded to accept specific answers during his time on the show.

In 1960, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the fixing of quiz shows. As a result of that action, many networks canceled their existing quiz shows and replaced them—at the prodding of incoming FCC commissioner Newton Minow—with a higher number of public service programs.

==Integrity questioned (1957–1958)==
=== &quot;Twenty-One&quot; ===
In late 1956, Herb Stempel, a contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, was coached by Enright. While Stempel was in the midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows (&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot;) were in the top-ten rated programs but &quot;Twenty-One&quot; did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner, Albert Freedman, were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren, an English teacher at Columbia University. Van Doren decided to try out for the NBC quiz show &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough.&quot; Enright, who produced both &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; and &quot;Twenty-One,&quot; saw his tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be perfect as the new face of &quot;Twenty-One.&quot;

After achieving winnings of $69,500, Stempel&#x27;s scripted loss to the more popular Van Doren occurred on December 5, 1956. One of the questions Stempel answered incorrectly involved the winner of the 1955 Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. The correct answer was &quot;Marty,&quot; one of Stempel&#x27;s favorite movies. As instructed by Enright, however, he gave the incorrect answer &quot;On the Waterfront,&quot; which had won the previous year. Although the manipulation of the contestants helped the producers maintain viewer interest and ratings, the producers had not anticipated the extent of Stempel&#x27;s resentment at being required to lose the contest against Van Doren.

Another former contestant, James Snodgrass, made lists of all the questions and answers on which he was coached and mailed them to his own home in a series of registered letters before his games aired. The dates on these letters served as indisputable proof that the show had been rigged, and Snodgrass testified before Congress on this matter in 1959.

=== &quot;The Big Surprise&quot; ===
In December 1956, Dale Logue, a contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Surprise&quot;, filed a lawsuit against the show&#x27;s production company, Entertainment Productions, Inc., seeking either $103,000 in damages or reinstatement on the show as a contestant. Her claim was that, after being asked a question she did not know in a &quot;warm-up&quot; session, that she was asked the same question again during the televised show. Her assertion was that this was done intentionally with the express purpose of eliminating her as a contestant. At the time Logue&#x27;s lawsuit was filed, Steve Carlin, executive producer of Entertainment Productions, Inc., called her claim &quot;ridiculous and hopeless&quot;. Assertions that Logue had been offered $10,000 to settle in January 1957 were called baseless. Charles Revson, head of Revlon and &quot;The Big Surprise&#x27;s&quot; primary sponsor, asked the producers if Logue&#x27;s accusation was true, and was told that it was not.

In April 1957, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article detailing the depths to which producers managed game shows, just short of involving the contestants themselves. This was followed by the August 20, 1957, &quot;Look&quot; magazine article &quot;Are TV Quiz Shows Fixed?&quot;, which concluded &quot;it may be more accurate to say they are controlled or partially controlled.&quot;

=== &quot;Dotto&quot; ===
In August 1958, Stempel and Logue&#x27;s credibility was bolstered when Edward Hilgemeier, Jr, a stand-by contestant on &quot;Dotto&quot; three months earlier, sent an affidavit to the FCC claiming that while backstage, he had found a notebook on set containing the answers contestant Marie Winn was to deliver.

==Backlash==
The American public&#x27;s reaction was swift and dramatic when the fraud became public; between 87% and 95% knew about the scandals as measured by industry-sponsored polls. Through late 1958 and early 1959, quiz shows implicated by the scandal were quickly cancelled. Among them, with their last-aired dates, were:
* &quot;Dotto&quot; (August 15, 1958)
* &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot; (September 7, 1958)
* &quot;Twenty-One&quot; (October 16, 1958)
* &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; (November 2, 1958)
* &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough,&quot; primetime edition (December 29, 1958)
*&quot;For Love or Money&quot; (January 30, 1959)

In late August 1958, New York prosecutor Joseph Stone convened a grand jury to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At the time of the empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz-show success, were so afraid of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, even to the point of perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Producers who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings, but did not want to implicate themselves, their sponsors, or the networks in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down and the judge sealed the grand jury report in August 1959. In October 1959, the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight, under Representative Oren Harris&#x27;s chairmanship, began to hold hearings to investigate the scandal. Stempel, Snodgrass, and Hilgemeier all testified.

The expansion of the probe led CBS president Frank Stanton to immediately announce cancellation of three more of its large-prize quiz shows between October 16 and October 19, 1959: &quot;Top Dollar&quot;, &quot;The Big Payoff&quot;, and &quot;Name That Tune,&quot; explaining that this decision was made &quot;because of the impossibility of guarding against dishonest practice&quot;. On November 2 when Van Doren said to the Committee in a nationally televised session that, &quot;I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception. The fact that I, too, was very much deceived cannot keep me from being the principal victim of that deception, because I was its principal symbol.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Law and politics===
All of the regulations regarding television in the late 1950s were defined under the Communications Act of 1934, which dealt with the advertising, fair competition, and labeling of broadcast stations. The act and regulations written by the FCC were indefinite in regard to fixed television programs. Because no specific laws existed regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, whether the producers or contestants alike did anything illegal is debatable. Instead, one inference could be that the medium was ill-used. After concluding the Harris Commission investigation, Congress amended the Communications Act to prohibit the fixing of televised contests of intellectual knowledge or skill.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on September 13, 1960. The legislation allowed the FCC to require license renewals of less than the legally required three years if the agency believes it would be in the public interest, prohibited gifts to FCC members, and declared illegal any contest or game with intent to deceive the audience.

===Contestants===
Many quiz-show contestants&#x27; reputations were ruined, including:
* Charles Van Doren, who had become a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, lost his job in the television industry. He was also forced to resign his professorship at Columbia University. Van Doren took a job as an editor at &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and continued working as an editor and writer until his retirement in 1982. He refused requests for interviews for more than three decades and chose not to participate in the production of &quot;The Quiz Show Scandal,&quot; a 1992 one-hour documentary aired on PBS. He later turned down an offer of $100,000 to act as a consultant on the 1994 feature film &quot;Quiz Show&quot; directed by Robert Redford (on which Stempel was a consultant) after discussing the matter with family members, who, with the exception of his son John, were against his participation. In 2008, Van Doren broke his silence, describing his quiz show experience in an essay-length memoir published in &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Van Doren died on April 9, 2019. Stempel, who was his opposing contestant on &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, died a year later almost to the day.
* Teddy Nadler, whose $264,000 haul on &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot; stood as a record for two decades, resorted to applying for a temporary job with the United States Census Bureau when his prize money started running short; he failed the civil service exam. In 1970, producers exonerated Nadler, stating that they had shown him questions beforehand but that he already knew the answers and did not need them given to him. Nadler died on May 24, 1984.
* Leonard Ross, who at age 10 won a combined $164,000 on &quot;The Big Surprise&quot; and &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot;, had major mental-health issues, including depression and attention deficit disorder, which limited his ability to work as an author and attorney in adulthood; most of his work was completed by other co-authors. After an unsuccessful cingulotomy, Ross died by suicide on May 1, 1985, at age 39.

===Hosts and producers===
In September 1958, a New York grand jury called producers who had coached contestants to appear in testimony. A prosecutor on the case later estimated that of the 150 sworn witnesses before the panel, only 50 told the truth.

Other producers met the same fate as Barry and Enright but, unlike them, could not redeem themselves afterwards. One of the more notable is Frank Cooper, whose &quot;Dotto&quot; ended up being his longest-running and most popular game creation. Hosts such as Jack Narz and Hal March continued to work on television after the scandals. March died in January 1970 from lung cancer. Narz, who passed a lie-detector test at the time of the &quot;Dotto&quot; affair, had an extensive career as a game-show host after the incident (which also allowed him to help his brother, James, who later took on the name Tom Kennedy, break into the television business.) Narz died in October 2008; Kennedy died in October 2020. Sonny Fox, the original host of &quot;The $64,000 Challenge,&quot; left long before it could become tainted and became a popular children&#x27;s host in the northeast, remembered best as the host of &quot;Wonderama.&quot; (Fox later stated that his unintentional &quot;predilection for asking the answers&quot; was a factor in his decision to only rarely host game shows after the scandals.) Fox died in January 2021.

===Television===
The quiz-show scandals exhibited the necessity for stronger network control over programming and production. Quiz-show scandals also justified and accelerated the growth of the networks&#x27; power over television advertisers concerning licensing, scheduling, and sponsorship of programs. The networks claimed to be ignorant, and victims of the scandals. The NBC president at the time stated, &quot;NBC was just as much a victim of the quiz-show frauds as was the public.&quot;

The first sign of the new enforcement this came when American Safety Razor Company pulled its sponsorship of NBC&#x27;s &quot;World Championship Golf&quot; match play series in April 1960 after a December 1959 taping of the match play tournament featured Sam Snead against Mason Rudolph. With the match tied on the 12th hole, Snead discovered a 15th club in his bag in violation of the Rules of Golf, which is a loss of hole penalty for each hole the excessive club was in the bag. By rule, Rudolph won the match upon Snead&#x27;s discovery of the violation, 11 and 7. Once the match legally ended on the 12th hole, Snead admitted to staging the Rudolph win. Snead claimed it was to keep the broadcast usable after match concluded on the 12th hole because of his violation. The rule was changed in 1964 by capping the number of penalties for this violation to two, after which Snead would have been informed of the violation, changing the score automatically to Rudolph 2 up, with the seven holes remaining under the new rule, which is still in use.
A big-money quiz show did not return until ABC premiered &quot;100 Grand&quot; in 1963. It went off the air after three shows, never awarding its top prize. Quiz shows still held a stigma throughout much of the 1960s, which was eventually eased by the success of the lower-stakes and fully legitimate answer-and-question game &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; upon its launch in 1964. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; distinguished itself with a viewer-friendly format that offers &quot;accessible clues and manageable categories&quot; that the typical viewer has a realistic chance of being able to answer. The biggest winner across the 11-year original NBC run of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Burns Cameron, won only $11,100 in his playing career -- $7,070 in his five days and an additional $4,040 from his Tournament of Champions win, a full order of magnitude less than the 1950s quiz shows at their peak. Later incarnations of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; substantially raised money values and removed limits on winning streaks. Cameron was invited by Sony Pictures Television to participate in the 1990 ABC summer &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot; tournament of past champions to represent the original version against players on the contemporary version, where he was eliminated in the first round and won $5,000. Cameron, who died in June 2023, won $16,100 overall in his appearances. Under the current scoring model, Cameron&#x27;s wins would be worth $391,400 ($141,400 for his five day winnings and $250,000 for the Tournament of Champions win). The other quiz show with a sustained run during the post-scandal era of the 1960s, one with the high-difficulty questions associated with the quiz show format, was &quot;GE College Bowl&quot;, in which college students competed on behalf of their universities (and the institutional goodwill those schools provided); competing teams were limited to five appearances and all winnings were placed in a scholarship trust.

Barry and Enright eventually found a loophole in limits the networks imposed on winnings by selling shows directly into syndication, a business model the Federal Communications Commission was actively encouraging in the 1970s by way of rules such as the Prime Time Access Rule and Financial Interest and Syndication Rules. Its revival of &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; would regularly produce &quot;six to eight&quot; winners each year who netted more than the networks&#x27; limits, including one, Thom McKee, who would surpass Nadler&#x27;s winnings with a total payday of $312,700 over a 46-episode run. Barry and Enright eventually brought its winnings limits into line with the networks&#x27; so that they could sell the programs to network owned-and-operated stations.

Big money quiz shows would not enjoy widespread popularity in the United States again until the late 1990s. In 1999, ABC launched the American adaptation of the British game show franchise, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; to both enormous critical success and high ratings, such of which still remains the last overall game show as of 2025 to become the most watched annual regular series overall on U.S. television. Around the turn of 21st century, other American television networks launched similar quiz shows offering large sums of money, including Fox with &quot;Greed&quot; and NBC, who first revived &quot;Twenty-One&quot; then later adapted the British game show, &quot;The Weakest Link.&quot; In 2003, Sony Pictures Television changed the rules on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to allow players to win until they are defeated. At the end of Season 20 in July 2004, contestant Ken Jennings won over one million dollars after his thirtieth win in the first season of the rule. He won 74 games over two seasons. Three other players -- (James Holzhauer in 2019, and both Matt Amodio and Amy Schneider in 2021) -- have won over one million dollars through multiple wins. Amodio&#x27;s wins came with seven different hosts during the interregnum between Alex Trebek&#x27;s death (last episode airing January 7, 2021) and the naming of Ken Jennings as full-time host on December 15, 2023. Schneider&#x27;s wins came primarily with either Mayim Bialik (the official host) or Ken Jennings (substitute host). Amodio and Schneider later played in a Tournament of Champions, and along with Holzhauer participated in Masters specials, both featuring Jennings as host. In 2008, Sony added the Australian version&#x27;s Million Dollar wedge to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; where a player can win a huge sum by landing on the wedge and meeting a series of standards. Today, numerous high-stakes game shows and reality competition shows continue to air on broadcast American television.

<text>In a dramatic production, an ensemble cast is one that comprises many principal actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly equal amounts of screen time.

==Structure==
In contrast to the popular model, which gives precedence to a sole protagonist, an ensemble cast leans more towards a sense of &quot;collectivity and community&quot;.

===Cinema===

Ensemble casts in film were introduced as early as September 1916, with D. W. Griffith&#x27;s silent epic film &quot;Intolerance&quot;, featuring four separate though parallel plots. The film follows the lives of several characters over hundreds of years, across different cultures and time periods. The unification of different plot lines and character arcs is a key characteristic of ensemble casting in film; whether it is a location, event, or an overarching theme that ties the film and characters together.

Films that feature ensembles tend to emphasize the interconnectivity of the characters, even when the characters are strangers to one another. The interconnectivity is often shown to the audience through examples of the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; theory, and allows them to navigate through plot lines using cognitive mapping. Examples of this method, where the six degrees of separation is evident in films with an ensemble cast, are in productions such as &quot;Love Actually,&quot; &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Babel&quot;, which all have strong underlying themes interwoven within the plots that unify each film. Whodunit films also often feature interconnected characters as suspects, such as in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, &quot;Clue&quot;, and &quot;Knives Out&quot;.

&quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot; are three examples of ensemble casts in the superhero genre. Referential acting is a key factor in executing this balance, as ensemble cast members &quot;play off each other rather than off reality&quot;.

Filmmakers known for their use of ensemble casts include Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson, and Paul Thomas Anderson among others.

===Television ===
Ensemble casting also became more popular in television series because it allows flexibility for writers to focus on different characters in different episodes. In addition, the departure of players is less disruptive than would be the case with a regularly structured cast. The television series &quot;The Muppets&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; are archetypal examples of ensemble casts in American sitcoms. The science-fiction mystery drama &quot;Lost&quot; features an ensemble cast. Ensemble casts of 20 or more actors are common in soap operas, a genre that relies heavily on the character development of the ensemble. The genre also requires continuous expansion of the cast as the series progresses, with soap operas such as &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; staying on air for decades. 

An example of a success for television in ensemble casting is the Emmy Award-winning HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. The fantasy series features one of the largest ensemble casts on the small screen. The series is notorious for major character deaths, resulting in constant changes within the ensemble.

Ensemble casts are common in children&#x27;s television, with both human and non-human casts. Examples include &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Total Drama&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, and &quot;The Replacements&quot;.

<text>A decision tree is a decision support recursive partitioning structure that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.

== Overview ==

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

In decision analysis, a decision tree and the closely related influence diagram are used as a visual and analytical decision support tool, where the expected values (or expected utility) of competing alternatives are calculated.

A decision tree consists of three types of nodes:
# Decision nodes – typically represented by squares
# Chance nodes – typically represented by circles
# End nodes – typically represented by triangles

Decision trees are commonly used in operations research and operations management. If, in practice, decisions have to be taken online with no recall under incomplete knowledge, a decision tree should be paralleled by a probability model as a best choice model or online selection model algorithm. Another use of decision trees is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities.

Decision trees, influence diagrams, utility functions, and other decision analysis tools and methods are taught to undergraduate students in schools of business, health economics, and public health, and are examples of operations research or management science methods. These tools are also used to predict decisions of householders in normal and emergency scenarios.

== Decision-tree building blocks ==

=== Decision-tree elements ===
Drawn from left to right, a decision tree has only burst nodes (splitting paths) but no sink nodes (converging paths). So used manually they can grow very big and are then often hard to draw fully by hand. Traditionally, decision trees have been created manually – as the aside example shows – although increasingly, specialized software is employed.

=== Decision rules ===

The decision tree can be linearized into decision rules, where the outcome is the contents of the leaf node, and the conditions along the path form a conjunction in the if clause. In general, the rules have the form:
: &quot;if&quot; condition1 &quot;and&quot; condition2 &quot;and&quot; condition3 &quot;then&quot; outcome.

Decision rules can be generated by constructing association rules with the target variable on the right. They can also denote temporal or causal relations.

=== Decision tree using flowchart symbols ===
Commonly a decision tree is drawn using flowchart symbols as it is easier for many to read and understand. Note there is a conceptual error in the &quot;Proceed&quot; calculation of the tree shown below; the error relates to the calculation of &quot;costs&quot; awarded in a legal action.

=== Analysis example ===
Analysis can take into account the decision maker&#x27;s (e.g., the company&#x27;s) preference or utility function, for example:

The basic interpretation in this situation is that the company prefers B&#x27;s risk and payoffs under realistic risk preference coefficients (greater than $400K—in that range of risk aversion, the company would need to model a third strategy, &quot;Neither A nor B&quot;).

Another example, commonly used in operations research courses, is the distribution of lifeguards on beaches (a.k.a. the &quot;Life&#x27;s a Beach&quot; example). The example describes two beaches with lifeguards to be distributed on each beach. There is maximum budget &quot;B&quot; that can be distributed among the two beaches (in total), and using a marginal returns table, analysts can decide how many lifeguards to allocate to each beach.

In this example, a decision tree can be drawn to illustrate the principles of diminishing returns on beach #1.
The decision tree illustrates that when sequentially distributing lifeguards, placing a first lifeguard on beach #1 would be optimal if there is only the budget for 1 lifeguard. But if there is a budget for two guards, then placing both on beach #2 would prevent more overall drownings.
=== Influence diagram ===
Much of the information in a decision tree can be represented more compactly as an influence diagram, focusing attention on the issues and relationships between events.

== Association rule induction ==

Decision trees can also be seen as generative models of induction rules from empirical data. An optimal decision tree is then defined as a tree that accounts for most of the data, while minimizing the number of levels (or &quot;questions&quot;). Several algorithms to generate such optimal trees have been devised, such as ID3/4/5, CLS, ASSISTANT, and CART.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Among decision support tools, decision trees (and influence diagrams) have several advantages. Decision trees:
* Are simple to understand and interpret. People are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation.
* Have value even with little hard data. Important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation (its alternatives, probabilities, and costs) and their preferences for outcomes.
* Help determine worst, best, and expected values for different scenarios.
* Use a white box model. If a given result is provided by a model.
* Can be combined with other decision techniques.
* The action of more than one decision-maker can be considered.
Disadvantages of decision trees:
* They are unstable, meaning that a small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree.
* They are often relatively inaccurate. Many other predictors perform better with similar data. This can be remedied by replacing a single decision tree with a random forest of decision trees, but a random forest is not as easy to interpret as a single decision tree.
* For data including categorical variables with different numbers of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
* Calculations can get very complex, particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.

== Optimizing a decision tree ==
A few things should be considered when improving the accuracy of the decision tree classifier. The following are some possible optimizations to consider when looking to make sure the decision tree model produced makes the correct decision or classification. Note that these things are not the only things to consider but only some.

Increasing the number of levels of the tree

The accuracy of the decision tree can change based on the depth of the decision tree. In many cases, the tree’s leaves are pure nodes. When a node is pure, it means that all the data in that node belongs to a single class. For example, if the classes in the data set are Cancer and Non-Cancer a leaf node would be considered pure when all the sample data in a leaf node is part of only one class, either cancer or non-cancer. It is important to note that a deeper tree is not always better when optimizing the decision tree. A deeper tree can influence the runtime in a negative way. If a certain classification algorithm is being used, then a deeper tree could mean the runtime of this classification algorithm is significantly slower. There is also the possibility that the actual algorithm building the decision tree will get significantly slower as the tree gets deeper. If the tree-building algorithm being used splits pure nodes, then a decrease in the overall accuracy of the tree classifier could be experienced. Occasionally, going deeper in the tree can cause an accuracy decrease in general, so it is very important to test modifying the depth of the decision tree and selecting the depth that produces the best results. To summarize, observe the points below, we will define the number D as the depth of the tree.

Possible advantages of increasing the number D:

* Accuracy of the decision-tree classification model increases.

Possible disadvantages of increasing D

*  Runtime issues
* Decrease in accuracy in general
* Pure node splits while going deeper can cause issues.

The ability to test the differences in classification results when changing D is imperative. We must be able to easily change and test the variables that could affect the accuracy and reliability of the decision tree-model.

The choice of node-splitting functions

The node splitting function used can have an impact on improving the accuracy of the decision tree. For example, using the information-gain function may yield better results than using the phi function. The phi function is known as a measure of “goodness” of a candidate split at a node in the decision tree. The information gain function is known as a measure of the “reduction in entropy”. In the following, we will build two decision trees. One decision tree will be built using the phi function to split the nodes and one decision tree will be built using the information gain function to split the nodes.

The main advantages and disadvantages of information gain and phi function

* One major drawback of information gain is that the feature that is chosen as the next node in the tree tends to have more unique values.
* An advantage of information gain is that it tends to choose the most impactful features that are close to the root of the tree. It is a very good measure for deciding the relevance of some features.
* The phi function is also a good measure for deciding the relevance of some features based on &quot;goodness&quot;.
This is the information gain function formula. The formula states the information gain is a function of the entropy of a node of the decision tree minus the entropy of a candidate split at node t of a decision tree.

formula_1

This is the phi function formula. The phi function is maximized when the chosen feature splits the samples in a way that produces homogenous splits and have around the same number of samples in each split.

formula_2

We will set D, which is the depth of the decision tree we are building, to three (D = 3). We also have the following data set of cancer and non-cancer samples and the mutation features that the samples either have or do not have. If a sample has a feature mutation then the sample is positive for that mutation, and it will be represented by one. If a sample does not have a feature mutation then the sample is negative for that mutation, and it will be represented by zero.

To summarize, C stands for cancer and NC stands for non-cancer. The letter M stands for mutation, and if a sample has a particular mutation it will show up in the table as a one and otherwise zero.
Now, we can use the formulas to calculate the phi function values and information gain values for each M in the dataset. Once all the values are calculated the tree can be produced. The first thing to be done is to select the root node. In information gain and the phi function we consider the optimal split to be the mutation that produces the highest value for information gain or the phi function. Now assume that M1 has the highest phi function value and M4 has the highest information gain value. The M1 mutation will be the root of our phi function tree and M4 will be the root of our information gain tree. You can observe the root nodes below 
Now, once we have chosen the root node we can split the samples into two groups based on whether a sample is positive or negative for the root node mutation. The groups will be called group A and group B. For example, if we use M1 to split the samples in the root node we get NC2 and C2 samples in group A and the rest of the samples NC4, NC3, NC1, C1 in group B.

Disregarding the mutation chosen for the root node, proceed to place the next best features that have the highest values for information gain or the phi function in the left or right child nodes of the decision tree. Once we choose the root node and the two child nodes for the tree of depth = 3 we can just add the leaves. The leaves will represent the final classification decision the model has produced based on the mutations a sample either has or does not have. The left tree is the decision tree we obtain from using information gain to split the nodes and the right tree is what we obtain from using the phi function to split the nodes.


Now assume the classification results from both trees are given using a confusion matrix.

Information gain confusion matrix:
Phi function confusion matrix:
The tree using information gain has the same results when using the phi function when calculating the accuracy. When we classify the samples based on the model using information gain we get one true positive, one false positive, zero false negatives, and four true negatives. For the model using the phi function we get two true positives, zero false positives, one false negative, and three true negatives. The next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision tree using some key metrics that will be discussed in the evaluating a decision tree section below. The metrics that will be discussed below can help determine the next steps to be taken when optimizing the decision tree.

Other techniques

The above information is not where it ends for building and optimizing a decision tree. There are many techniques for improving the decision tree classification models we build. One of the techniques is making our decision tree model from a bootstrapped dataset. The bootstrapped dataset helps remove the bias that occurs when building a decision tree model with the same data the model is tested with. The ability to leverage the power of random forests can also help significantly improve the overall accuracy of the model being built. This method generates many decisions from many decision trees and tallies up the votes from each decision tree to make the final classification. There are many techniques, but the main objective is to test building your decision tree model in different ways to make sure it reaches the highest performance level possible.

== Evaluating a decision tree ==

It is important to know the measurements used to evaluate decision trees. The main metrics used are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, miss rate, false discovery rate, and false omission rate. All these measurements are derived from the number of true positives, false positives, True negatives, and false negatives obtained when running a set of samples through the decision tree classification model. Also, a confusion matrix can be made to display these results. All these main metrics tell something different about the strengths and weaknesses of the classification model built based on your decision tree. For example, a low sensitivity with high specificity could indicate the classification model built from the decision tree does not do well identifying cancer samples over non-cancer samples.

Let us take the confusion matrix below. The confusion matrix shows us the decision tree model classifier built gave 11 true positives, 1 false positive, 45 false negatives, and 105 true negatives.
We will now calculate the values accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, miss rate, false discovery rate, and false omission rate.

Accuracy:

formula_3

formula_4

Sensitivity (TPR – true positive rate):

formula_5

formula_6

Specificity (TNR – true negative rate):

formula_7

formula_8

Precision (PPV – positive predictive value):

formula_9

formula_10

Miss Rate (FNR – false negative rate):

formula_11

formula_12

False discovery rate (FDR):

formula_13

formula_14

False omission rate (FOR):

formula_15

formula_16

Once we have calculated the key metrics we can make some initial conclusions on the performance of the decision tree model built. The accuracy that we calculated was 71.60%. The accuracy value is good to start but we would like to get our models as accurate as possible while maintaining the overall performance. The sensitivity value of 19.64% means that out of everyone who was actually positive for cancer tested positive. If we look at the specificity value of 99.06% we know that out of all the samples that were negative for cancer actually tested negative. When it comes to sensitivity and specificity it is important to have a balance between the two values, so if we can decrease our specificity to increase the sensitivity that would prove to be beneficial. These are just a few examples on how to use these values and the meanings behind them to evaluate the decision tree model and improve upon the next iteration.

<text>Frederic Harrison (18 October 1831 – 14 January 1923) was a British jurist and historian.

==Biography==

Born at 17 Euston Square, London, he was the son of Frederick Harrison (1799–1881), a stockbroker and his wife Jane, daughter of Alexander Brice, a Belfast granite merchant. He was baptised at St. Pancras Church, Euston, and spent his early childhood at the northern London suburb of Muswell Hill, to which the family moved soon after his birth. His father later acquired a lease on the grand Tudor manor house Sutton Place near Guildford, Surrey, in 1874, which descended to his elder son Sidney, and about which Frederic jnr. wrote the definitive history &quot;Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place, Guildford&quot;, first published in 1893. His paternal grandfather was a Leicestershire builder. In 1840, the family moved again to 22 Oxford Square, Hyde Park, London, a house designed by Harrison&#x27;s father. Along with his siblings Sidney and Lawrence, Harrison received his initial education at home before attending a day school in St John&#x27;s Wood. In 1843, he entered King&#x27;s College School, graduating as second in the school in 1849.

==Oxford and Positivism==

He received a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford in 1849. It was at Oxford that he was to embrace positive philosophy, under the influence of his tutor Richard Congreve and the works of John Stuart Mill and George Henry Lewes. Harrison found himself in conflict with Congreve as to details, and eventually led the Positivists who split off and founded Newton Hall in 1881, and he was president of the English Positivist Committee from 1880 to 1905; he was also editor and part author of the &quot;Positivist New Calendar of great Men&quot; (1892), and wrote much on Auguste Comte and Positivism. For more than three decades, he was a regular contributor to &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;, often in defence of Positivism, especially Comte&#x27;s version of it.

Among his contemporaries at Wadham were Edward Spencer Beesly, John Henry Bridges, and George Earlam Thorley who were to become the leaders of the secular Religion of Humanity or &quot;Comtism&quot; in England. He received a second class in Moderations in 1852 and a first class in Literae Humaniores in 1853. In the following year, he was elected a fellow of the college and became a tutor, taking over from Congreve. He became part of a liberal group of academics at Oxford that also included Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Goldwin Smith, Mark Pattison and Benjamin Jowett.

As a religious teacher, literary critic, historian and jurist, Harrison took a prominent part in the life of his time, and his writings, though often violently controversial on political, religious and social subjects, and in their judgment and historical perspective characterized by a modern Radical point of view, are those of an accomplished scholar, and of one whose wide knowledge of literature was combined with independence of thought and admirable vigour of style. In 1907 he published &quot;The Creed of a Layman&quot;, which included his &quot;Apologia pro fide mea&quot;, in explanation of his Positivist religious position.

==Legal and publishing career==

He was called to the bar in 1858, and, in addition to his practice in equity cases, soon began to distinguish himself as an effective contributor to the higher-class reviews. Two articles in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, one on the Italian question, which procured him the special thanks of Cavour, the other on &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, which had the probably undesigned effect of stimulating the attack on the book, attracted especial notice. A few years later Harrison worked at the codification of the law with Lord Westbury, of whom he contributed an interesting notice to Nash&#x27;s biography of the chancellor. His special interest in legislation for the working classes led him to be placed upon the Trades Union Commission of 1867–1869; he was secretary to the commission for the digest of the law, 1869–1870; and was from 1877 to 1889 professor of jurisprudence and international law under the Council of Legal Education. He was also professor of jurisprudence to the Inns of Court, and an Honorary fellow of Wadham College.

Of his separate publications, the most important are his lives of Cromwell (1888), William the Silent, (1897), Ruskin (1902), and Chatham (1905); his &quot;Meaning of History&quot; (1862; enlarged 1894) and &quot;Byzantine History in the Early Middle Ages&quot; (1900); and his essays on &quot;Early Victorian Literature&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Choice of Books&quot; (1886) are remarkable alike for generous admiration and good sense. In 1904 he published a &quot;romantic monograph&quot; of the 10th century Byzantine resurgence, &quot;Theophano&quot;, based on the empress of that name, and in 1906 a verse tragedy, &quot;Nicephorus&quot;, based on Emperor Nikephoros II. His &quot;Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place, Guildford&quot;, first published in London in 1893 as a quarto work, re-issued in a small abridged form in 1899, is a valuable and detailed study of the Weston family and the architecturally important manor house Sutton Place built by Sir Richard Weston c. 1525. Harrison&#x27;s father had been the lessee since 1874 and the author had many years of access in which to perform his detailed investigations and researches.

He gave the Sir Robert Rede Lecture at the University of Cambridge in 1900.

==Politics==
An advanced and vehement Radical in politics and Progressive in municipal affairs, Harrison in 1886 stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party candidate against Sir John Lubbock for the University of London parliamentary constituency. In 1889, he was elected an alderman of the London County Council, but resigned in 1893.

Harrison was a regular contributor to George Potter&#x27;s trade unionist journal &quot;The Beehive&quot;, and to W. H. Riley&#x27;s &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, which promoted the International Working Men&#x27;s Association. He was a supporter of Polish and Italian independence, the Union in the American Civil War, the reformers in the Jamaica Committee of 1866, the Paris Commune and was a vice president of the Reform League. In an article defending the Paris Commune which appeared in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; Harrison proclaimed: &#x27;The status quo is impossible. The alternative is Communism or Positivism.&#x27;

Later works include &quot;Autobiographic Memoirs&quot; (1911); &quot;The Positive Evolution of Religion&quot; (1912); &quot;The German Peril&quot; (1915); &quot;On Society&quot; (1918); &quot;Jurisprudence and Conflict of Nations&quot; (1919); &quot;Obiter Dicta&quot; (1919); &quot;Novissima Verba&quot; (1920). The last two of these were collections of vigorous comments on politics and literature contributed by him to the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; towards the end of World War I and immediately afterwards.

==Family==

In 1870, Harrison married his first cousin Ethel Bertha Harrison, daughter of William Harrison. They had four sons, including the journalist and literary critic Austin Harrison. George Gissing, the novelist, was at one time their tutor; and in 1905, Harrison wrote a preface to Gissing&#x27;s &quot;Veranilda&quot;. One of the sons, Christopher René Harrison, was killed in World War I.

<text>Nematullah Shahrani (born 1941) is a prominent Afghan scholar. He was one of four Vice Presidents of the Afghan Transitional Administration from 2002 to 2004. Shahrani also headed of the Afghan Constitution Commission.

He has written more than 30 books and several hundred academic articles. He belongs to an academic family that is known in Afghanistan as the family of scholars. He studied at Kabul University, Al-Azhar University (Cairo) and The George Washington University (U.S.).

From Badakhshan Province in northern Afghanistan, Shahrani is an ethnic Uzbek. Although he was one of the ideological figures behind the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he was never involved in any sectarian, party and other ethnic conflicts in Afghanistan. For that he earned the nickname of Mr. Clean.

Currently some of his family members teach at academic institutions in the United States (such as Indiana University Bloomington) and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="232624" wikidata="Q6838653" url="?curid=232624" title="Mickey Harte">
<text>Mickey Harte (born 1954) is an Irish Gaelic football manager and former player. He is the current joint-manager of the Offaly senior football team. 

Harte managed the Tyrone county team from 2003 until his resignation in 2020, at which time he was the longest-serving manager then active with the same team in inter-county competition. He is the most successful senior manager in the county&#x27;s history, having led it to three All-Ireland SFC titles, as well as six Ulster SFC titles, one National League and twelve Dr McKenna Cups. Immediately after his exit as Tyrone manager in 2020, Mickey took over the reins of the Louth county team and kept a hold of them until 2023. 

Considered one of the best tacticians in the game, Harte is admired both by peers and former rivals.

==Early life==
Born in Glencull, near Ballygawley, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, Harte was educated at the Christian Brothers Grammar School in Omagh. He trained to be a teacher at St Joseph&#x27;s College in Belfast (now St Mary&#x27;s). He taught for five years at De La Salle Boys School in Kircubben. He then moved to St Ciaran&#x27;s in Ballygawley. In his 22 years spent there, he achieved numerous successes, including Tyrone, Ulster and All-Ireland Vocational Schools titles. He continued working there as he progressed through the county ranks of Tyrone&#x27;s Gaelic football side, bringing them to a National Football League title, All-Ireland Minor and U21 victories and eventually, in 2003, the Sam Maguire Cup.

==Management==
Raised in Ballymacilroy outside Ballygawley, County Tyrone, Harte managed the Tyrone minor team (1991–1998) and under-21 team, winning All-Ireland titles with both, before he was named manager of the senior Tyrone county team. He guided the under-21 team to two All-Ireland Under-21 titles and three Ulster Under-21 titles. He led the minor team to an All-Ireland Minor title and three Ulster Minor titles.

He subsequently managed his home club of Errigal Ciarán and was successful with this team as well, winning the Tyrone County Championship and Ulster Senior Club Football Championship.

Harte&#x27;s first season in charge of the senior county team came in 2003. His team overcame Down in the 2003 Ulster SFC final, requiring a replay after a drawn game when the team conceded four goals; Harte switched Cormac McAnallen from midfield to full-back for the second game. Tyrone conceded only one further goal in their other four games in that competition, which ended with the county claiming the first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) title in its history, and McAnallen would win an All Star Award in this new role. Peter Canavan was injured on the day of the final. Harte started Canavan before withdrawing him at half-time, then unexpectedly bringing him back on with a few minutes remaining and Tyrone narrowly in the lead.

Tyrone and Harte won a second All-Ireland SFC in 2005. The county played a total of ten matches, including three replays, which was a record for any winning team. Tyrone played five matches in the Ulster SFC, including replays against Cavan in the semi-final and against Armagh in the final, which they lost. Having to contest an All-Ireland SFC qualifier as a result of that loss, Tyrone overcame Monaghan to reach an All-Ireland SFC quarter-final against Dublin. Tyrone had yet another drawn game, a match memorable for Owen Mulligan&#x27;s solo goal. Harte combined Enda McGinley with Joe McMahon for the second half of that game, a move which outwitted Ciarán Whelan, who had been getting the better of his opponents in the first half; Whelan was ultimately removed from the game by the Dublin management. In the All-Ireland SFC semi-final, the county met Armagh for a third time; two points behind with only six minutes of play left and, in what Eamonn Sweeney writing later in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; called &quot;the defining moment of Harte&#x27;s team&quot;, Seán Cavanagh scored a solo point, substitute Shane Sweeney levelled the game and Canavan converted an injury-time free. In the 2005 All-Ireland SFC final, the county defeated Kerry for the second time in three years to win the Sam Maguire Cup.

Harte&#x27;s and Tyrone&#x27;s third All-Ireland SFC winning campaign began with a quarter-final loss to Down in the 2008 Ulster SFC. Entering the All-Ireland SFC qualifiers again, the county advanced to the 2008 All-Ireland SFC final against a Kerry team then bidding to win three consecutive titles. Kerry did not. Despite Peter Canavan&#x27;s retirement, Mulligan&#x27;s disciplinary problems and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s on-off retirement through injury, Tyrone won a third All-Ireland SFC title. Harte deployed Justin McMahon to effectively deal with Kerry&#x27;s Kieran Donaghy (a forward who had become more prominent since the 2005 final), while the half-back line of David Harte, Conor Gormley and Philip Jordan outperformed expectations and Cavanagh scored five points from play. Eamonn Sweeney reckoned 2008 to be &quot;the supreme managerial achievement of Harte&#x27;s career&quot;.

In the latter part of his time as Tyrone manager, Ulster Championship success did not come easy for Harte and his team, having been knocked out five times by Donegal in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2020. That 2020 defeat was his last game as Tyrone manager.

In November 2020, Harte was appointed manager of the senior Louth county team for an expected three-year period.

In September 2023, Harte was appointed manager of the Derry county team. Taking over a team that had won consecutive Ulster titles, Harte managed them to a heavy defeat against Donegal at Derry&#x27;s home venue in his only Ulster championship game as Derry manager. Donegal were able to carve out numerous goal opportunities due to Derry&#x27;s tactics, but only managed to score four of them. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; described the game as a &quot;classic&quot;. The newspaper also named Donegal&#x27;s first goal, scored with a lob into an empty net as Derry goalkeeper Odhran Lynch ran back up the pitch after vacating his goal, as its &quot;Moment of the Year&quot;. Harte left at the end of the season.

==Advocacy==
In 2009, Harte attended the launch of Patrick McCrystal&#x27;s controversial book &quot;Who is at the Centre of Your Marriage, the Pill or Jesus Christ?&quot;

In 2010, as part of the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;Year for Priests&quot; celebration, he contributed to a DVD, &quot;In Praise of Priests&quot;, featuring interviews with various people expressing admiration for their favourite priest.

Harte attracted controversy when, in 2013, he provided a character reference for Ronan McCusker, who had pleaded guilty to rape, and Judge Piers Grant singled out the character reference from Harte as one of the &quot;mitigating factors&quot; which led him to pitch the jail sentence towards the bottom of the range; two-and-a-half years, 15 months in jail, 15 on licence.

Harte supported the No Vote in the 2018 abortion referendum.

==Writing and broadcasting==
In 2009, Harte began writing a weekly column for the Northern Irish newspaper, &quot;The Irish News&quot;. To date his column has focused on hot topics in Gaelic games, referees and other GAA-related topics.

In October 2009, Harte (with the help of Michael Foley) published an autobiography, &quot;Harte: Presence Is The Only Thing&quot;. It was published by Poolbeg ().

Harte makes occasional appearances to offer analysis on the BBC&#x27;s championship coverage. He did so less than 48 hours after departing as Tyrone manager.

==Personal life==
Harte is married to Marian with 4 children. His daughter Michaela McAreavey was murdered on her honeymoon in Mauritius in January 2011. Two of his brothers also died due to illness around the time of his daughter&#x27;s murder.

==Honours==
* Honorary Doctorate by Queen&#x27;s University Belfast for services to Gaelic football (2006)

<text>In education, business, law, and other fields, gender blindness or sex blindness is the practice of disregarding gender as a significant factor in interactions between people and applying equal rules across genders (formal equality of opportunity).

== In education ==
Krista Ratcliffe writes that gender blindness functions in the classroom to downplay the existence of gender differences, which tends to reinforce existing gender substantive inequality.

The National Student Genderblind Campaign, founded in the United States in 2006, has argued in favor of gender-neutral campus housing at colleges and universities to better serve gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex students.

== In health care ==

The use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada. Manitoba&#x27;s Health Minister, Theresa Oswald, has campaigned actively against such rooms, saying that if humanity can &quot;put somebody on the moon&quot;, it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients. Great Britain agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.

Some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms. Jacob M. Appel, an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from &quot;old-fashioned prejudice&quot;, arguing: &quot;Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy.&quot;

== In law ==

The legal test of the &quot;reasonable person&quot; has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of &quot;Ellison v. Brady&quot; 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that &quot;a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women&quot;.

== Research ==

Gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women&#x27;s inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. In a 2011 poll of 1,000 women by the Women&#x27;s Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym. Single-sex services can provide greater comfort and engagement for participants who would otherwise not get involved.

<text>Earl Silas Johnson IV (February 7, 1934 – April 17, 2003), known as Earl King, was an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter, most active in blues music. A composer of blues standards such as &quot;Come On&quot; (covered by Jimi Hendrix, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan) and &quot;Big Chief&quot; (recorded by Professor Longhair), he was an important figure in New Orleans R&amp;B.

==Biography==
King was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. His father was a piano player. He died when Earl was still a baby, and Earl was brought up by his mother. With his mother, he started going to church at an early age. In his youth he sang gospel music, but he took the advice of a friend to switch to blues to make a better living.

King started to play the guitar at the age of 15. Soon he started entering talent contests at local clubs, including the Dew Drop Inn. At one such club he met his idol, Guitar Slim. King started imitating Slim, and his presence had a big impact on his musical direction. In 1954, Slim was injured in an automobile accident (right around the time he had the number 1 R&amp;B hit &quot;The Things That I Used To Do&quot;), and King was deputized to continue a tour with Slim&#x27;s band, representing himself as Slim. After succeeding in this role, King became a regular at the Dew Drop Inn.

His first recording was made in 1953. As Earl Johnson, he released a 78-rpm record, &quot;Have You Gone Crazy&quot;/&quot;Begging at Your Mercy&quot;, for Savoy Records. The following year, the talent scout Johnny Vincent introduced King to Specialty Records, for which he recorded some sides, including &quot;Mother&#x27;s Love&quot;, which was locally popular. In 1955, King signed with Vincent&#x27;s label, Ace. His first single for that label, &quot;Those Lonely, Lonely Nights&quot;, was a hit, reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. He continued to record for Ace for the next five years. During that time, he also he started writing songs for other artists, such as Roland Stone and Jimmy Clanton.

In 1960, Dave Bartholomew invited King to record for Imperial Records. In sessions for that label, he was backed by a host of musicians, including Bob French, George French, James Booker, and Wardell Quezergue. It was at this label he recorded his signature songs &quot;Come On&quot; and &quot;Trick Bag&quot;. The former has been a much-covered standard for decades, notably recorded by Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Anson Funderburgh. The latter has also been widely covered, with versions by Johnny Winter, the Meters and Robert Palmer. King co-wrote a number of songs with Bartholomew, either under his own name or under the pseudonym &quot;E.C. King&quot;.

King recorded for Imperial until 1963. He went without a recording contract for the rest of the 1960s. During this time, he mostly concentrated on producing and songwriting for the local labels NOLA and Watch. His compositions from this era include &quot;Big Chief&quot;, recorded by Professor Longhair; &quot;Teasin&#x27; You&quot;, recorded by Willie Tee; and &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, recorded by Lee Dorsey. He went to Detroit for an audition with Motown Records and recorded a few tracks in the mid-1960s. Three tracks from that session are included on the album &quot;Motown&#x27;s Blue Evolution&quot;, released in 1996.

In 1972, he was joined by Allen Toussaint and the Meters to record the album &quot;Street Parade&quot;. Atlantic Records initially showed interest in releasing it but eventually declined. The title track was released as a single on the Kansu label at the time, but the rest was unreleased until 1982, when the album was issued by Charly Records in the UK.

In the 1970s, he recorded another album, &quot;That Good Old New New Orleans Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, which was released by Sonet in 1977. He also appeared on the album &quot;New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival 1976&quot;.

In the early 1980s, King met Hammond Scott, the co-owner of Black Top Records, and started to record for the label. The first album &quot;Glazed&quot;, on which he was backed by Roomful of Blues, was released in 1986. This particular album was nominated for a Grammy Award. A second album, &quot;Sexual Telepathy&quot;, released in 1990, featured Snooks Eaglin on two tracks and backing by Ronnie Earl &amp; The Broadcasters on some tracks. He recorded his third album for Black Top, &quot;Hard River to Cross&quot; (1993), with backing by George Porter Jr., David Torkanowsky, and Herman V. Ernest III.

In 2001, King was hospitalized for an illness during a tour of New Zealand, but that did not stop him from performing. In December of the same year, he toured Japan. and he continued to perform off and on locally in New Orleans until his death.

King died on April 17, 2003, from diabetes-related complications, just a week before the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. His funeral was held on April 30, during the festival, and many musicians attended it, including Dr. John, Leo Nocentelli and Aaron Neville. His Imperial recordings, which had long been out of print, were reissued on CD soon after he died. The June 2003 issue of &quot;OffBeat&quot;, a local music magazine, paid tribute to King with a series of articles on him.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon is a tactical shooter video game developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubi Soft in 2001 for Microsoft Windows. It is the first game in the &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; series. It was ported to Mac OS, Xbox and PlayStation 2 in 2002 and to the GameCube in 2003. Ports for N-Gage and Game Boy Advance were planned, but later canceled. Unlike Clancy&#x27;s other tactical shooter series, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; is not based on any of his books.

Together with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;SWAT 3&quot;, and &quot;Operation Flashpoint&quot;, game industry experts generally credit &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; with defining and refining the tactical shooter genre. &quot;Ghost Recon&quot;″s success spawned two expansion packs, &quot;Desert Siege&quot; and &quot;Island Thunder&quot;, as well as numerous sequels.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Ghost Recon&quot; puts the player in charge of the eponymous Ghosts, a fictional squad of United States Special Operations Forces soldiers from Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group. They are organized into three fireteams named using the NATO phonetic alphabet: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie, with space for three soldiers per team (the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions do not have a Charlie team available). However, only six soldiers can be selected per mission. The player enjoys limited tactical control on the battlefield by issuing maneuver commands and rules of engagement for each fireteam through a &quot;command map&quot;. There are 3 difficulties; Recruit, Veteran, and Elite. Recruit offers unlimited ammo for some weapons, while the level of difficulty corresponds with the level of responsiveness and &quot;training&quot; of the AI.

The soldiers themselves are organized into four different character classes. Every class can carry a primary and secondary weapon, which are organized into &quot;kits&quot;. Even though the primary weapon remains the same in all the kits (being defined by the soldier class — see below), there is a variety of equipment to be chosen as the secondary weapon.

*Rifleman: The predominant soldier class in the game, riflemen can use a variety of different weapon kits. Their primary weapon is the M16 assault rifle. Secondaries include the M203 grenade launcher, the M9 pistol, spare magazines, or a pair of binoculars (in later versions these were replaced with deployable sensors, since binoculars were supplied to all Ghosts).
*Support: Support soldiers provide a high volume of suppressive fire with the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. As the soldier is equipped for short range, he also carries more armor. In addition to the machine gun, the support class may also carry the M9 (suppressed), M67 fragmentation grenades, or additional magazines.
*Demolitions (&quot;Demo&quot;): Demolitions personnel are specialists in destroying large structures and can serve in the anti-tank role. Their primary weapon is the M4 carbine. This soldier can also be equipped with demolition charges, grenades, extra magazines, Claymore mines, or the M136 AT4 anti-tank rocket.
*Sniper: Distinguishable by their ghillie suits, the sniper can provide fire support over long ranges while hidden. Primarily equipped with the U.S. Army&#x27;s M24 rifle, they can also be equipped with the standard and silenced M9, extra magazines or grenades.

For every completed mission in the single-player campaign, each soldier that survives gains one Combat Point to upgrade their attributes. There are four basic categories of skill:
*Weapon: affects the accuracy and aiming of the weapon; the reticule will close faster and tighter as more points are added.
*Stealth: enhances the ability of the soldier to remain undetected and reduces noise generated by the soldier moving.
*Endurance: improves recovery time when taking hits, increases the soldier&#x27;s ability to survive a wound and reduces the effect of heavy equipment on speed.
*Leadership: for every three points of skill, all other soldiers in the same fireteam gain an extra point to each of their statistics. The bonus can only apply if the soldier with the high leadership skill is the fireteam&#x27;s point man.

The player also unlocks &quot;specialists&quot; from NATO or allied countries by completing extra mission objectives. The specialists are more experienced than the Ghosts and have more Combat Points, making them an essential part of the team. They are also equipped with weapons not available to standard soldiers. Two specialists are armed with the Objective Individual Combat Weapon, as part of field tests and implementation of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Land Warrior program. The specialist corps includes three women, who are the only female combatants in the game.

The game is played entirely from the first-person perspective. A heads-up display relays information such as the name of the soldier the player is controlling, the soldier&#x27;s assigned fireteam, weapon and ammo counter, a threat indicator, the targeting reticule, health status, and a stance indicator (to show whether the character is standing, crouched, or prone).

Players will engage most often with either rebel militia, or Russian foot soldiers, who have varying levels of body armor, some being capable of stopping most small-arms fire, and varying levels of accuracy and reactions to the player. Occasionally the player will come face-to-face with armored threats, such as cargo trucks, or civilian trucks with mounted machine guns, and APC&#x27;s, but the player may also encounter tanks, which requires the M136 recoilless anti-tank rifle in order to destroy. Soldiers are very mobile and adaptive, using cover, going prone, providing suppressive fire, and flanking and sneaking up on the player. Enemy visibility is based on weather conditions as well as the level of light available. Vehicles follow strict movement options.

Bullets will not penetrate most objects, but they will break glass and deflate tires. Explosives or heavy gunfire can be used to destroy wooden doors, and (in the case of explosives) potentially kill anyone within the blast radius on the other side. Depending on a target&#x27;s armor, it is generally possible to neutralize a threat with one or two well-placed shots.

Soldiers rendered &quot;out of action&quot; during a mission are considered to be dead, and not available for the rest of the campaign. Wounded soldiers who survive a mission will remain wounded unless they are replaced with a healthy soldier for the next mission.

&quot;Ghost Recon&quot; has both single player and multiplayer modes of play. Up to 36 players are supported in the PC version&#x27;s multiplayer over an internet (TCP/IP) connection or LAN.

==Plot==
In April 2008, Russia is taken over by ultranationalists led by Dmitri Arbatov, who annex Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to form the Russian Democratic Union (RDU), a political and military alliance dedicated to recreating the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile in Georgia, the U.S. Army&#x27;s elite &quot;Ghost&quot; special forces unit battles South Ossetian separatists who are harassing the Georgian government and their allies. In response to their presence, the RDU complains to the United Nations that the United States has interfered in their internal affairs, and the Russian Armed Forces invade Georgia to support the rebels; in turn, the Ghosts support the Defence Forces of Georgia and U.S. reinforcements, who slow the Russian advance. However, the Russians&#x27; numerical advantage overwhelms the Georgian defenders, prompting the U.S. to pivot toward evacuating Americans and foreign nationals as Russian forces push deeper into the country. Eventually, the Russian military captures Tbilisi and the RDU controversially proclaims its annexation of Georgia, forcing the Ghosts to withdraw, while the Georgian government sets up a government-in-exile in Geneva, Switzerland.

The RDU&#x27;s expansionism continues when they invade the Baltic states three days ahead of NATO intelligence estimates. The Ghosts deploy to slow the invasion ahead of U.S. and NATO forces, who defeat the Russians in Latvia and Lithuania, forcing them out of the region and prompting further Ghost deployments into RDU territory to rescue American prisoners of war and Russian political prisoners. The RDU government blames President Arbatov for their losses, places him under house arrest, and eventually executes him in a coup d&#x27;état. The death of Arbatov results in a massive loss of domestic support for the RDU government and the rise of an anti-RDU insurgency, while the Ghosts covertly attack Russian military facilities in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk to cripple their combat capabilities.

During a battle between U.S.-backed Russian deserters and RDU forces north of Moscow, the RDU detonates a nuclear weapon, prompting strong international condemnation as the RDU collapses into civil war between RDU ultranationalists and Russian loyalists. Acting Russian Prime Minister Karpin privately requests NATO support, and NATO forces enter Russia to fight the ultranationalists and support the loyalists. After the Ghosts break through a major ultranationalist defensive line, NATO forces occupy Moscow and corner the last ultranationalist holdouts inside the Red Square. The Ghosts launch a final assault and capture the Kremlin, forcing the ultranationalists to surrender on November 10, 2008. The war ends as the Americans and Russians celebrate liberation.

==Development==
The game was in development as early as November 2000. Motion capture was used for character animation. The lead designer was Brian Upton and the soundtrack was composed by Bill Brown.

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Desert Siege&quot; is a 2002 expansion pack, released for Microsoft Windows as a separate purchase and can be unlocked as a new campaign in the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;. It is also bundled with the Mac port. The expansion pack adds 2 new multiplayer game types (Domination and Siege), 5 new multiplayer maps, new weapons for use in multiplayer, and an eight-mission single player campaign, which also unlocks a new specialist soldier (Jodit Haile). In the PlayStation 2 version, players who start Desert Siege by finishing the &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; campaign first will also retain the soldiers they used in the campaign, including their statistics.

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Island Thunder&quot; was released in late 2002 as an expansion pack for Microsoft Windows, and as a standalone game for Xbox. It contains eight new single player missions, 12 new weapons, 5 new dedicated multiplayer maps, 3 new multiplayer modes (Cat and Mouse, Defend, and Behemoth). On the Xbox, &quot;Island Thunder&quot; features five additional missions and twelve multiplayer maps.

In addition to the official expansion packs, the very active &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; modding scene (over 1,000 mods have been published as of January 2013) has produced a large number of unofficial expansions packs for PC. Free expansions like &quot;Frostbite&quot;, &quot;CENTCOM&quot;, &quot;Heroes Unleashed&quot;, and &quot;Year of the Monkey&quot; (among others) have gained huge popularity, with download counts in the hundreds of thousands, and attaining community-based awards.

==Reception==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions, while the PC and Xbox versions received &quot;generally positive&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;Ghost Recon&quot; was a commercial success. By the end of 2001, sales of its computer version had reached 430,000 units.

The computer version of &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; also received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

Sales of the game&#x27;s Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions surpassed 2 million copies by the end of June 2003, and helped to drive Ubisoft&#x27;s Q1 2003/2004 revenues to a record high for the company. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; had sold 1.1 million copies and earned $39 million in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 46th highest-selling game launched for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.

===Awards===
The editors of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; presented &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; with their 2001 &quot;Best Sound&quot; and overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards, and wrote that &quot;few games have made us cringe in shock, roar with aggression, or exult in victory the way &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; has.&quot; &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; was also named &quot;Best Game of the Year&quot; in 2001 by IGN. &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; was a runner-up in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Best Action Game 2001&quot; and &quot;Best Use Of Sound&quot; (&quot;Reader&#x27;s Choice&quot;).

During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; received nominations for the &quot;Online Gameplay&quot; and &quot;Sound Design&quot; awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS).

&quot;Ghost Recon&quot;″s Xbox version won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Best Sound on Xbox&quot; award, and was nominated for &quot;Best Online Game on Xbox&quot; and &quot;Best Shooter on Xbox&quot;. During the AIAS&#x27; 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Xbox version received a nomination for &quot;Console First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;

==Legacy==
===Plot coincidence===
In August 2008, the Russo-Georgian war began, and a number of commentators noted that this real-world event was somewhat similar to the plot of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;, namely how it was prescient in its prediction of Russia&#x27;s backing of separatist rebel forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

<text>Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata  (God alone shall have my heart), 169, a solo cantata for an alto soloist, in Leipzig for the 18th Sunday after Trinity, and first performed it on 20 October 1726.

== History and words ==
Bach wrote the cantata during his fourth year in Leipzig, for the 18th Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul&#x27;s thanks for grace of God in Ephesus (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Great Commandment ().

The unknown author of the text concentrated on the love of God in movements 2 to 5 and added one movement about the love of your neighbour in movement 6, continued in the concluding chorale, the third stanza of Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The poet connected the first recitative to the following aria by starting the two thoughts in the recitative by a related line from the aria as a motto, and ending both with the a recapitulation of the first line. The second recitative is a paraphrase of , Elijah lifted to heaven. The second aria is a paraphrase of , which sets the love of God apart from the love of the world.

The only other extant cantata for the Sunday is the chorale cantata , composed in 1724. Like three other cantatas, the early (1714), and the 1726 works , and , Bach wrote for a single alto soloist, but unlike those works a choir sings the chorale. The three later cantatas, written within a few months, employ the organ as an obbligato instrument, possibly because Bach liked the combination of alto voice and organ registrations. A week later, Bach composed the famous cantata for bass solo, , also concluded by a chorale. It is not known if Bach looked for texts suitable for a solo voice, or if texts were &quot;clerically imposed on him&quot;, which stressed individual piety and therefore suggested to be treated as solo cantatas.

Bach first performed the cantata on 20 October 1726. It is regarded as part of his third annual cycle of cantatas.

== Scoring and structure ==
The cantata in seven movements is scored for alto, a four-part choir only for the closing chorale, two oboes, taille (tenor oboe), two violins, viola, organ obbligato and basso continuo.

== Music ==
As in a number of other works, Bach reused some of his earlier works. The first movement, a sinfonia, and movement 5 rely on a lost concerto, perhaps for oboe or flute, possibly written during his time in Köthen (1717–23). That same concerto is the source of Bach&#x27;s Harpsichord Concerto BWV 1053, composed around 1739. According to John Eliot Gardiner, it may have also served as an organ concerto for the new Silbermann organ in Dresden&#x27;s Sophienkirche in 1725. Bach used the first movement of the concerto, in da capo form, as an extended instrumental introduction, assigning the solo part to the organ, the tutti to the strings and three oboes which he added for the cantata. The first vocal movement is an arioso, accompanied only by the continuo. Bach followed the careful wording of the poet by setting the lines from the following aria as a motto and conclusion of each thought as an arioso, the reflection which they frame as a secco recitative. The repeat of the essential line &quot;&quot; &quot;acts like a rondo motif&quot;, according to Gardiner. In the aria, this line appears reminiscent of the arioso, but in reverse movement. As Gardiner observes: &quot;It is a perfect example of Bach&#x27;s skill in following admonitions by contemporary music theorists to &#x27;grasp the sense of the text&#x27; (Mauritius Vogt, 1719) with the goal of &#x27;refined and text-related musical expression ... the true purpose of music&#x27; (Johann David Heinichen, 1711).&quot; The accompaniment of the virtuoso organ adds weight to the statement. Musicologist Julian Mincham interprets the &quot;richly embroidered organ melody&quot;, which continues throughout the movement, as a &quot;virtually continuous stream of goodness&quot;. A simple secco recitative leads to the second aria, which is again, like the Sinfonia, taken from the concerto, with the voice woven into the solo organ and the strings. According to Dürr, the aria is an example of &quot;how a piece can gain rather than lose from its adaptation in the context of a new work&quot;. Another example is the Agnus Dei from Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor&#x27;. The text marks a farewell to love in the world: &quot;&quot; (Die in me, world and all your love). The music of the aria, marked &quot;siciliano&quot; as the slow movement of the harpsichord concerto, has been regarded as a &quot;farewell to worldly life&quot;, in &quot;a mood of heart-stopping intensity&quot;, also as a mystic contemplation of a heavenly love. The aria has been compared in character to the aria of the repenting Peter &quot;&quot; from Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;.

After the love of God has been expanded in great detail in five movements, the commandment to also love one&#x27;s neighbour is expressed in a short recitative, leading to the chorale, which asks the Holy Spirit to assist in doing so, &quot;so that we might love each other from our hearts and remain of one mind in peace&quot;.

== Recordings ==
As a solo cantata, the work has attracted many conductors and singers who are not specialists in Baroque music to record it. Conductors have included Rudolf Barshai and Ludwig Güttler and singers Aafje Heynis, Birgit Finnilä, Jadwiga Rappé and Monica Groop. Andreas Scholl recorded it in 2010 with Julia Schröder leading as concertmaster the Kammerorchester Basel with Junko Takamaya, Michael Feyfar and Raitis Grigalis singing the chorale.

<doc id="232642" wikidata="Q244620" url="?curid=232642" title="Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery">
<text>Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, 1st Earl of Midlothian (7 May 1847 – 21 May 1929) was a British Liberal Party politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from March 1894 to June 1895. Between the death of his father in 1851, and the death of his grandfather, the 4th Earl of Rosebery, in 1868, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Dalmeny.

Rosebery first came to national attention in 1879 by sponsoring the successful Midlothian campaign of William Ewart Gladstone. His most successful performance in office came as chairman of the London County Council in 1889. He entered the Cabinet in 1885 and was twice Foreign Secretary, paying special attention to French and German affairs. He succeeded Gladstone as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party in 1894; the Liberals lost the 1895 election. He resigned the party leadership in 1896 and never again held political office.

Rosebery was widely known as a brilliant orator, an outstanding sportsman and marksman, a writer and historian, connoisseur and collector. All of these activities attracted him more than politics, which grew boring and unattractive. Furthermore, he drifted to the right of the Liberal party and became a bitter critic of its policies. Winston Churchill, observing that he never adapted to democratic electoral competition, quipped: &quot;He would not stoop; he did not conquer.&quot;

Rosebery was a Liberal Imperialist who favoured strong national defence and imperialism abroad and social reform at home, while being solidly anti-socialist. Historians judge him a failure as foreign minister and as prime minister.

==Origins and early life==

Archibald Philip Primrose was born on 7 May 1847 in his parents&#x27; house in Charles Street, Mayfair, London. His father was Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (1809–1851), son and heir apparent to Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery (1783–1868), whom he predeceased. Lord Dalmeny was a courtesy title used by the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent, during the Earl&#x27;s lifetime, and was one of the Earl&#x27;s lesser Scottish titles. Lord Dalmeny (died 1851) was MP for Stirling from 1832 to 1847 and served as First Lord of the Admiralty under Lord Melbourne.

Rosebery&#x27;s mother was Lady (Catherine Lucy) Wilhelmina Stanhope (1819–1901), a historian who later wrote under her second married name &quot;the Duchess of Cleveland&quot;, a daughter of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope. Lord Dalmeny died on 23 January 1851, having predeceased his father, when the courtesy title passed to his son, the future Rosebery, as the new heir to the earldom. In 1854 his mother remarried to Lord Harry Vane (later after 1864 known as Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland). The relationship between mother and son was very poor. His elder and favourite sister Lady Leconfield was the wife of Henry Wyndham, 2nd Baron Leconfield.

==Education and youth==
Dalmeny attended Bayford House school in Hertfordshire, Eton College (1860–63), and finally Brighton College (1863-65). At Eton, he formed a close attachment to his tutor William Johnson Cory: they visited Rome together in 1864, and maintained correspondence for years afterwards. Dalmeny proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in January 1866. During his time at Oxford he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. He left Oxford in 1868: Dalmeny bought a horse named Ladas, although a rule banned undergraduates from owning horses. When he was found out, he was offered a choice: to sell the horse or to give up his studies. He chose the latter, and subsequently was a prominent figure in British horseracing for 40 years.

The three Prime Ministers from 1880 to 1902, namely Gladstone, Salisbury and Rosebery, all attended both Eton and Christ Church. Rosebery toured the United States in 1873, 1874 and 1876. He was pressed to marry Marie Fox, the sixteen-year-old adopted daughter of Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland. She declined him because she was unwilling to renounce Roman Catholicism.

==Succession to earldom==

When his grandfather died in 1868, Dalmeny became 5th Earl of Rosebery. The earldom did not of itself entitle Archibald Primrose to sit in the House of Lords. The title is part of the old Peerage of Scotland, from which 16 members (Scottish representative peers) were elected to sit in the Lords for each session of Parliament. However, in 1828, Rosebery&#x27;s grandfather had been created 1st Baron Rosebery in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which did entitle Rosebery to sit in the Lords like all peers of the United Kingdom, and barred him from a career in the House of Commons.

Rosebery inherited his title from his grandfather in 1868, aged 21, together with an income of £30,000 a year (equivalent to £ in present-day terms). He owned 40,000 acres (160 km2) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent.

==Career==
Rosebery is reputed to have said that he had three aims in life: to win the Derby, to marry an heiress, and to become Prime Minister. He managed all three.

===Early political career===
At Eton, Rosebery notably attacked Charles I of England for his despotism, and went on to praise his Whig forebears – his ancestor, James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, was a minister to George I of Great Britain. Benjamin Disraeli often met with Rosebery in the 1870s to try to recruit him for his party, but this proved futile. Disraeli&#x27;s major rival, William Ewart Gladstone, also pursued Rosebery, with considerable success.

As part of the Liberal plan to get Gladstone to be MP for Midlothian, Rosebery sponsored and largely ran the Midlothian Campaign of 1879. He based this on what he had observed in elections in the United States. Gladstone spoke from open-deck trains, and gathered mass support. In 1880, he was duly elected Member for Midlothian and returned to the premiership.

Rosebery served as Foreign Secretary in Gladstone&#x27;s brief third ministry in 1886. He served as the first chairman of the London County Council, set up by the Conservatives in 1889. Rosebery Avenue in Clerkenwell is named after him. He served as President of the first day of the 1890 Co-operative Congress.

In 1892 he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter. Rosebery&#x27;s second period as Foreign Secretary, 1892–1894, predominantly involved quarrels with France over Uganda. To quote his hero Napoleon, Rosebery thought that &quot;the Master of Egypt is the Master of India&quot;; thus he pursued the policy of expansion in Africa. He helped Gladstone&#x27;s Second Home Rule Bill in the House of Lords; nevertheless it was defeated overwhelmingly in the autumn of 1893. The first bill had been defeated in the House of Commons in 1886.

===Prime Minister===

Rosebery became a leader of the Liberal Imperialist faction of the Liberal Party and when Gladstone retired, in 1894, Rosebery succeeded him as Prime Minister, much to the disgust of Sir William Harcourt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the more left-wing Liberals. Rosebery&#x27;s selection was largely because Queen Victoria disliked most of the other leading Liberals. Rosebery was in the House of Lords, but Harcourt controlled the House of Commons, where he often undercut the prime minister.
Rosebery&#x27;s government was largely unsuccessful, as in the Armenian crisis of 1895–96. He spoke out for a strongly pro-Armenian and anti-Turkish policy. Gladstone, a prime minister in retirement, called on Britain to intervene alone. The added pressure weakened Rosebery.

His designs in foreign policy, such as an expansion of the fleet, were defeated by disagreements within the Liberal Party. He angered all the European powers.

The Unionist-dominated House of Lords stopped the whole of the Liberals&#x27; domestic legislation. The strongest figure in the cabinet was Rosebery&#x27;s rival, Harcourt. He and his son Lewis were perennial critics of Rosebery&#x27;s policies. There were two future prime ministers in the Cabinet, Home Secretary H. H. Asquith, and Secretary of State for War Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Rosebery rapidly lost interest in running the government. In the last year of his premiership, he was increasingly haggard: he suffered insomnia due to the continual dissension in his Cabinet.
On 21 June 1895, the government lost a vote in committee on army supply by just seven votes. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Rosebery remained the Liberal leader for another year, then permanently retired from politics.

===Later life===
====Liberal Imperialists====

Rosebery resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on 6 October 1896, to be succeeded by William Harcourt and gradually moved further and further from the mainstream of the party. With the Liberals in opposition divided over the Boer War which started in 1899, Rosebery, although officially politically inactive, emerged as the head of the &quot;Liberal Imperialists&quot; faction of the party, opposed to Irish Home rule. He supported the war, and brought along many nonconformists likewise. However the war was opposed by a younger faction of Liberals, including David Lloyd George and the party leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. 

Rosebery&#x27;s acolytes, including H. H. Asquith and Edward Grey, regularly implored him to return as party leader and even Campbell-Bannerman said he would serve under Rosebery, if he accepted fundamental Liberal party doctrine. In a much trailed speech to the Chesterfield Liberal Association in December 1901, Rosebery was widely expected to announce his return but instead delivered what Harcourt&#x27;s son and private secretary Lewis described as &quot;an insult to the whole past of the Liberal party&quot;, by telling the party to &quot;clean its slate&quot;. In 1902 Rosebery was installed as president of the newly formed &quot;Liberal League&quot; which superseded the Liberal Imperialist League and counted amongst its vice presidents Asquith and Grey.

He was Honorary Colonel of the 1st Midlothian Artillery Volunteers from January 1903 until his death in 1929.

====1905 onwards====

Rosebery&#x27;s positions made it impossible to join the Liberal government that returned to power in 1905. Rosebery turned to writing, including biographies of Lord Chatham, Pitt the Younger, Napoleon, and Lord Randolph Churchill. Another one of his passionate interests was the collecting of rare books.

The last years of his political life saw Rosebery become a purely negative critic of the Liberal governments of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith. His crusade &quot;for freedom as against bureaucracy, for freedom as against democratic tyranny, for freedom as against class legislation, and ... for freedom as against Socialism&quot; was a lonely one, conducted from the crossbenches in the Lords. He joined the die-hard unionist peers in attacking Lloyd George&#x27;s redistributive People&#x27;s Budget in 1909 but stopped short of voting against the measure for fear of bringing retribution upon the Lords. The crisis provoked by the Lords&#x27; rejection of the budget encouraged him to reintroduce his resolutions for Lords reform, but they were lost with the dissolution of parliament in December 1910.

After assaulting the &quot;ill-judged, revolutionary and partisan&quot; terms of the 1911 Parliament Bill, which proposed to curb the Lords&#x27; veto, he voted with the government in what proved to be his last appearance in the House of Lords. This was effectively the end of his public life, though he made several public appearances to support the war effort after 1914 and sponsored a &quot;bantam battalion&quot; in 1915. Though Lloyd George offered him &quot;a high post not involving departmental labour&quot; to augment his 1916 coalition, Rosebery declined to serve.

On 20 March 1878, 31-year-old Rosebery married 27-year-old Hannah de Rothschild (1851–1890), only child and sole heiress of the Jewish banker Mayer Amschel de Rothschild, and the wealthiest British heiress of her day. Her father had died four years previously in 1874, and bequeathed to her the bulk of his estate. The wedding was held (registered) at the office of the Board of Guardians in Mount Street, London. Later the same day, the marriage was blessed at a Christian ceremony in Christ Church, Down Street, Piccadilly. The Prince of Wales and the Queen&#x27;s cousin, the army commander Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, were among the guests who attended the ceremony.

The marriage was a happy one. In January 1878, Rosebery had told a friend that he found Hannah &quot;very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy ... I never knew such a beautiful character.&quot; Hannah&#x27;s death in 1890 from typhoid, compounded by Bright&#x27;s disease, left him distraught.

More than a decade after his wife&#x27;s death, in July 1901, it was speculated that Rosebery intended to marry the widowed Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany, widow of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, youngest son of Queen Victoria. Princess Helena was also the sister of Queen Emma of the Netherlands. However, Rosebery never remarried.

===Progeny===
By his wife Hannah de Rothschild, Rosebery had two sons and two daughters, with whom, according to Margot Asquith, he loved to play:
*Albert Edward Harry Meyer Archibald Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery known as &quot;Harry&quot; (8 January 1882 – 30 May 1974) he married Lady Dorothy Grosvenor (granddaughter of Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster through his third son Lord Henry Grosvenor) on 15 April 1909 and was divorced from her in 1919. They had two children. He married Hon. Eva Isabel Bruce (daughter of Henry Campbell Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare) on 24 June 1924. They had two children.
*Neil James Archibald Primrose (14 December 1882 – 18 November 1917), who married Lady Victoria Stanley (daughter of Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby) on 7 April 1915. They had one daughter: Ruth Wood, Countess of Halifax.
*Lady Sybil Primrose (18 September 1879 – 25 February 1955), who married General Sir Charles Grant on 28 March 1903. They had one son. 
*Lady Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Etrenne Hannah Primrose (1 January 1881 – 13 March 1967), who married Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe on 20 April 1899. They had a son, who died in childhood, and a daughter: Mary Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe. As Lady Crewe, she became one of the first seven women appointed as magistrates in 1919 following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919.

===Sexuality===
Throughout his life, it was rumoured that Rosebery was homosexual or bisexual. He was a notorious misogynist, and liked to surround himself with younger men.

As a student at Eton, beyond his close relationship with his tutor, William Johnson Cory, he likely had feelings for at least one fellow student, Frederick Vyner. He was devastated by Vyner&#x27;s murder at the hands of Greek brigands in 1870, keeping the anniversary sacred for the rest of his life.

Like Oscar Wilde, he was hounded by John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry for his association with Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig, Queensberry&#x27;s first born son – who had become his private secretary in 1892 when Rosebery became Foreign Secretary. A few months later he arranged for Drumlanrig, who was 26 at the time, to be made a junior member of the government with a seat in the House of Lords.

During the preliminary hearing of the case against Wilde, a letter from Queensberry was produced referring to him as &#x27;a damned cur and coward of the Rosebery type&#x27;.

On 18 October 1894, sixteen months after his ennoblement, Drumlanrig died from injuries received during a shooting party. The inquest returned a verdict of &quot;accidental death&quot;, but his death was rumoured potentially to be suicide or murder. It was speculated at the time that Drumlanrig may have had a romantic, if not sexual, relationship with Rosebery.

The suggestion was that Queensberry had threatened to expose the Prime Minister if his government did not vigorously prosecute Wilde for the latter&#x27;s relationship with Drumlanrig&#x27;s younger brother, Lord Alfred Douglas. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that &quot;Snob Queers like Rosebery&quot; had corrupted his sons, and he held Rosebery indirectly responsible for Drumlanrig&#x27;s death. He claimed to have evidence of Rosebery&#x27;s transgressions but that was never confirmed.

Using a minor defeat in Parliament that did not warrant such action, Rosebery resigned from the Premiership on 22 June 1895. This was a few months after the death of Drumlanrig and not quite a month after Wilde was convicted on 25 May, his life and reputation destroyed by a man who was also pursuing Rosebery for the same reason he was after Wilde. In August 1893, Queensberry had followed Rosebery to the spa town of Bad Homburg with the declared intention of giving him a horse-whipping, and had to be dissuaded by the Prince of Wales who was also staying there.

In his recollections, Rosebery wrote: &quot;I cannot forget 1895. To lie awake night after night, wide awake, hopeless of sleep, tormented of nerves, and to realise all that was going on, at which I was present, so to speak, like a disembodied spirit, to watch one&#x27;s own corpse, as it were day after day, is an experience which no sane man would repeat.&quot;

Sir Edmund Backhouse wrote in his unpublished memoirs that he had been one of Rosebery&#x27;s lovers – although it has been suggested that many of Backhouse&#x27;s claims were dubiously made.

Robert Rhodes James, who wrote a biography of Rosebery in 1963 (when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain), makes no mention of homosexual relationships at all, while for Leo McKinstry, who was writing in 2005, the evidence that Rosebery was homosexual is circumstantial. Michael Bloch, in 2015, has, however, no doubt that Rosebery was at least romantically interested in men, making him one of the four figures presented in the first chapter of his book on homosexual and bisexual British politicians of the 20th century. In his view, any remaining evidence (of which he gives a long list) can only be circumstantial in any case, considering Rosebery&#x27;s paranoid taste for secrecy.

==Death and burial==

The last year of the war was clouded by two personal tragedies: his son Neil&#x27;s death in Palestine in November 1917 and Rosebery&#x27;s own stroke a few days before the armistice. He regained his mental powers, but his movement, hearing, and sight remained impaired for the rest of his life. His sister Constance described his last years as a &quot;life of weariness, of total inactivity, and at the last of almost blindness&quot;. John Buchan remembered him in his last month of life, &quot;crushed by bodily weakness&quot; and &quot;sunk in sad and silent meditations&quot;.

Rosebery died at his Epsom, Surrey home of The Durdans on 21 May 1929, to the accompaniment, as he had requested, of a gramophone recording of the &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot;. Survived by three of his four children, he was buried in the small church at Dalmeny. By the time of his death, he was the last Victorian-era British Prime Minister alive.

==Sporting interests==
===Horse racing===
As a result of his marriage to Hannah de Rothschild, Rosebery acquired the Mentmore Towers estate and Mentmore stud near Leighton Buzzard which had been built by Mayer Amschel de Rothschild. Rosebery built another stable and stud near Mentmore Towers at Crafton, Buckinghamshire, called Crafton Stud.

Rosebery won several of the five English Classic Races. His most famous horses were Ladas who won the 1894 Derby, Sir Visto who won it in 1895 (Rosebery was Prime Minister on both occasions), and Cicero in 1905.

===Football===

Rosebery became the first president of the London Scottish Rugby Football Club in 1878, also developed a keen interest in association football and was an early patron of the sport in Scotland. In 1882 he donated a trophy, the Rosebery Charity Cup, to be competed for by clubs under the jurisdiction of the East of Scotland Football Association. The competition lasted over sixty years and raised thousands of pounds for charities in the Edinburgh area.

Rosebery also became Honorary President of the national Scottish Football Association, with the representative Scotland national team and Honorary President of Heart of Midlothian. The national team occasionally forsook their traditional dark blue shirts for his traditional racing colours of primrose and pink. This occurred nine times during Rosebery&#x27;s lifetime, most notably for the 1900 British Home Championship match against England, which the Scots won 4–1. These colours were used for the away kit of the Scotland national team in 2014 and were Heart of Midlothian&#x27;s away colours for season 2016/17.

==Literary interests==
He was a keen collector of fine books and amassed an excellent library. It was sold on 29 October 2009 at Sotheby&#x27;s, New Bond Street. Rosebery unveiled the statue of Robert Burns in Dumfries on 6 April 1882.

==Landholdings==

Rosebery was the owner of twelve houses. By marriage, he acquired:
*Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, a huge neo-Renaissance stately home, sold in the 1970s
*Number 40, Piccadilly, in London.
With his fortune, he bought:
*Malleny House and Garden in 1882
*a shooting lodge at Carrington in Midlothian
*a Georgian villa at Postwick in Norfolk
*In 1897, he bought Villa Delahente in Posillipo, overlooking the Bay of Naples, currently an official residence of the President of the Italian Republic, still known as Villa Rosebery
*38 Berkeley Square, London
*The Durdans, Epsom, where he died in 1929.
As Earl of Rosebery, he was laird of:
*Dalmeny House on the banks of the Firth of Forth (pictured)
*Barnbougle Castle in the grounds of Dalmeny Estate, used by Rosebery (an insomniac) for privacy.
He rented:
*a home in Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh, during World War I
*Lansdowne House, in London, from the Marquess of Lansdowne.

==Legacy and evaluations==
Rosebery&#x27;s position in British politics was puzzling to contemporaries and historians due to the enigmatic nature of his private and public lives. He had an air of privileged detachment, which persisted throughout his brief stint in the political limelight and his significant years in the background. Although he was an orator and statesman in the mold of his original leader, Gladstone, his fifteen-month term as Liberal Prime Minister in 1894-5 was an unhappy spectacle. Lord Rosebery&#x27;s failure to live up to his potential disappointed Liberals of all kinds. Journalists and biographers have criticized his lack of character and sense of failure, possibly influenced by his Scottish Calvinist upbringing. Despite his love for luxury and pleasure, his motives for leaving and returning to politics may not have been solely self-indulgent. He was known for his passion for racehorses, even ending his studies at Oxford to pursue them.

===Place-name tributes===
The &quot;Oatlands&quot; area in the South Side of Glasgow was laid out in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, contemporary with Rosebery&#x27;s most prominent period. The area is much changed since it was originally laid out, but several of the original street names had an association with him or areas around his estate to the northwest of Edinburgh: Rosebery Street, Dalmeny Street, Queensferry Street, Granton Street and Cramond Street.

In London, Rosebery Avenue, running between Holborn and Clerkenwell, was named after him, in recognition of his service as the London County Council&#x27;s first chairman.

Rosebery, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, is named after him. A major street, Dalmeny Avenue, runs through the area. Rosebery, Tasmania is also named after him, via the name of a mining company. Dalmeny, New South Wales, a suburb on the New South Wales South Coast, is named after him. Roseberry Avenue in the suburb of South Perth, Western Australia, is also named after him. The former township of Rosebery in South Australia (now part of Collinswood) was named for him, as was modern-day Rosebery Lane in Collinswood. Rosebery in the north west of Victoria, some 15 km south of Hopetoun is also named after him.

Rosebery House, Epsom College, in Epsom, is named after him.
Rosebery School sits on an area of land given to the borough by Lord Rosebery.

In October 1895 Lord Rosebery opened the new &quot;Liberal Club&quot; on Westborough, in Scarborough, only months after resigning as Prime Minister. The building now houses a Wetherspoons, which is named in his honour.

<doc id="232643" wikidata="Q11493441" url="?curid=232643" title="Significant other">
<text>The term significant other (SO) has different uses in psychology and colloquial language. Colloquially, &quot;significant other&quot; is used as a gender-neutral term for a person&#x27;s partner in an intimate relationship without disclosing or presuming anything about marital status, relationship status, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Synonyms with similar properties include sweetheart, other half, better half, spouse, domestic partner, lover, , soulmate, and life partner.

==Scientific use==
Its usage in psychology and sociology is very different from its colloquial use. In psychology, a significant other is any person who has great importance to an individual&#x27;s life or well-being. In sociology, it describes any person or persons with a strong influence on an individual&#x27;s self-concept. Although the influence of significant others on individuals was long theorized, the first actual measurements of the influence of significant others on individuals were made by Archie O. Haller, Edward L. Fink, and Joseph Woelfel at the University of Wisconsin.

Haller, Fink, and Woelfel are associates of the Wisconsin model of status attainment. They surveyed 100 Wisconsin adolescents, measured their educational and occupational aspirations, and identified the set of other individuals who communicated with the students and served as examples for them. They then contacted the significant others directly measured their expectations for the adolescent&#x27;s educational and occupational attainments, and calculated the impact of these expectations on the aspirations of the students. Results of the research showed that the expectations of significant others were the single most potent influences on the student&#x27;s aspirations. This usage is synonymous with the term &quot;relevant other&quot; and can also be found in plural form, &quot;significant others&quot;.

In social psychology, a significant other is an &quot;insulating person&quot;, uncle/aunt, grandparent, guardian, or teacher – the person who guides and takes care of a child during primary socialization. The significant other protects, rewards, and punishes the child as a way of aiding the child&#x27;s development. This usually takes about six or seven years, after which the significant other is no longer needed, and the child moves on to a general &quot;other&quot; which is not a real person, but an abstract notion of what society deems good or bad.

==First use==
The first known use of the terms &quot;significant other person&quot; and &quot;significant other people&quot; is by the U.S. psychiatrist Harry Stack Sullivan in the article &quot;Conceptions of Modern Psychiatry&quot; in the journal: &quot;Psychiatry: Journal of the Biology and Pathology of Interpersonal Relations&quot;, published in 1940. The phrase was popularised in the United States by Armistead Maupin&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;Significant Others&quot;, and in the UK by the 1989 TV series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, in which Derek Trotter uses the phrase a number of times when referring to his long-term partner Raquel Turner.

<text>The 1966 Lunar Orbiter 1 robotic spacecraft mission, part of NASA&#x27;s Lunar Orbiter program, was the first American spacecraft to orbit the Moon. It was designed primarily to photograph smooth areas of the lunar surface for selection and verification of safe landing sites for the Surveyor and Apollo missions. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data.

==Mission summary==
Mission controllers injected the spacecraft into a parking orbit around Earth on August 10, 1966, at 19:31 UTC. The trans-lunar injection burn occurred at 20:04 UTC. The spacecraft experienced a temporary failure of the Canopus star tracker (probably due to stray sunlight) and overheating during its cruise to the Moon. The star tracker problem was resolved by navigating using the Moon as a reference, and the overheating was abated by orienting the spacecraft 36 degrees off-Sun to lower the temperature.

Lunar Orbiter 1 was injected into an elliptical near-equatorial lunar orbit 92.1 hours after launch. The initial orbit was and had a period of 3 hours 37 minutes and an inclination of 12.2 degrees. On August 21, perilune was dropped to and on August 25 to . The spacecraft acquired photographic data from August 18 to 29, 1966, and readout occurred through September 14, 1966.

A total of 42 high-resolution and 187 medium-resolution frames were taken and transmitted to Earth covering more than 5 million square kilometers of the Moon&#x27;s surface, accomplishing about 75% of the intended mission, although a number of the early high-resolution photos showed severe smearing. It also took the first two pictures of Earth from the Moon. Accurate data were acquired from all other experiments throughout the mission.

While not disclosed until after the end of the Cold War, the imaging system on the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft were the same Eastman Kodak cameras developed by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) for the SAMOS reconnaissance satellites. NASA extended the camera innovation further by developing the film onboard the spacecraft and then scanning the photos for transmission via a video signal.

Orbit tracking showed a slight &quot;pear-shape&quot; of the Moon based on the gravity field, and no micrometeorite impacts were detected. The spacecraft was tracked until it impacted the lunar surface on command at 7 degrees north latitude, 161 degrees east longitude (selenographic coordinates) on the Moon&#x27;s far side on October 29, 1966, on its 577th orbit. The early end of the nominal one-year mission resulted from a shortage of remaining attitude control gas and other deteriorating conditions and was planned to avoid transmission interference with Lunar Orbiter 2.

<doc id="232653" wikidata="Q191713" url="?curid=232653" title="Hussar">
<text>A hussar was a member of a class of light cavalry, originally from the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15th and 16th centuries. The title and distinctive dress of these horsemen were subsequently widely adopted by light cavalry regiments in European armies during the late 17th and 18th centuries. By the 19th century, hussars were wearing jackets decorated with braid plus shako or busby fur hats and had developed a romanticized image of being dashing and adventurous.

Several modern armies retain the designation of hussars for armored (tank) units. In addition, a number of mounted units survive which wear historical hussar uniforms on parade or while providing ceremonial escorts.

Historically, the term derives from the cavalry of late medieval Hungary, under Matthias Corvinus, with mainly Serb warriors.

==Etymology== 

Etymologists are divided over the derivation of the word &quot;hussar&quot;. Several alternative theories are summarised below:

* According to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;hussar&quot; stems from the Hungarian , which in turn originates from the medieval Serbian (Cyrillic: , or , Cyrillic: ), meaning brigand (because early hussars&#x27; shock troops tactics used against the Ottoman army resembled that of brigands; in modern Serbian the meaning of is limited to sea pirate), from the Medieval Latin (cf. the English word &quot;corsair&quot;).
* Another theory is that the term is an original Hungarian one, having nothing in common with the Serbian . The hussars&#x27; tactics and riding skills were characteristic of the early Hungarian warriors and in the ancient and early medieval ages were used by many ethnicities on the Eurasian steppe, like Huns, Avars, Pechenegs, Cumans and later by the Mongols and Tatars. This type of light cavalry was especially characteristic of the Hungarian armies, at first equipped with bows, arrows, spears, and sabres, which were only later exchanged for rifles and carbines.
* The first written use of the word (in Latin, plural; in Hungarian: ) is found in documents dating from 1432 in Southern Hungary (at the time an area of the Kingdom of Hungary bordering the Ottoman Empire). A type of irregular light horsemen was already well-established by the 15th century in medieval Hungary. 
* Byzantinist scholars argue that the term originated in Roman military practice, and the (singular ). 10th-century Byzantine military manuals mention , light cavalry, recruited in the Balkans, especially Serbs, &quot;ideal for scouting and raiding&quot;. This word was subsequently reintroduced to Western European military practice after its original usage had been lost with the collapse of Rome in the west.
* A further premise notes that means &#x27;twenty&#x27; in Hungarian whilst is a unit of land measurement or acre. Accordingly, it is suggested that Hussars are so named as they were a form of military levy introduced after 1458 whereby any landowner with twenty acres was duty bound to provide a mounted and equipped (peasant origin) soldier to the king&#x27;s army at his own expense.

==Origins==
===Early Hungarian hussars===
The hussars reportedly originated in bands of Serb warriors, crossing into southern Hungary after the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in the late 14th century. Regent-Governor John Hunyadi created mounted units inspired by the Ottomans. His son, Matthias Corvinus, later king of Hungary, is claimed to be the creator of these troops, commonly called &quot;Rác&quot; (a Hungarian exonym for Serbs). Initially, they fought in small bands, but were reorganised into larger, trained formations during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus.

The medieval Hungarian written sources spoke disparagingly and contemptuously of the light cavalry and the hussars in general, and during battles the texts praised only the virtues, endurance, courage, training and achievements of the knights. No wonder, since during the Middle Ages the Hungarian noble origin soldiers served exclusively as heavy armoured cavalry.

The first hussar regiments comprised the light cavalry of the Black Army of Hungary. Under Corvinus&#x27;s command, the hussars took part in the war against the Ottoman Empire in 1485 and proved successful against the &quot;sipahis&quot; (Ottoman cavalry) as well as against the Bohemians and Poles. After the king&#x27;s death, in 1490, hussars became the standard form of cavalry in Hungary in addition to the heavy cavalry. Their role was limited to irregular warfare, raiding, securing, covering and reconnaissance of main regular forces. According to Antonio Bonfini, this lightly armed cavalry (expeditissimus equitatus) was not allowed to be part of the regular army, when the order of the battle was formed, but was placed outside it in quite separate groups and used to destroy, burn, kill and instil fear in the civilian population, while they rode ahead of the regular army.

The 16th and 17th centuries saw a major change and during the Thirty Years&#x27; War they fought as light cavalry and increasingly used firearms, instead of more traditional weapons such as bows and spears. The Habsburg emperors hired Hungarian hussars as mercenaries to serve against the Ottomans and on various battlefields throughout Western Europe.

Early hussars wore armor when they could afford it, as did the later Polish hussars. Hungarian hussars abandoned the use of shields and, at a later date, armor; becoming entirely light cavalry in the first half of the 17th century.

===Polish hussars===
Initially the first units of Polish Hussars in the Kingdom of Poland were formed around 1500.

The Polish heavy hussars of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were far more manoeuvrable than the heavily armoured lancers previously employed. The hussars proved vital to the Polish–Lithuanian victories at the Orsza (1514), the Obertyn (1531) and the Battle of Vienna (1683).

Over the course of the 16th century, hussars in Transylvania and Hungary became heavier in character: they had abandoned wooden shields and adopted plate-metal body armour. When Stephen Báthory, a Transylvanian-Hungarian prince, was elected King of Poland in 1576, he reorganised the Polish–Lithuanian Hussars of his Royal Guard along Hungarian lines, making them a heavy formation, equipped with a long lance as their main weapon. Under his reign, the hussars replaced medieval-style lancers in the Polish–Lithuanian army, and they formed the bulk of the Polish cavalry. By the 1590s, most Polish–Lithuanian hussar units had been reformed along the same &quot;heavy&quot;, Hungarian model. Due to the same resemblance, the Polish heavy hussars came with their own style, the Polish winged hussars or Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth winged &quot;husaria&quot;.

In the Battle of Lubieszów, in 1577, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the husaria began. Up to and including the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Polish–Lithuanian hussars fought countless actions against a variety of enemies. In the battles of Byczyna (1588), Kokenhusen (1601), Kircholm (1605), Kłuszyn (1610), Trzciana (1629), Chocim (1673) and Lwów (1675), the Polish–Lithuanian hussars proved to be the decisive factor, often against overwhelming odds.

Until the 18th century, they were considered the elite of the Commonwealth&#x27;s armed forces.

===Croatian hussars===
Croatian hussar units, often designated simply as &quot;Croats&quot;, were raised from the Kingdom of Hungary Military Frontier, Croatian-Slavonian and the Kingdom of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia. One notable captain and chief officer of hussars was Petar Keglević. In 1578, Charles II took command of the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontier and prepared written orders and rule of service for infantry (Haramije) and horsemen (hussars), using the Serbo-Croatian language. The oldest written trace of the surname Husar in Croatia is from 1507 in Vinica where Petrus Hwzar (Petar Husar) was mentioned, in a document dated 1598 entitled &quot;Regestum&quot;, mention was made of &quot;hussar&quot; at Lobor (&quot;Castrum Lobor cum suis pertinentiis portiones magnificorum dominorum Joannis et Petri Keglyewich…“&quot;Blasius Hwszar&quot;, Inq(uilinus)”. A second reference to &quot;hussar&quot; appeared in 1613 from Krapina (&quot;desertum Joannes &quot;Huszar&quot; de vinea cb – qr j”).

Croatian hussars were irregular light horsemen characteristic of the Habsburg-Ottoman border area. Croatian units were not inevitably referred as &quot;Croats&quot; but it was the most commonly used name. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War other designations used were &quot;Wallachen, Uskocken, Raitzen, Granitscharen, Insulaner, Wenden, Polen, Türken i Zigeuner&quot;. Amongst the Croatian hussars could be found other ethno-political groups, such as Hungarians, Serbs, Albanians, Romanians, Poles, Vlachs and Cossacks. Croatian hussars participated in the siege of Magdeburg which was led by Johann Tserclaes as well as the sieges of Heidelberg, Frankenthal, Manheim, Breitenfeld, Lützen, Nördlingen, Wittstock and Breitenfeld.

Between 1746 and 1750, four Grenz Hussar (border) regiments were established: the Karlovac, the Varaždin, the Slavonian and the Syrmia Regiments. The Croatian-Slavonian Grenz Hussars took part in the campaigns of 1793–94 against Revolutionary France In 1751, Maria Theresa prescribed a distinctive hussar uniform.

==History==

=== 18th century European hussar formations ===
Hussars throughout Europe followed a different line of development than the Polish hussars. During the early decades of the 17th century, hussars in Hungary ceased to wear metal body armour; and, by 1640, most were light cavalry. It was hussars of this &quot;light&quot; pattern, rather than the Polish heavy hussar, that were later to be copied across Europe. These light hussars were ideal for reconnaissance and raiding sources of fodder and provisions in advance of the army.

In battle, they were used in such light cavalry roles as harassing enemy skirmishers, overrunning artillery positions, and pursuing fleeing troops. In many countries, the hussars and bosniaks actually retained their original Asiatic uniforms. In the late 17th and 18th centuries, many Hungarian hussars sought employment in other Central and Western European countries and became the core of similar light cavalry formations created there. Following their example, hussar regiments were introduced into at least twelve European armies by 1800.

Bavaria raised its first hussar regiment in 1688 and a second one in about 1700. Prussia followed suit in 1721 when Frederick the Great used hussar units extensively during the War of the Austrian Succession.

France established a number of hussar regiments from 1692 onward, recruiting originally from Hungary and Germany, then subsequently from German-speaking frontier regions within France itself. The first hussar regiment in the French army was the &quot;Hussars-Royaux&quot; (Royal Hussars), raised from Hungarian deserters in 1692.

Spain disbanded its first hussars in 1747 and then raised new units of Húsares in 1795. The Húsares de Pavía were created in 1684 by the Count of Melgar to serve in Spanish possessions in Italy and were named after the Spanish victory over the French army at Pavia, south of Milan, Italy. During the battle, the King of France, Francis I, was captured by the Spanish Cavalry. The Húsares de Pavía fought in Italy during the Nine Years&#x27; War (1692–1695) and the War of Spanish Succession, it was transferred back to Spain. In 1719, the regiment was sent again to Italy until 1746.
Then, it served in campaigns against Algerian pirates and in the sieges of Oran and Algiers. During the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleon (1808–1814), the unit fought the Battles of Bailén, Tudela, Velez, Talavera and Ocaña and the actions of Baza, Cuellar, Murviedro and Alaquàs.

The Húsares de Pavía regiment also was involved in the Ten Years&#x27; War in Cuba, the Spanish–American War (1898), the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and in the Ifni War (1958). Ifni was a Spanish colony in North Africa that was attacked by irregulars from Morocco. At present, this regiment is named Regimiento Acorazado de Caballería Pavía nr 4 (Cavalry armored regiment Pavia nr 4) and is garrisoned in Zaragoza (Spain).

Sweden had hussars from about 1756 and Denmark introduced this class of cavalry in 1762. Britain converted a number of light dragoon regiments to hussars in the early 19th century.

The Dutch Republic took a Bavarian regiment into service in 1745 (Regiment Frangipani). Several new regiments and corps were raised in 1747 and 1748, but eventually these existed only on paper. One regiment, the &quot;Statenhuzaren&quot; (&#x27;States&#x27; Hussars&#x27;) remained, but was disbanded in 1752. In 1784, two free companies of hussars were raised, which were taken into service after 1787 and would become two full regiments. These would be united into one regiment in 1795, which would be the 2nd Regiment of the Kingdom of Holland in 1806, with a 3rd Hussars being raised that same year, as well as a Guard Hussars Regiment. The Guard Hussars would become the 2eme Regiment Chevaux-Legeres Lanciers of the Imperial Guard (The Red Lancers) after 1810; the 3rd was disbanded; the 2nd being incorporated into the French line as the 11eme Regiment. 

After regaining independence, the new Royal Netherlands Army raised two hussar regiments (nrs. 6 and 8). They were disbanded (nr. 8 in 1830), or converted to lancers (nr. 6 in 1841). In 1867, all remaining cavalry regiments were transferred to hussar regiments. This tradition remains to this day, with the last surviving hussar regiment (Boreel&#x27;s, 103rd and 104th reconnaissance squadrons) carrying on the tradition of all Dutch cavalry predecessors.

====Russian Empire formation of hussar regiments====
 
Russia relied on its native cossacks along with kalmyks and other nomads to provide irregular light cavalry until the mid-18th century. In 1707, Apostol Kigetsch, a Wallachian nobleman serving Russian Emperor Peter the Great, was given the task to form a &quot;khorugv&quot; (&quot;banner&quot; or &quot;squadron&quot;) of 300 men to serve on the Ottoman-Russian border. The squadron consisted of Christians from Hungary, Serbia, Moldavia, and Wallachia. In 1711, prior to the Pruth campaign, 6 regiments (4 khorugv&#x27;s each) of hussars were formed, mainly from Wallachia. Two other &quot;khorugv&quot;, for guerilla warfare, were formed, one Polish and one Serbian, to battle the Ottomans. In 1723, Peter the Great formed a Hussar regiment exclusively from Serbian light cavalry serving in the Austrian army. On 14 October 1741, during the regency of Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna, four Hussar regiments, a Serbian (&quot;Serbskiy&quot;), a Moldavian (&quot;Moldavskiy&quot;), a Hungarian (&quot;Vengerskiy&quot;) and a Georgian (&quot;Gruzinskiy&quot;) were authorized.

After the Russo-Turkish War (1735–39), these Hussar regiments were converted to regular service, voluntarily enlisted and not conscripted as the rest of the Russian army. They were on a level between regular and irregular cavalry. Hussars were recruited only from the nation indicated by the regiment&#x27;s name, i.e., these regiments were national units in Russian service; all troops (including officers) were national, and commands were given in the respective languages. Each regiment was supposed to have a fixed organization of 10 companies, each of about 100 men, but these regiments were recruited from different sources, so they were less than the indicated strength.

By 1741, the foreign hussars in Russian service had disbanded and reliance for light cavalry functions was again placed on the indigenous Cossack irregulars. In that year new hussar regiments were raised, now drawn from Orthodox Christian communities along the Turkish frontier. The newly raised Russian hussar units had increased to 12 regiments by the Seven Years&#x27; War. During the 1750s Serbian and Slovakian Orthodox communities and refugees, plus Poles and Hungarians, provided non-Russian recruits for the expanding hussars who evolved into a semi-regular corps of frontier light horse. In 1759–60, three more Hussar regiments, were raised, the Yellow (&quot;Želtiy&quot;), the Macedonian (&quot;Makedonskiy&quot;) and the Bulgarian (&quot;Bolgarskiy&quot;).

====Hussars of Prussia&#x27;s Frederick the Great====

During and after Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence, many Hungarians served in the Habsburg army. Located in garrisons far away from Hungary, some deserted from the Austrian army and joined that of Prussia. The value of the Hungarian hussars as light cavalry was recognised and, in 1721, two Hussaren Corps were organised in the Prussian Army.

Frederick II (later called &quot;The Great&quot;) recognised the value of hussars as light cavalry and encouraged their recruitment. In 1741, he established a further five regiments, largely from Polish deserters. Three more regiments were raised for Prussian service in 1744 and another in 1758. While the hussars were increasingly drawn from Prussian and other German cavalrymen, they continued to wear the traditional Hungarian uniform, richly decorated with braid and gold trim.

Possibly due to a daring and impudent surprise raid on his capital, Berlin, by the hussars of Hungarian general András Hadik, Frederick also recognised the national characteristics of his Hungarian recruits and, in 1759, issued a royal order which warned the Prussian officers never to offend the self-esteem of his hussars with insults and abuse. At the same time, he exempted the hussars from the usual disciplinary measures of the Prussian Army, such as physical punishments including cudgeling.

Frederick used his hussars for reconnaissance duties and for surprise attacks against the enemy&#x27;s flanks and rear. A hussar regiment under the command of Colonel Sigismund Dabasi-Halász helped win the Battle of Hohenfriedberg at Striegau on May 4, 1745, by attacking the Austrian combat formation on its flank and capturing all of its artillery.

The effectiveness of the hussars in Frederick&#x27;s army can be judged by the number of promotions and decorations awarded to their officers. Recipients included the Hungarian generals Pal Werner and Ferenc Kőszeghy, who received the highest Prussian military order, the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;; General Tivadar Ruesh was awarded the title of baron; Mihály Székely was promoted from the rank of captain to general after less than fifteen years of service.

While Hungarian hussars served in the opposing armies of Frederick and Maria Theresa, there were no known instances of fratricidal clashes between them.

====Hussar Verbunkos====
Verbunkos (; other spellings are Verbounko, Verbunko, Verbunkas, Werbunkos, Werbunkosch, Verbunkoche) is an 18th-century Hungarian dance and music genre.

The name is derived from the German word &quot;werben&quot; that means, in particular, &quot;to enroll in the army&quot;; verbunkos means recruiter. The corresponding music and dance were performed during military recruiting, which was a frequent event during this period, hence the character of the music. The verbunkos was an important component of the Hungarian hussar tradition. Potential recruits were dressed in items of hussar uniform, given wine to drink and invited to dance to this music.

===19th century: hussar deployment worldwide===

==== The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ====
The hussars played a prominent role as cavalry in the Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) and Napoleonic Wars (1803–15). As light cavalrymen mounted on fast horses, they would be used to fight skirmish battles and for scouting. Most of the great European powers raised hussar regiments. The armies of France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia had included hussar regiments since the mid-18th century. In the case of Britain, four light dragoon regiments were converted to hussars in 1806–1807.

The hussars of the period created the tradition of sabrage, the opening of a champagne bottle with a sabre. Moustaches were universally worn by Napoleonic-era hussars; the British hussars were the only moustachioed troops in the British Army—leading to their being taunted as being &quot;foreigners&quot;, at times. French hussars also wore &quot;cadenettes&quot;, braids of hair hanging on either side of the face and held in place by pistol balls, until the practice was officially proscribed when shorter hair became universal.

The uniform of the Napoleonic hussars included the pelisse, a short fur-edged jacket which was often worn slung over one shoulder in the style of a cape and was fastened with a cord. This garment was extensively adorned with braiding (often gold or silver for officers) and several rows of buttons. The dolman or tunic, which was also decorated in braid, was worn under it. The hussar&#x27;s accoutrements included a Hungarian-style saddle covered by a shabraque: a decorated saddlecloth with long, pointed corners surmounted by a sheepskin.

On active service, the hussar normally wore reinforced breeches which had leather on the inside of the leg to prevent them from wearing due to the extensive time spent in the saddle. On the outside of such breeches, running up each outer side, was a row of buttons, and sometimes a stripe in a different colour. A shako or fur &quot;kolpac&quot; (busby) was worn as headwear. The colours of the dolman, pelisse and breeches varied greatly by regiment, even within the same army.

The French hussar of the Napoleonic period was armed with a brass-hilted sabre, a carbine and sometimes with a brace of pistols, although these were often unavailable. A famous military commander in Bonaparte&#x27;s army who began his military career as a hussar was Marshal Ney, who, after being employed as a clerk in an iron works, joined the 5th Hussars in 1787. He rose through the ranks of the hussars in the wars of Belgium and the Rhineland (1794–1798), fighting against the forces of Austria and Prussia before receiving his marshal&#x27;s baton in 1804, after the Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s coronation.

In the British Army, hussar cavalry were introduced at a later date than in other major European armies. Towards the end of the 18th century, British light dragoon regiments began to adopt hussar style accoutrements such as laced jackets, pelisses and sabretaches. In 1805, four light dragoon regiments were permitted to use the &quot;hussar&quot; name, initially in parentheses after their regimental title and adopted full hussar uniforms. British hussars were armed with, in addition to firearms, the highly regarded 1796-pattern light-cavalry sabre.
There were several Russian regiments of hussars by the time of Napoleonic Wars and extensive use was made of them.

====Eastern Europe====
Although the Romanian cavalry were not formally designated as hussars, their pre-1915 uniforms, as described below, were of the classic hussar type. These regiments were created in the second part of the 19th century, under the rule of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, creator of Romania by the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia. Romania diplomatically avoided the word &quot;hussar&quot; due to its connotation at the time with Austria-Hungary, traditional rival of the Romanian principates. Therefore, these cavalry regiments were called &quot;&quot;Călărași&quot; in Moldavia, and later the designation &quot;Roșiori&quot;&quot; was adopted in Wallachia. (The word &quot;călăraș&quot; means &quot;mounted soldier&quot;, and &quot;roșior&quot; means &quot;of red colour&quot; which derived from the colour of their uniform.) The three (later expanded to ten) Roșiori regiments were the regular units, while the Călărași were territorial reserve cavalry who supplied their own horses.

These troops played an important role in the Romanian Independence War of 1877, on the Russo-Turkish front. The Roșiori, as their Romanian name implies, wore red dolmans with black braiding while the Călărași wore dark blue dolmans with red loopings. Both wore fur busbies and white plumes. The Roșiori regiments were distinguished by the different colours of their cloth busby bags (yellow, white, green, light blue, light green, dark blue, light brown, lilac, pink and light grey according to regiment). The Regimentul 1 Roșiori &quot;General de armată Alexandru Averescu&quot; was formed in 1871, while the Regimentul 4 Roșiori &quot;Regina Maria&quot; was created in 1893.

After World War I, the differences between the two branches of Romanian cavalry disappeared, although the titles of Roșiori and Călărași remained. Both types of cavalry served through World War II on the Russian front as mounted and mechanised units.
====Latin America====
In Argentina, the &#x27;Regimiento de Húsares del Rey&#x27; was created in 1806 to defend Buenos Aires from the British 1806–1807 expeditions. After the revolution in 1810, it became the &#x27;Regimiento Húsares de Pueyrredón&#x27; after its founder and first colonel, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón. Today, its traditions and historic name and uniform are kept by the 8th Tank Regiment of the Argentinian Army.

In Chile, the &quot;Regimiento de Húsares de la Gran Guardia Nacional&quot; (Grand National Guard Hussars Regiment) was created by José Miguel Carrera, who was himself previously a hussar in the Spanish Army. In 1813, as part of the army of the newly independent Chile, the regiment fought against the Spanish Army until its defeat at the disaster of the Battle of Rancagua. It was dissolved by José de San Martín after the Chilean Army fled to Argentina. In addition, the &#x27;Húsares de la Muerte&#x27;, or &#x27;Death Hussars&#x27;, were created as a paramilitary corps by Manuel Rodríguez after the &#x27;Desastre de Cancha Rayada&#x27; (Disaster of Cancha Rayada) on 26 March 1818, during the period known as the Patria Vieja (Old Fatherland).

In Peru, the squadrons of &quot;Hussars of the Peruvian Legion of the Guard&quot; were created in 1821 by General José de San Martín, from officers and troopers of the Squadron of &quot;Hussars of the General&#x27;s Escort&quot;, the former Squadron of Horse-Chasseurs of the Andes, which were included in the new army of the newly independent republic of Peru.

The 4th Squadron of the Hussars of the Peruvian Legion of the Guard was organized in Trujillo under the command of Peruvian Colonel Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. Originally designated as &quot;Cuirassiers&quot; in 1823, it became the &quot;Hussars of Perú&quot; Squadron in 1824.

It was renamed &quot;Hussars of Junín&quot; for its performance in 1824 at the Battle of Junín, which was one of the Spanish-Peruvian battles which determined the final defeat of Spanish colonial rule.

The Hussars of Junín fought at the Battle of Ayacucho on 9 December 1824, among the liberating forces commanded by Antonio de Sucre against the Royalist Spanish forces commanded by Viceroy José de la Serna. The heroic action of the Hussars of Junín Regiment as part of the light cavalry commanded by General José María Córdova was victorious, the battle eventuating in the capitulation of the Spanish forces, affirming the final independence of Peru. For this heroic action, the &quot;Hussars of Junín&quot; Light Cavalry Regiment was declared the &quot;Liberator of Perú&quot; with an inscription on the regimental flag.

====North America====

In the United States, the Georgia Hussars were a cavalry regiment founded before the American Revolution that continues today as part of the Georgia National Guard. The Hussars served the State of Georgia as part of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, and after reconciliation served in Mexico, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and The War on Terror. Another famous Confederate regiment designated as Hussars were the 1st Virginia Cavalry, known as the Black Horse Troop. Their grey uniforms had black facings, and unique rows of braid across the chest.

The Union army had two hussar regiments during the Civil War. The 3rd New Jersey Cavalry, nicknamed the Butterflies, wore dark blue pelisses with yellow braid, short blue cloaks with red lining, and a distinctive peakless forage cap similar to the British army. The 5th Missouri Cavalry, known as the Benton Hussars, wore sky blue uniforms with dark blue facings and chest braid. On campaign, a kepi was worn in place of the traditional fur cap. The Benton Hussars served as General Charles S. Hamilton&#x27;s elite bodyguard, and distinguished themselves at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Iuka in 1862.

===Hussars in the early 20th century===
On the eve of World War I, there were still hussar regiments in the British, Canadian, French, New Zealand, Spanish, German, Russian, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Romanian, and Austro-Hungarian armies. In most respects, they had now become regular light cavalry, recruited solely from their own countries and trained and equipped along the same lines as other classes of cavalry. But Hussars were still notable for their colourful and elaborate parade uniforms, the most spectacular of which were those worn by the two Spanish regiments, Húsares de Pavía and Húsares de la Princesa.

A characteristic of both the Imperial German and Russian Hussars was the variety of colours apparent in their dress uniforms. These included red, black, green, dark and light blue, brown and even pink (the Russian 15th Hussars) dolmans. Most Russian hussar regiments wore red breeches, as did all the Austro-Hungarian hussars of 1914. This rainbow-effect harked back to the 18th-century origins of hussar regiments in these armies and helped regrouping after battle or a charge.

The fourteen French hussar regiments were an exception to this rule – they wore the same relatively simple uniform, with only minor distinctions, as the other branches of French light cavalry. This comprised a shako, light blue tunic and red breeches. The twelve British hussar regiments were distinguished by different coloured busby bags and a few other distinctions such as the yellow plumes of the 20th, the buff collars of the 13th and the crimson breeches of the 11th Hussars.

Hussar influences were apparent even in those armies which did not formally include hussar regiments. Thus, both the Belgian Guides (prior to World War I) and the Mounted Escort, the so-called Blue Hussars, of the Irish Defence Forces (during the 1930s) wore hussar-style uniforms.

==Image and uniform==

The colourful military uniforms of hussars from 1700 onwards were inspired by the prevailing Hungarian fashions of the day. Usually, this uniform consisted of a short jacket known as a , or later a medium-length atilla jacket, both with heavy, horizontal gold braid () on the breast and yellow braided or gold Austrian knots () on the sleeves, a matching pelisse (a short-waisted over-jacket often worn slung over one shoulder), colourful riding breeches, sometimes with yellow braided or gold Austrian knots at the front, a busby () (a high, fur hat with a cloth bag hanging from one side, although some regiments wore the shako () of various styles), and high riding boots (often Hessian boots). A sabretache, an ornate pouch hung from the belt, often completed the accoutrements.

European hussars traditionally wore long moustaches (but no beards) and long hair, with two plaits hanging in front of the ears as well as a larger queue at the back, a style known as the . They often retained the queue, which used to be common to all soldiers, after other regiments had dispensed with it and adopted short hair.

Hussars had a reputation for being the dashing, if unruly, adventurers of the army. The traditional image of the hussar is of a reckless, hard-drinking, womanising, moustachioed swashbuckler. General Lasalle, an archetypal hussar officer, epitomized this attitude by his remarks, among which the most famous is: &quot;Any hussar who is not dead by the age of thirty is a blackguard.&quot; He died at the Battle of Wagram at the age of 34.

Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s character Brigadier Etienne Gerard of the French has come to epitomise the hussar of popular fiction – brave, conceited, amorous, a skilled horseman and (according to Napoleon) not very intelligent. Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s boast that the (an actual regiment) could set a whole population running, the men away from them and the women towards them, may be taken as a fair representation of the esprit de corps of this class of cavalry.

Less romantically, 18th-century hussars were also known (and feared) for their poor treatment of local civilians. In addition to commandeering local food-stocks for the army, hussars were known to also use the opportunity for personal looting and pillaging.

The 1930 operetta (&quot;Victoria and her Hussar&quot;) has been filmed several times.

==Armament and tactics==
Hussar armament varied over time. Until the 17th century, it included a cavalry sabre, lance, long wooden shield and, optionally, light, metal armour or simple leather vest. Their usual form of attack was a rapid charge in compact formation against enemy infantry or cavalry units. If the first attack failed, they would retire to their supporting troops, who re-equipped them with fresh lances, and then would charge again.

Apart from the Polish sabre and the lance, Polish hussars were usually equipped with two or more horse pistols, a small rounded shield, and koncerz (a long thrusting sword up to , which was used during mounted charges, when the lance was either broken or lost), some even carried a mace, horseman&#x27;s pick, or war hammer. The Polish hussars abandoned the use of the &quot;Balkan&quot; shield (a large shield of an asymmetric shape) by the 1590s, and most of them were now equipped with metal breastplates.

Unlike their lighter counterparts, the Polish hussars were used as a heavy cavalry for line-breaking charges against enemy infantry or cavalry units. The famous low losses were achieved by the unique tactic of &quot;late concentration&quot;. Until the first musket salvo of the enemy infantry, the hussars approached relatively slowly, in a loose formation. Each rider was at least 5 steps away from his colleagues and the infantry, still using undeveloped muskets, could not aim at any particular cavalryman. Also, if a hussar&#x27;s horse was wounded, the following lines had time to steer clear of him. After the salvo, the cavalry rapidly accelerated and tightened the ranks. At the moment of the clash of the charging cavalry with the defenders, the hussars were riding knee-to-knee.

Hussars of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were also famous for the huge wings worn on their backs or attached to the saddles of their horses. Several theories attempt to explain the meaning of the wings. According to some, they were designed to foil attacks by the Tatar lasso; another theory maintains that the sound of vibrating feathers attached to the wings made a strange sound that frightened enemy horses during the charge. However, recent experiments performed by Polish historians in 2001, did not support any of these theories and the phenomenon remains unexplained. They might have simply intended as a distinctive feature. The wings were probably worn only during parades and not during combat, but this explanation is also disputed. Because Poland has a large population of devout Catholics, it seems possible the wings and uniforms were meant to resemble St. Michael the Archangel.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, hussars of Central and Western Europe retained the use of the sabre. Some cavalrymen such as chasseurs were also armed with firearms, primarily pistols or carbines.

==Legacy==

===Armoured units===
After horse cavalry became obsolete, hussar units were generally converted to armoured units, though retaining their traditional titles. Hussar regiments still exist today, and horses are sometimes used for ceremonial purposes. In the British Army (although amalgamations have reduced their number to only two), the French Army, the Swedish Army (Livregementets husarer, the Life Regiment Hussars), the Dutch Army and the Canadian Forces, they are usually tank forces or light mechanised infantry. The Danish Guard Hussars provide a ceremonial mounted squadron, which is the last to wear the slung pelisse.

===Police hussars in Germany===

In certain German states, notably Rheinpfalz, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, hussars were sometimes used as a mounted police force or gendarmerie. A rare exception to the usual pattern of German police uniforms were those of the &quot;Mecklenburg-Strelitzsche Districts-Husaren&quot;. This gendarmerie corps retained their 19th century-style uniforms until 1905.

==Current hussar units==

===Argentina===
The &#x27;Regimiento &#x27; (10th Tank Pueyrredon Hussars Regiment) currently serves as an armoured regiment ( &quot;Husares de Pueyrredón&quot;) of the Argentine Army using its revolution-era full dress uniforms worn during formal parades.

===Bulgaria===
The National Guards Unit of Bulgaria were established as a hussar regiment in 1879 and served as the personal escort of Alexander I of Bulgaria. In modern times they serve as the president&#x27;s honor guard and security detail, and carry AK-47s and SKS instead of sabres, worn only by officers assigned to the unit.

===Canada===
Regiments in the Primary Reserve:

Regiments on the Supplementary Order of Battle:
* 14th Canadian Hussars

===Chile===
The only remaining hussar unit in the Chilean Army is the 3rd Cavalry Regiment &quot;Hussars&quot; () in Angol. It forms part of the 3rd Army Mountain Division and is the only horse-mounted regiment remaining in the army, aside from the Presidential Horse Grenadiers. The regiment has a mounted troop and mounted military band. It is named after one of the nation&#x27;s founding fathers, José Miguel de Carrera, and is informally named &quot;The Hussars of Death&quot;, as the successor regiment to Manuel Rodríguez&#x27;s cavalry unit of that name. The modern regiment has the Totenkopf as its insignia as well as on the regimental camp flag.

===Denmark===

Gardehusarregimentet (English: The Guard Hussar Regiment), founded in 1762, is currently a unit with four battalions: an armoured infantry battalion, a light (motorized) reconnaissance battalion and two training battalions. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the Den Kongelige Livgarde) to be categorised as &#x27;Guards&#x27;; in this case, the Mounted Squadron perform the same role as the Household Cavalry do in the British Army. In mounted parade uniform, the Gardehusarregimentet are the only hussars to still wear the slung and braided pelisse, which was formerly characteristic of this class of cavalry.

===France===

* 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment (). Founded in 1720, this regiment is currently stationed in Tarbes, Hautes-Pyrénées, France. They were formerly the &quot;&quot;, after their founder, Count Bercheny, a Hungarian noble.
* (2nd Hussar Regiment). Founded in 1735, currently stationed in Haguenau, Bas-Rhin, France. Traditionally called &quot;Chamborant&quot;.
* (3rd Hussar Regiment). Founded in 1764, currently stationed in Metz, France. Part of the Franco-German Brigade. Formerly the &quot;&quot;.

Because of political upheavals such as the French Revolution and the Restoration of 1815, the French hussar regiments do not have the same historical continuity as their counterparts in some other armies.

 (&#x27;black hussar&#x27;) was the nickname given to primary-school teachers during the Third Republic, referring to their black coats. Originally written by essayist Charles Péguy in 1913, the phrase (&#x27;the black knights of the Republic&#x27;) has a military undertone: It is meant to capture the tense atmosphere of the late 19th century in France, as schoolteachers felt entrusted with a superior mission to actively promote Republican and secular values, among a largely illiterate population still much influenced by the authority of royalist or Catholic powers. The phrase is still commonly used in public discourse, to emphasize the moral and civic role played by schoolteachers (or occasionally, journalists, etc.) in the enlightenment of citizens in a democracy.

===Ireland===
The Mounted Escort, popularly known as &quot;Blue Hussars&quot;, was an Irish Army unit which was used for state and ceremonial functions and wore bright blue hussar-style uniforms. They were created in 1932 and disbanded in 1948. The name is sometimes used to refer to their successors: the motorcycle unit that has provided presidential escort since then.

===Lithuania===
The &quot;King Mindaugas Hussar Battalion&quot; of the Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade is a unit of the Lithuanian Land Forces. It is named after King Mindaugas of Lithuania (–1263).

===Netherlands===
The Dutch word for hussar is &quot;huzaar&quot;.
* Regiment Huzaren Van Sytzama, eldest element founded in 1577; disbanded in 2012
* Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje, eldest element founded in 1668
* Regiment Huzaren Prins Alexander eldest element founded in 1672; disbanded in 2007
* Regiment Huzaren van Boreel, eldest element founded in 1585

Except for the Huzaren van Boreel, the regiments operate in an armoured role in one of the two mechanised brigades of the Dutch army, using the Leopard 2 main battle tank. Each of these brigades also has a squadron from the Huzaren van Boreel attached for reconnaissance.
There is also a mounted unit for ceremonies: Cavalerie Ere-Escorte. It is linked to the Huzaren Prins Alexander, although riders from other regiments participate as well.

===Peru===

The 1st Light Cavalry Regiment, the &quot;Glorious Hussars of Junín&quot;, was until 2012 the horse guards unit of the Peruvian Army, with a history spanning almost two centuries. Raised on August 18, 1821, by José de San Martín as the mounted component of the Peruvian Guard Legion, the regiment served in the final battles of the Latin American wars of independence in Junin and Ayacucho, in the Gran Colombia–Peru War, in the War of the Confederation and in the War of the Pacific.

Following an extended period as part of the Army Education Command, the regiment became the Presidential horse guards regiment in 1987. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of 2 February 2012, signed under the administration of President Ollanta Humala Tasso, the Field Marshal Domingo Nieto Cavalry Regiment has been reestablished as the official presidential escort, with the main mission of guaranteeing the security of the President of the Republic and the Government Palace of Perú in Lima.

The Hussars of Junín wear a stylised dress uniform of a blue and red shako, red coat and blue breeches modelled on that worn in 1824 in the Battle of Junín. This uniform is of similar design, but with different colors and braiding, to that worn by the Argentine Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers General San Martín, which assisted in its raising and in the training of its first troopers.

The Hussars of Junin carry lances and sabers on parade and perform as a ceremonial guard together with the Marshal Nieto Dragoon Guards and the other ceremonial units of the Peruvian Armed Forces and the National Police of Peru. As noted above, The Hussars of Junín no longer serve as the presidential escort but are now based in the Peruvian Army Education Command and still participates in ceremonies and parades, representing the Peruvian Army. The regiment also provides honor guards and escorts for welcoming-ceremonies and other events of national importance. An example of such occasions is the annual ceremony commemorating the 1929 reintegration of the Tacna Region into Peru.

===Spain===

The Spanish Army still retains one of its historic hussar regiments: the &quot;Húsares de Pavía&quot;, plus a mechanised cavalry group which commemorates the hussars as a corps: 
* Húsares de Pavía: &quot;Regimiento Acorazado de Caballería Pavía no 4&quot; (the Pavía Armoured Cavalry Regiment no. 4 Pavia Húsares (Hussars), garrisoned in Zaragoza, Spain.
* Húsares Españoles: (Grupo de Caballería Mecanizado &quot;Húsares Españoles&quot; II/11) 

Historic regiments now disbanded included:
* Húsares de la Princesa
* Húsares de Calatrava 
* Húsares de Fernando VII
* Húsares de Iberia
* Húsares de Cantabria
* Húsares de Castilla
* Húsares de Cataluña
* Húsares de San Andres
* Húsares de Aragón
* Húsares de Arlabán (Carlist)

===Sweden===
Livregementets husarer (English: &#x27;Life Regiment Hussars&#x27;). One of the most distinguished hussar regiments in European history, with roots extending back to 1536. Today, Livregementets husarer, also known as K 3, is the last active hussar regiment in Sweden and trains an airborne battalion and an intelligence battalion and hosts the Swedish Army&#x27;s Parachute Ranger School and the Armed Forces Survival School.

===United Kingdom===

* Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars
* King&#x27;s Royal Hussars
* C (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Squadron, the Royal Wessex Yeomanry
* 710 (Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars) Squadron RLC

Presently, the first two regiments and C Sqn RWxY operate in the armoured role, primarily operating the Challenger 2 main battle tank. The Hussar regiments are grouped together with the Dragoon and Lancer regiments in the order of precedence, all of which are below the Dragoon Guards. A Dragoon regiment, the Light Dragoons, was formed by the amalgamation of two Hussar regiments, the 13th/18th Royal Hussars and the 15th/19th The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars, in 1992, reversing the mid-19th-century trend of all existing light-dragoon regiments being converted to hussars. 710 (Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars) Laundry Squadron, RLC is a Reserve Operational Hygiene Squadron within 165 Port and Maritime Regiment RLC and was formed in April 2014 from 60 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals.

The Light Cavalry HAC also wear hussar uniform.

=== Venezuela ===
The of Venezuela wear hussar style full-dress uniforms, thus maintaining the traditions and legacy of Simón Bolívar&#x27;s Hussar Troop. This unit was established in 1815, serving under Bolivar during the Venezuelan War of Independence and Spanish American wars of independence. The modern brigade serves as a ceremonial escort to the President of Venezuela at Miraflores Palace and attends all state arrival ceremonies conducted there, as well as providing security for the palace complex. The brigade also provides honor guards (i) at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Carabobo Field, Carabobo commemorating the memory of national heroes and the fallen of the Battle of Carabobo; (ii) at the Montana Barracks in Caracas in memory of the late Hugo Chávez; and (iii) at the National Pantheon in Caracas in memory of Bolívar and other national heroes buried there. The brigade also performs public-duty functions as required. Brigade personnel come from all branches of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela and public security services. The brigade is commanded by a general or flag officer and includes a Presidential mounted escort of platoon size.

<text>Bernard &quot;Ben&quot; Turpin (September 19, 1869 – July 1, 1940) was an American comedian and actor, best remembered for his work in silent films. His trademarks were his cross-eyed appearance and adeptness at vigorous physical comedy. A sometimes vaudeville performer, he was &quot;discovered&quot; for film while working as the janitor for Essanay Studios in Chicago. Turpin went on to work with notable performers such as Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, and was a part of the Mack Sennett studio team. He is believed to have been the first filmed &quot;victim&quot; of the pie in the face gag. When sound came to films, Turpin chose to retire, having invested profitably in real estate, although he did do occasional cameos.

==Personal life==
Turpin was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 19, 1869, the son of a candy store owner, Ernest Turpin, and Sarah Buckley.

Turpin and his first wife, actress Carrie Lemieux, were married in Chicago on February 18, 1907. In 1923, Mrs. Turpin became ill with influenza, which caused the loss of her hearing. Heartbroken, Turpin took his seriously ill wife to the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in Quebec, hoping she would be healed. She eventually became an invalid, with Turpin placing his career on hold to care for her. Carrie died on October 2, 1925. Turpin remarried on July 8, 1926, to Babette Dietz in Los Angeles.

He was a Roman Catholic, and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

==Vaudeville==
Turpin worked in vaudeville, burlesque, and circuses. He had a distinctive appearance, with a small wiry frame, a brush mustache, and crossed eyes. Turpin&#x27;s famous eyes, he said, only crossed as a young adult after he suffered an accident. He was convinced that the crossed eyes were essential to his comic career; his co-workers recalled that after he received any blow to the head he made a point of looking himself in the mirror to assure himself that they had not become uncrossed. He was a devout Catholic, and his workmates occasionally goaded him by threatening to pray that his eyes would uncross, thus depriving him of his livelihood.

Turpin famously bought a $25,000 insurance policy with Lloyd&#x27;s of London, payable if his eyes ever uncrossed. A 1920 version of the story had the amount upped $100,000.
He developed a vigorous style of physical comedy, including an ability to stage comic pratfalls that impressed even his fellow workers in the rough-and-tumble world of silent comedy. One of his specialties was a forward tumble he called the &quot;hundred an&#x27; eight&quot;. It was basically an interrupted forward somersault initiated by kicking one leg up, turning over 180 degrees to land flat on the back or in a seated position.

==Film==
Turpin first appeared on film in 1907 for Essanay Studios in Chicago in various small parts and comic bits. In addition to his on-screen work, he worked as a carpenter and janitor for Essanay. In the 1909 film &quot;Mr. Flip&quot;, Turpin receives what is believed to have been the first pie-in-the-face.

Charlie Chaplin joined the Essanay company in 1915, and the studio made Turpin his second banana. Chaplin was maturing as a filmmaker, working slowly and intuitively. Turpin, however, was impatient with Chaplin&#x27;s methods. The earthy Turpin understood straightforward slapstick more than comic subtlety. The Chaplin–Turpin duo did not last long, with Chaplin abandoning Chicago for California. Turpin does share one additional credit with Chaplin: after Chaplin filmed &quot;Burlesque on Carmen&quot; in two reels, Essanay filmed new scenes with Turpin to pad the picture into a featurette, doubling its length. These new scenes were staged by actor-director Leo White; Turpin and Chaplin do not appear together on screen.

Essanay did not survive Chaplin&#x27;s departure and remained solvent for only a few more years. Turpin may have been aware of Essanay&#x27;s instability; he left for the Vogue comedy company, where he starred in a series of two-reel comedies. Former Essanay comedian Paddy McGuire supported him. Many of Turpin&#x27;s Vogue comedies were re-released under different titles (by the Cameo company, in 1920) to cash in on Turpin&#x27;s subsequent stardom: &quot;Why Ben Bolted&quot; was retitled &quot;He Looked Crooked&quot;, for example.

==Mack Sennett and stardom==
In 1917, Ben Turpin joined the leading comedy company, the Mack Sennett studio. Turpin&#x27;s aptitude for crude slapstick suited the Sennett style perfectly, and Sennett&#x27;s writers often cast the ridiculous-looking Turpin against type (a rugged Yukon miner; a suave, worldly lover; a stalwart cowboy; a fearless stuntman, etc.) for maximum comic effect. Through the 1920s his roles often spoofed serious actors and celebrities of the time – e.g., &quot;The Shriek&quot; for &quot;The Sheik&quot; – and Turpin became one of film&#x27;s most popular comics. Turpin appeared in both short subjects and feature films for Sennett. Delighted with his success, he took to introducing himself with the phrase, &quot;I&#x27;m Ben Turpin; I make $3,000 a week.&quot;

Sennett terminated most of his staff&#x27;s contracts in 1928, and closed the studio to retool for the new talking pictures. Turpin was signed by the low-budget Weiss Bros.-Artclass company, perhaps the most ambitious coup that Artclass ever attempted. Turpin made 10 two-reel comedies there for one year. Artclass usually traded on his peculiar vision with titles like &quot;Idle Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot;.

==Turpin in the sound era==

The year 1929 saw many silent-film stars uncertain about their future employment, with the new talking pictures requiring new skills and techniques. Ben Turpin chose to retire. He had invested his earnings in real estate and, being highly successful at this, had no financial need for more work. Producers soon sought him out for gag appearances in films. Turpin&#x27;s speaking voice was a gritty rasp that retained elements of the New Orleans &quot;Yat&quot; accent of his youth. He commanded a flat fee of $1000 per appearance, regardless of whether it was a speaking role or a fleeting cameo. Among the most memorable of these cameos were in RKO&#x27;s Wheeler and Woolsey comedy &quot;Cracked Nuts&quot; (with Turpin as a cockeyed bombardier), and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1932) starring W. C. Fields, Jack Oakie, and Susan Fleming (the future wife of Harpo Marx of The Marx Brothers). Turpin also offered comedy relief in Mascot&#x27;s 1934 adventure serial &quot;The Law of the Wild&quot;.

Turpin starred in only one more film, the short subject &quot;Keystone Hotel&quot; (Warner Bros., 1935), a reunion of silent-era comedians. His last feature film was Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s&quot; Saps at Sea&quot; in 1940, in which his cross-eyed face served as a joke punchline. He was paid his $1000 for one quick shot of his face and just 16 words of dialogue. Death prevented his scheduled appearance in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.

==Death==
Ben Turpin died July 1, 1940, of a heart attack and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, following a Requiem Mass at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. He was eulogized as &quot;a fine member of his church, strong in his faith&quot; by Father J. P. Concannon. His pallbearers included Andy Clyde, Billy Bevan, James Finlayson, Heinie Conklin, and Charlie Murray.

Turpin had been close friends with Andy Clyde and James Finlayson, with Clyde having been the witness at Turpin&#x27;s second wedding, and Turpin having been one of the witnesses signing Finlayson&#x27;s petition for naturalization.

==Turpin&#x27;s crossed eyes==
Turpin and Sennett both appeared as themselves (in Technicolor) in &quot;Hollywood Cavalcade&quot; (1939), a partly fictionalized movie about the silent-film era. This movie contains a sequence in which Turpin reports for work and prepares to go onto the set in character. In the dressing room he picks up a hand mirror and checks his reflection as he deliberately crosses his eyes as extremely as possible. In this sequence, it can be seen that Turpin&#x27;s left eye was actually normal when he was not performing and that he intentionally crossed it (to match his misaligned right eye) as part of his screen character.

<doc id="232657" wikidata="Q312577" url="?curid=232657" title="Henry Addington">
<text>Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth (30 May 175715 February 1844) was a British Tory statesman who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1804 and as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1789 to 1801.

Addington is best known for obtaining the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, an unfavourable peace with Napoleonic France which marked the end of the Second Coalition during the French Revolutionary Wars. When that treaty broke down, Addington resumed the war without allies. He conducted relatively weak defensive hostilities, ahead of what would become the War of the Third Coalition. He was forced from office in favour of William Pitt the Younger, who had preceded Addington as prime minister. Addington is also known for his reactionary crackdown on advocates of democratic reforms during a ten-year spell as Home Secretary from 1812 to 1822. He is the longest continuously serving holder of that office since it was created in 1782.

==Family==
Henry Addington was the son of Anthony Addington, Pitt the Elder&#x27;s physician; and Mary Addington, the daughter of the Rev. Haviland John Hiley, headmaster of Reading School. As a consequence of his father&#x27;s position, Addington was a childhood friend of William Pitt the Younger. Addington studied at Reading School, Winchester, and Brasenose College, Oxford, and then studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

He married Ursula Mary Hammond in 1791; she brought an income of £1,000 a year into the marriage. The couple had eight children, of whom six survived to adulthood. Ursula Addington died in 1823. Afterwards, he married a widow, Marianne Townsend, daughter of William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell.

==Political career==

He was elected to the House of Commons in 1784 as one of the Members of Parliament for Devizes, and became Speaker of the House of Commons in 1789. In March 1801, William Pitt the Younger resigned from office, ostensibly over the refusal of King George III to remove some of the existing political restrictions on Roman Catholics in Ireland (Catholic Emancipation), but poor health, failure in war, economic collapse, alarming levels of social unrest due to famine, and irreconcilable divisions within the Cabinet also played a role. Both Pitt and the King insisted that Addington take over as prime minister, despite his own objections, and his failed attempts to reconcile the King and Pitt.

==Prime Minister==
Foreign policy was the centrepiece of his term in office. Some historians have been highly critical and said that it was ignorant and indifferent to Britain&#x27;s greatest needs. However, Thomas Goldsmith argues that Addington and Hawkesbury conducted a logical, consistent and eurocentric balance-of-power policy, rooted in rules and assumptions governing their conduct, rather than a chaotic free-for-all approach.

Addington&#x27;s domestic reforms doubled the efficiency of the income tax. In foreign affairs, he secured the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. While the treaty&#x27;s terms were the bare minimum that the British government could accept, Napoleon Bonaparte would not have agreed to any terms more favourable to the British, and the British government had reached a state of financial collapse from war expenditure, the loss of Continental markets for British goods and two successive failed harvests that had led to widespread famine and social unrest, rendering peace a necessity.

By early 1803, Britain&#x27;s financial and diplomatic positions had recovered sufficiently to allow Addington to declare war on France, when it became clear that the French would not allow a settlement for the defences of Malta that would have been secure enough to fend off a French invasion that appeared imminent.

At the time and ever since, Addington has been criticised for his lacklustre conduct of the war and his defensive posture. However, without allies, Britain&#x27;s options were limited to defence. He increased the forces, provided a tax base that could finance an enlarged war and seized several French possessions. To gain allies, Addington cultivated better relations with the Russian Empire, the Austrian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia. These relations culminated in the Third Coalition shortly after Addington left office. Addington also strengthened British defences against a French invasion through the building of Martello towers on the south coast and the raising of more than 600,000 men at arms.

=== Foundling Hospital ===
In 1802, Addington accepted an honorary position as vice-president for life on the Court of Governors of London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital for abandoned babies.

=== Loss of office ===

Although the King stood by him, it was not enough, because Addington did not have a strong enough hold on both Houses of Parliament. By May 1804, partisan criticism of Addington&#x27;s war policies provided the pretext for a parliamentary putsch by the three major factions (Grenvillites, Foxites, and Pittites), who had decided that they should replace Addington&#x27;s ministry. Addington&#x27;s greatest failing was his inability to manage a parliamentary majority by cultivating the loyal support of MPs beyond his own circle and the friends of the King. That, combined with his mediocre speaking ability, left him vulnerable to Pitt&#x27;s mastery of parliamentary management and his unparallelled oratory skills. Pitt&#x27;s parliamentary assault against Addington in March 1804 led to the slimming of his parliamentary majority to the point that defeat in the House of Commons was imminent.

==Lord President and Lord Privy Seal==
Addington remained an important political figure because he had gained a large following of MPs who supported him loyally in the Commons. He was reconciled with Pitt in December 1804, with the help of Lord Hawkesbury as an intermediary. As a result, Pitt arranged for him to join the Cabinet as Lord President of the Council in January 1805. Pitt insisted for Addington to accept a peerage to avoid the inconvenience of them sitting together in the Commons. Addington was created Viscount Sidmouth, of Sidmouth in the County of Devon on 12 January 1805.

In return for the support of the government by Addington&#x27;s loyal supporters, Pitt agreed to include Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire, Addington&#x27;s colleague, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with a promise to elevate him to the first vacancy of a more senior position in the Cabinet. However, when Melville resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty in July 1805, Pitt broke his promise by having Sir Charles Middleton appointed instead of Buckinghamshire. As a result of the betrayal, Addington and Buckinghamshire resigned and took all of their supporters into opposition. Addington was appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1806 in the Ministry of All the Talents that succeeded Pitt. Later that year he returned to the position of Lord President to 1807. His resignation precipitated the fall of the Talents Ministry. Addington was opposed to a limited measure of Catholic Emancipation, which the Cabinet was considering despite the opposition of King George III.

==Home Secretary==
He returned to government again as Lord President in March 1812, and, in June of the same year, became Home Secretary. As Home Secretary, Addington countered revolutionary opposition, being responsible for the temporary suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in 1817 and the passage of the Six Acts in 1819. His tenure also saw the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. He left office in 1822, succeeded as Home Secretary by Sir Robert Peel.

Addington remained in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio for the next two years, opposing, along with Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, other members of Cabinet, and King George IV, British recognition of the South American republics. He remained active in the House of Lords for the next few years, making his final speech in opposition to Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and casting his final vote against the Reform Act 1832.

==Residences and land==

Addington maintained homes at Upottery, Devon and Bulmershe Court, in what is now the Reading suburb of Woodley, but moved to the White Lodge in Richmond Park when he became prime minister. However, he maintained links with Woodley and the Reading area as commander of the Woodley Yeomanry Cavalry and High Steward of Reading. He also donated to the town of Reading the of land that is today the site of the Royal Berkshire Hospital, and his name is commemorated in the town&#x27;s Sidmouth Street and Addington Road as well as in Sidmouth Street in Devizes and Addington Special School in Woodley, Reading. In Devizes he paid for the new Market Cross, designed by James Wyatt, that was constructed in 1814.

As Speaker of the House of Commons, from 1795 he had a residence in the Palace of Westminster, to the north-east of the House of Commons.

==Death==
Addington died in London on 15 February 1844 at the age of 86, from influenza, and was buried in the churchyard at St Mary the Virgin, Mortlake on Mortlake High Street, now in Greater London.

<text>Xu Shichang (Hsu Shih-chang; ; courtesy name: Juren (Chu-jen; 菊人); October 20, 1855 – June 5, 1939) was a Chinese politician who served as the President of the Republic of China, in Beijing, from 10 October 1918 to 2 June 1922. The only permanent president of the Beiyang government to be a civilian, his presidency was also the longest of the Warlord Era. Previously, he was Minister of the Cabinet of the Imperial Cabinet during the Qing Dynasty.

== Biography ==
Xu Shichang&#x27;s ancestral hometown was Yinxian County (current Yinzhou District), Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. Born in Weihui, Henan, he was Yuan Shikai&#x27;s closest friend. He was at one time the Viceroy of the Three Northeast Provinces, served as minister of the cabinet in Prince Qing&#x27;s Cabinet, and tutored Emperor of China Puyi. At the end of the Qing dynasty, Xu was made chief of the general staff despite being a civilian. Following the overthrow of the monarchy and the Republic of China&#x27;s establishment, he was appointed minister of state by Yuan Shikai in 1912, as the latter hoped that this would appease the pro-Qing Royalist Party. Xu resigned as secretary of state (premier) in protest to Yuan&#x27;s imperial ambition in late 1915. He resumed his post after Yuan abandoned monarchism on 22 March 1916.

His election as president was largely engineered by Duan Qirui and his Anhui clique. He was chosen because he was a civilian yet had close ties to the Beiyang Army and was neutral to both its Zhili and Anhui cliques. Lacking any military power of his own, he had to play Duan, Zhili leader Cao Kun, and Fengtian leader Zhang Zuolin against each other to stay in power.

Xu believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Reginald Johnston to teach Puyi &quot;subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English&quot;.

He held a massive celebration in Beijing for China&#x27;s victory in World War I on 18 November 1918. However, he then brought troops into the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. A ceasefire with Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s rival Constitutional Protection government was declared and intellectuals were given greater freedom. This lasted until news from France showed how Duan Qirui promised German territory in Shandong to Japan. Large student protests (May Fourth Movement) led to Xu cracking down with mass arrests. Ma Jun (), a Muslim, led protests against the Versailles Treaty. The delegation was ordered home and China refused to sign or ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Consequently, the shaky alliance between the Zhili and Anhui cliques collapsed with Duan decisively defeated. This led to the era of high warlordism. Conflict with the south flared again in 1920 and he also failed to retake Mongolia. Cao Kun, who never liked Xu, pressured him out of office and restored Li Yuanhong.

<doc id="232669" wikidata="Q296729" url="?curid=232669" title="Tony Bennett">
<text>Anthony Dominick Benedetto (August 3, 1926 – July 21, 2023), known professionally as Tony Bennett, was an American jazz and traditional pop singer. He received many accolades, including 20 Grammy Awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. Bennett was named a National Endowments for the Arts Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree. He founded the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, New York, along with Exploring the Arts, a non-profit arts education program. He sold more than 50 million records worldwide and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Bennett began singing at an early age. He fought in the final stages of World War II as a U.S. Army infantryman in the European Theater. Afterward, he developed his singing technique, signed with Columbia Records and had his first number-one popular song with &quot;Because of You&quot; in 1951. Several popular tracks such as &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; followed in early 1953. He then refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as &quot;The Beat of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Basie Swings, Bennett Sings&quot;. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;. His career and personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding his reach to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact.

Bennett continued to create popular and critically praised work into the 21st century. He attracted renewed acclaim late in his career for his collaboration with Lady Gaga, which began with the album &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; (2014); the two performers toured together to promote the album throughout 2014 and 2015. With the release of the duo&#x27;s second album, &quot;Love for Sale&quot; (2021), Bennett broke the individual record for the longest run of a top-10 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for any living artist; his first top-10 record was &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; in 1962. Bennett also broke the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to release an album of new material, at the age of 95 years and 60 days.

In February 2021, Bennett revealed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2016. Due to the slow progression of his illness, he continued to record, tour, and perform until his retirement from concerts due to physical challenges, which was announced after his final performances on August 3 and 5, 2021, at Radio City Music Hall.

== Early life ==
=== 1926–1943: Family and education ===
Anthony Dominick Benedetto was born on August 3, 1926, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Long Island City, Queens, in New York City. His parents were grocer John Benedetto and seamstress Anna (Suraci) Benedetto, and he was the first member of his family to be born in a hospital. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podargoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna had been born in the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature, and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was ten years old.

Bennett grew up listening to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Joe Venuti. His uncle Dick was a tap dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business, and his uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner. By age 10 he was already singing, and performed at the opening of the Triborough Bridge, standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head. Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.

Bennett attended New York&#x27;s School of Industrial Art where he studied painting and music and would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique. But he dropped out at age 16 to help support his family. He worked as a copy boy and runner for the Associated Press in Manhattan and in several other low-skilled, low-paying jobs. He mostly set his sights on a professional singing career, returning to performing as a singing waiter, playing and winning amateur nights all around the city, and enjoying a successful engagement at a Paramus, New Jersey, nightclub.

=== 1944–1950: World War II and after ===
Benedetto was drafted into the United States Army in November 1944, during the final stages of World War II. He did basic training at Fort Dix and Fort Robinson as part of becoming an infantry rifleman. Benedetto ran afoul of a sergeant from the South who disliked the Italian from New York City; heavy doses of KP duty or BAR cleaning resulted. Processed through the huge Le Havre replacement depot, in January 1945, he was assigned as a replacement infantryman to the 255th Infantry Regiment of the 63rd Infantry Division, a unit filling in for the heavy losses suffered in the Battle of the Bulge. He moved across France and later into Germany. As March 1945 began, he joined the front line of what he would later describe as a &quot;front-row seat in hell&quot;.

As the German Army was pushed back to its homeland, Benedetto and his company saw bitter fighting in cold winter conditions, often hunkering down in foxholes as German 88 mm guns fired on them. At the end of March, they crossed the Rhine and entered Germany, engaging in dangerous house-to-house, town-after-town fighting to clean out German soldiers; during the first week of April, they crossed the Kocher River, and by the end of the month reached the Danube. During his time in combat, Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times. The experience made him a pacifist; he would later write, &quot;Anybody who thinks that war is romantic obviously hasn&#x27;t gone through one&quot;, and later say, &quot;It was a nightmare that&#x27;s permanent. I just said, &#x27;This is not life. This is not life. At the war&#x27;s conclusion he was involved in the liberation of the Kaufering concentration camp, a subcamp of Dachau, near Landsberg, where some American prisoners of war from the 63rd Division had also been held. He later wrote in his autobiography that &quot;I saw things no human being should ever have to see.&quot;

Benedetto stayed in Germany as part of the occupying force but was assigned to an informal Special Services band unit that would entertain nearby American forces. His dining with a black friend from high school—at a time when the Army was still racially segregated—led to his being demoted and reassigned to Graves Registration Service duties. Subsequently, he sang with the 314th Army Special Services Band under the stage name Joe Bari (a name he had started using before the war, chosen after the city and province in Italy, and as a partial anagram of his family origins in Calabria). He played with many musicians who would have post-war careers.

Upon his discharge from the Army and return to the States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at the American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians—such as that of Stan Getz&#x27;s saxophone and Art Tatum&#x27;s piano—helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for a small outfit called Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.

In 1949, Pearl Bailey recognized Benedetto&#x27;s talent and asked him to open for her in Greenwich Village. She had invited Bob Hope to the show. Hope decided to take Benedetto on the road with him and shortened his name to Tony Bennett. In 1950, Bennett cut a demo of &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; and was signed to the major label Columbia Records by Mitch Miller.

== Career ==
=== 1951–1959: First successes ===
Warned by Miller not to imitate Frank Sinatra (who was just then leaving Columbia), Bennett began his career as a crooner of commercial pop tunes. His first big hit was &quot;Because of You&quot;, a ballad produced by Miller with a lush orchestral arrangement from Percy Faith. It started out gaining popularity on jukeboxes, then reached number one on the pop charts in 1951 and stayed there for ten weeks, selling over a million copies. This was followed to the top of the charts later that year by a similarly styled rendition of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, which helped introduce Williams and country music in general to a wider, more national audience. The Miller and Faith tandem continued to work on all of Bennett&#x27;s early hits. Bennett&#x27;s recording of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was also very popular and attracted screaming teenage fans at concerts at the famed Paramount Theater in New York (Bennett did seven shows a day, starting at 10:30 am) and elsewhere.

A third number-one came in 1953 with &quot;Rags to Riches&quot;. Unlike Bennett&#x27;s other early hits, this was an up-tempo big band number with a bold, brassy sound and a double tango in the instrumental break; it topped the charts for eight weeks.
Later that year, the producers of the upcoming Broadway musical &quot;Kismet&quot; had Bennett record &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; as a way of promoting the show during a New York newspaper strike. The song reached the top, the show was a hit, and Bennett began a long practice of recording show tunes. &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; was also a number-one hit in the United Kingdom a year and a half later.

Once the rock and roll era began in 1955, the dynamic of the music industry changed and it became harder and harder for existing pop singers to do well commercially. Nevertheless, Bennett continued to enjoy success, placing eight songs in the &quot;Billboard&quot; during the latter part of the 1950s, with &quot;In the Middle of an Island&quot; (which he vehemently hated) reaching the highest at number nine in 1957.

For a month in August–September 1956, Bennett hosted an NBC Saturday night television variety show, &quot;The Tony Bennett Show&quot;, as a summer replacement for &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;. Patti Page and Julius La Rosa had in turn hosted the two previous months, and they all shared the same singers, dancers, and orchestra. In 1959, Bennett would again fill in for &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, this time alongside Teresa Brewer and Jaye P. Morgan as co-hosts of the summer-long &quot;Perry Presents.&quot;

=== 1954–1965: A growing artistry ===
In 1954, the guitarist Chuck Wayne became Bennett&#x27;s musical director. Bennett released his first long-playing album in 1955, &quot;Cloud 7&quot;. The album was billed as featuring Wayne and showed Bennett&#x27;s leanings towards jazz. In 1957, Ralph Sharon became Bennett&#x27;s pianist, arranger, and musical director, replacing Wayne. Sharon told Bennett that a career singing &quot;sweet saccharine songs like &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27;&quot; would not last long, and encouraged Bennett to focus even more on his jazz inclinations.
The result was the 1957 album &quot;The Beat of My Heart&quot;. It featured well-known jazz musicians such as Herbie Mann and Nat Adderley, with a strong emphasis on percussion from the likes of Art Blakey, Jo Jones, Latin star Candido Camero, and Chico Hamilton. The album was both popular and critically praised. Bennett followed this by working with the Count Basie Orchestra, becoming the first male pop vocalist to sing with Basie&#x27;s band. The albums &quot;Basie Swings, Bennett Sings&quot; (1958) and &quot;In Person!&quot; (1959) were the well-regarded fruits of this collaboration, with &quot;Chicago&quot; being one of the standout songs.

Bennett also built up the quality and, therefore, the reputation of his nightclub act; in this he was following the path of Sinatra and other top jazz and standards singers of this era. In June 1962, Bennett staged a highly promoted concert performance at Carnegie Hall, using a stellar lineup of musicians including Al Cohn, Kenny Burrell, and Candido, as well as the Ralph Sharon Trio. Carnegie Hall had not featured a male pop performer until then (only Judy Garland one year before that). The concert featured 44 songs, including favorites like &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the World on a String&quot; and &quot;The Best Is Yet To Come&quot;. It was a big success and like Garland&#x27;s, the concert was recorded for posterity, further cementing Bennett&#x27;s reputation as a star both at home and abroad. Bennett also appeared on television, and in October 1962 he sang on the initial broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.
Also in 1962, Bennett released his recording of &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;, a decade-old but little-known song originally written for an opera singer. Although this single only reached number 19 on the , it spent close to a year on various other charts and increased Bennett&#x27;s exposure. The album of the same title was a hit and both the single and album achieved gold record status. The song won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Solo Vocal Performance for Bennett. Over the years, this would become known as Bennett&#x27;s signature song. In 2001, it was ranked 23rd on an RIAA/NEA list of the most historically significant Songs of the 20th Century.

Bennett&#x27;s following album, &quot;I Wanna Be Around...&quot; (1963), was also a top-5 success, with the title track and &quot;The Good Life&quot; each reaching the of the pop singles chart along with the of the Adult Contemporary chart.

The next year brought the Beatles and the British Invasion, and with them still more musical and cultural attention to rock and less to pop, standards, and jazz. Over the next couple of years, Bennett had minor hits with several albums and singles based on show tunes; his last top-40 single was the number 34 &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot; from the musical &quot;Pickwick&quot; in 1965, but his commercial fortunes were clearly starting to decline. An attempt to break into acting with a role in the poorly received 1966 film &quot;The Oscar&quot; met with middling reviews for Bennett; he did not enjoy the experience and did not seek further roles.

A firm believer in the Civil Rights Movement, Bennett participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. He performed in the &quot;Stars for Freedom&quot; rally the night before Martin Luther King&#x27;s &quot;How Long, Not Long&quot; speech. At the conclusion of the march, Bennett was driven to the airport by Viola Liuzzo, a mother of five from Detroit, who was murdered later that day by the Ku Klux Klan. 

Bennett refused to perform in apartheid South Africa.

=== 1965–1979: Years of struggle ===
Ralph Sharon and Bennett parted ways in 1965. There was great pressure on singers such as Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand to record &quot;contemporary&quot; rock songs and, in this vein, Columbia Records&#x27; Clive Davis suggested that Bennett do the same. Bennett was very reluctant and, when he tried, the results pleased no one. This was exemplified by &quot;Tony Sings the Great Hits of Today!&quot; (1970), before which Bennett became physically ill at the thought of recording. It featured covers of Beatles and other current songs and a psychedelic art cover.

Years later, Bennett would recall his dismay at being asked to do contemporary material, comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress. By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records (Philips in the UK) and relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from the Talk of the Town nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television, &quot;Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town&quot;. With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.

Taking matters into his own hands, Bennett started his own record company, Improv. He recorded some songs that would later become favorites, such as &quot;What is This Thing Called Love?&quot;, and made two well-regarded albums with jazz pianist Bill Evans, &quot;The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album&quot; (1975) and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1976), but Improv lacked a distribution arrangement with a major label and by 1977, it was out of business.

As the decade neared its end, Bennett had no recording contract, no manager, and was not performing many concerts outside of Las Vegas. He had developed a drug addiction, was living beyond his means, and had the Internal Revenue Service trying to seize his Los Angeles home.

=== 1979–1989: Turnaround ===
After a near-fatal cocaine overdose in 1979, Bennett called his sons Danny and Dae for help. &quot;Look, I&#x27;m lost here&quot;, he told them. &quot;It seems like people don&#x27;t want to hear the music I make.&quot;

Danny and Dae&#x27;s band, Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends, had floundered and the former realized he was not musically talented but had a head for business. His father, on the other hand, had tremendous musical talent, but had trouble sustaining a career from it and had little financial sense. Danny signed on as his father&#x27;s manager.

Danny got his father&#x27;s expenses under control, moved him back to New York City, and began booking him in colleges and small theaters to get him away from a &quot;Vegas&quot; image. After some effort, a successful plan to pay back the IRS debt was put into place. The singer had also reunited with Ralph Sharon as his pianist and musical director (and would remain with him until Sharon&#x27;s retirement in 2002). By 1986, Tony Bennett was re-signed to Columbia Records, this time with creative control, and released &quot;The Art of Excellence&quot;. This became his first album to reach the charts since 1972.

Henry Mancini&#x27;s theme song &quot;Life in a Looking Glass&quot; from the Blake Edwards motion picture &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; (1986), sung by Bennett, received a nomination at the Oscars for Best Original Song.

=== 1990–2006: Established career ===
Danny Bennett felt that younger audiences who were unfamiliar with his father would respond to his music if given a chance. No changes to Tony&#x27;s formal appearance, singing style, musical accompaniment (The Ralph Sharon Trio or an orchestra), or song choice (generally the Great American Songbook) were necessary or desirable. Accordingly, Danny began regularly to book his father on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, a show with a younger, &quot;hip&quot; audience. This was subsequently followed by appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, and various MTV programs. In 1993, Bennett played a series of benefit concerts organized by alternative rock radio stations around the country. The plan worked; as Tony later remembered, &quot;I realized that young people had never heard those songs. Cole Porter, Gershwin—they were like, &#x27;Who wrote that?&#x27; To them, it was different. If you&#x27;re different, you stand out.&quot;
During this time, Bennett continued to record, first putting out the acclaimed look-back &quot;&quot; (1990), then emphasizing themed albums such as the Sinatra homage &quot;Perfectly Frank&quot; (1992) and the Fred Astaire tribute &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; (1993). The latter two both achieved gold status and won Grammys for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance (Bennett&#x27;s first Grammys since 1962) and further established Bennett as the inheritor of the mantle of a classic American great.

As Bennett was seen at MTV Video Music Awards shows side by side with the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Flavor Flav, and as his &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out with My Baby&quot; video received MTV airplay, it was clear that, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Tony Bennett has not just bridged the generation gap, he has demolished it. He has solidly connected with a younger crowd weaned on rock. And there have been no compromises.&quot;

The new audience reached its height with Bennett&#x27;s appearance in 1994 on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. (He quipped on the show, &quot;I&#x27;ve been unplugged my whole career.&quot;) Featuring guest appearances by rock and country stars Elvis Costello and k.d. lang (both of whom had an affinity for the standards genre), the show attracted a considerable audience and much media attention. The resulting &quot;MTV Unplugged: Tony Bennett&quot; album went platinum and, besides taking the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance Grammy award for the third straight year, also won the top Grammy prize of Album of the Year.

Following his comeback, Bennett financially prospered; by 1999, his assets were worth $15 to 20 million. He had no intention of retiring, saying in reference to masters such as Pablo Picasso, Jack Benny, and Fred Astaire: &quot;right up to the day they died, they were performing. If you are creative, you get busier as you get older.&quot; He continued to record and tour steadily, playing a hundred shows a year by the end of the 1990s. In concert, he often made a point of singing one song (usually &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;) without any microphone or amplification, demonstrating his skills at vocal projection. One show, &quot;Tony Bennett&#x27;s Wonderful World: Live From San Francisco&quot;, was made into a PBS special. He conceptualized and starred in the first episode of the A&amp;E Network&#x27;s popular &quot;Live by Request&quot; series, for which he won an Emmy Award. He made cameo appearances as himself in films such as &quot;The Scout&quot;, &quot;Analyze This&quot;, and &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;.

In 1998, Bennett performed on the final day of a mud-soaked Glastonbury Festival in an immaculate suit and tie, his whole set on this occasion consisting of songs about the weather. His autobiography &quot;The Good Life&quot; was also first published in 1998. A series of albums, often based on themes (such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, blues, or duets), met with largely positive reviews.

For his contribution to the recording industry, Bennett was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street. Bennett was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997, was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001, and received a lifetime achievement award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 2002. In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named Bennett in its list of the &quot;50 Bands To See Before You Die&quot;. On December 4, 2005, Bennett was the recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor. Later, a theatrical musical revue of his songs, called &quot;I Left My Heart: A Salute to the Music of Tony Bennett&quot; was created and featured some of his best-known songs such as &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful&quot;. The following year, Bennett was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.

Bennett frequently donated his time to charitable causes, to the extent that he was sometimes nicknamed &quot;Tony Benefit&quot;. In April 2002, he joined Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker, and former President Bill Clinton in a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee at New York City&#x27;s Apollo Theater. He also recorded public service announcements for Civitan International.

Danny Bennett continued to be Tony&#x27;s manager while Dae Bennett is a recording engineer who worked on a number of Tony&#x27;s projects and who opened Bennett Studios in Englewood, New Jersey in 2001, now shuttered due to the downturn of major label budgets combined with skyrocketing overhead. Tony&#x27;s younger daughter Antonia is an aspiring jazz singer who opened shows for her father.

=== 2006–2021: Later years and final album ===
On August 3, 2006, Bennett turned 80 years old. His record label celebrated by releasing reissues, compilations, and the album &quot;&quot;, which reached his highest chart position ever and won a Grammy Award. Concerts were given, including a high-profile one for New York radio station WLTW/106.7; a performance was done with Christina Aguilera and a comedy sketch was made with affectionate Bennett impressionist Alec Baldwin on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; a Thanksgiving-time, Rob Marshall–directed television special &quot;Tony Bennett: An American Classic&quot; on NBC, which went on to win multiple Emmy Awards; receipt of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Century Award; and guest-mentoring on &quot;American Idol&quot; season 6 as well as performing during its finale. He received the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&#x27; Humanitarian Award. Bennett was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2006.
In 2008, Bennett made two appearances with Billy Joel singing &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; at the final concerts given at Shea Stadium, and in October released the album &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Christmas&quot; with The Count Basie Big Band, for which he made a number of promotional appearances at holiday time. In 2009, Bennett performed at the conclusion of the final Macworld Conference &amp; Expo for Apple Inc., singing &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; and &quot;I Left My Heart In San Francisco&quot; to a standing ovation, and later making his Jazz Fest debut in New Orleans. In February 2010, Bennett was one of over 70 artists who sang on &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;, a charity single in aid of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In October, he performed &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; at AT&amp;T Park before the third inning of Game 1 of the 2010 World Series and sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch. Days later he sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, D.C., which he reprised ten years later in a segment on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

In September 2011, Bennett appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and named American military actions in the Middle East as the root cause of the September 11 attacks. Bennett also claimed that former President George W. Bush personally told him at the Kennedy Center in December 2005 that he felt he had made a mistake invading Iraq, to which a Bush spokesperson replied, &quot;This account is flatly wrong.&quot; Following bad press resulting from his remarks, Bennett clarified his position, writing: &quot;There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country. My life experiences, ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King, made me a life-long humanist and pacifist, and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior.&quot;

In September 2011, Bennett released &quot;Duets II&quot;, a follow-up to his first collaboration album, in conjunction with his 85th birthday. He sang duets with seventeen prominent singers of varying techniques, including Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson, Queen Latifah, and Lady Gaga. Bennett appeared on the season 2 premiere of the television procedural &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; performing &quot;It Had To Be You&quot; with Carrie Underwood. His duet with Amy Winehouse on &quot;Body and Soul&quot;—reportedly the last recording she made before her death—charted on the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making Bennett the oldest living artist to appear there, as well as the artist with the greatest span of appearances. The single did well in Europe, where it reached the top 15 in several countries. The album then debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Bennett the oldest living artist to reach that top spot, as well as marking the first time he had reached it himself. A model of Koss headphones, the Tony Bennett Signature Edition (TBSE1), was created for this milestone (Bennett having been one of the early adopters of the Koss product back in the 1960s). In November 2011, Columbia released &quot;Tony Bennett – The Complete Collection&quot;, a 73-CD plus 3-DVD set, which although not absolutely &quot;complete&quot;, finally brought forth many albums that had not had a previous CD release, as well as some unreleased material and rarities. In December 2011, Bennett appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in Salford in the presence of Princess Anne.
In the wake of the premature deaths of Winehouse and Whitney Houston, Bennett called for the legalization of drugs in February 2012. In October 2012, Bennett released &quot;Viva Duets&quot;, an album of Latin American music duets, featuring Vicente Fernández, Juan Luis Guerra, and Vicentico among others. The recording and filming for the project, in Fort Lauderdale, was co-sponsored by the city. On October 31, 2012, Bennett performed &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; in front of more than 100,000 fans at a City Hall ceremony commemorating the 2012 World Series victory by the San Francisco Giants. He published another memoir, &quot;Life is a Gift: The Zen of Bennett&quot;, and a documentary film produced by his son Danny was released, also titled &quot;The Zen of Bennett&quot;.

In September 2014, Bennett performed for the first time in Israel, with his jazz quartet at the Charles Bronfman Auditorium in Tel Aviv, receiving a standing ovation. He also made a surprise cameo appearance on stage with Lady Gaga at Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv, the previous evening. The performance took place days before the release that month of the two stars&#x27; much-delayed collaborative effort and resultant Grammy-winning album, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, extending the 88-year-old Bennett&#x27;s record for the oldest artist to do so, It also earned him the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for &quot;oldest person to reach No.1 on the US Album Chart with a newly recorded album&quot;, at the age of 88 years and 69 days. In October 2014, Bennett and Lady Gaga released the concert special &quot;Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!&quot;, and at the end of the year, they kicked off their co-headlining Cheek to Cheek Tour. The pair also appeared in a Barnes &amp; Noble commercial.

On September 25, 2015, he released an album of songs composed by Jerome Kern, featuring Bill Charlap on piano, called &quot;The Silver Lining: The Songs of Jerome Kern&quot;. On November 1, 2015, Bennett, joined by the choir from the Frank Sinatra School, sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; before Game 5 of the baseball World Series between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets at Citi Field.

On August 19, 2016, shortly after his 90th birthday, Bennett was honored by the unveiling of an 8-foot tall statue in his likeness in front of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. With Senator Dianne Feinstein, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and several San Francisco mayors in attendance, Bennett was serenaded by a young-adult choir singing &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;. Bennett had first sung the song at the hotel in 1961. That same year, he performed at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 24 and the Rockefeller Center tree lighting on November 30. On December 20, 2016, NBC televised a special concert in honor of his 90th birthday, called &quot;Tony Bennett Celebrates 90: The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;. In September 2018, Bennett re-recorded the George Gershwin song &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot;, after 68 years and 342 days, according to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; adjudicator, earning the title of &quot;longest time between the release of an original recording and a re-recording of the same single by the same artist&quot;. The song appeared on the collaborative album &quot;Love Is Here to Stay&quot; with Diana Krall that was released on September 14.
Bennett&#x27;s final album, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, another collaborative record with Lady Gaga, was released on September 30, 2021. The record received generally favorable reviews, and debuted at number eight in the United States. Alexis Petridis called Bennett&#x27;s performance on the album &quot;pretty remarkable&quot; despite the singer&#x27;s age and health condition in his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Bennett broke the individual record for the longest span of top-10 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for any living artist; his first top-10 record was &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; in 1962. Bennett also broke the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to release an album of new material, at the age of 95 years and 60 days.

Bennett&#x27;s final live performances were on August 3 and 5, 2021, when he presented a pair of shows with Lady Gaga at Radio City Music Hall. On August 12, 2021, nine days after his 95th birthday, Bennett&#x27;s retirement from concerts was announced by his son and manager Danny Bennett. Danny stated that though his father remained a capable singer, he was becoming physically frail and risked a major fall if he continued touring. A television special, &quot;One Last Time: An Evening with Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga&quot; debuted on November 28, 2021, on CBS, which contained select performances from the two final concerts. Bennett&#x27;s last televised performance was also with Gaga on December 16, 2021, on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The special was filmed the previous July in front of an intimate studio audience in New York City, and included duets from &quot;Love for Sale&quot;. A documentary called &quot;The Lady and the Legend&quot;, which will include footage from the making of Bennett and Lady Gaga&#x27;s two collaborative albums is scheduled to be available on Paramount+ in September 2023.

Despite his retirement, as of early 2022, Bennett still continued to rehearse with his music director three times a week, Danny Bennett said in an interview.

==Artistry==

===Painting===
Bennett also had success as a painter, done under his real name of Anthony Benedetto, or just Benedetto. He followed up his childhood interest with professional training, work, and museum visits throughout his life. He sketched or painted every day, often of views out of hotel windows when he was on tour.

He exhibited his work in numerous galleries around the world. He was chosen as the official artist for the 2001 Kentucky Derby, and was commissioned by the United Nations to do two paintings, including one for its fiftieth anniversary. His painting &quot;Homage to Hockney&quot; (for his friend David Hockney, painted after Hockney drew him) is on permanent display at the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio. His &quot;Boy on Sailboat, Sydney Bay&quot; is in the permanent collection at the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park in New York City, as is his &quot;Central Park&quot; at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. His paintings and drawings have been featured in &quot;ARTnews&quot; and other magazines, and have sold for as much as $80,000 a piece. Many of his works were published in the art book &quot;Tony Bennett: What My Heart Has Seen&quot; in 1996. In 2007, another book involving his paintings, &quot;Tony Bennett in the Studio: A Life of Art &amp; Music&quot;, became a bestseller among art books.

===Musical style===
Regarding his choices in music, Bennett reiterated his artistic stance in a 2010 interview:

==Awards and legacy==
Bennett won 20 Grammy Awards (including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award), as follows (years shown are the year in which the ceremony was held and the award was given, not the year in which the recording was released):

===Discography===
Bennett released over 70 albums during his career, almost all for Columbia Records. The biggest selling of these in the U.S. were &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;, &quot;MTV Unplugged: Tony Bennett&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, all of which went platinum for shipping one million copies. Eight other albums of his went gold in the U.S., including several compilations. Bennett also charted over 30 singles during his career, with his biggest hits all occurring during the early 1950s, and none charting between 1968 and 2010.

==Personal life==

On February 12, 1952, Bennett married Ohio art student and jazz fan Patricia Beech, whom he had met the previous year after a nightclub performance in Cleveland. Two thousand female fans dressed in black gathered outside the ceremony at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan, New York, in mock mourning. The couple had two sons, D&#x27;Andrea (Danny, b. 1954) and Daegal (Dae, b. 1955). Bennett and his wife Patricia separated in 1965, their marriage a victim of Bennett&#x27;s spending too much time on the road, among other factors. In 1969, Patricia sued him for divorce on grounds of adultery. In 1971, their divorce became official.

Bennett had become involved with aspiring actress Sandra Grant while filming &quot;The Oscar&quot; in 1965. The couple lived together for several years and on December 29, 1971, they quietly married in New York. They had two daughters, Joanna (b. 1970) whom he named after the 1964 song When Joanna Loved Me and Antonia (b. 1974), and moved to Los Angeles. The two were married until 1983.

In the late 1980s, Bennett entered into a long-term romantic relationship with Susan Crow, a former New York City schoolteacher.

Bennett and Crow founded Exploring the Arts, a charitable organization dedicated to creating, promoting, and supporting arts education. At the same time, they founded (and named after Bennett&#x27;s friend) the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens, a public high school dedicated to teaching the performing arts. The school opened in 2001 and has a very high graduation rate. On June 21, 2007, Bennett married Crow in a private civil ceremony in New York that was witnessed by Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York.

==Politics==
The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the presidency of Herbert Hoover would make Bennett a lifelong Democrat.

==Illness and death==
In February 2021, an article in &quot;AARP Magazine&quot; revealed that Bennett had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2016, though he continued to perform and record until the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. He briefly resumed performing in 2021 for his farewell performances. Bennett&#x27;s twice-weekly singing practices are thought to have kept his brain stimulated and spared him from symptoms such as disorientation, depression, and a detachment from reality. His neurologist told &quot;AARP&quot; that, prior to the pandemic, the singer&#x27;s touring schedule &quot;kept him on his toes and also stimulated his brain in a significant way&quot;. Bennett recorded tracks with Lady Gaga from 2018 until early 2020 for their 2021 album &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, despite at times being &quot;lost and bewildered&quot; during recording sessions.

In announcing Bennett&#x27;s retirement in August 2021, Danny Bennett stated that the Alzheimer&#x27;s was mainly affecting his father&#x27;s short-term memory and that he would often forget he had just performed after a concert; his long-term memory remained intact and he could still remember all the lyrics to his repertoire when performing. 

Bennett died at his home in New York City on July 21, 2023, following a seven-year battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. His family said he kept singing to the end, lastly &quot;Because of You&quot;. He was hailed as the &quot;champion&quot; and &quot;legendary interpreter&quot; of the Great American Songbook.

Bennett was interred alongside his parents at Calvary Cemetery, Queens.

<doc id="232670" wikidata="Q2912428" url="?curid=232670" title="Ready-to-wear">
<text>Ready-to-wear (RTW)also called prêt-à-porter, or off-the-rack or off-the-peg in casual useis the term for garments sold in finished condition in standardized sizes, as distinct from made-to-measure or bespoke clothing tailored to a particular person&#x27;s frame. In other words, it is a piece of clothing that was mass produced in different sizes and sold that way instead of it being designed and sewn for one person. The term &quot;off-the-peg&quot; is sometimes used for items other than clothing, such as handbags. It is the opposite of haute couture.

Ready-to-wear has a rather different place in the spheres of fashion and classic clothing. In the fashion industry, designers produce ready-to-wear clothing, intended to be worn without significant alteration because clothing made to standard sizes fits most people. They use standard patterns, factory equipment, and faster construction techniques to keep costs low, compared to a custom-sewn version of the same item. Some fashion houses and fashion designers make mass-produced and industrially manufactured ready-to-wear lines, while others offer garments that are not unique but are produced in limited numbers.

==History==
===Men&#x27;s and children&#x27;s clothing===

Before pre-war times men’s ready-to-wear clothing was determined by these following factors : cloth, trimmings, labor, taxes, amortization, transportation charges, and overhead &amp; profit which lead for ready-to-wear military uniforms to be mass-produced in the United States during the War of 1812. High-quality ready-to-wear garments for men became generally available soon thereafter, as the relatively simple, flattering cuts and muted tones of the contemporary fashion made proportionate sizing possible in mass production. The first ready-made garment factory was established in New York City in 1831. During the American Civil War the need for ready-made uniforms helped the garment sector grow in the United States.

In 1868, Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter offered ready-to-wear clothing for men and children to Belgian clientele when they opened the first chain department stores, &quot;Dewachter frères&quot; (Dewachter Brothers). By 1904, the chain was managed by Isidore&#x27;s son, Louis, and had grown to 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with some cities having multiple stores. Louis Dewachter also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym Louis Dewis.

Near the end of the nineteenth century, ready-made garments were no longer seen as only for the lower classes but also for the middle classes because of the view of the social aspect and how it has changed in value. This trend started in the United States. In the beginning, they were more popular with men than women. In the late 1860s, twenty-five percent of garments produced in the US were ready-made, but by 1890, the portion had risen to sixty percent. By 1951, ninety percent of garments sold in the United States were ready-made. During the same time, two-thirds of garments sold in France were ready-made.

===Women&#x27;s clothing===
In the early 19th century, women&#x27;s fashion was highly ornate and dependent on a precise fit, so ready-to-wear garments for women did not become widely available until the beginning of the 20th century. Before, women would alter their previously styled clothing to stay up to date with fashion trends. Women with larger incomes purchased new, fully tailored clothing in current styles while middle-class and lower-class women adjusted their clothing to fit changes in fashion by adding new neck collars, shortening skirts, or cinching shirt waists.

The widespread adoption of ready-to-wear clothing reflected a variety of factors including economic disparities, a desire for an independent fashion industry, and an increase in media attention. The demand for affordable and fashionable women&#x27;s clothing sparked designers and department stores to manufacture clothing in bulk quantities that were accessible to women of all classes and incomes. Through the emergence of the US ready-to-wear market, designers like Chanel with their shift dresses or the mail-order catalogs sent to rural farms by Sears allowed women to purchase clothing faster and at a cheaper price. The introduction of the concept of &quot;pret-a-porter&quot; has been attributed to Sonia Delaunay after her geometric styles were exhibited at the seminal 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs in Paris.

Another significant factor created by the ready-to-wear industry was the US development of a style independent from Europe. The US fashion market turned away from the Parisian style in favor of an individualized apparel industry promoted through advertisements and articles in magazines like &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, &quot;Harper’s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;.

Ready-to-wear also sparked new interests in health, beauty, and diet as manufactured clothing set specific, standardized sizes in attire to increase quantities for profit. Women of larger sizes had difficulties finding apparel in department stores, as most manufacturers maintained and sold the limited sizes across the nation.

Overall, ready-to-wear fashion exposed women to the newest styles and fashion trends, leading to a substantial increase in profits by US factories from $12,900,583 in 1876 (equivalent to $ in ) to $1,604,500,957 in 1929 (equivalent to $ in ). The ready-to-wear fashion revolution led to an expansion of the US fashion industry that made fashionable apparel accessible, cost-effective, and commensurable.

Interest in ready-to-wear was sparked by Yves Saint Laurent, who was the first designer to launch a ready-to-wear collection, and in 1966 he opened Rive Gauche, his first ready-to-wear boutique. Whether he succeeded in democratizing fashion is an open question, since few were able to afford his designs, but he did pave the way for ready-to-wear fashion and the cross-fertilisation between haute-couture and high-street fashion that persists into the 21st century.

==Haute couture and bespoke==

Fashion houses that produce a women&#x27;s &quot;haute couture&quot; line, such as Chanel, Dior, Lacroix and Saint Laurent also produce a ready-to-wear line, which returns a greater profit because of the higher volume of garments made and the greater availability of the clothing. The construction of ready-to-wear clothing is also held to a different standard than that of &quot;haute couture&quot; due to its industrial nature. High-end ready-to-wear lines are sometimes based upon a famous gown or other pattern that is then duplicated and advertised to raise the visibility of the designer.

==Collections==
In high-end fashion, ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a city-by-city basis, and the most prominent of these include London, New York, Milan, and Paris, and are held twice a year—the Fall/Winter (FW) shows take place in February, and the Spring/Summer (SS) collections are shown in September. Smaller lines include the Cruise and Pre-Fall collections, which add to the retail value of a brand, and are presented separately at the fashion designer&#x27;s discretion. Ready-to-wear fashion weeks occur separately and earlier than those of &quot;haute couture&quot;. Unlike ready-to-wear products, collections are kept exclusive to designers chosen guests and idols creating the division between two production styles. It takes the work of one person to a team of skilled artists rather than machine made garments.

<text>Matala (Greek: Μάταλα) is a village located 75 km south-west of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Matala is part of the community of Pitsidia within the municipal unit of Tympaki, Faistos municipality, Heraklion regional unit.

== History ==
The artificial caves in the cliff of the Matala bay were created in the Neolithic Age. Matala was the port of Phaistos during the Minoan period. In the year 220 BC, Matala was occupied by the Gortynians, and during the Roman period, Matala became the port of Gortys. It has been suggested that the caves were once used as tombs, but it is more likely that they were used as living spaces, given their volume (corpses do not need that much room to walk around). One of the caves is called &quot;Brutospeliana&quot; because according to the legend it was frequented by the Roman general Brutus.

Matala was then a fishing village. In the 1960s, the caves were occupied by hippies who were later driven out by the church and the military junta. Matala is now a popular tourist destination relying on coach tours and summer visitors. There are many gift shops and bars. Matala&#x27;s hippie history is celebrated during the three-day Matala Beach Festival, held every June since 2011.

== Mythology ==
When Zeus in the form of a white bull seduced the princess Europa, he crossed the sea and brought her to the beach of Matala. There he changed into an eagle and flew her to Gortys where he had sex with her.

==Climate==
Matala has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;). Matala experiences hot, very dry summers and very mild, wet winters.

== In popular culture ==
*In &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals Zero Hour&quot;, the USS &quot;Reagan&quot;, along with the carrier support group docked in Matala and the naval base on the island, is destroyed by GLA forces .
*In Simon Scarrow&#x27;s historical adventure novel, &quot;The Gladiator&quot;, the protagonists beach their damaged ship just outside Matala after it is damaged by a tsunami.
*Canadian singer and musician Joni Mitchell&#x27;s experiences with the Matala hippies were immortalised in her songs &quot;Carey&quot; and &quot;California&quot;, on her 1971 album &quot;Blue&quot;. She spent several weeks living in the Matala caves during the summer of 1969.

<text>Turntablism is the art of manipulating sounds and creating new music, sound effects, mixes and other creative sounds and beats, typically by using two or more turntables and a cross fader-equipped DJ mixer. The mixer is plugged into a PA system (for live events) or broadcasting equipment (if the DJ is performing on radio, TV or Internet radio) so that a wider audience can hear the turntablist&#x27;s music. Turntablists typically manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic &quot;scratching&quot; effect which is a key part of hip hop music), all while using a DJ mixer&#x27;s cross-fader control and the mixer&#x27;s gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. Turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on different records (Greasley &amp; Prior, 2013).

Turntablists, often called DJs (or &quot;deejays&quot;), generally prefer direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by &quot;scratching&quot; and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. The word &quot;turntablist&quot; is claimed to be originated by Luis &quot;DJ Disk&quot; Quintanilla (Primus, Herbie Hancock, Invisibl Skratch Piklz). After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by DJ Babu to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop DJing in the 1990s.

According to most DJ historians, it has been documented that &quot;DJ Babu&quot; of the &quot;Beat Junkies&quot; / &quot;Dilated Peoples&quot; was the one who originally coined the term &quot;turntablist&quot;. In 1995 while working on the groundbreaking mixtape &quot;Comprehension&quot;, DJ Babu hand wrote the name &quot;Babu The Turntablist&quot; on hundreds of copies of this mixtape to describe his style of DJing, while working on the track &quot;Turntablism&quot; with &quot;D-Styles&quot; and DJ Melo-D, Babu would say &quot;if someone plays the piano, we call them a pianist, if someone plays the guitar, we call them a guitarist, why don&#x27;t we call ourselves Turntablists?&quot; found in the documentary &quot;Scratch (2001 film)&quot; which was released in 2001.

John Oswald described the art: &quot;A phonograph in the hands of a &#x27;hiphop/scratch&#x27; artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which are unique and &quot;not&quot; reproduced—the record player becomes a musical instrument.&quot; Some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and improvising with other performers. Depending on the records and tracks selected by the DJ and their turntablist style (e.g., hip hop music), a turntablist can create rhythmic accompaniment, percussion breaks, basslines or beat loops, atmospheric &quot;pads&quot;, &quot;stabs&quot; of sudden chords or interwoven melodic lines.

The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.

==History==

===Precursors===

The use of the turntable as a musical instrument has its roots dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when musique concrète composers did experiments with audio equipment. Experimental composers (such as John Cage, Halim El-Dabh, and Pierre Schaeffer) used them to sample and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary Landscape No. 1&quot; (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and cymbal. Edgard Varèse experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s–2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as Christian Marclay, Janek Schaefer, Otomo Yoshihide, Philip Jeck, and Maria Chavez. Turntablism as it is known today, however, did not surface until the advent of hip hop in the 1970s.

Examples of turntable effects can also be found on popular records produced in the 1960s and 1970s. This was most prominent in Jamaican dub music of the 1960s, among deejays in the Jamaican sound system culture. Dub music introduced the techniques of mixing and scratching vinyl, which Jamaican immigrants introduced to American hip hop culture in the early 1970s. Beyond dub music, Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s 1968 self-titled debut album features a backspin effect in the song &quot;Walk on the Water&quot;.
===Direct-drive turntables===
Turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables. In 1971, Matsushita released the Technics SL-1100. Due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity, it was adopted by early hip hop artists.

A forefather of turntablism was DJ Kool Herc, an immigrant from Jamaica to New York City. He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican dub music, while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the Technics SL-1100, which he used for the first sound system he set up after emigrating to New York. The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the b-dancers&#x27; favorite section, switching back and forth between the two to loop the breaks to a rhythmic beat.

The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200, which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972. It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.

===Hip-hop===
Turntablism as a modern art form and musical practice has its roots within African-American inner city hip-hop of the late 1970s. Kool Herc (a Jamaican DJ who immigrated to New York City), Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash are widely credited for having cemented the now established role of DJ as hip hop&#x27;s foremost instrumentalist. Kool Herc&#x27;s invention of break-beat DJing is generally regarded as the foundational development in hip hop history, as it gave rise to all other elements of the genre. His influence on the concept of &quot;DJ as turntablist&quot; is equally profound.

To understand the significance of this achievement, it is important to first define the &quot;break&quot;. Briefly, the &quot;break&quot; of a song is a musical fragment only seconds in length, which typically takes the form of an &quot;interlude&quot; in which all or most of the music stops except for the percussion. Kool Herc introduced the break-beat technique as a way of extending the break indefinitely. This is done by buying two of the same record, finding the break on each record, and switching from one to the other using the DJ mixer: e.g., as record &quot;A&quot; plays, the DJ quickly backtracks to the same break on record &quot;B&quot;, which will again take the place of &quot;A&quot; at a specific moment where the audience will not notice that the DJ has switched records. Using that idea, Grandmaster Flash elaborated on Kool Herc&#x27;s invention of break-beat DJing and came up with the quick-mix theory, in which Flash sectioned off a part of the record like a clock. He described it as being &quot;...like cutting, the backspin, and the double-back.&quot;

Kool Herc&#x27;s revolutionary techniques set the course for the development of turntablism as an art form in significant ways. Most important, however, he developed a new form of DJing that did not consist of just playing and mixing records one after the other. The type of DJ that specializes in mixing a set is well respected for his/her own set of unique skills, but playlist mixing is still DJing in the traditional sense. Kool Herc instead originated the idea of &quot;creating&quot; a sequence for his own purposes, introducing the idea of the DJ as the &quot;feature&quot; of parties, whose performance on any given night would be different from on another night, because the music would be created by the DJ, mixing a bassline from one song with a beat from another song (Greasley &amp; Prior, 2013). The DJ would be examined critically by the crowd on both a technical and entertainment level.

Grand Wizzard Theodore, an apprentice of Flash, who accidentally isolated the most recognizable technique of turntablism: scratching. He put his hand on a record one day, to silence the music on the turntable while his mother was calling out to him and thus accidentally discovered the sound of scratching by moving the record back and forth under the stylus. Though Theodore discovered scratching, it was Flash who helped push the early concept and showcase it to the public, in his live shows and on recordings. DJ Grand Mixer DXT is also credited with furthering the concept of scratching by practicing the rhythmic scratching of a record on one or more turntables (often two), using different velocities to alter the pitch of the note or sound on the recording (Alberts 2002). DXT appeared (as DST) on Herbie Hancock&#x27;s hit song &quot;Rockit&quot;. These early pioneers cemented the fundamental practice that would later become the emerging turntablist art form. Scratching would during the 1980s become a staple of hip hop music, being used by producers and DJs on records and in live shows. By the end of the 1980s it was very common to hear scratching on a record, generally as part of the chorus of a track or within its production.

On stage the DJ would provide the music for the MCs to rhyme and rap to, scratching records during the performance and showcasing his or her skills alongside the verbal skills of the MC. The most well known example of this &#x27;equation&#x27; of MCs and DJ is probably Run-D.M.C. who were composed of two MCs and one DJ. The DJ, Jam Master Jay, was an integral part of the group since his turntablism was critical to Run DMC&#x27;s productions and performances. While Flash and Bambaataa were using the turntable to explore repetition, alter rhythm and create the instrumental stabs and punch phrasing that would come to characterize the sound of hip hop, Grandmaster DST was busy cutting &quot;real&quot; musicians on their own turf. His scratching on Herbie Hancock&#x27;s 1983 single, &quot;Rockit&quot;, makes it perhaps the most influential DJ track of them all – even more than (Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s) &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot;, it established the DJ as the star of the record, even if he wasn&#x27;t the frontman. Compared to &quot;Rockit&quot;, West Street Mob&#x27;s &quot;Break Dancin&#x27; – Electric Boogie&quot; (1983) was punk negation. As great as &quot;Break Dancin&#x27;&quot; was, though, it highlighted the limited tonal range of scratching, which was in danger of becoming a short-lived fad like human beat-boxing until the emergence of Code Money&#x27;s DJ Brethren from Philadelphia in the mid-1980s.

Despite New York&#x27;s continued pre-eminence in the hip-hop world, scratch DJing was modernized less than 100 miles down the road in Philadelphia, where the climate for the return of the DJ was created by inventing transformer scratching. Developed by DJ Spinbad, DJ Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff, transforming was basically clicking the fader on and off while moving a block of sound (a riff or a short verbal phrase) across the stylus. Expanding the tonal as well as rhythmic possibilities of scratching, the transformer scratch epitomized the chopped-up aesthetic of hip hop culture. Hip hop was starting to become big money and the cult of personality started to take over. Hip hop became very much at the service of the rapper and Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff were accorded maybe one track on an album – for example, DJ Jazzy Jeff&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of Jazz&quot; (1987) and &quot;Jazzy&#x27;s in the House&quot; (1988) and Cash Money&#x27;s &quot;The Music Maker&quot; (1988). Other crucial DJ tracks from this period include Tuff Crew&#x27;s DJ Too Tuff&#x27;s &quot;Behold the Detonator&quot; &quot;Soul Food&quot; (both 1989)&quot;, and Gang Starr&#x27;s &quot;DJ Premier in Deep Concentration&quot; (1989).

===Decline in role of DJ in hip hop===
The appearance of turntablists and the birth of turntablism was prompted by one major factor – the disappearance or downplaying of the role of the DJ in hip-hop groups, on records and in live shows at the turn of the 1990s. This disappearance has been widely documented in books and documentaries (among them &quot;Black Noise&quot; and &quot;Scratch&quot;), and was linked to the increased use of DAT tapes and other studio techniques that would ultimately push the DJ further away from the original hip-hop equation of the MC as the vocalist and the DJ as the music provider alongside the producer. This push and disappearance of the DJ meant that the practices of the DJ, such as scratching, went back underground and were cultivated and built upon by a generation of people who grew up with hip hop, DJs and scratching. By the mid-90s the disappearance of the DJ in hip hop had created a sub-culture which would come to be known as turntablism and which focused entirely on the DJ using his turntables and a mixer to manipulate sounds and create music. By pushing the practice of DJing away, hip hop created the grounds for this sub-culture to evolve (Greasley &amp; Prior, 2013).

===Coining of terms===
The origin of the terms turntablist and turntablism are widely contested and argued about, but over the years some facts have been established by various documentaries (&quot;Battlesounds&quot;, Doug Pray&#x27;s &quot;Scratch&quot;), books (DJ Culture), conferences (Skratchcon 2000) and interviews in online and printed magazines. These facts are that the origins of the words most likely lay with practitioners on the US West Coast, centered on the San Francisco Bay Area. Some claim that DJ Disk, a member of the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, was the first to coin the term, others claim that &quot;DJ Babu&quot;, a member of the &quot;Beat Junkies&quot;, was responsible for coining and spreading the term turntablist after inscribing it on his mixtapes as&quot;Babu the Turntablist&quot; and passing them around. Another claim credits DJ Supreme, 1991 World Supremacy Champion and DJ for Lauryn Hill. The truth most likely lies somewhere in between all these facts.

In an interview with the &quot;Spin Science&quot; online resource in 2005, &quot;DJ Babu&quot; added the following comments about the birth and spread of the term:

===Mid- to late 1990s===
By the mid- to late 1990s the terms &quot;turntablism&quot; and &quot;turntablist&quot; had become established and accepted to define the practice and practitioner of using turntables and a mixer to create or manipulate sounds and music. This could be done by scratching a record or manipulating the rhythms on the record either by drumming, looping or beat juggling. The decade of the 1990s is also important in shaping the turntablist art form and culture as it saw the emergence of pioneering artists (Mix Master Mike, DJ Qbert, DJ Quest, DJ Krush, A-Trak, Ricci Rucker, Mike Boo, Pumpin&#x27; Pete, Prime Cuts) and crews (Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, The Allies, X-Ecutioners), record labels (Asphodel), DJ Battles (DMC) and the evolution of scratching and other turntablism practices such as Beat Juggling which are viewable in the IDA (International DJ Association/ITF) World Finals.

===Techniques ===
More sophisticated methods of scratching were developed during that decade, with crews and individual DJs concentrating on the manipulation of the record in time with the manipulation of the cross fader on the mixer to create new rhythms and sonic artifacts with a variety of sounds. The evolution of scratching from a fairly simple sound and simple rhythmic cadences to more complicated sounds and more intricate rhythmical patterns allowed the practitioners to further evolve what could be done with scratching musically. These new ways of scratching were all given names, from flare to crab or orbit, and spread as DJs taught each other, practiced together or just showed off their new techniques to other DJs. Alongside the evolution of scratching, other practices such as drumming (or scratch drumming) and beat juggling were also evolved significantly during the 1990s.

Beat juggling was invented by Steve Dee, a member of the X-Men (later renamed X-Ecutioners) crew. Beat juggling essentially involves the manipulation of two identical or different drum patterns on two different turntables via the mixer to create a new pattern. A simple example would be to use two copies of the same drum pattern to evolve the pattern by doubling the snares, syncopating the drum kick, adding rhythm and variation to the existing pattern. From this concept, which Steve Dee showcased in the early 1990s at DJ battles, Beat Juggling evolved throughout the decade to the point where by the end of it, it had become an intricate technique to create entirely new &quot;beats&quot; and rhythms out of existing, pre-recorded ones (van Veen &amp; Attias, 2012). These were now not just limited to using drum patterns, but could also consist of other sounds – the ultimate aim being to create a new rhythm out of the pre-recorded existing ones. While beat juggling is not as popular as scratching due to the more demanding rhythmical knowledge it requires, it has proved popular within DJ battles and in certain compositional situations (van Veen &amp; Attias, 2012).

===Studies===
One of the earliest academic studies of turntablism (White 1996) argued for its designation as a legitimate electronic musical instrument—a manual analog sampler—and described turntable techniques such as backspinning, cutting, scratching and blending as basic tools for most hip hop DJs. White&#x27;s study suggests the proficient hip-hop DJ must possess similar kinds of skills as those required by trained musicians, not limited to a sense of timing, hand–eye coordination, technical competence and musical creativity. By the year 2000, turntablism and turntablists had become widely publicized and accepted in the mainstream and within hip hop as valid artists. Through this recognition came further evolution.

===Evolution===
This evolution took many shapes and forms: some continued to concentrate on the foundations of the art form and its original links to hip hop culture, some became producers utilizing the skills they&#x27;d learnt as turntablists and incorporating those into their productions, some concentrated more on the DJing aspect of the art form by combining turntablist skills with the trademark skills of club DJs, while others explored alternative routes in utilizing the turntable as an instrument or production tool solely for the purpose of making music – either by using solely the turntable or by incorporating it into the production process alongside tools such as drum machines, samplers, computer software, and so on. Digital turntablism techniques later was coined into a term called controllerism, which inspired a movement of new digital DJs such as DJ Buddy Holly and Moldover. DJ Buddy and Moldover went on to create a song called &quot;Controllerism&quot; that pays homage to the sound of digitally emulated turntablism.

New DJs, turntablists and crews owe a distinct debt to pioneer old-school DJs like Kool DJ Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, Grandmixer DST, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa, also DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Cash Money, DJ Scratch, DJ Clark Kent, and other DJs of the golden age of hip hop, who originally developed many of the concepts and techniques that evolved into modern turntablism. Within the realm of hip hop, notable modern turntablists are the cinematic DJ Shadow, who influenced Diplo and RJD2, among others, and the experimental DJ Spooky, whose &quot;Optometry&quot; albums showed that the turntablist can perfectly fit within a jazz setting. Mix Master Mike was a founding member of the influential turntablist group Invisibl Skratch Piklz (begun in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet) and later DJ for the Beastie Boys. Cut Chemist, DJ Nu-Mark, and Kid Koala are also known as virtuosi of the turntables.

====Concerto for Turntable====

&quot;Concerto for Turntable&quot; is a groundbreaking musical work that integrates the art of turntablism with classical music composition. Co-created by DJ Radar and Raul Yanez, a composer and professor at Arizona State University, this composition showcases a unique melding of electronic and orchestral music elements. The concerto was first performed in notable venues including Carnegie Hall, symbolizing its acceptance into the classical music tradition. The project was initially supported by Red Bull, which helped to sponsor its development and the premiere performance. The concerto debuted at Arizona State University&#x27;s Gammage Auditorium before its major premiere at Carnegie Hall on October 2, 2005.

The &quot;Concerto for Turntable&quot; features a turntable as the solo instrument, complemented by a full symphony orchestra. This arrangement necessitated the development of &quot;scratch notation&quot; by DJ Radar to transcribe his turntable manipulations into a format readable by classically trained musicians. This innovative scoring method was crucial for integrating the turntable&#x27;s electronic sounds with the acoustic orchestra.

The premiere at Carnegie Hall was met with enthusiastic responses, highlighting the potential of digital instruments within classical music settings and demonstrating the artistic validity of turntablism.

==Techniques==
===Chopped and screwed===
Starting in the 1980s in the Southern United States and burgeoning in the 2000s, a meta-genre of hip hop called &quot;chopped and screwed&quot; became a significant and popular form of turntablism. Often using a greater variety of vinyl emulation software rather than normal turntables, &quot;chopped and screwed&quot; stood out from previous standards of turntablism in its slowing of the pitch and tempo (&quot;screwing&quot;) and syncopated beat skipping (&quot;chopping&quot;), among other added effects of sound manipulation.

DJ Screw Robert Earl Davis of Texas, innovated the art of chopping and screwing coining the phrase &quot;chopped n screwed&quot;, taking original contemporary hit records and replaying them in the &quot;chopped n screwed&quot; art form. This gained a very large following finally paving the way for small, independent rap labels to turn a decent profit. However, it is thought by many that DJ Michael Price started slowing down vinyl recordings before the era of DJ Screw.

This form of turntablism, which is usually applied to prior studio recordings (in the form of custom mixtapes) and is not prominent as a feature of live performances, de-emphasizes the role of the rapper, singer or other vocalist by distorting the vocalist&#x27;s voice along with the rest of the recording (van Veen &amp; Attias, 2012). Arguably, this combination of distortion and audial effects against the original recording grants greater freedom of improvisation to the DJ than did the previous forms of turntablism. Via the ChopNotSlop movement, &quot;Chopped and screwed&quot; has also been applied to other genres of music such as R&amp;B and rock music, thus transcending its roots within the hip-hop genre.

===Transform===
A transform is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and repeated movement of the crossfader. The name, which has been associated with DJ Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff, comes from its similarity to the sound made by the robots in the 1980s cartoon, &quot;The Transformers&quot;.

===Tear===
A tear is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from moving the record on the turntable by hand. The tear is much like a baby scratch in that one does not need the fader to perform it, but unlike a baby scratch, when the DJ pulls the record back he or she pauses his or her hand for a split second in the middle of the stroke. The result is one forward sound and two distinct backward sounds. This scratch can also be performed by doing the opposite and placing the pause on the forward stroke instead. A basic tear is usually performed with the crossfader open the entire time, but it can also be combined with other scratches such as flares for example by doing tears with the record hand and cutting the sound in and out with the fader hand.

===Orbit===
An orbit is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is generally any scratch that incorporates both a forward and backward movement, or vice versa, of the record in sequence. The orbit was developed by DJ Disk who incorporated the flare after being shown by DJ Qbert. Usually when someone is referring to an orbit, they are most likely talking about flare orbits. For example, A 1 click forward flare and a 1 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 4 very quick distinct sounds) would be a 1 click orbit. A 2 click forward flare and a 2 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 6 very distinct sounds) would be a 2 click orbit, etc. Orbits can be performed once as a single orbit move, or sequenced to produce a cyclical never ending type of orbit sound.

===Flare===
Flare is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and quick movement of the crossfader. The flare was invented by its namesake, DJ Flare in 1987. This scratch technique is much like the &quot;transform&quot; in some ways, only instead of starting with the sound that is cutting up off, one starts with the sound on and concentrate on cutting the sound into pieces by bouncing the fader off the cut outside of the fader slot to make the sound cut out and then back in a split second.

Each time the DJ bounces the fader off the side of the fader slot it makes a distinct clicking noise. For this reason, flares are named according to clicks. A simple one click forward flare would be a forward scratch starting with the sound on as the DJ bounces/clicks the fader against the side once extremely quickly in the middle of the forward stroke creating two distinct sounds in one stroke of your record hand and ending with the fader open. In the same manner, 2 clicks, 3 clicks, and even more clicks (if a DJ is fast enough) can be performed to do different types of flares. The discovery and development of the flare scratch was instrumental in elevating this art form to the level of speed and technical scratching that is seen in the 2010s.

===Chirp===
A &quot;chirp&quot; is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made with a mix of moving the record and incorporating movement with the crossfade mixer. It was invented by DJ Jazzy Jeff. The scratch is somewhat difficult to perform because it takes a good amount of coordination. The scratch starts out with the cross-fader open. The DJ then moves the record forward while simultaneously closing the previously opened channel ending the first sound. Then, in a reverse fashion, the DJ opens the channel while moving the record backwards creating a more controlled sounding &quot;baby scratch&quot;. Done in quick succession it sounds as though a chirp sound is being produced.

===Stab===

A &quot;stab&quot; is quite similar to the chirp technique but requires the crossfade mixer to be &quot;closed&quot;. The stab requires the user to push the record forward and back quickly and moving the crossfade mixer with a thumb pressed against it, which results in minimal sound coming out, producing a sharp &quot;stabbing&quot; noise&quot;.

===Crab===
A &quot;crab&quot; is a type of scratch used by turntablists and originally developed by DJ Qbert. It is one of the most difficult scratch techniques to master. The crab is done by pushing the record forward and back while pushing the crossfader mixer open or closed through a quick succession of 4 movements with the fingers. Variations can also include 3 or 2 fingers, and generally it is recommended for beginners to start with 2 fingers and work their way to 4. It is a difficult move to master but also versatile and quite rewarding if done right.

==Visual elements==

Visual elements may be linked to turntable movement, incorporating digital media including photographs, graphic stills, film, video, and computer-generated effects into live performance. A separate video mixer is used in combination with the turntable. In 2005 the International Turntablist Federation World final introduced the &#x27;Experimental&#x27; category to recognise visual artistry.

==Contests==
Like many other musical instrumentalists, turntablists compete to see who can develop the fastest, most innovative and most creative approaches to their instrument. The selection of a champion comes from the culmination of battles between turntablists. Battling involves each turntablist performing a routine (A combination of various technical scratches, beat juggles, and other elements, including body tricks) within a limited time period, after which the routine is judged by a panel of experts. The winner is selected based upon score. These organized competitions evolved from actual old school &quot;battles&quot; where DJs challenged each other at parties, and the &quot;judge&quot; was usually the audience, who would indicate their collective will by cheering louder for the DJ they thought performed better. The DMC World DJ Championships has been hosted since 1985. There are separate competitions for solo DJs and DJ teams, the title of World Champion being bestowed on the winners of each. They also maintain a turntablism hall of fame.

== Role of women==


In Western popular music, women musicians have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, with top examples being Madonna, Celine Dion and Rihanna. However, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. In a 2013 &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; article Rosina Ncube attested that few women work in the record production and sound engineering industry. Ncube claimed that &quot;[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male&quot; and that female producers are less well-known than their male counterparts despite accomplishing great feats within the music industry. The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male.

In hip hop music, the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. In 2007, University of North Carolina music professor Mark Katz&#x27;s article stated that it is rare for women to compete in turntable battles and that this gender disparity has become a topic of conversation among the hip-hop DJ community. In 2010, Rebekah Farrugia stated that in the EDM sphere, a male-centric culture has contributed to the marginalisation of women who seek to engage and contribute. Whilst turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests that the broad use, or lack of use, of the turntable by women across genres and disciplines is impacted by &quot;male technophilia&quot;. Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on female engagement with engineering technology. Oldenziel argues that socialization is a central factor in the lack of female engagement with technology, insisting that the historical socialisation of boys as technophiles has contributed to the prevalence of men who engage with technology.

Lucy Green, professor of music at the University College London, focused on gender in relation to musical performers and creators, and specifically on educational frameworks as they relate to both. She suggests that women&#x27;s alienation from fields with strong technical aspects such as DJing, sound engineering and music producing should not only be attributed to a feminine dislike towards these instruments. Instead she argues that women entering these fields are forced to complete the difficult task of disrupting a dominant masculine sphere. Despite this, women and girls do increasingly engage in turntable and DJ practices, individually and collectively, and &quot;carve out spaces for themselves in EDM and DJ Culture&quot;.

<doc id="232677" wikidata="Q580287" url="?curid=232677" title="Bob Chiarelli">
<text>Roberto Chiarelli (born September 24, 1941) is a Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who served from 1987 to 1997 and again from 2010 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Ottawa West and Ottawa West—Nepean. He was the Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton from 1997 to 2001 and was mayor of Ottawa from 2001 to 2006. He served in the provincial cabinets of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne. Chiarelli was a candidate for Mayor of Ottawa in the 2022 Ottawa municipal election.

==Background==
The youngest of seven children, Chiarelli is the son of Antonia ( Lorello) and Eugenio Chiarelli, an immigrant from Cleto, Calabria, Italy, who owned a grocery store and butcher shop in Little Italy on Rochester Street. Eugenio first moved to Ottawa, before Atonia moved from Italy with their first two children. The family lived above Eugenio&#x27;s store. Bob was an ice hockey player in high school and attended Clarkson University, New York, on a hockey scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree, and then returned to Ottawa to attend the University of Ottawa law school. He began his legal practice in 1969. He served for seven years on the National Capital Commission. He lives in Ottawa with his partner Randi Hansen, and has five adult children and two grandchildren.

==Provincial politics==
Chiarelli entered politics in 1987, where he ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1987 provincial election in the riding of Ottawa West. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Derek Insley by about 6,000 votes. He served as the parliamentary assistant to the Chair of the Management Board in 1987–88. Chiarelli was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1990 and 1995. Chiarelli endorsed Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996.

He resigned his seat in 1997 in order to pursue a position in municipal politics.

===Return to provincial politics===
In 2010, Chiarelli ran as the Liberal Party candidate in a by-election held in the riding of Ottawa West–Nepean to succeed Jim Watson who resigned to run for Mayor of Ottawa. He won the by-election, which was held on March 4. Chiarelli was re-elected in the 2011 and 2014 elections.

On August 18, 2010, Chiarelli was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Public Infrastructure and Renewal.

On June 7, 2018, Chiarelli was defeated in the provincial election. He placed 3rd, behind the PC and NDP local candidates. The Progressive Conservatives, led by Doug Ford, won a sizeable majority government, ending 15 consecutive years of Liberal power.

==Municipal politics==
In November 1997, Chiarelli contested the position of Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton. He defeated incumbent Peter Clark. Chiarelli&#x27;s win was the only Ottawa municipal contest where an incumbent was upset. For the next three years, he advocated eliminating the region&#x27;s &quot;two-tiered&quot; government, and amalgamating the regional municipalities into a single city. The provincial government of Mike Harris did this in 2000, and Chiarelli declared himself a candidate to become the first mayor of the amalgamated city of Ottawa.

Chiarelli was elected as the first mayor of the newly amalgamated city of Ottawa on November 13, 2000 defeating former mayor of Gloucester, Ontario, Claudette Cain. He was easily re-elected in the 2003 election beating his closest rival by nearly 40,000 votes.

===2006 election===
In the 2006 election, he ran for re-election against two main opponents: former Kanata councillor Alex Munter, and businessman Larry O&#x27;Brien. Terry Kilrea, runner-up to Chiarelli in 2003, campaigned through the summer but withdrew when it seemed left-wing candidate Alex Munter had taken the lead. Kilrea decided to support Chiarelli for the remainder of the campaign.

Chiarelli&#x27;s main project was the expansion of the city&#x27;s light-rail system: a north-south line would run from Barrhaven to downtown Ottawa starting in 2009. His opponents in the election alleged that the project had been undertaken without sufficient consultation or communication with the public. The project was cancelled shortly after his departure of City Hall.

Chiarelli also had plans to improve the east end of the city. He introduced a 10-point revitalization plan that would include attracting more jobs and businesses east of the Rideau River in order to improve its economic development. He also planned to build new roads to improve connections between Orleans and the south end of the city. Also he promised to expand the existing bike trail system with additional trails connecting suburban and rural areas of Ottawa.

In a survey conducted by UniMarketing during the week of October 13, 2006, Chiarelli placed second with an 11-point percentage deficit on Munter but had a three-point advantage over O&#x27;Brien among the most likely to vote. In the election, he finished in third position with just over 15% of the vote and lost the mayoral position to O&#x27;Brien.

===Return to municipal politics===

On December 10, 2021, Chiarelli announced his intention to return to municipal politics, declaring himself a candidate for his former job as mayor in the 2022 municipal election. He finished third with 5.08% of the vote.

<text>Action fiction is a genre in literature that focuses on stories involving high-stakes, high-energy, and fast-paced events. This genre includes a wide range of subgenres, such as spy novels, adventure stories, tales of terror, intrigue (&quot;cloak and dagger&quot;), and mysteries. These kinds of stories utilize suspense, the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is going to be resolved or the solution to a mystery of a thriller.

The intricacies of human relationships or the nuances of philosophy and psychology are rarely explored in action fiction, typically being fast-paced mysteries that merely seek to provide the reader with an exhilarating experience.

Action fiction can also be a plot element of non-literary works such as graphic novels and film.

==Genre fiction==
Action genre is a form of fiction whose subject matter is characterized by emphasis on exciting action sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling.

The action genre is also related to non-literary media including comic books, graphic novels (such as manga), anime, action film, action television series, and action games. It includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, hand-to-hand combat, suspense action, and action comedy, with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action.

It is usually possible to identify the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action-adventure. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.

<doc id="232683" wikidata="Q4405761" url="?curid=232683" title="Frasier Crane">
<text>Dr. Frasier Winslow Crane (born ) is a fictional character who is both a supporting character on the American television sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; and the titular protagonist of its spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; and the latter’s 2023 sequel. In all three series, he is portrayed by Kelsey Grammer. The character debuted in the &quot;Cheers&quot; third-season premiere, &quot;Rebound (Part 1)&quot; (1984), as Diane Chambers&#x27;s love interest, part of the Sam and Diane story arc. Intended to appear for only a few episodes, Grammer&#x27;s performance in the role was praised by producers, prompting them to expand his role and increase his prominence. 

Later in &quot;Cheers&quot;, Frasier marries Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) and has a son, Frederick. After &quot;Cheers&quot; ended, the character moved to a spin-off series, &quot;Frasier&quot;, through which the span of his overall television appearances totals twenty years. In the spin-off, Frasier moves back to his birthplace, Seattle, after his divorce from Lilith, who retained custody of Frederick in Boston, and is reunited with a newly created family: his estranged father, Martin, and brother, Niles. In February 2021, ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) announced that Grammer would reprise the character in a new series on Paramount+.

Grammer received award recognitions for portraying this character on these two shows, in addition to a 1992 one-time appearance on &quot;Wings&quot;. For his portrayal on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Grammer was nominated twice for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series but did not win in that category. For portraying the character on &quot;Frasier&quot;, Kelsey Grammer won four Emmy Awards out of eleven nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and two Golden Globe Awards out of eight nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series (Musical or Comedy).

==Creation and casting==
The character Frasier Crane was created in the third season of &quot;Cheers&quot; (1984–1985) by series creators Glen and Les Charles as Diane Chambers&#x27;s (Shelley Long) &quot;romantic and intellectual ideal&quot; following her breakup with Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Not only Sam Malone&#x27;s rival and opposite, Frasier Crane was also part of the love triangle, &quot;a different form of the Sam-Diane relationship,&quot; said Glen Charles. The show&#x27;s writers initially conceived the character as &quot;the role Ralph Bellamy used to play in Cary Grant movies — the guy the lady falls in love with, but is not real. You just know he doesn&#x27;t have the sexual dynamism Grant does.&quot;

John Lithgow was originally chosen by &quot;Cheers&quot; producers for the role, but turned it down. Grammer believed that he had failed the audition because no one laughed, but was chosen because of the quality of his performance with Danson. Frasier was supposed to appear only on a few episodes before Diane left him, but Grammer&#x27;s performance was praised by series executives, leading to an extended role in the series. His character was not universally popular, however, for coming between Sam and Diane; a viewer approached Grammer asking &quot;Are you that pin dick that plays Frasier?&quot;, and the show received fan mail denouncing Grammer.

==Role in &quot;Cheers&quot;==
Frasier Crane, an alumnus of Harvard College, Harvard Medical School, and Oxford University, debuted in the two-part episode &quot;Rebound&quot; (1984), the premiere of &quot;Cheers&quot; season three (1984–85), as a psychiatrist to help bartender Sam Malone recover from a brief return to alcoholism and also cope with his breakup from Diane Chambers. Also, Diane&#x27;s fiancé throughout the third season, he and Diane are supposed to wed in Italy in &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (1985), the finale of season three. However, in &quot;Birth, Death, Love, and Rice&quot; (1985), the premiere of season four (1985–86), Frasier enters the bar and tells Sam that he was jilted by Diane at the altar in Europe. A despondent Frasier, who had given up his practice to go to Europe, loses his job lecturing at a university in Europe. Later in season four, he begins to regularly attend Cheers for drinks and finds himself depending more and more on alcohol. In &quot;The Triangle&quot; (1986), Sam feigns symptoms of depression, planned by Diane, to help Frasier recover from alcoholism and regain his self-confidence. This leads Frasier to conclude that Sam&#x27;s symptoms indicate his love for Diane. However, upon arrival, Frasier sees Sam and Diane arguing in the bar office, and Sam admits the whole plan. Furious, Frasier declares himself to be sober, refuses to be a part of their relationship, and vows to practice psychiatry again.

The character finally becomes a permanent fixture among the other bar patrons by the middle of the series&#x27; run and adds to his comedic repertoire an occasional penchant for commenting on the personality flaws of the other Cheers regulars while still managing to remain a likable addition to the gang. As his role is expanded, Frasier becomes romantically involved with a stereotypical &quot;intelligent, ice queen&quot; Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth). Their first date in &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1986) does not go well; they exchange insults with each other until she leaves the bar, disappointing him. In &quot;Abnormal Psychology&quot; (1986), Frasier and Lilith feel mutual attraction after Diane gives Lilith a makeover. At first reluctant to start anew, they then decide to go on another date. They live together for a year before being married one month before &quot;Our Hourly Bread&quot; (1988) as revealed in the episode and give birth to their son Frederick in &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot; (1989). In &quot;Smotherly Love&quot; (1992), they reenact their wedding to please Lilith&#x27;s mother Betty (Marilyn Cooper), who was irritated that she had not been present for their marriage.

In &quot;One Hugs, the Other Doesn&#x27;t&quot; (1992), Frasier is revealed to have been previously married to Nanette Guzman (Emma Thompson), now known as the popular children&#x27;s entertainer Nanny G. When Nanette sings a song implying her possible feelings for Frasier (despite being fully aware he&#x27;s remarried), Lilith attacks her during Frederick&#x27;s second birthday party.

In &quot;Teaching with the Enemy&quot; (1992), Lilith admits her affair with another man, Dr. Louis Pascal (Peter Vogt), dooming their marriage. In &quot;Is There a Doctor in the Howe?&quot; (1993), a distraught Frasier is going to sleep with Rebecca Howe in his bed until Lilith unexpectedly returns and—in the following episode, &quot;The Bar Manager, The Shrink, His Wife and Her Lover&quot; (1993)—storms out of the room and heads to Cheers. There, Lilith reveals that the eco-pod experiment with Pascal was a disaster—Pascal turned out to be claustrophobic, among other mental problems—and she abandoned the project to return to Boston. Frasier, Rebecca, and eventually Pascal converge on Cheers in pursuit of Lilith. Pascal, armed with a pistol, demands Lilith return to him, threatening to shoot Frasier and the others. Lilith demands that he shoot her first, which causes him to back down and surrender to the police. Although Frasier initially refuses to take Lilith back after all this, her pathetic sobbing wins him over, and he hesitantly reconciles with her.

==Role in &quot;Frasier&quot;==

===Spin-off development===
When &quot;Cheers&quot; ended in 1993, at first the creators did not plan to spin off the character from the predecessor because they were concerned that a spinoff might fail. Instead, they wanted to cast Kelsey Grammer as a paraplegic millionaire resembling Malcolm Forbes, &quot;a magazine mogul [and] a motorcycle enthusiast&quot;. The idea was deemed unsuitable and scrapped. Then the show&#x27;s creators decided to move Frasier Crane out of Boston to avoid any resemblance to &quot;Cheers&quot;. The spinoff idea would have focused primarily on &quot;his work at a radio station&quot;, but they found it resembled an older sitcom, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, too much. Therefore, they decided to add in his private life, such as his father Martin and younger brother Niles. In his titular spin-off, Frasier becomes &quot;haughty, disdainful, and exceedingly uptight.&quot;

===Moving to Seattle===
After &quot;Cheers&quot;, Frasier and Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) divorce off-screen, and Lilith is awarded custody of their son, Frederick, with Frasier granted visiting rights. In the pilot &quot;The Good Son&quot;, Frasier explains that he left Boston because he felt that his life and career had grown stagnant (and he had been publicly humiliated after climbing onto a ledge and threatening to commit suicide before being talked down). Therefore, he returned to his original hometown of Seattle, where his father Martin (John Mahoney) and younger brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) live, to have a fresh start.

Frasier works for the radio station KACL as the host of his psychotherapeutic radio show, &quot;The Dr. Frasier Crane Show&quot;, produced by his producer and friend, Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), who has many ex-boyfriends. Later, his father Martin, a retired Seattle Police Department detective who was shot in the line of duty, ends up moving in with him. Frasier is worried about his father in his current state as he can barely walk, and requires a cane to move. In &quot;Cheers&quot;, Frasier had said that his father was dead and had been a scientist. He also says that he is an only child. This inconsistency is later explained in &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;: At Frasier&#x27;s apartment, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) tells Martin and Niles what Frasier had said about them, and Frasier explains that he was trying to distance himself from his family at the time. He confirms in &quot;To All the Girls I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot; (1988) that his mother Hester, portrayed by Nancy Marchand in &quot;Diane Meets Mom&quot; (1984) and then by Rita Wilson in flashbacks in &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; (1999) and &quot;Don Juan in Hell: Part 2&quot; (2001), is dead off-screen.

Frasier hires a live-in physical therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), to care for Martin. Daphne is an eccentric, working class Englishwoman who professes to be &quot;a bit psychic&quot;. Moreover, Martin brings his beloved Jack Russell Terrier, Eddie, whom Frasier is uncomfortable around. After some initial hostility, Frasier grows very close to his new family.

===Life with Martin and Niles===
During the spin-off&#x27;s run, especially in scenes at Frasier&#x27;s apartment, Frasier and Martin regularly fight over the living arrangements and each other&#x27;s personalities: Frasier is intellectual, elitist, and mild-mannered, while Martin is a rugged man of simple tastes who speaks (according to Frasier) in words that no &quot;sophisticated, educated&quot; person could understand. While Frasier has many common interests with Niles and shares adventures (or misadventures) with him, he has little in common with his father, Martin.

In &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1993), Martin takes Frasier and Niles to a themed steakhouse, where health-conscious Frasier and Niles criticize the food, the restaurant&#x27;s customs, and the clientele. Martin becomes frustrated and angry before leaving, remarking upon departing that their mother, Hester, would be disappointed with their behavior. Frasier and Niles try to prove that they are not &quot;snobs&quot; by finishing their meal, although it takes them until after closing time. Ironically, in the &quot;Cheers&quot; season seven episode &quot;I Kid You Not&quot; (1988), Frasier invites Carla and her son Ludlow to a fine dining restaurant, but Carla and Ludlow criticize and mock it, enraging Frasier.

In &quot;Chess Pains&quot; (1996), Frasier teaches Martin how to play chess, but is horrified when Martin becomes a better player than him, due to Martin&#x27;s seasoned insight as a police detective. Frasier becomes obsessed with winning against his father until Frasier wins one match and Martin does not want to play with Frasier anymore. One late night, Frasier wakes Martin up and asks him whether he lost the chess match on purpose. Martin responds that Frasier &quot;won, fair and square&quot; and nothing more. In the &quot;Cheers&quot; season five episode &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1987), dimwitted Woody Boyd consistently beats Frasier in chess, frustrating Frasier.

In an episode of the seventh season &quot;A Tsar Is Born&quot; (1999), Martin takes an old family clock, which Frasier and Niles consider ugly, to exhibit on the television show &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. As the boys soon discover, the clock is related to their ancestors and royalty, and may be worth a fortune, and heightens their expectations of being descended from royalty. Unfortunately, when they try to sell the clock later, the brothers learn from an antique specialist that it was stolen from the daughter of Tsar Alexander II. Moreover, their great-great-grandmother was discovered to have been the clock thief and the daughter&#x27;s scullery maid and is discovered to have later been a prostitute in New York City. Therefore, the brothers are left without a fortune, a clock, and their royal dreams are destroyed, as Frasier puts it, they are descended from &quot;thieves and whores&quot;. Much to their anger, Martin buys a Winnebago RV with money Frasier claimed was the proceeds from selling the clock.

====Reunion with Lilith and Frederick====
Actress Bebe Neuwirth left &quot;Cheers&quot; for fear of becoming typecast and to do Broadway; she did not expect to appear recurrently on &quot;Frasier&quot;. &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found the chemistry between Frasier and Lilith &quot;special&quot; enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on Prozac. In &quot;The Show Where Lilith Comes Back&quot; (1994), Lilith surprises Frasier by dialing into the radio show. They later make love in a hotel room but end up regretting it, prompting them to part ways again. They decide to remain friends and help each other co-parent their son, Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also appears occasionally in this spin-off. In &quot;Adventures in Paradise, Part Two&quot; (1994), Lilith gets engaged to her fiancé Brian (James Morrison), much to Frasier&#x27;s chagrin. In &quot;A Lilith Thanksgiving&quot; (1996), Frasier and Lilith have Frederick admitted to a private school after they annoy the administrator (Paxton Whitehead) several times on Thanksgiving. In &quot;The Unnatural&quot; (1997), Frasier is proven unathletic and bad at softball, which he reluctantly admits to Frederick. Then Frasier tells him that, when Frasier was a third-grade elementary student, Martin was bad at math.

In &quot;Room Service&quot; (1998), Lilith is recently divorced from her husband Brian for his gay affair. Frasier attempts to renew the relationship but changes his mind when he finds out, to his horror, that Lilith and Niles had a drunken one-night stand. Lilith last appears in &quot;Guns &#x27;N Neuroses&quot; (2003), in which she and Frasier are accidentally set up to go on a blind date. Lilith and Frasier are close to restarting a relationship in the hotel room, but they are interrupted by a loud argument between a young married couple next door. Frasier and Lilith can resolve the couple&#x27;s dispute, spend the night together watching television, and finally fall asleep on the couch without having had sex. The next morning, they part ways with a tender final onscreen moment together.

===Reunions with &quot;Cheers&quot; characters===
Except for Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), all the surviving main cast members of &quot;Cheers&quot; appear in the show at various points. In &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot; (1995), Sam Malone reunites with Frasier in Seattle. Later, Frasier is discovered to have slept with Sam&#x27;s fiancée Sheila (Téa Leoni), but Sam has not discovered the affair, much to Frasier&#x27;s relief. Nevertheless, Sam finds out her dalliances with Paul Krapence (Paul Willson) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger). Though Sam isn&#x27;t initially angry when told of her infidelity with Paul when Sheila reveals she slept with Cliff (something that shocked and horrified both Sam and Frasier), it leads to him ending the romantic relationship. In &quot;The Show Where Diane Comes Back&quot; (1996), Frasier is reunited with Diane Chambers and learns that due to an accident with her and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (Jane Seymour), much of her personal life had been turned upside down and the financial backers for her upcoming play rescinded their support, prompting him to support it instead. The play turns out to be based on their relationship in Boston, including her leaving him at the altar. Frasier angrily confronts her about it, but they end up reconciling.

In &quot;The Show Where Woody Shows Up&quot; (1999), Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), still married to Kelly with his son and daughter, accidentally reunites with Frasier after landing in the wrong destination, Seattle. However, they realize that they are no longer friends, as their lives are too different. Nevertheless, they admit that they had good times together in Boston, and they will always think about each other. In &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot; (2002), Frasier arrives in Boston for a psychiatric conference. At the airport, Frasier unexpectedly bumps into Cliff Clavin and is invited to Cliff&#x27;s retirement party the following evening, where he is reunited with Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) and then briefly Norm Peterson (George Wendt). Later, Cliff confides in Frasier that he fears that his friends will not miss him. Frasier tells everyone to say a nice farewell to Cliff; even Carla, who hates him. Moved, Cliff decides to stay in Boston, much to Carla&#x27;s annoyance.

===Final years: 2003–04===
In &quot;Caught in the Act&quot; (2004), Frasier&#x27;s ex-wife Nanette Guzman (Laurie Metcalf), tries to rekindle their relationship, but Frasier refuses. (The character was previously portrayed by Emma Thompson in &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;One Hugs, the Other Doesn&#x27;t&quot; (1992) and by Dina Spybey in &quot;Don Juan in Hell, Part 2&quot; (2001) as part of Frasier&#x27;s imaginary dream.) Later, he falls in love with Charlotte Connor (Laura Linney), but the romance turns out to be short-lived when she moves to Chicago. In the 2004 two-part series finale, &quot;Goodnight, Seattle&quot;, Frasier is offered a job as the host of his television talk show, located in San Francisco, and has decided to accept the job. However, in the final scene of the show, it is revealed that Frasier has boarded a plane to Chicago, implying he will be with Charlotte.

=== The revival: 2023–present ===
In the revival series, Frasier again returns to Boston, coming from Martin&#x27;s funeral. Off-screen, Frasier has since been disillusioned with and then quit his eponymous television talk show in Chicago, and his relationship with Charlotte has ended as well. He tries to reconnect with his son Frederick (now Jack Cutmore-Scott), nicknamed Freddy, who has dropped out of Harvard and then become a firefighter. Frasier becomes recruited by Harvard&#x27;s psychology department as a psychology professor, especially to prove himself as a serious psychiatrist rather than a mere showman. He also buys Freddy&#x27;s apartment building, and has Freddy move in with him in his new apartment across the hall from Freddy&#x27;s old apartment.

== Other appearances ==
Kelsey Grammer has made several appearances as Dr. Frasier Crane outside of &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;.

* &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 60th Birthday&quot; (1988)
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; Season 34, Episode 15, &quot;Disneyland&#x27;s 35th Anniversary Celebration&quot; (1990)
* &quot;The Earth Day Special&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Wings&quot; Season 3, Episode 16, &quot;Planes, Trains and Visiting Cranes&quot; (1992)
* &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; Season 3, Episode 1, &quot;More Changes&quot; (1995)
* Dr Pepper TV Commercial (2008)

An animated version of the character appears in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, although Grammer, who voices Sideshow Bob on the show, does not voice the character of Frasier.

== Characterization and analysis ==
Frasier Crane is a licensed psychiatrist who is, as Kelsey Grammer described, &quot;flawed, silly, pompous, and full of himself, [yet] kind [and] vulnerable.&quot; Judy Berman from &quot;Flavor Wire&quot; describes him as also &quot;a child prodigy, theater geek, and frequent target for bullies.&quot; According to &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; writer Peter Casey, Frasier is &quot;very complicated, very intelligent, but also very insecure&quot;; he may have solutions to such problems as a psychiatrist but is clueless about himself.

== Reception ==
=== Reception on the character ===
At the time &quot;Cheers&quot; originally aired, Rick Sherwood from Los Angeles disdained Frasier Crane and his existence as part of the &quot;Sam and Diane&quot; dynamic. Sherwood found Frasier&#x27;s frequent appearances in the bar setting (&quot;his [former] girlfriend&#x27;s former lover&#x27;s bar&quot;) responsible for turning &quot;Cheers&quot; into &quot;as believable as [conservative] Archie Bunker [from &quot;All in the Family&quot;] voting for a liberal Democrat.&quot; According to a 1993 telephone survey before the &quot;Frasier&quot; premiere and the &quot;Cheers&quot; finale, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) scored 26 percent as a favorite character, and Frasier Crane scored 1 percent. In response to the question of spinning off a character, 15 percent voted Sam, 12 percent voted Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), 10 percent voted Norm Peterson (George Wendt), and 29 percent voted no spin-offs. Frasier Crane, whose own spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; debuted in September 1993, was voted by 2 percent to have his own show.

Later, while the character became more prominent in the series, inspiring a spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, in a 1999 book &quot;Writing and Responsibility&quot;, Beverly West and Jason Bergund noted that Frasier&#x27;s father Martin was supposed to be dead in &quot;Cheers&quot; but turns out still alive in &quot;Frasier&quot;, calling it inconsistent with &quot;a bout of amnesia[,] poor scriptwriting&quot;, or desperation to elicit more laughter. (In &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot; [1995], Frasier addresses the inconsistency by explaining that he told his friends Martin was dead after an argument with him.) In another book &quot;TV Therapy&quot;, Frasier Crane in &quot;Cheers&quot; is considered &quot;high-strung [and] pseudo-sophisticated&quot; and an attraction to 1980s demographics of &quot;anti-intellectual snobbery&quot;, but Frasier in &quot;Frasier&quot; is considered a good, positive role model for intellectuality and sophistication. In 2004, he was ranked by Bravo No. 26 of &quot;Bravo&#x27;s The 100 Greatest TV Characters&quot; of all-time. In 2009, the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; website ranked him No. 20 of &quot;Top 20 Sitcom Characters You&#x27;d Kill in Real Life&quot; and called him &quot;hilarious&quot; in the fictional world and &quot;unbearable&quot; in the real world.

Robert Bianco from &quot;USA Today&quot; considered Frasier Crane masculine in the days of &quot;Fred Astaire and William Powell&quot; instead of recent &quot;beer-belching&quot; days of the reality show, &quot;Survivor&quot;. Bianco found the series of Frasier&#x27;s love life repetitive and &quot;tiring&quot;. Gillian Flynn from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered Frasier Crane&#x27;s &quot;diction&quot; an inspiration of &quot;Fringe&quot;&#x27;s Walter Bishop (John Noble), who has an addition of &quot;daffiness&quot; of roles portrayed by actor Christopher Lloyd. Joe Sixpack, a pseudonymous name for writer Don Russell, called Frasier an &quot;insufferable twerp&quot;. An internet user from Ken Levine&#x27;s blog considered Frasier a successor to more prestigious, experienced Bostonian medical doctor and surgeon Charles Winchester (David Ogden Stiers) from the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. However, Levine did not consider the comparison when Frasier was introduced in &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1984. (Coincidentally, in the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Fathers and Son&quot; (2003), actor Stiers, portrayer of Winchester, appears as Hester Crane&#x27;s former lab assistant Leland Barton, who is suspected as Frasier and Niles&#x27; biological father.)
&quot;Television Without Pity&quot; called Frasier &quot;snooty and pretentious&quot;, even if he may be &quot;smart&quot; on television and a &quot;rare&quot; species of all characters. Steve Silverman from &quot;Screen Junkies&quot; praised Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s performances as Frasier Crane but found them &quot;predictable&quot;. Silverman thought that Grammer did not deserve an Emmy, especially in 1998. In a note, Silverman deemed the character Frasier as &quot;a windbag with a sense of humor&quot; and &quot;a whining schoolboy with a series of lame excuses.&quot;

===Reception on Frasier and Lilith===
Martha Nolan from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Frasier and Lilith &quot;repressed&quot; when married together in &quot;Cheers&quot;. Josh Bell from &quot;About.com&quot; called Frasier and his ex-wife Lilith Sternin one of the &quot;best sitcom divorced couples&quot; of all-time. Steven H. Scheuer from &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; considered Lilith&#x27;s significance to and marriage with Frasier &quot;fun&quot; to watch, especially when, in &quot;Severe Crane Damage&quot; (1990), she uses comparisons between &quot;the duller good boy&quot; Frasier and &quot;the interesting bad boy&quot; Sam Malone as &quot;psychiatric examples of the good boy-bad boy syndrome&quot;. Faye Zuckerman and John Martin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called their marriage in &quot;Cheers&quot; a hilariously &quot;perfect mismatch&quot;. Television critic Kevin McDonough from New York praised Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth&#x27;s performances as &quot;repressed individuals&quot; and &quot;separate couple on TV&quot; with &quot;acidic and hilarious&quot; chemistry together.

=== Accolades ===
For his performance as Frasier Crane in &quot;Cheers&quot;, Kelsey Grammer was Emmy Award-nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1988 and 1990. For the same role in &quot;Wings&quot; episode &quot;Planes, Trains, and Visiting Cranes&quot;, he was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 1992 Emmy Awards.

For the same role in &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, Grammer was consecutively nominated as an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series during the show&#x27;s whole run except in 2003. He won that Lead category in 1994, 1995, 1998, and 2004. He earned eight Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series (Musical or Comedy) throughout the series&#x27;s whole run and won that category in 1996 and 2001. Grammer won American Comedy Awards as the Funniest Male Performer in a TV Series (Leading Role) in 1995 and 1996. Grammer won the Screen Actors Guild Award as part of an ensemble cast of &quot;Frasier&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="232684" wikidata="Q917461" url="?curid=232684" title="Tree spiking">
<text>Tree spiking involves hammering a metal rod, nail or other material into a tree trunk, either inserting it at the base of the trunk where a logger might be expected to cut into the tree, or higher up where it would affect the sawmill later processing the wood. Contact with the spike often damages saw blades, which can result in injuries, or death, to nearby workers. The spike can also lower the commercial value of the wood by causing discoloration, reducing the economic viability of logging in the long term, without threatening the life of the tree. It is illegal in the United States, and has been described as a form of eco-terrorism by logging activists.

== History ==

It was first mentioned in the context of discouraging logging in Earth First! magazine. It came to prominence as a contentious tactic within unconventional environmentalist circles during the 1980s, after it was advocated by Earth First! co-founder Dave Foreman in his book &quot;Ecodefense&quot;. In the book, he discusses how to do it and how to avoid risks to the activist and the logger, such as by putting warning signs or marks in the area where the trees are being spiked.

On 8 May 1987, George Alexander, a millworker, was severely injured when a saw blade shattered after contact with a tree spike and cut his jaw in half. Louisiana-Pacific, Alexander&#x27;s employer, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the alleged tree spiker, but no charges were filed in this incident. The spiking itself was thought to be inconsistent with Earth First! tactics, as the trees were not in an old-growth forest and the placement of the nail suggested it was inserted after the tree was cut. Alexander later filed a lawsuit against Louisiana-Pacific claiming that the band saw had been weakened from previous strikes with nails, but that he was forced to work with the saw or face dismissal.

This industrial accident led the leaders of Earth First! to denounce tree spiking. Tree spiking is labeled as eco-terrorism by logging advocates who claim it is potentially dangerous to loggers or mill-workers, although by 1996 only this single injury resulting from tree spiking had been reported.

== By country ==

=== New Zealand ===
Beech trees that were being logged in 1998 in the Tuatapere area were spiked. Police were unable to trace those who were responsible.

Pat O&#x27;Dea, while he was the mayor for the Buller District, suggested in 2000 that Native Forest Action (NFA) had spiked trees during a direct action campaign against native forest logging on the West Coast. This was denied by NFA spokesperson Dean Bagient-Mercer. In 1998, Kevin Smith from Forest and Bird had said that tree spiking was proposed by some individuals involved in the NFA campaign.

=== United States ===

Following the 1987 injury of California mill worker George Alexander, anti-tree spiking legislation was introduced as the Anti-Tree Spiking Act, and was passed into federal law as an amendment, introduced by senators James A. McClure and Mark Hatfield, to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. In 1993, John Blount and others were convicted under this statute for spiking trees in the Clearwater National Forest, after Tracy Stone-Manning agreed to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

In 1990, Earth First! leaders, including Judi Bari and Mike Roselle, issued a memo and press release to Earth First! activists in Northern California and Southern Oregon, renouncing tree-spiking as a tactic on the eve of Redwood Summer, a 1990 campaign of nonviolent protests against logging of the redwood forest.

In 2021, President Biden nominated Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the Bureau of Land Management despite her involvement in a 1989 tree-spiking plot.

<text>Federal law is the body of law created by the federal government of a country. A federal government is formed when a group of political units, such as states or provinces join in a federation, delegating their individual sovereignty and many powers to the central government while retaining or reserving other limited powers. As a result, two or more levels of government exist within an established geographic territory. The body of law of the common central government is the federal law.

Examples of federal governments include those of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Russia, the former Soviet Union and the United States.

The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law take precedence over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. After the American Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Constitution&#x27;s Bill of Rights to state governments. Legislation passed by Congress, an executive order of the President, or a decision of federal courts pursuant to the Constitution is federal law.

Through the system of checks and balances, it is the Supreme Court that makes final decisions regarding federal laws regarding specific cases brought before them. &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot; was a seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 that prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regard to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. Federal laws are codified in the United States Code.

=== Gravitational Force Theory ===
Professor Scott Dodson proposes a theory that argues that American federal law has some measurable effect on state law and compares this effect to a gravitational force that while not &quot;inexorable&quot;, influences state actors to create legislature in accordance with or at least closely aligned with federal legislature. Dodson justifies the existence of this &quot;pull&quot; by arguing that state legislators and courts rarely exercise their constitutional power to deviate from Federal Law despite having the capability. He cited, among other supreme case decisions and legislative acts, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as being responsible for ushering, &quot;in a new era of federal procedural uniformity&quot; in 1938.

==== Proposed Case Evidence ====
Dodson points to the 1957 Conley v. Gibson Supreme Court decision as additional contextualization for his argument. This case was brought as a class-action lawsuit by a group of African American rail workers to a Federal District Court in Texas and stating that &quot;their collective bargaining agent be compelled to represent them fairly&quot; in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The suit was initially dismissed on the basis that the complaint did not follow the previously set federal precedence of requiring a complaint &quot;to state a claim upon which relief could be given&quot;. The Supreme Court later held that this decision was a mistake based on their subjective interpretation of the Federal Rules of Procedure. The Court prioritized Rule 8 while glossing over Rule 12 to establish a fairly liberating set of standards for pleading procedures that were then adopted by many state legislatures.

<doc id="232689" wikidata="Q107569" url="?curid=232689" title="Club of Rome">
<text>The Club of Rome is a nonprofit, informal organization of intellectuals and business leaders whose goal is a critical discussion of pressing global issues. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 at Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, Italy. It consists of one hundred full members selected from current and former heads of state and government, UN administrators, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe. It stimulated considerable public attention in 1972 with the first report to the Club of Rome, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;. Since 1 July 2008, the organization has been based in Winterthur, Switzerland.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1965, the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei gave a speech about the dramatic scientific and technological changes happening in the world. The speech was noticed by Alexander King, a British scientist who had advised the British government, and who was currently serving as Director-General for Scientific Affairs at the OECD. King arranged a meeting with Peccei. The pair shared a lack of confidence that the problems faced by the world could be solved by development and technological progress.

In April 1968, Peccei and King convened a small international group of people from the fields of academia, civil society, diplomacy, and industry met at Villa Farnesina in Rome. The background paper to set the tone of the meeting was entitled &quot;A tentative framework for initiating system wide planning of world scope&quot;, by Austrian OECD consultant Erich Jantsch. However, the meeting was described as a &quot;monumental flop&quot;, with discussions becoming bogged down in technical and semantic debates.

After the meeting, Peccei, King, Jantsch, and Hugo Thiemann decided to form the Club of Rome, named for the city of their meeting.

=== First steps ===
Central to the formation of the club was Peccei&#x27;s concept of the &quot;problematic&quot;. It was his opinion that viewing the problems of humankind—environmental deterioration, poverty, endemic ill-health, urban blight, criminality—individually, in isolation or as &quot;problems capable of being solved in their own terms&quot;, was doomed to failure. All are interrelated. &quot;It is this generalized meta-problem (or meta-system of problems) which we have called and shall continue to call the &#x27;problematic&#x27; that inheres in our situation.&quot;

In October 1968, the OECD held a symposium in Bellagio, Italy, in collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation, at which several new members joined the Club. The symposium focused on the dangers of exponential growth—which by its nature cannot continue forever—and ended with participants signing &quot;The Bellagio Declaration on Planning&quot;, which emphasized the need to overcome global problems through coordination.

For a brief period, the Club&#x27;s ideas held sway within the OECD, thanks to King&#x27;s efforts in promoting the group&#x27;s work. When Secretary General Thorkil Kristensen formed a group of ten science and economic experts in 1969 to study problems for modern societies, four of the ten were members of the Club of Rome.

In 1970, Peccei&#x27;s vision was laid out in a document written by Hasan Özbekhan, Erich Jantsch, and Alexander Christakis. Entitled, &quot;The Predicament of Mankind; Quest for Structured Responses to Growing Worldwide Complexities and Uncertainties: A PROPOSAL&quot;. The document would serve as the roadmap for the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; project.

=== &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; ===
The Club of Rome stimulated considerable public attention with the first report to the club, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;. Published in 1972, its computer simulations suggested that growth of production and consumption could not continue indefinitely because of either resource depletion or unmanageable levels of pollution. The 1973 oil crisis increased public concern about this problem. The report went on to sell 30 million copies in more than 30 languages, making it the best-selling environmental book in history.

Although the Club of Rome had enjoyed some influence at the OECD, their questioning of the value of growth &quot;deepened the internal fractures within the OECD and provoked hostile reactions, leading to a revitalization of the strong pro-growth position.&quot; A 1973 booklet on the OECD&#x27;s approach to environmental issues stated that the role of governments in &quot;an acceptable human environment must now be developed in the framework of policies for economic growth&quot;. The OECD had given up on the Club of Rome, and set its course on a trajectory of unfettered growth.

=== 1974–present ===
Even before &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; was published, Eduard Pestel and Mihajlo Mesarovic of Case Western Reserve University had begun work on a far more elaborate model (it distinguished ten world regions and involved 200,000 equations compared with 1,000 in the Meadows model). The research had the full support of the club and its final publication, &quot;Mankind at the Turning Point&quot;, was accepted as the official &quot;second report&quot; to the Club of Rome in 1974. In addition to providing a more refined regional breakdown, Pestel and Mesarovic had succeeded in integrating social as well as technical data. The second report revised the scenarios of the original &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; and gave a more optimistic prognosis for the future of the environment, noting that many of the factors involved were within human control and therefore that environmental and economic catastrophe were preventable or avoidable.

In 1991, the club published &quot;The First Global Revolution&quot;. It analyses the problems of humanity, calling these collectively or in essence the &quot;problematique&quot;. It notes that, historically, social or political unity has commonly been motivated by enemies in common:

In 2001, the Club of Rome established a think tank, called &quot;tt30&quot;, consisting of about 30 men and women, ages 25–35. It aimed to identify problems in the world and suggest approaches to addressing them, from the perspective of youth.

In 2008, the club moved its headquarters from Hamburg to Winterthur in Switzerland.

In 2018, the Club of Rome appointed its first female co-presidents. The same year, co-presidents Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Anders Wijkman collaborated with over 30 members to publish &quot;Come On! Capitalism, Short-termism, Population and the Destruction of the Planet&quot;. This publication advocated for profound changes in the interactions between governments, businesses, financial systems, innovators, and families to foster sustainable planetary stewardship. 

Four years later, in 2022, the Club of Rome introduced &quot;Earth for All: A Survival Guide for Humanity&quot;, released fifty years after the pioneering &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;. This new publication, unveiled at events including the closing of the New York Stock Exchange, stems from the Earth4All initiative—a collaborative effort among institutions such as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Stockholm Resilience Centre.

According to its website, the Club of Rome is composed of &quot;scientists, economists, businessmen, international high civil servants, heads of state and former heads of state from all five continents who are convinced that the future of humankind is not determined once and for all and that each human being can contribute to the improvement of our societies&quot;.

The Club of Rome is a membership organization and has different membership categories. Full members engage in the research activities, projects, and contribute to decision-making processes during the club&#x27;s annual general assembly. Of the full members, 12 are elected to form the executive committee, which sets the general direction and the agenda. Of the executive committee, two are elected as co-presidents. The secretary-general is appointed by the executive committee and is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the club. Aside from full members there are associate members, who participate in research and projects, but have no vote in the general assembly. The club has a satellite office in Brussels.

The club also has honorary members. Notable honorary members include Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Orio Giarini, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mikhail Gorbachev, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Horst Köhler, and Manmohan Singh.

The annual general assembly of 2016 took place in Berlin on 10–11 November. Among the guest speakers were former German President Christian Wulff, German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller, as well as Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus.

==National associations==
The club has national associations in 35 countries and territories. The mission of the national associations is to spread the ideas and vision in their respective countries, to offer solutions and to lobby for a more sustainable and just economy in their nations, and to support the international secretariat of the club with the organization of events, such as the annual general assembly.

==Current activities==
As of 2023, there have been 54 reports to the club. These are internally reviewed studies commissioned by the executive committee, or suggested by a member or group of members, or by outside individuals and institutions. The most recent reports, both published in 2022, are &quot;Earth for All – A Survival Guide for Humanity&quot; and &quot;Limits and Beyond: 50 Years on from The Limits to Growth, What Did We Learn and What’s Next?&quot;.

On 14 March 2019, the Club of Rome issued an official statement in support of Greta Thunberg and the school strikes for climate, urging governments across the world to respond to this call for action and cut global carbon emissions.
In 2020, the &quot;Earth4All&quot; initiative was launched at the UNFCCC &quot;Race-to-Zero Dialogues&quot; session on Transformational Leadership to explore potential transformational political and economic solutions for the 21st century. Led by the Club of Rome, the BI Norwegian Business School and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a group of researchers and policymakers assessed global risks and identified five pathways to catalyze transformation and systemic change towards sustainability: energy, food, poverty, inequality and population (including health and education). The results are published in the book &quot;Earth for All&quot; in 2022 alongside the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Summit in Stockholm and the initial publication of the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; in 1972.

===Impact Hubs===
The Club of Rome has five Impact Hubs, each designed to foster collaborative solutions to global challenges. The Emerging New Civilisations hub focuses on a paradigm shift for a sustainable future, while the Planetary Emergency hub advocates for integrated responses to climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality. The Reframing Economics hub challenges growth-centric economic models in favor of sustainability and equity. The Rethinking Finance hub seeks financial system reforms to support sustainable economic transitions. Lastly, the Youth Leadership and Intergenerational Dialogues hub empowers young leaders and promotes intergenerational cooperation for systemic change, highlighting its flagship initiative, The 50 Percent, which aims to mobilize youth action across the globe. Together, these hubs represent a comprehensive approach by the Club of Rome to address the interconnected challenges facing humanity and the planet.

==Critics==

From the 1970s, the Club of Rome attracted substantial criticism. Economist Robert Solow, recipient of a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, criticized &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; (LTG) as having &quot;simplistic&quot; scenarios. He has also been a vocal critic of the Club of Rome. In 2002 he said that &quot;the one thing that really annoys me is amateurs making absurd statements about economics, and I thought that the Club of Rome was nonsense. Not because natural resources or environmental necessities might not at some time pose a limit, not on growth, but on the level of economic activity—I didn&#x27;t think that was a nonsensical idea—but because the Club of Rome was doing amateur dynamics without a license, without a proper qualification. And they were doing it badly, so I got steamed up about that.&quot; However, in 2009, Solow suggested that &quot;Thirty years later, the situation may have changed. It is possible that real demands on natural resources, and therefore on the natural environment, will be dramatically different in a world in which India and China, and other countries, too, grow at 8 or 10 percent a year, and need to pass through the material-goods-intensive phase of growth before they arrive at the service economy... it will probably be more important in the future to deal intellectually, quantitatively, as well as practically, with the mutual interdependence of economic growth, natural resource availability, and environmental constraints.&quot;

An analysis of the world model used for &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; in 1976 by mathematicians Vermeulen and De Jongh has shown it to be &quot;very sensitive to small parameter variations&quot; and having &quot;dubious assumptions and approximations&quot;.

In 1973, an interdisciplinary team at Sussex University&#x27;s Science Policy Research Unit reviewed the structure and assumptions of the models used and published their analysis in &quot;Models of Doom&quot;, finding that the forecasts of the world&#x27;s future are very sensitive to a few unduly pessimistic key assumptions. The Sussex scientists also wrote that the Dennis Meadows &quot;et al.&quot; methods, data, and predictions were faulty, that their world models (and their Malthusian bias) did not accurately reflect reality.

Economist Thomas Sowell, in his 1995 book &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot;, describes economist John Kenneth Galbraith, biologist Paul R. Ehrlich, the Club of Rome and Worldwatch Institute as &quot;the anointed&quot;, declaring that &quot;they were utterly certain in their predictions, yet completely disproven empirically, though their reputations remained perfectly undamaged&quot;. According to the National Review, he describes them &quot;promoters of a worldview concocted out of fantasy, impervious to any real-world considerations&quot;.

==Support==
In contrast, John Scales Avery, a member of Nobel Peace Prize (1995) winning group associated with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, supported the basic thesis of &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; by stating, &quot;Although the specific predictions of resource availability in &quot;[The] Limits to Growth&quot; lacked accuracy, its basic thesis that unlimited economic growth on a finite planet is impossible was indisputably correct.&quot;

In 1980, United States president Jimmy Carter commissioned the Global 2000 Report to the President, which undertook a long-term global economic modelling exercise similar to the Club of Rome&#x27;s research. The report arrived at similar conclusions regarding expected global resource scarcity, and the need for multilateral coordination to prepare for this situation.

Over the years, various studies have supported aspects of Club of Rome research. In 2008, a study by Graham Turner of the Australian research organisation CSIRO found that &quot;30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the &quot;standard run&quot; scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st century.&quot; In 2020, econometrician Gaya Herrington published a study in the Yale University&#x27;s Journal of Industrial Ecology which concluded that all economic data since the 1970s was consistent with the World3 BAU scenario in &quot;Limits to Growth,&quot; which could mean that rapid degrowth would occur after 2040&quot;.&quot;

<text>Robert Anderson (7 January 1750 – 20 February 1830) was a Scottish author and critic.

Son of David Anderson, W.S., he was born at Carnwath, Lanarkshire. He studied first divinity and then medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and subsequently, after some experience as a surgeon, took his M.D. at the University of St Andrews in 1778. He began to practise as a physician at Alnwick in Northumberland, but he became financially independent by his marriage with the daughter of John Gray, and abandoned his profession for a literary life in Edinburgh.

For several years his attention was occupied with his edition of &quot;The Works of the British Poets, with Prefaces Biographical and Critical&quot; (14 vols. 8vo, Edin., 1792–1807). His other publications were:

*&quot;The Miscellaneous Works of Tobias Smollett, M.D., with Memoirs of his Life and Writings&quot; (Edin., 1796)
*&quot;Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D., with Critical Observations on his Works&quot; (Edin., 1815)
*&quot;The Works of John Moore, M.D., with Memoirs of his Life and Writings&quot; (Edin., 7 vols., 1820)
*&quot;The Grave and other Poems, by Robert Blair; to which are prefixed some Account of his Life and Observations on his Writings&quot; (Edin., 1826).

Anderson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.

==Freemasonry==
He was a Scottish Freemason having been Initiated in The Lodge of Holyrood House (St Luke&#x27;s), No.44, in 1781.

<doc id="232692" wikidata="Q940462" url="?curid=232692" title="Music hall">
<text>Music hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was most popular from the early Victorian era, beginning around 1850, through the Great War. It faded away after 1918 as the halls rebranded their entertainment as variety. Perceptions of a distinction in Britain between bold and scandalous music hall entertainment and subsequent, more respectable variety entertainment differ. Music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts, and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. In North America vaudeville was in some ways analogous to British music hall, featuring rousing songs and comic acts.

Originating in saloon bars within pubs during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences. So much so, that during the 1850s some public houses were demolished, and specialised music hall theatres developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so that people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place, with the cheapest seats located in the gallery. This differed from the conventional type of theatre, which seats the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room. Major music halls were based around London. Early examples included: the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall in Tower Hamlets, and The Middlesex in Drury Lane, otherwise known as the Old Mo. By the mid-19th century, the halls cried out for many new and catchy songs. As a result professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers, such as Marie Lloyd, Dan Leno, Little Tich, and George Leybourne. All manner of other entertainment was performed: male and female impersonators, lions comiques, mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists (such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith) were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.

The Music Hall Strike of 1907 was an important industrial conflict. It was a dispute between artists and stage hands on one hand, and theatre managers on the other. The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but became less popular due to upcoming jazz, swing, and big-band dance music acts. Licensing restrictions had also changed, and drinking was banned from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. They were deemed old-fashioned, and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and modern-day variety began.

==Origins and development==
Music-halls had their origins in 18th century London. They grew with the entertainment provided in the new style saloon bars of pubs during the 1830s. These venues replaced earlier semi-rural amusements provided by fairs and suburban pleasure gardens such as Vauxhall Gardens and the Cremorne Gardens. These latter became subject to urban development and became fewer and less popular. From the mid-19th century music halls spread to the provincial cities, such as Bristol.

The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a greater price at the bar, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed. The most famous London saloon of the early days was the Grecian Saloon, established in 1825, at The Eagle (a former tea-garden), 2 Shepherdess Walk, off the City Road in east London. According to John Hollingshead, proprietor of the Gaiety Theatre, London (originally the Strand Music Hall), this establishment was &quot;the father and mother, the dry and wet nurse of the Music Hall&quot;. Later known as the Grecian Theatre, it was here that Marie Lloyd made her début at the age of 14 in 1884. It is still famous because of an English nursery rhyme, with the somewhat mysterious lyrics:
Up and down the City RoadIn and out The EagleThat&#x27;s the way the money goesPop goes the weasel.

Another famous &quot;song and supper&quot; room of this period was Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms, 43 King Street, Covent Garden, established in the 1840s by W.H. Evans. This venue was also known as &#x27;Evans Late Joys&#x27; – Joy being the name of the previous owner. Other song and supper rooms included the Coal Hole in The Strand, the Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden and the Mogul Saloon in Drury Lane.

The music hall as we know it developed from such establishments during the 1850s and were built in and on the grounds of public houses. Such establishments were distinguished from theatres by the fact that in a music hall you would be seated at a table in the auditorium and could drink alcohol and smoke tobacco whilst watching the show. In a theatre, by contrast, the audience was seated in stalls and there was a separate bar-room. An exception to this rule was the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton (1841) which somehow managed to evade this regulation and served drinks to its customers. Though a theatre rather than a music hall, this establishment later hosted music-hall variety acts.

===Early music halls===

The establishment often regarded as the first true music hall was the Canterbury, 143 Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth built by Charles Morton, afterwards dubbed &quot;the Father of the Halls&quot;, on the site of a skittle alley next to his pub, the Canterbury Tavern. It opened on 17 May 1852 and was described by the musician and author Benny Green as being &quot;the most significant date in all the history of music hall&quot;. The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms, but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size. It was further extended in 1859, later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by German bombing in 1942. The Canterbury Hall became a model for music halls in other cities too, such as the Bristol Canterbury, which was built in 1850s as the first purpose-built music hall in the city.

Another early music hall was The Middlesex, Drury Lane (1851). Popularly known as the &#x27;Old Mo&#x27;, it was built on the site of the Mogul Saloon. Later converted into a theatre it was demolished in 1965. The New London Theatre stands on its site.

Several large music halls were built in the East End. These included the London Music Hall, otherwise known as The Shoreditch Empire, 95–99 Shoreditch High Street, (1856–1935). This theatre was rebuilt during 1894 by Frank Matcham, the architect of the Hackney Empire. Another in this area was the Royal Cambridge Music Hall, 136 Commercial Street (1864–1936). Designed by William Finch Hill (the designer of the Britannia theatre in nearby Hoxton), it was rebuilt after a fire in 1898.

The construction of Weston&#x27;s Music Hall, High Holborn (1857), built up on the site of the Six Cans and Punch Bowl Tavern by the licensed victualler of the premises, Henry Weston, signalled that the West End was fruitful territory for the music hall. During 1906 it was rebuilt as a variety theatre and renamed as the Holborn Empire. It was closed as a result of German action in the Blitz on the night of 11–12 May 1941 and the building was pulled down in 1960. Significant West End music halls include:
* The Oxford Music Hall, 14/16 Oxford Street (1861) – built on the site of an old coaching inn called the Boar and Castle by Charles Morton, the pioneer music hall developer of The Canterbury, who with this development brought music hall to the West End. Demolished in 1926.
* The London Pavilion (1861). Facade of 1885 rebuild still extant.
* The Alhambra Theatre of Variety (1860) in London, which became a model for Parisian music halls. Some years before the Folies-Bergere it staged circus attractions alongside popular ballets in 55 new productions between 1864 and 1870.

Other large suburban music halls included:

* The Bedford, 93–95 High Street, Camden Town, constructed on the site of the tea gardens of a pub called the Bedford Arms. The first building, the Bedford Music Hall (“The Old Bedford”), opened in 1861 and closed in 1898. It was demolished and rebuilt as the larger Bedford Palace of Varieties also known as the Bedford Theatre (“The New Bedford”), which opened in 1899 and operated until 1959. The Bedford was a favourite haunt of the artist Walter Sickert, who featured interior scenes of music halls in many of his paintings, including one entitled &quot;Little Dot Hetherington at the Old Bedford&quot;. The Bedford was derelict from 1959 and finally demolished in 1969.
* Collins&#x27;s or Collins&#x27;, Islington Green (1863). Opened by Sam Collins on 4 November 1863 after he had converted the pre-existing Lansdowne Arms and Music Hall public house. It was colloquially known as &#x27;The Chapel on the Green&#x27;. Collins was a star of his own theatre, singing mostly Irish songs specially composed for him. It closed in 1956, after a fire, but the street front of the building still survives (see below).
* Deacons in Clerkenwell (1862).

A noted music hall entrepreneur of this time was Carlo Gatti who built a music hall, known as Gatti&#x27;s, at Hungerford Market in 1857. He sold the music hall to South Eastern Railway in 1862, and the site became Charing Cross railway station. With the proceeds from selling his first music hall, Gatti acquired a restaurant in Westminster Bridge Road, opposite The Canterbury music hall. He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti&#x27;s music hall, known as &quot;Gatti&#x27;s-in-the-Road&quot;, in 1865. It later became a cinema. The building was badly damaged in the Second World War, and was demolished in 1950. In 1867, he acquired a public house in Villiers Street named &quot;The Arches&quot;, under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station. He opened it as another music hall, known as &quot;Gatti&#x27;s-in-The-Arches&quot;. After his death his family continued to operate the music hall, known for a period as the Hungerford or Gatti&#x27;s Hungerford Palace of Varieties. It became a cinema in 1910, and the Players&#x27; Theatre in 1946.

By 1865, there were 32 music halls in London seating between 500 and 5,000 people plus an unknown, but large, number of smaller venues. Numbers peaked in 1878, with 78 large music halls in the metropolis and 300 smaller venues. Thereafter numbers declined due to stricter licensing restrictions imposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and London County Council, and because of commercial competition between popular large suburban halls and the smaller venues, which put the latter out of business.

A few of the UK&#x27;s music halls have survived and have retained many of their original features. Among the best examples are:

*Victoria Hall, Settle is a Grade II listed concert hall in Kirkgate, Settle, North Yorkshire, England. It is the UK&#x27;s oldest surviving music hall having opened as Settle Music Hall on 11 October 1853. The Music Hall was renamed &#x27;The Victoria Hall&#x27; around November 1892. 
*Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall is a Grade II listed building in Shadwell, built by John Wilton in 1859 as a music hall and now run as a multi-arts performance space in Graces Alley, off Cable Street in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. 
*The Britannia Music Hall (later known as The Panopticon or The Britannia Panopticon) in Trongate, Glasgow, Scotland was built in 1857/58 and is located above an amusement arcade at 113-117 Trongate.

===Variety theatre===
A new era of variety theatre was developed by the rebuilding of the London Pavilion in 1885. Contemporary accounts noted:

One of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the Empire Leicester Square, built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall licence in 1887. Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers, and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans. Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the Strand built 1888–90 in an eclectic neo-Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish-Indian embellishments. &quot;The Tivoli&quot; became a brand name for music-halls all over the British Empire. During 1892, the Royal English Opera House, which had been a financial failure in Shaftesbury Avenue, applied for a music hall licence and was converted by Walter Emden into a grand music hall and renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties, managed by Charles Morton. Denied by the newly created LCC permission to construct the promenade, which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra, the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in tableaux vivants, though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh-toned body stockings and were not naked at all.

One of the grandest of these new halls was the Coliseum Theatre built by Oswald Stoll in 1904 at the bottom of St Martin&#x27;s Lane. This was followed by the London Palladium (1910) in Argyll Street. Both were designed by the prolific Frank Matcham. As music hall grew in popularity and respectability, and as the licensing authorities exercised ever firmer regulation, the original arrangement of a large hall with tables at which drink was served, changed to that of a drink-free auditorium. The acceptance of music hall as a legitimate cultural form was established by the first &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; before King George V during 1912 at the Palace Theatre. However, consistent with this new respectability the best-known music hall entertainer of the time, Marie Lloyd, was not invited, being deemed too &quot;saucy&quot; for presentation to the monarchy.

===&#x27;Music Hall War&#x27; of 1907===

The development of syndicates controlling a number of theatres, such as the Stoll circuit, increased tensions between employees and employers. On 22 January 1907, a dispute between artists, stage hands and managers of the Holborn Empire worsened. Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed, organised by the Variety Artistes&#x27; Federation. The strike lasted for almost two weeks and was known as the &quot;Music Hall War&quot;. It became extremely well known, and was advocated enthusiastically by the main spokesmen of the trade union and Labour movement – Ben Tillett and Keir Hardie for example. Picket lines were organized outside the theatres by the artistes, while in the provinces theatre management attempted to oblige artistes to sign a document promising never to join a trade union.

The strike ended in arbitration, which satisfied most of the main demands, including a minimum wage and maximum working week for musicians.

Several music hall entertainers such as Marie Dainton, Marie Lloyd, Arthur Roberts, Joe Elvin and Gus Elen were strong advocates of the strike, though they themselves earned enough not to be concerned personally in a material sense. Lloyd explained her advocacy:

===Recruiting===
World War I may have been the high-water mark of music hall popularity. The artists and composers threw themselves into rallying public support and enthusiasm for the war effort. Patriotic music hall compositions such as &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot; (1914), &quot;Pack up Your Troubles&quot; (1915), &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; (1914) and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Want to Lose You (But We Think You Ought To Go)&quot; (1914), were sung by music hall audiences, and sometimes by soldiers in the trenches.

Many songs promoted recruitment (&quot;All the boys in khaki get the nice girls&quot;, 1915); others satirised particular elements of the war experience. &quot;What did you do in the Great war, Daddy&quot; (1919) criticised profiteers and slackers; Vesta Tilley&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve got a bit of a blighty one&quot; (1916) showed a soldier delighted to have a wound just serious enough to be sent home. The rhymes give a sense of grim humour (&quot;When they wipe my face with sponges / and they feed me on blancmanges / I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve got a bit of a blighty one&quot;).

Tilley became more popular than ever during this time, when she and her husband, Walter de Frece, managed a military recruitment drive. In the guise of characters like &#x27;Tommy in the Trench&#x27; and &#x27;Jack Tar Home from Sea&#x27;, Tilley performed songs such as &quot;The army of today&#x27;s all right&quot; and &quot;Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier&quot;. This is how she got the nickname &quot;Britain&#x27;s best recruiting sergeant&quot; – young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show. She also performed in hospitals and sold war bonds. Her husband was knighted in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, and Tilley became Lady de Frece.

Once the reality of war began to sink home, the recruiting songs all but disappeared – the Greatest Hits collection for 1915 published by top music publisher Francis and Day contains no recruitment songs. After conscription was brought in 1916, songs dealing with the war spoke mostly of the desire to return home. Many also expressed anxiety about the new roles women were taking in society.

Possibly the most notorious of music hall songs from the First World War was &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a lovely war&quot; (1917), popularised by male impersonator Ella Shields.

===Decline===
Music hall continued during the interwar period, no longer the single dominant form of popular entertainment in Britain. The improvement of cinema, the development of radio, and the cheapening of the gramophone damaged its popularity greatly. It now had to compete with jazz, swing and big band dance music.

In 1914, the London County Council (LCC) enacted that drinking be banished from the auditorium into a separate bar and, during 1923, the separate bar was abolished by parliamentary decree. The exemption of the theatres from this latter act prompted some critics to denounce this legislation as an attempt to deprive the working classes of their pleasures, as a form of social control, whilst sparing the supposedly more responsible upper classes who patronised the theatres (though this could be due to the licensing restrictions brought about due to the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which also applied to public houses). Even so, the music hall gave rise to such major stars as George Formby, Gracie Fields, Max Miller, Will Hay, and Flanagan and Allen during this period.

In the mid-1950s, rock and roll, whose performers initially topped music hall bills, attracted a young audience who had little interest in the music hall acts, while driving the older audience away. The final demise was competition from television, which grew popular after the Queen&#x27;s coronation was televised. Some music halls tried to retain an audience by putting on striptease acts. In 1957, the playwright John Osborne delivered this elegy:
Moss Empires, the largest British music hall chain, closed the majority of its theatres in 1960, closely followed by the death of music hall stalwart Max Miller in 1963, prompting one contemporary to write that: &quot;Music-halls ... died this afternoon when they buried Max Miller&quot;. Miller himself had sometimes said that the genre would die with him. Many music hall performers, unable to find work, fell into poverty; some did not even have a home, having spent their working lives living in digs between performances.

Stage and film musicals, however, continued to be influenced by the music hall idiom, including &quot;Oliver!&quot;, &quot;Dr Dolittle&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The BBC series &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, which ran for thirty years, recreated the music hall for the modern audience, and the &quot;Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot; allowed several speciality acts a television presence from 1979 to 1994. Aimed at a younger audience, but still owing a lot to the music hall heritage, was the late-1970s’ television series, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

==Music halls of Paris==
The music hall was first imported into France in its British form in 1862, but under the French law protecting the state theatres, performers could not wear costumes or recite dialogue, something only allowed in theaters. When the law changed in 1867, the Paris music hall flourished, and a half-dozen new halls opened, offering acrobats, singers, dancers, magicians, and trained animals. The first Paris music hall built specially for that purpose was the Folies-Bergere (1869); it was followed by the Moulin Rouge (1889), the Alhambra (1866), the first to be called a music hall, and the Olympia (1893). The &quot;Printania&quot; (1903) was a music-garden, open only in summer, with a theater, restaurant, circus, and horse-racing. Older theaters also transformed themselves into music halls, including the Bobino (1873), the Bataclan (1864), and the Alcazar (1858). At the beginning, music halls offered dance reviews, theater and songs, but gradually songs and singers became the main attraction.
Paris music halls all faced stiff competition in the interwar period from the most popular new form of entertainment, the cinema. They responded by offering more complex and lavish shows. In 1911, the Olympia had introduced the giant stairway as a set for its productions, an idea copied by other music halls. Gaby Deslys rose in popularity and created, with her dance partner Harry Pilcer, her most famous dance &quot;The Gaby Glide&quot;. The singer Mistinguett made her debut the Casino de Paris in 1895, and continued to appear regularly in the 1920s and 1930s at the Folies Bergère, Moulin Rouge and Eldorado. Her risqué routines captivated Paris, and she became one of the most highly-paid and popular French entertainers of her time.
One of the most popular entertainers in Paris during the period was the American singer Josephine Baker. Baker sailed to Paris, France. She first arrived in Paris in 1925 to perform in a show called &quot;La Revue Nègre&quot; at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She became an immediate success for her erotic dancing, and for appearing practically nude on stage. After a successful tour of Europe, she returned to France to star at the Folies Bergère. Baker performed the &#x27;Danse sauvage,&#x27; wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas.
The music-halls suffered growing hardships in the 1930s. The Olympia was converted into a movie theater, and others closed. Others however continued to thrive. In 1937 and 1930, the Casino de Paris presented shows with Maurice Chevalier, who had already achieved success as an actor and singer in Hollywood.

In 1935, a twenty-year old singer named Édith Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle by nightclub owner Louis Leplée, whose club, Le Gerny, off the Champs-Élysées, was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel. Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub appearance led to her first two records produced that same year, and the beginning of her career.

Competition from movies and television largely brought an end to the Paris music hall. However, a few still flourish, with tourists as their primary audience. Major music halls include the Folies-Bergere, Crazy Horse Saloon, Casino de Paris, Olympia, and Moulin Rouge.

==History of the songs==

The musical forms most associated with music hall evolved in part from traditional folk song and songs written for popular drama, becoming by the 1850s a distinct musical style. Subject matter became more contemporary and humorous, and accompaniment was provided by larger house-orchestras, as increasing affluence gave the lower classes more access to commercial entertainment, and to a wider range of musical instruments, including the piano. The consequent change in musical taste from traditional to more professional forms of entertainment, arose in response to the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations in Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The newly created urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and readily accessible forms of entertainment.

Music halls were originally tavern rooms which provided entertainment, in the form of music and speciality acts, for their patrons. By the middle years of the nineteenth century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs, that could no longer be met from the traditional folk song repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap.

The emergence of a distinct music hall style can be credited to a fusion of musical influences. Music hall songs needed to gain and hold the attention of an often jaded and unruly urban audience. In America, from the 1840s, Stephen Foster had reinvigorated folk song with the admixture of Negro spiritual to produce a new type of popular song. Songs like &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; (1851) and &quot;Oh, Dem Golden Slippers&quot; (James Bland, 1879]) spread round the globe, taking with them the idiom and appurtenances of the minstrel song. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone, and a repeated chorus which carries the principal melody, and in which the audience is encouraged to join.
In Britain, the first music hall songs often promoted the alcoholic wares of the owners of the halls in which they were performed. Songs like &quot;Glorious Beer&quot;, and the first major music hall success, &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; (1867) had a major influence in establishing the new art form. The tune of &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; became used for The Salvation Army hymn &quot;Bless His Name, He Sets Me Free&quot; (1881). When asked why the tune should be used like this, William Booth is said to have replied &quot;Why should the devil have all the good tunes?&quot; According to The Salvation Army, &quot;The adoption of such music was soon put to full use. On Saturday afternoon, May 13, 1882, the congregation at the opening of the Clapton Congress Hall joined heartily in the chorus of Gipsy Smith&#x27;s solo, &#x27;O the Blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow&#x27; to the music of &#x27;I traced her little footsteps in the snow&#x27;. There were no qualms of conscience. Many people gathered there knew none of the hymn tunes or gospel melodies used in the churches; the music hall had been their melody school.&quot;

Music hall songs were often composed with their working class audiences in mind. Songs like &quot;My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)&quot;, &quot;Wot Cher! Knocked &#x27;em in the Old Kent Road&quot;, and &quot;Waiting at the Church&quot;, expressed in melodic form situations with which the urban poor were familiar. Music hall songs could be romantic, patriotic, humorous or sentimental, as the need arose. The most popular music hall songs became the basis for the pub songs of the typical Cockney &quot;knees up&quot;. Although a number of songs show a sharply ironic and knowing view of working-class life, there were, too, those which were repetitive, derivative, written quickly and sung to make a living rather than a work of art.

==Music hall comedy==

The typical music hall comedian was a man or woman, usually dressed in character to suit the subject of the song, or sometimes attired in absurd and eccentric style. Until well into the twentieth century, the acts were essentially vocal, with songs telling a story, accompanied by a minimum of patter. They included a variety of genres, including:
* Lion comiques: essentially, men dressed as &quot;toffs&quot;, who sang songs about drinking champagne, going to the races, going to the ball, womanising and gambling, and living the life of an aristocrat.
* Male and female impersonators, the latter more in the style of a pantomime dame than a modern drag queen. Nevertheless, these included some more sophisticated performers such as Vesta Tilley and Ella Shields, whose male impersonations communicated real social commentary.

Music hall impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and in 1904, Karno&#x27;s Komics produced a new sketch for the Hackney Empire in London called &quot;Mumming Birds&quot;, which included the pie in the face gag among other new innovations. Immensely popular, it became the longest-running sketch the music halls produced. Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel were among the music hall comedians who worked for Karno, and on the latter Simon Louvish writes, &quot;Chaplin remained the great observer of the absurdity of life&#x27;s endless struggles, an actor trained with Karno&#x27;s &quot;Speechless Comedians&quot; to express each thought and attitude in mime.&quot;

==Speciality acts==

The vocal content of the music hall bills, was, from the beginning, accompanied by many other kinds of act, some of them quite weird and wonderful. These were known collectively as &quot;speciality acts&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;spesh&quot;), which, over time, have included:

* Adagio: essentially a sort of cross between a dance act and a juggling act, consisting usually of a male dancer who threw a slim, pretty young girl around. Some aspects of modern dance choreography evolved from Adagio acts.
* Aerial acts, of the sort usually seen at the circus
* Animal acts: Talking dogs, flea circuses, and all manner of animals doing tricks.
* Cycling acts: again, a development of a circus act, consisting of either a solo or a troupe of trick cyclists. There was even a seven-piece cycling band called Seven Musical Savonas, who played fifty instruments between them, and Kaufmann&#x27;s Cycling Beauties, a troupe of girls in Victorian swim wear.
* Drag artists: female entertainers dressed as men, such as Vesta Tilley, Ella Shields, and Hetty King; or male entertainers dressed as women, such as Bert Erroll, Julian Eltinge, Danny La Rue, and Rex Jameson in the character of Mrs Shufflewick
* Electric acts, using the newly discovered phenomenon of static electricity to produce tricks such as lighting gas jets and setting fire to handkerchiefs through the performers fingertips. Dr Walford Bodie (1869/70-1939) was the most notable.
* Escapologists, such as Harry Houdini.
* Fire eaters and other eating acts, such as eating glass, razor blades, goldfish, etc.
* Juggling and plate spinning acts. Another variation was the Diabolo.
* Knife throwing and sword swallowing. The most spectacular of its time was the Victorina Troupe, who swallowed a sword fired from a rifle.
* Magic acts, such as David Devant.
* A memory act of the type performed by Datas, &quot;the Living Encyclopaedia&quot; (1875–1956).
* Mentalism acts. Commonly a male mentalist, blindfolded on stage, and an attractive female assistant passing among the audience. The assistant would collect objects from the audience, and the mentalist would identify each by &quot;reading&quot; the assistants mind. This was usually accomplished by a clever system of codes and clues from the assistant.
* Mime artists and impressionists.
* Comic pianists, such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith.
* Puppet acts, including human puppets and living doll acts.
* Shadow puppet acts.
* Stilt walkers.
* Strongmen such as Eugen Sandow, and strongwomen such as Joan Rhodes, performing feats of strength.
* Trampoline acts.
* Ventriloquists, or &quot;Vent&quot; acts as they were called in the business, such as Fred Russell, Arthur Prince, Frank Travis, Coram (Thomas Mitchell).
* Wild West/Cowboy acts.
* Wrestling and jujitsu exhibitions were both popular speciality acts, forming the basis of modern professional wrestling.

==Cultural influences of music hall: Literature, drama, screen, and later music==
The music hall has been evoked in many films, plays, TV series, and books.
* In James Joyce&#x27;s short story &quot;The Boarding House&quot; (1914), Mrs Mooney&#x27;s boarding-house in Hardwicke Street accommodates &quot;occasionally (...) &quot;artistes&quot; from the music halls&quot;. The Sunday night &quot;reunions&quot; with Jack Mooney in the drawing-room create a certain atmosphere.
* About half of the film &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; (1934) is set in a music hall. It was based on a farce by Pinero and features the music hall acts of Lily Morris, Harry Bedford, the gymnasts Gaston &amp; Andre, G. H. Elliott, Sam Curtis, and Frank Boston &amp; Betty.
* A music hall with a &#x27;memory man&#x27; act provides a pivotal plot device in the classic 1935 Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;.
* The Arthur Askey comedy film &quot;I Thank You&quot; (1941) features old-time music hall star Lily Morris as an ex-music hall artiste now ennobled as &quot;Lady Randall&quot;. In the last scene of the film, however, she reverts to type and gives a rendition of &quot;Waiting at the Church&quot; at an impromptu concert at Aldwych tube station organised by Askey and his side-kick Richard &quot;Stinker&quot; Murdoch.
* The Victorian era of music hall was celebrated by the 1944 film, &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;.
* The comedy of Benny Hill, first seen on British television in 1951, was heavily influenced by the traditions and conventions of music hall comedy and he kept those traditions (comedy, songs, patter, pantomime, and female impersonations) alive on his more-than-100 television specials broadcast from 1955 through 1991.
* Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 1915 film &quot;A Night in the Show&quot; brings one of the classic music hall comedy sketches, &quot;Mumming Birds&quot;, known as &quot;A Night in an English Music Hall&quot; when Chaplin performed it on tour, into his film work. His 1952 film &quot;Limelight&quot;, set in 1914 London, evokes the music hall world of Chaplin&#x27;s youth where he performed as a comedian before he achieved worldwide celebrity as a film star in America. The film depicts the last performance of a washed-up music hall clown called Calvero at The Empire theatre, Leicester Square. The film premiered at the Empire Cinema, which was built on the same site as the Empire theatre.
* &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; (1953 to 1983) was a popular BBC television light entertainment programme recorded live at the Leeds City Varieties, which aimed to recreate an authentic atmosphere of the Victorian–Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed by present-day performers in the style of the original artistes. The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing, especially the singing of &quot;Down at the Old Bull and Bush&quot; which closed the show. The show was compered by Leonard Sachs, who introduced the acts. In the course of its run, it featured about 2,000 artists. The show was first broadcast on 20 July 1953. &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; was inspired by the success of the &quot;Ridgeway&#x27;s Late Joys&quot; at the Players&#x27; Theatre Club in London: a private members&#x27; club that ran fortnightly programmes of variety acts in London&#x27;s West End.
* In 1957, Peter Sellers recorded a rendition of &quot;Any Old Iron&quot; in a voice he created for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, Willium &quot;Mate&quot; Cobblers. A scene in the 1992 biopic &quot;Chaplin&quot; where Charlie and Syd Chaplin meet just before Charlie&#x27;s audition for Mr. Karno, they greet each other by singing the chorus to &quot;Any Old Iron&quot;.
* John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1957) portrays the life and work of a failing, third-rate music hall stage performer who tries to keep his career going even as his personal life falls apart. The story is set at the time of the Suez Crisis in 1956, against the backdrop of the dying music hall tradition, and has been seen as symbolic of Britain&#x27;s general post-war decline, its loss of its Empire, its power, and its cultural confidence and identity. It was made into a film in 1960 starring Laurence Olivier in the title role of Archie Rice.
* In &quot;Grip of the Strangler&quot; (1958), set in Victorian London, the raunchy can-can dancers and loose women of the sleazy &quot;Judas Hole&quot; music hall are terrorised by the Haymarket Strangler, played by Boris Karloff.
* The variously titled Ken Dodd TV series recorded between 1959 and 1988 were heavily influenced by those traditions; up to his death in 2018, Dodd continued to tour a variety show including quick-fire stand-up comedy, songs, ventriloquism and sometimes other speciality acts.
* The Theatre of the Absurd (c. late 1950s) was influenced by music hall in its use of comedy, with avant-garde cultural forms (such as surrealism) being a more obvious influence.
* In &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), Lawrence (Peter O&#x27;Toole) sings &quot;The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo&quot; while riding across the desert. In the 2017 sci-fi &quot;&quot;, in mimicry of his idol Lawrence of Arabia, the android David sings the words of the song&#x27;s title while he is cutting his own hair in the mirror.
* The 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, set in Edwardian London, features music and lyrics by brothers Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman who took inspiration from Edwardian music hall music. 
* J. B. Priestley&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Lost Empires&quot; also evokes the world of Edwardian music hall just before the start of World War I; the title is a reference to the Empire theatres (as well as foreshadowing the decline of the British Empire itself). It was adapted as a television miniseries, shown in both the UK and in the U.S. as a PBS presentation. Priestley&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;The Good Companions&quot;, set in the same period, follows the lives of the members of a &quot;concert party&quot; or touring Pierrot troupe.
* Herman&#x27;s Hermits, led by Peter Noone, incorporated music hall into their repertoire, scoring a major hit with their cover of the Harry Champion music hall standard, &quot;I&#x27;m Henery the Eighth, I Am&quot;, in 1965 (Noone&#x27;s version includes only the chorus; not the many verses of the original).
* Music hall had a discernible influence on the Beatles through Paul McCartney, himself the son of a performer in the music hall tradition (Jim McCartney, who led Jim Mac&#x27;s Jazz Band). Examples of McCartney&#x27;s songs to display a music hall influence include: &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; (1967), &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; (1967), &quot;Honey Pie&quot; (1968), and &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; (1969); in the solo period: &quot;You Gave Me the Answer&quot; (1975), and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot; (1979).
* In 1969, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; debuted on the BBC, with Charles Isherwood writing that Monty Python, like Benny Hill, &quot;derived their sketch formats in part from the rowdy tradition of the music hall.&quot;
* The parodic film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), based on the stage musical &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; (1963) by Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop, featured the music hall turns and songs that had provided support for the British war effort in World War I.
* The popular ITV television series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (1971–1975) and its spin-off &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot; (1979) each dealt frequently with the world of the Edwardian music hall, sometimes through references to actual Edwardian era performers such as Vesta Tilley, or to characters on the show attending performances, and other times through the experiences of the popular character Sarah Moffat, who left domestic service several times and often ended up going on stage to support herself when she did.
* British rockers Queen incorporated music hall styles into several of their songs, such &quot;Killer Queen&quot; (1974) and &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; (1976).
* Garry Bushell&#x27;s punk pathetique band, The Gonads (formed 1977), did rock versions of music hall songs. Many punk pathetique acts were indebted to the music hall tradition.
* Between 1978 and 1984, BBC television broadcast two series of programmes called &quot;The Old Boy Network&quot;. These featured a star (usually a music hall/variety performer, but also some younger turns like Eric Sykes) performing some of their best known routines while giving a slide show of their life story. Artistes featured included Arthur Askey, Tommy Trinder, Sandy Powell, and Chesney Allen.
* In Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall&#x27;s musical, &quot;Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera&quot; (1985), the lead performer is an ageing music hall artiste named Soliquisto.
* Sarah Waters&#x27;s book &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; (1998) revolves around the world of music halls in the late Victorian era, and in particular around two fictional &quot;mashers&quot; (drag kings) named Kitty Butler and Nan King.
* The modern Players&#x27; Theatre Club provides a brief impression of contemporary music hall in the film &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; (2001), where Jeremy Irons&#x27; character creates an alibi by visiting a show.
* The name of music hall singer Ida Barr (1882–1967) was appropriated some 40 years after her death by Christopher Green for an unrelated, non-tribute drag act.
* The album &quot;Between Today and Yesterday&quot; by Alan Price (previously keyboard player for The Animals) was influenced by pre-rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music styles, especially music hall.
* Popular music duo Chas &amp; Dave did much to revive the spirit of music hall in their albums and songs throughout the 1980s. They wrote and recorded &quot;Harry Was A Champion&quot; – a tribute song to the stars of music hall – for their 1984 album &quot;Well Pleased&quot;.

==Surviving music halls==

London was the centre of music hall with hundreds of venues, often in the entertainment rooms of public houses. With the decline in popularity of music hall, many were abandoned, or converted to other uses such as cinemas, and their interiors lost. There are a number of purpose-built survivors, including the Hackney Empire, an outstanding example of the late music hall period (Frank Matcham 1901). This has been restored to its Moorish splendour and now provides an eclectic programme of events from opera to &quot;Black Variety Nights&quot;. The architectural writer Nikolaus Pevsner called the Grade II-listed Hackney Empire &quot;among the best-surviving Edwardian suburban variety theatres&quot;. A mile to the south is Hoxton Hall, an 1863 example of the saloon style. It is unrestored but maintained in its original layout, and currently used as a community centre and theatre. In the neighbouring borough, Collins Music Hall (built about 1860) still stands on the north side of Islington Green. The hall closed in the 1960s and currently forms part of a bookshop.

In Clapham, The Grand, originally the Grand Palace of Varieties (1900), has been restored, but its interior reflects its modern use as a music venue and nightclub. The Greenwich Theatre was originally the Rose and Crown Music Hall (1855), and later became Crowder&#x27;s Music Hall and Temple of Varieties. The building has been extensively modernised and little of the original layout remains.
In the nondescript Grace&#x27;s Alley, off Cable Street, Stepney, stands Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall. This 1858 example of the &quot;giant pub hall&quot; survived use as a church, fire, flood and war intact, but was virtually derelict, after its use as a rag warehouse, in the 1960s. The Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall Trust has embarked on a fund-raising campaign to restore the building. In June 2007, the World Monuments Fund added the building to its list of the world&#x27;s &quot;100 most endangered sites&quot;. The building was for many years on Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk Register, but following its successful restoration was removed from list in 2016 and after 20 years on the register it was named as one of the successful rescues. The music video of the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single &quot;Relax&quot; was shot here. Many of these buildings can be seen as part of the annual London Open House event.

There are also surviving music halls outside London, a notable example being the Leeds City Varieties (1865) with a preserved interior. This was used for many years as the setting for the BBC television variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, based on the music-hall genre. The Alhambra Theatre, Bradford was built in 1914 for theatre impresario Francis Laidler, and later owned by the Stoll-Moss Empire. It was restored in 1986, and is a fine example of the late Edwardian style. It is now a &quot;receiving theatre&quot; for touring productions and opera.

In Nottingham, the Malt Cross music hall retains its restored cast-iron interior. It is run as a cafe bar by a Christian charitable trust promoting responsible drinking, also as the location of a safe space late at night and for operating a street pastor service. It is true to its original purpose of providing a venue for up-and-coming musical acts.

In Northern Ireland, the Grand Opera House, Belfast, Frank Matcham 1895, was preserved and restored in the 1980s. The Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man is another Matcham design from 1900 that remains in use after an extensive restoration programme in the 1970s. In Glasgow, the Britannia Music Hall (1857), by architects Thomas Gildard and H.M. McFarlane, remains standing, with much of the theatre intact but in a poor state, having closed in 1938. There is a preservation trust attempting to rescue the theatre.

One of the few fully functional music hall entertainments is at the Brick Lane Music Hall in a former church in North Woolwich. The Players&#x27; Theatre Club is another group performing a Victorian-style music hall show at a variety of venues, and The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America stage music hall-style entertainments.

<text>Mungo Park (10 September 1771 – 1806) was a Scottish explorer of West Africa. After an exploration of the upper Niger River around 1796, he wrote a popular and influential travel book titled &quot;Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa&quot; in which he theorized the Niger and Congo merged to become the same river, though it was later proven that they are different rivers. He was killed during a second expedition, having successfully travelled about two-thirds of the way down the Niger. 

If the African Association was the &quot;beginning of the age of African exploration&quot; by Europeans, then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer; he set a standard for all who followed. Park was the first Westerner to have recorded travels in the central portion of the Niger, and through his popular book introduced the European public to a vast unexplored continent which influenced future European explorers and colonial ambitions in Africa.

==Early life==
Mungo Park was born 10 September 1771 in Selkirkshire, Scotland, at Foulshiels on the Yarrow Water, near Selkirk, on a tenant farm which his father, Mungo Park (1714–1793), rented from the Duke of Buccleuch. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen. Although tenant farmers, the Parks were relatively well-off. They were able to pay for Park to receive a good education, and Park&#x27;s father died leaving property valued at £3,000 (). His parents had originally intended him for a ministry in the Church of Scotland.

He was educated at home before attending Selkirk grammar school. At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to Thomas Anderson, a surgeon in Selkirk. During his apprenticeship, Park became friends with Anderson&#x27;s son Alexander and was introduced to Anderson&#x27;s daughter Allison, who would later become his wife.

In October 1788, Park enrolled at the University of Edinburgh, attending for four sessions studying medicine and botany. Notably, during his time at university, he spent a year in the natural history course taught by Professor John Walker. After completing his studies, he spent a summer in the Scottish Highlands, engaged in botanical fieldwork with his brother-in-law, James Dickson, a gardener and seed merchant in Covent Garden. In 1788 Dickson along with Sir James Edward Smith and six other fellows founded the Linnean Society of London.

In 1792, Park completed his medical studies at University of Edinburgh. Through a recommendation by Joseph Banks he obtained the post of surgeon&#x27;s mate on board the East India Company&#x27;s ship . In February 1793 the &quot;Worcester&quot; sailed to Benkulen in Sumatra. Before departing, Park wrote to his friend Alexander Anderson in terms that reflect his Calvinist upbringing:

On his return in 1794, Park gave a lecture to the Linnaean Society, describing eight new Sumatran fish. The paper was not published until three years later. He also presented Banks with various rare Sumatran plants.

==Travels into the interior of Africa==
===First journey===

On 26 September 1794, Mungo Park offered his services to the African Association, then looking for a successor to Major Daniel Houghton, who had been sent in 1790 to discover the course of the Niger River and had died in the Sahara. Supported by Sir Joseph Banks, Park was selected.

On 22 May 1795, Park left Portsmouth, England, on the brig &quot;Endeavour&quot;, a vessel travelling to Gambia to trade for beeswax and ivory.

On 21 June 1795, he reached the Gambia River and ascended it to a British trading station named Pisania. On 2 December, accompanied by two local guides, he started for the unknown interior. He chose the route crossing the upper Senegal basin and through the semi-desert region of Kaarta. The journey was full of difficulties, and at Ludamar he was imprisoned by a Moorish chief for four months. On 1 July 1796, he escaped, alone and with nothing but his horse and a pocket compass, and on the 21st reached the long-sought Niger River at Ségou, being the first European to do so. He followed the river downstream to Silla, where he was obliged to turn back, lacking the resources to go further. Moreover, while traveling within Niger, many local inhabitants of the region would consistently think that he was himself a Moor, rather than European.

On his return journey, begun on 29 July, he took a route more to the south than that originally followed, keeping close to the Niger River as far as Bamako, thus tracing its course for some . At Kamalia he fell ill, and owed his life to the kindness of a man in whose house he lived for seven months. Eventually he reached Pisania again on 10 June 1797. Unable to book passage directly to England from Bathurst, he boarded a slave ship bound for Charleston. Having learned the Mandinka language during his travels, he served as doctor to the slaves, many of whom died en route. The ship was eventually forced to dock in Antigua, from which he returned to Scotland on 22 December. He had been thought dead, and his return home with news of his exploration of the Niger River evoked great public enthusiasm. An account of his journey was drawn up for the African Association by Bryan Edwards, and his own detailed narrative appeared in 1799 (&quot;Travels in the Interior of Africa&quot;).

Park was convinced that: 
Park encountered a group of slaves when travelling through Mandinka country Mali: 
His book &quot;Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa&quot; became a best-seller because it detailed what he observed, what he survived, and the people he encountered. His dispassionate — if not scientific or objective — descriptions set a standard for future travel writers to follow and gave Europeans a glimpse of Africa&#x27;s humanity and complexity. Park introduced them to a vast continent unexplored by Europeans. If the African Association was the &quot;beginning of the age of African exploration&quot; then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer, he set a standard for all who followed. After his death, European public and political interest in Africa began to increase. Perhaps the most lasting effect of Park&#x27;s travels, though, was the influence on European colonial ambitions during the 19th century.

=== Controversy ===
Mungo Park is credited with the original report of the Mountains of Kong - a mountain range rumored to be located in West Africa, beginning near the source of the Niger River and spanning the majority of the African continent from east to west. This mountain range was published by geographer and cartographer James Rennell.

Debate surrounding the existence of the mountain range occurred frequently, however, it was French officer and explorer Louis-Gustave Binger officially reported that the Mountains of Kong did not exist during an expedition in 1887-1888. It was not long after this that the Mountains of Kong were dropped from most map publications.

While the Mountains of Kong have been disproven, it has remained periodically on maps in until the early 20th century.

===Between journeys===
Settling at Foulshiels, in August 1799 Park married Allison, daughter of his apprenticeship master, Thomas Anderson. A project to go to New South Wales in some official capacity came to nothing, and in October 1801 Park moved to Peebles, where he practiced as a physician.
===Second journey===
In the autumn of 1803, Park was invited by the government to lead another expedition to the Niger. Park, who chafed at the hardness and monotony of life at Peebles, accepted the offer, but the expedition was delayed. Part of the waiting time was occupied perfecting his Arabic; his teacher, Sidi Ambak Bubi, was a native of Mogador (now Essaouira in Morocco) whose behavior both amused and alarmed the people of Peebles.

In May 1804, Park went back to Foulshiels, where he made the acquaintance of Walter Scott, then living nearby at Ashiesteil and with whom he soon became friendly. In September, Park was summoned to London to leave on the new expedition; he left Scott with the hopeful proverb on his lips, &quot;Freits (omens) follow those that look to them.&quot;

Park had at that time adopted the theory that the Niger and the Congo were one, and in a memorandum drawn up before he left Britain he wrote: &quot;My hopes of returning by the Congo are not altogether fanciful.&quot;

On 31 January 1805, he sailed from Portsmouth for Gambia, having been given a captain&#x27;s commission as head of the government expedition. Alexander Anderson, his brother-in-law and second-in-command, had received a lieutenancy. George Scott, a fellow Borderer, was draughtsman, and the party included four or five artificers. At Gorée (then in British occupation) Park was joined by Lieutenant Martyn, R.A., thirty-five privates and two seamen.

The expedition got a late start into the rainy season and did not reach the Niger until mid-August, when only eleven Europeans were left alive; the rest had succumbed to fever or dysentery. From Bamako the journey to Ségou was made by canoe. Having received permission from the local ruler, Mansong Diarra, to proceed, at Sansanding, a little below Ségou, Park made ready for his journey down the still unknown part of the river. Helped by one soldier, the only one capable of work, Park converted two canoes into one tolerably good boat, long and broad. This he christened H.M. schooner &quot;Joliba&quot; (the native name for the Niger River), and in it, with the surviving members of his party, he set sail downstream on 19 November.

Anderson had died at Sansanding on 28 October, and in him Park had lost one of his few remaining valuable members. Those who embarked in the &quot;Joliba&quot; were Park, Martyn, three European soldiers (one mad), a guide and three slaves. Before his departure, Park gave to Isaaco, a Mandingo guide who had been with him thus far, letters to take back to Gambia for transmission to Britain.

The Muslim traders along this section of the Niger did not believe Park was exploring purely for intellectual curiosity but was scouting European trading routes, they saw Park as a threat to their trading dominance. They lobbied Mansong Diarra to have Park killed, and when Mansong did not, they lobbied tribes further down the river. Park understood the politics and adopted a policy of staying away from the shore towards the middle of the river while attacking anyone who came near. In the process he also avoided paying tolls/bribes to pass through each kingdom, earning the rage of local rulers, Moorish or not, who would send messengers ahead to the next tribe downriver that a dangerous interloper was coming their way. Furthermore, Park&#x27;s policy of shoot first and not engaging with locals, in some cases slaughtering significant numbers of natives using superior firepower, made the Europeans something of a pariah. Park was running a gauntlet of hostile tribes in part of his own making.

To his wife, Park wrote of his intention not to stop nor land anywhere until he reached the coast, where he expected to arrive about the end of January 1806. These were the last communications received from Park, and nothing more was heard of the party until reports of disaster reached Gambia.

===Death===
At length, the British government engaged Isaaco to go to the Niger to ascertain Park&#x27;s fate. At Sansanding, Isaaco found Amadi Fatouma (Isaaco calls him Amaudy), the guide who had gone downstream with Park, and the substantial accuracy of the story he told was later confirmed by the investigations of Hugh Clapperton and Richard Lander.

Amadi Fatouma stated that Park&#x27;s canoe had descended the river as far as Sibby without incident. After Sibby, three native canoes chased them and Park&#x27;s party repulsed the pursuers with firearms. A similar incident occurred at Cabbara and again at Toomboucouton. At Gouroumo seven canoes pursued them. One of the party died of sickness leaving &quot;four white men, myself [Amadi], and three slaves&quot;. Each person (including the slaves) had &quot;15 musquets apiece, well loaded and always ready for action&quot;. After passing the residence of the king of Goloijigi, 60 canoes came after them which they &quot;repulsed after killing many natives&quot;. Further along they encountered an army of the Poule nation and kept to the opposite bank to avoid an action. After a close encounter with a hippopotamus they continued past Caffo (3 canoe pursuers) to an island where Isaaco was taken prisoner. Park rescued him, and 20 canoes chased them. This time they merely asked Amadi for trinkets which Park supplied. At Gourmon they traded for provisions and were warned of an ambush ahead. They passed the army &quot;being all Moors&quot; and entered Haoussa, finally arriving at Yauri (which Amadi calls Yaour), where he (Fatouma) landed. 

To this point of the journey of some Park, who had plenty of provisions, stuck to his resolution of keeping away from the natives. Below Djenné, came Timbuktu, and at various other places the natives came out in canoes and attacked his boat. These attacks were all repulsed, Park and his party having plenty of firearms and ammunition and the natives having none. The boat also escaped the many perils attendant on navigating an unknown stream strewn with many rapids; Park had built &quot;Joliba&quot; so that she drew only of water.

At Haoussa, Amadi traded with the local chief. Amadi reports that Park gave him five silver rings, some powder and flints to give as a gift to the chief of the village. The following day Amadi visited the king where Amadi was accused of not having given the chief a present. Amadi was &quot;put in irons&quot;. The king then sent an army to Boussa where there is a natural narrowing of the river commanded by high rock. But at the Bussa rapids, not far below Yauri, Park&#x27;s boat became stuck on a rock and remained fast. On the bank were gathered hostile natives, who attacked the party with bow and arrow and throwing spears. Their position being untenable, Park, Martyn, and the two remaining soldiers sprang into the river and were drowned. The sole survivor was one of the slaves. After three months in irons, Amadi was released and talked with the surviving slave, from whom was obtained the story of the final scene.

===Aftermath===
Amadi paid a Peulh man to obtain Park&#x27;s sword belt. Amadi then returned first to Sansanding and then to Segou. After, Amadi went to Dacha and told the king what had occurred. The king sent an army past &quot;Tombouctou&quot; (Timbuktu) to Sacha but decided that Haoussa was too far for a punitive expedition. Instead they went to Massina, a small &quot;Paul&quot; Peulh country where they took all the cattle and returned home. Amadi appears to have been part of this expedition: &quot;We came altogether back to Sego&quot; (Segou). Amadi then returned to Sansanding via Sego. Eventually the Peulh man obtained the sword belt and after a voyage of eight months met up with Amadi and gave him the belt. Isaaco met Amadi in Sego and having obtained the sword belt returned to Senegal.

Isaaco, and later Richard Lander, obtained some of Park&#x27;s effects, but his journal was never recovered. In 1827 his second son, Thomas, landed on the Guinea coast, intending to make his way to Bussa, where he thought his father might be detained a prisoner; but after penetrating a little distance inland he died of fever. Park&#x27;s widow, Allison, received a previously agreed upon £4,000 settlement from the African Association as a result of the death of Mungo Park. She died in 1840. Mungo Park&#x27;s remains are believed to have been buried along the banks of the River Niger in Jebba, Nigeria.

With Park&#x27;s death the mystery of the Niger remained unsolved. Park&#x27;s theory that the Niger and Congo were the same river became the general opinion in the years after his death. However even while Park was alive, an amateur German geographer named Reichard proposed the Niger delta was the mouth of the river, but his theory was one of many and did not have much currency because the delta had so many small streams it did not appear to be from a great river. In 1821, James McQueen published a book, the result of 25 years of research, in which he correctly (it would later be seen) laid out the entire course of the Niger; however, like Reichard, his theories did not receive much notice. A number of failed expeditions were mounted, but the mystery would finally be solved 25 years after Park&#x27;s death, in 1830. Richard Lander and his brother became the first Europeans to follow the course of the Niger from source to ocean.

His son Mungo Park (1800–1823) died in India at the age of 22, while in government service, and was buried at Trichinopoly.

==Medal==
The Royal Scottish Geographical Society award the Mungo Park Medal annually in Park&#x27;s honour.

==Memorial==
A life-size statue was erected to Park on the High Street in Selkirk in 1859. The monument was sculpted by Andrew Currie. In 1905 the monument had bronze figures added on the corners and two bas-relief panels, all by Thomas J. Clapperton.

==In media==
Circa 1836, Richard Adams Locke (author of the Great Moon Hoax) composed a fictional &quot;Lost Manuscript of Mungo Park&quot;, in which Park explores the interior of the hollow Earth.

Mungo Park is mentioned in Herman Melville&#x27;s 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (Chapter 5: Breakfast), and several times, parodically, in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s short story &quot;A Natural History of the Dead.&quot;

Mungo Park appears as one of the two protagonists in T. C. Boyle&#x27;s 1981 historical novel &quot;Water Music&quot;.

Tom Fremantle&#x27;s 2005 travelogue &quot;The Road to Timbuktu: Down the Niger on the Trail of Mungo Park&quot; details Mungo Park&#x27;s biography and retraces his travels.

Nigerian singer Burna Boy mentions Park in his song &quot;Monsters You Made&quot; on the 2020 album &quot;Twice as Tall&quot;.

<text>Richard Heber (5 January 1773 – 4 October 1833) was an English book collector.

==Biography==
He was born in Westminster, as the eldest son of Reginald Heber, who succeeded his eldest brother as lord of the manors of Marton in Yorkshire and Hodnet in Shropshire, and of Mary Baylie, his first wife. He attended Brasenose College, Oxford. At 19 he edited the works of Silius Italicus (2 vols. 12mo, 1792), and a year later prepared for the press an edition of &quot;Claudiani Carmina&quot; (2 vols., 1793).

He developed a taste for book collecting in childhood, and as an undergraduate he began to collect a purely classical library. His taste broadening, he became interested in early English drama and literature, and began his collection of rare books in these departments. Succeeding on the death of his father in 1804 to large estates in Yorkshire and Shropshire, which he considerably augmented, he forthwith devoted himself to the purchase of rare books. Heber was one of the 18 founders in 1812 of the Roxburghe Club of bibliophiles.

He possessed extensive landed property in Shropshire and Yorkshire, and was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1821, was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford University from 1821 to 1826, and in 1822 was made a D.C.L. of that University. He was one of the founders of the Athenaeum Club, London.

In 1826 he and Charles Henry Hartshorne, a friend he had made through the Roxburghe Club, encountered gossip and innuendo over the nature of their relationship. &quot;John Bull&quot; hinted over two of its issues at the idea that it was sexual. Heber had abruptly left the country; Hartshorne pursued &quot;John Bull&quot; successfully through the courts.

After ransacking England for books, Heber travelled extensively on the Continent, purchasing everywhere, and leaving large depots of books in Paris, Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent, and elsewhere in the Netherlands and Germany. At booksales he sometimes purchased single volumes, sometimes whole libraries. Sir Walter Scott classed Heber&#x27;s library as &quot;superior to all others in the world&quot;; Thomas Campbell described him as &quot;the fiercest and strongest of all the bibliomaniacs.&quot; He did not confine himself to the purchase of a single copy of a work which took his fancy. &quot;No gentleman,&quot; he remarked, &quot;can be without three copies of a book, one for show, one for use, and one for borrowers.&quot; To such a size did his library grow that it overran eight houses, some in England, some on the Continent.

At his death his collection in England was estimated by Dibdin at 105,000 volumes, exclusive of many thousands on the Continent, the whole having cost upward of £180,000. Allibone in his &quot;Dictionary of Authors&quot; computes the volumes in England at 113,195, and those in France and Holland at 33,632, making a total of 146,827, to which must be added a large collection of pamphlets. This immense library was disposed of by auction after the owner&#x27;s death, the sale lasting 216 days and realizing more than £60,000.

==Family==
He was the half-brother of Reginald Heber, a bishop. After he died aged 60 in 1833, there was well-founded gossip that he had been homosexual. He was very close to another book collector named Frances Mary Richardson Currer. Currer helped Heber when he was in financial difficulties and came to aid his reputation after he died.

<doc id="232705" wikidata="Q754755" url="?curid=232705" title="Fucus vesiculosus">
<text>Fucus vesiculosus, known by the common names bladderwrack, black tang, rockweed, sea grapes, bladder fucus, sea oak, cut weed, dyers fucus, red fucus and rock wrack, is a seaweed found on the coasts of the North Sea, the western Baltic Sea and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It was the original source of iodine, discovered in 1811, and was used extensively to treat goitre.

==Description==
The fronds of &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; grow to long and wide and have a prominent midrib throughout. It is attached by a basal disc-shaped holdfast. It has almost spherical air bladders, which are usually paired one on either side of the mid-rib but may be absent in young plants. The margin is smooth and the frond is dichotomously branched. It is sometimes confused with &quot;Fucus spiralis&quot; with which it hybridises and is similar to &quot;Fucus serratus&quot;.

=== Biology ===
Plants of &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; are dioecious. Gametes are generally released into the seawater under calm conditions, and the eggs are fertilized externally to produce a zygote. Eggs are fertilized shortly after being released from the receptacle. A study on the coast of Maine showed that there was 100% fertilization at both exposed and sheltered sites. Continuously submerged populations in the Baltic Sea are very responsive to turbulent conditions. High fertilization success is achieved because the gametes are released only when water velocities are low.

Individuals of &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; from the North Sea colonized the Baltic Sea less than 8,000 years ago. The event is paralleled by a switch from what seems to be obligate sexual recruitment to facultative asexual recruitment. Asexual reproduction in Baltic Sea populations is accomplished by the production of adventitious branches that come loose and reattach to the bottom by the formation of rhizoids. Adventitious branches are present in thalli of &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; in other areas too but asexual formation of new thalli has never been reported outside the Baltic Sea.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Fucus vesiculosus&quot; is a common large alga on the shores of the British Isles. It has been recorded from the Atlantic shores of Europe, Northern Russia, the Baltic Sea, Greenland, Azores, Canary Islands, Morocco and Madeira. It is also found on the Atlantic coast of North America from Ellesmere Island, Hudson Bay to North Carolina.
==Ecology==
The species is especially common on sheltered shores from the middle littoral to lower intertidal levels. It is rare on exposed shores, where any specimens may be short, stunted and without the air vesicles. &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; supports few colonial organisms but provides a canopy and shelter for the tube worm &quot;Spirorbis spirorbis&quot;, herbivorous isopods such as &quot;Idotea&quot; and surface-grazing snails such as &quot;Littorina obtusata&quot;. Phlorotannins in &quot;Fucus vesiculosus&quot; act as chemical defenses against the marine herbivorous snail &quot;Littorina littorea&quot;, while galactolipids act as herbivore deterrents against the sea urchin &quot;Arbacia punctulata&quot;. Methyl jasmonate may induce the phlorotannins production. Fucophlorethol A is a type of phlorotannin found in &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot;.

==Uses==
&quot;Fucus vesiculosus&quot; can be cooked and eaten.

It was the original source of iodine, discovered in 1811, and was used extensively to treat goitre, a swelling of the thyroid gland related to iodine deficiency.

It is also sold as a nutritional supplement. Primary chemical constituents include mucilage, algin, mannitol, fucitol, beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, volatile oils, iodine, bromine, potassium and other minerals.

===Adverse effects===
Consumption of &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot; can cause platelet inhibition, which may potentiate the anticoagulant activity of warfarin (Coumadin). It should be avoided before surgery.

Some people may suffer an allergic reaction to the iodine in &quot;F. vesiculosus&quot;.

<text>Reginald Heber (21 April 1783 – 3 April 1826) was an English Anglican bishop, a man of letters, and hymn-writer. After 16 years as a country parson, he served as Bishop of Calcutta until his death at the age of 42. The son of a rich landowner and cleric, Heber gained fame at the University of Oxford as a poet. After graduation he made an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and Central Europe. Ordained in 1807, he took over his father&#x27;s old parish, Hodnet, Shropshire. He also wrote hymns and general literature, including a study of the works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor.

He was consecrated Bishop of Calcutta in October 1823. He travelled widely and worked to improve the spiritual and general living conditions of his flock. Arduous duties, a hostile climate and poor health led to his collapse and death after less than three years in India. Memorials were erected there and in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. A collection of his hymns appeared soon after his death. &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty&quot; remains popular for Trinity Sunday, while &quot;Brightest and Best&quot; is frequently sung during Epiphany.

==Early life==
===Background and childhood===

The surname &quot;Heber&quot; probably derives from &quot;Haybergh&quot;, a hill in the Craven district of Yorkshire, where the family originated. The Hebers held the lordship of the manor of Marton, and were granted a coat of arms during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Richard Heber was the son of Thomas Heber and Elizabeth Atherton, the granddaughter of Richard Atherton.

In 1752 Richard Heber received the manor and estate of Hodnet Hall in Shropshire as a bequest from a cousin of his wife. This included patronage of the parish of Hodnet. On Richard Heber&#x27;s death in 1766 his brother Reginald, who was co-rector of the parish of Malpas in Cheshire, inherited the Shropshire estate and additionally became rector of Hodnet. His first marriage, to Mary Baylie, produced a son, Richard Heber, who became a noted book collector and Member of Parliament for Oxford University. His second marriage to Mary Allanson, after Mary Baylie&#x27;s death, produced two further sons, the elder, born at Malpas on 21 April 1783, being named Reginald after his father.

At the age of eight the younger Reginald began five years at the local grammar school at Whitchurch. In 1796 he was sent to Bristow&#x27;s, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge. At Bristow&#x27;s he met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend, sharing an interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter from Heber to Thornton is described by Heber&#x27;s biographer Arthur Montefiore as worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton&#x27;s decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber&#x27;s regret.

===Oxford===
There were family connections with Brasenose, Heber&#x27;s brother Richard being a fellow at the time and his father was a former fellow. The head of the college was William Cleaver, a friend of Reginald Senior and frequent visitor to Hodnet Hall. In his first year, Heber won the University Prize for Latin Verse, and began to develop local repute as a Romantic poet. In 1803 he entered a long poem, &quot;Palestine&quot;, for the Newdigate Prize. He had been helped in composing it by Walter Scott, a family friend, before Scott&#x27;s years of fame. The poem was enthusiastically received when Heber declaimed it at that year&#x27;s Encaenia ceremony. It was later published and set to music by William Crotch (who had been professor of music at Oxford since 1797), and translated into Welsh by W. Owen Pughe in 1822. Montefiore, in 1902, described it as &quot;the most successful and popular piece of religious verse of the first half of the [19th] century&quot;. Heber&#x27;s later biographer Derrick Hughes finds its contemporary acclaim puzzling: &quot;It is not a good, not even a mediocre poem; it is leaden&quot;.

The death of Reginald Senior in February 1804 left the living of parish of St Luke, Hodnet vacant, and may have prompted Heber&#x27;s decision to seek ordination, though he delayed it for some years. In his degree examinations he did honourably rather than brilliantly; Montefiore quotes a contemporary view that Heber&#x27;s main contribution to university life was in fields outside formal academic success, particularly as a thinker, a poet and an orator: &quot;Reginald Heber was a star whose lustre was as steady as it was clear.&quot; He took his bachelor&#x27;s degree in the summer of 1804 and was elected to a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford. He also won the university&#x27;s Bachelor&#x27;s Prize for an English prose essay.

===European journey===
Heber and Thornton had planned to follow their graduation with a Grand Tour of Europe. However, in 1804 the Napoleonic Wars made much of Europe inaccessible, and so they delayed their departure until the summer of 1805 and took a route through Sweden, Norway and Finland to Russia, instead of the usual journey through France and Italy. In July 1805, they sailed for Gothenburg in Sweden, then travelled northward by stage coach, via Vänern and Uddevalla, to Kristiania (Oslo) in Norway. After a short stay there, they moved through the wild Dovre Region to Trondheim, where they observed the practice of skiing for the first time (Heber referred to it as &quot;skating&quot;).

They then turned south-east, re-entered Sweden and travelled through Uppsala to Stockholm. Towards the end of September they crossed the Gulf of Bothnia to Åbo (Turku), site of Europe&#x27;s most northerly university, in the part of Finland then under Swedish rule. They proceeded eastwards and reached St Petersburg at the end of October. They spent two months in the city; through influential British Embassy contacts they visited places generally closed to the public, including Tsar Alexander&#x27;s private quarters in the Winter Palace. They experienced Muslim worship at first hand as the city&#x27;s large Muslim population observed Ramadan; Heber described the crowds gathered for prayer in an improvised mosque as &quot;the most decent and attentive congregation [he] had seen since leaving England.&quot;

Heber and Thornton had meant to remain in St Petersburg until after the New Year, then if possible return home through Germany. This was thwarted by Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 and the treaties that followed. Instead they extended their stay in Russia, leaving St Petersburg on 31 December 1805 by sledge for the 500-mile journey to Moscow, where they arrived on 3 January. They found it a hospitable city—in a letter home Heber refers to it as an &quot;overgrown village&quot;—and they made friends with many of its leading citizens and clergy. They left by stage coach on 13 March, heading south towards the Crimea and the Black Sea. This took them through the Cossack country of the Don River Basin. Heber sent home a vivid account of the night celebrations for Easter at Novo Tcherkask, the Cossack capital: &quot;The soft plaintive chaunt of the choir, and their sudden change at the moment of daybreak to the full chorus of &#x27;Christ is risen&#x27; were altogether what a poet or a painter would have studied with delight&quot;.

In the Crimea, Heber observed the manners and practices of the region&#x27;s large Muslim community. He expressed pleasure at being greeted with the oriental &quot;salaam&quot;. The course of the war in Europe had meanwhile shifted to allow Heber and Thornton to pass through Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany to the port of Hamburg, by way of Austerlitz, where they heard accounts of the recent battle. While making sketches of the scene, Heber was briefly mistaken for a French spy by local farmers. At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth&#x27;s private yacht and sailed for England, arriving at Great Yarmouth on 14 October 1806.

==Rector of Hodnet==
===Parish priest===
On his return to England, Heber prepared for Holy Orders at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life. He was ordained as deacon at the end of February 1807 and received full priest&#x27;s orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet; he was later to describe his role as &quot;a half-way station between a parson and a squire&quot;. At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: &quot;Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience&quot;. A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.

On 9 April 1809 Heber married Amelia Shipley, the youngest daughter of the Dean of St Asaph. He withdrew from Oxford, having secured his M.A., and set himself up permanently in the Hodnet rectory; finding this too small for his wife&#x27;s liking he had the house demolished and a larger replacement built. In September 1813 Heber preached a sermon in Shrewsbury to the British and Foreign Bible Society, a missionary organisation of which he had been a member since his undergraduate days. The sermon ended with what Hughes describes as Heber&#x27;s first public declaration in support of the work of overseas missions. He refused an appointment as a canon at Durham, preferring to continue his work in Hodnet in which, after 1814, he was assisted by his younger brother, the Revd Thomas Heber, who served as his curate until his death, at the age of 31, in 1816. The employment of a curate enabled Heber to devote more time to his literary pursuits, and to accept an invitation, in 1815, to deliver the Bampton Lectures at Oxford. He chose as his subject &quot;The Personality and the Office of the Christian Comforter&quot;; the series was published in 1822.

In 1817 Heber accepted the post of canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties to be carried out without interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber&#x27;s critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber&#x27;s life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.

===Hymn writer===
At the start of the 19th century the Anglican authorities officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, and was one of the first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber&#x27;s death, as &quot;Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year&quot;.

Betjeman characterised Heber&#x27;s style as consciously literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: &quot;poetic imagery was as important as didactic truth&quot;. A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber&#x27;s tendency to deliver what he terms &quot;a rather obvious sermon&quot;, and to his mixing of powerful description with &quot;a rather trite moralism&quot;. A handful of Heber&#x27;s hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century.
* Brightest and Best
* Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty

One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn &quot;From Greenland&#x27;s Icy Mountains&quot;, written in 1819 as part of a country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as &quot;a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field&quot;, and while widely sung until the second half of the 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal. Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to &quot;...every prospect pleases and only man is vile&quot;, and to &quot;the heathen in his blindness [bowing] down to wood and stone&quot;. These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech at YMCA Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: &quot;My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... [Man] is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so&quot;. Other Heber texts remain popular, and the &quot;Dictionary of North American Hymnology&quot; notes that most of his hymns remain in use.

==Bishop of Calcutta==
===Appointment===
The see of Calcutta had been established in 1814. It covered much of the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon, together with Australia and parts of southern Africa. The first bishop, Thomas Middleton, who had been consecrated in 1814, died in office in July 1822. At the time the head of the Indian Board of Control was Charles Williams-Wynn, an old Oxford friend of Heber&#x27;s. In December 1822 Williams-Wynn wrote to Heber, not directly offering his friend the post—the wording appeared to anticipate a refusal—but nevertheless leaving Heber the opportunity to claim the office, should he wish. Heber had a longstanding interest in the work of overseas missions; he supported not only the SPG but also its more recently formed evangelical sister-body, the Church Missionary Society (CMS), and while still at Oxford had helped to found the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS).

Heber was attracted to the post, his interest in distant places having been stimulated by his early travels, but his initial response to the implied offer was cautious. He first asked Williams-Wynn whether there was a suitable local man for the appointment and he was told there was not. His next concern was whether his wife and infant daughter should be exposed to the rigours of the Indian climate, and also if his own health was adequate. After consultation with doctors and discussion with his family, Heber wrote to Williams-Wynn on 2 January 1823, refusing the post. Within days he had written again, regretting the refusal and asking if the post was still available, at which Williams-Wynn quickly obtained the formal approval of King George IV to the appointment. Heber spent the next few months at Hodnet preparing for his departure; during this period he gave a farewell sermon at Oxford, after which the degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) was conferred on him. On 1 June 1823 Heber was formally consecrated as Bishop of Calcutta at Lambeth Palace, by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Two weeks later he departed for India with Amelia and his daughter Emily.

===In office===
The new bishop arrived in Calcutta on 10 October 1823. After his ceremonial installation by the Governor General, Lord Amherst, Heber preached his first sermon as bishop on Sunday 12 October, in St John&#x27;s Cathedral Church. He faced many challenges arising from tasks unfinished at the time of his predecessor&#x27;s death and from the long hiatus without a bishop. A major area of concern was Bishop&#x27;s College, a training school for local clergy founded by Middleton in 1820, the development of which had stalled due to financial and management problems. Heber reinvigorated the project by extensive fundraising, by persuading the government to increase its grant of land, and by restarting the building programme; within a few months the college boasted a library and a new chapel. In June 1824 Heber, using a power provided to him by recent Act of Parliament, ordained as deacon the first native Indian to receive Holy Orders.

Heber was interested in all aspects of Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.

===Travels===
On 15 June 1824 Heber set out on a tour of northern India, accompanied by his personal chaplain, Martin Stowe, and Daniel Corrie, the Archdeacon of Calcutta. Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet. The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges, then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west, crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay. The journey was almost aborted near to its beginning when Stowe fell ill in Dacca (present-day Dhaka, Bangladesh) and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue. Early in August the party reached Benares (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well-established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a Holy Communion service in both English and Hindustani, a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.

The party left Benares in mid-September. After reaching Allahabad they continued overland, accompanied by an armed troop of sepoys. On 28 November they reached their farthest northerly point, at Almora in the Kumaon region. Their subsequent path southward took them to Delhi, the ancient Mughal capital, where Heber was presented to the ageing emperor Akbar Shah II in his dilapidated palace; Heber wrote of the emperor as &quot;the venerable ruin of a mighty stock&quot;. In the final stages of the journey to Bombay, at Nadiad, Heber met with Sahajanand Swami, the region&#x27;s leading Hindu religious leader. Heber had hopes of converting the Swami to Christianity, but was disappointed in the meeting since he failed to do so. On 19 April Heber arrived in Bombay, to be greeted a week later by Amelia and his daughters, who had arrived by sea from Calcutta.

Heber remained in Bombay for four months, and then decided that, instead of sailing directly for Calcutta, he would visit Ceylon on the way. He arrived at Galle on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months.

===Final months===
Heber wished to pass on to the Governor General, Lord Amherst, much of what he had learned and observed on his long voyage, and on his return to Calcutta busied himself with a series of detailed reports. He also wrote to Williams-Wynn in London, strongly criticising the East India Company&#x27;s stewardship of its Indian territories. He was concerned that few Indians were promoted to senior posts, and noted the &quot;bullying, insolent manner&quot; towards Indians that was widespread amongst the Company authorities. Many local matters also demanded Heber&#x27;s attention: the next phase in the development of Bishop&#x27;s College, the preparation of a Hindustani dictionary, and a series of ordinations including that of Abdul Masih, an elderly Lutheran whose reception into Anglican orders had earlier been resisted by Bishop Middleton, on unspecified grounds

In spite of the pressures on his time, Heber set out again on 30 January 1826, this time heading south for Madras, Pondicherry, Tanjore, and ultimately Travancore. One reason for the tour was to examine the issue of caste, which persisted in Southern India. In Tanjore on Easter Day, 26 March 1826, Heber preached to more than 1300, and on the following day conducted a confirmation service for a large Tamil congregation. On 1 April he moved on to Trichinopoly where, next day, he confirmed 42 people. On 3 April, after attending an early-morning service at which he gave a blessing in the Tamil language, Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath. Immediately after plunging into the water he died, possibly from the shock of the cold water in the intense heat. Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body &quot;being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain, the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat&quot;. His funeral was held the next day at St John&#x27;s church, where he had preached his final sermon; he was buried within the church, on the north side of the altar.

==Memorials and legacy==
Although Heber&#x27;s episcopate had been brief he had made a considerable impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. Sir Charles Grey, an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta&#x27;s Chief Justice, spoke of Heber&#x27;s cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience and kindness. Flags were flown at half-mast in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered a salute of 42 guns—one for each completed year of the bishop&#x27;s life. In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments. In St John&#x27;s church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber&#x27;s death; this was in due course made much more elaborate. In St George&#x27;s church, Madras, a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock. Reflecting Heber&#x27;s interest in the training of local ordinands, further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop&#x27;s College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School.

It took four months for reports of Heber&#x27;s death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an appropriate memorial; this idea was taken over by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas. At the time of Heber&#x27;s episcopacy, Australia formed part of the Diocese of Calcutta and, following Heber&#x27;s death, a schoolhouse was erected at St Paul&#x27;s, Cobbitty, New South Wales and named the Heber Chapel. During his time in St Asaph, Heber became a good friend of the poet, Felicia Hemans, and in 1826 she published a poetic tribute &quot;To the Memory of Bishop Heber&quot; in &quot;The Asiatic Journal&quot;. Another tribute was provided by Letitia Elizabeth Landon with her poetical illustration to an engraving of a painting by H. Melville on the &quot;Death of Heber&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.


Heber was soon commemorated in print; as well as the publication of his hymns collection in 1827, the journal that he had kept during his northern India tour of 1824–25 was published in 1828 and proved a great commercial success. Less popular was the three-volume biography and letters collection that Amelia published in 1830. In the ensuing years various collections of Heber&#x27;s poetry appeared. Hughes observes that although some of the lighter verses are neat and amusing, the general quality is such that had Heber been only a poet, he would quickly have been forgotten. He achieved a more lasting niche as a hymn-writer; according to Hughes, among his hymns with enduring appeal are the Epiphany hymn &quot;Brightest and best of the sons of the morning&quot;; &quot;The Son of God Goes Forth to War&quot;, dedicated to the church&#x27;s saints and martyrs, and the Trinity Sunday hymn &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty&quot;. The last one is probably the most widely known of all Trinity hymns and owes a great deal of its popularity to John Bacchus Dykes&#x27;s tune &quot;Nicea&quot;: Watson observes that the tune&#x27;s &quot;magnificent grandeur carries the long lines effortlessly&quot;. Hughes mentions two more Heber hymns that, he says, deserve to be better known: &quot;God that madest earth and heaven&quot; and &quot;By cool Siloam&#x27;s shady rill&quot;.

Heber&#x27;s pioneering commitment to the mission fields was expressed, half a century after his death, by the author Charlotte Mary Yonge: &quot;Heber was one of the first English churchmen who perceived that to enlarge her borders and strengthen her stakes was the bounden duty of the living Church&quot;. He led through example, and through his writings which &quot;did much to spread knowledge of, and therefore interest in, the field of labour in which he died&quot;. The Anglican Church of Canada commemorates Heber on 4 April each year.

In July 1830 Amelia Heber married Count Demetrius Valsamachi, a Greek diplomat who became a British subject and was later knighted by Queen Victoria. Amelia lived until 1870. Her daughter Emily married Algernon Percy, the son of the Bishop of Carlisle, and the younger daughter Harriet married a son of Heber&#x27;s friend John Thornton.

<text>The Truman Show is a 1998 American psychological comedy-drama film written and co-produced by Andrew Niccol, and directed by Peter Weir. The film depicts the story of Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey), a man who is unaware that he is living his entire life on a colossal soundstage, and that it is being filmed and broadcast as a reality television show that has a huge international following. All of his friends, family and members of his community are paid actors whose job it is to sustain the illusion and keep Truman unaware about the false world he inhabits.

The movie&#x27;s supporting cast includes Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Delate.

Niccol&#x27;s original spec script was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Producer Scott Rudin purchased the script and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.

&quot;The Truman Show&quot; held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 1, 1998, and was released in North America on June 5. The film was a financial success, grossing $264 million worldwide, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards, and 25th Saturn Awards. &quot;The Truman Show&quot; has been analyzed as an exploration of simulated reality, existentialism, surveillance, metaphilosophy, privacy, and reality television, and described as a genre-blending work that features elements of dystopian fiction, meta fiction, psychological drama, romantic comedy, satire, and social science fiction.

== Plot ==
Selected at birth and legally adopted by a television studio following an unwanted pregnancy, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, a reality television program filmed and broadcast worldwide, 24/7, through approximately five thousand hidden cameras.

Truman&#x27;s hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous soundstage, which allows Christof, the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer, to control most aspects of Truman&#x27;s life, including the weather. Truman&#x27;s world is populated by actors and crew members who serve as his community while carefully keeping him from discovering the truth. They also earn revenue for the show through cleverly disguised product placement. To prevent Truman from escaping, Christof has orchestrated various scenarios, such as the &quot;death&quot; of Truman&#x27;s father in a boating accident to instill thalassophobia, and has the cast reinforce Truman&#x27;s anxieties with messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home.

Though the producers intend for Truman to fall in love with and marry a woman named Meryl, Truman develops feelings for Sylvia, an extra. Sympathetic to Truman&#x27;s plight, she tries to tell him the truth, but is fired and forcibly removed from the set before she can convince him. Truman eventually marries Meryl, but their relationship is stilted and passionless, and he secretly continues to imagine a life with Sylvia and dreams of traveling to Fiji, where he was told she had moved. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sylvia joins &quot;Free Truman&quot;, an activist group that calls for Truman&#x27;s liberation.

As the show approaches its thirtieth anniversary, Truman begins to notice unusual occurrences, such as a stage light falling from the sky, an isolated patch of rain that falls only over him, a radio transmission describing his movements through town, and the reappearance of his father, who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him. Inferring that the city somehow revolves around him, Truman begins questioning his life and asking who he sees as his closest confidants to help him solve the mystery.

Truman&#x27;s suspicions culminate in an attempt to escape the island, but increasingly implausible occurrences block his path. Eventually, he is caught and returned home under a flimsy pretext. There, he confronts Meryl and challenges the sincerity of their marriage. A panicked Meryl tries to change the subject with a product placement, causing Truman to snap and hold her at knifepoint. Meryl breaks character to call for help and is removed from the show.

Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father to the show under the guise of him having developed amnesia after the boating accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. One night, however, Christof discovers that Truman has begun sleeping in his basement. Disturbed by this change in behavior, Christof sends Truman&#x27;s best friend Marlon to visit and discovers that Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in the basement. Christof suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers.

Christof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to break the production&#x27;s day-night cycle to optimize the hunt. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman&#x27;s boat. Truman nearly drowns, but he continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome. Horrified, Truman looks around and finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to Truman directly, revealing the truth about the show and encouraging him to stay by claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one. Truman utters his catchphrase: &quot;In case I don&#x27;t see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night,&quot; bows to the audience, and exits. Viewers around the world celebrate Truman&#x27;s escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. The executive producers end the program with a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof devastated. After the broadcast ends, Truman&#x27;s viewers look for something else to watch.

==Production==
===Development===

Andrew Niccol completed a one-page film treatment titled &quot;The Malcolm Show&quot; in May 1991. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Niccol stated, &quot;I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It&#x27;s like when kids ask if they&#x27;re adopted.&quot; In the fall of 1993, producer Scott Rudin purchased the script for slightly over $1 million. Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute. Part of the deal called for Niccol to make his directing debut, though Paramount executives felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him. In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an A-list director, paying Niccol extra money &quot;to step aside&quot;. Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left United Talent Agency in March 1994. Directors who were considered after De Palma&#x27;s departure included Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Peter Weir signed on in early 1995, following a recommendation of Niccol. Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided to go with the more experienced Weir.

Weir wanted the film to be funnier, feeling that Niccol&#x27;s script was too dark, and declaring, &quot;where [Niccol] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.&quot; Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star, but because of commitments with &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; and &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show&#x27;s history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.

Weir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was dissatisfied with the landscapes. Sound stages at Universal Studios were reserved for the story&#x27;s setting of Seahaven before Weir&#x27;s wife Wendy Stites introduced him to Seaside, Florida, a &quot;master-planned community&quot; located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place. The scenes of Truman&#x27;s house were filmed at a residence owned by the Gaetz family, which included Florida State Senator Don Gaetz and U.S. representative Matt Gaetz. The scene at the Seahaven Nuclear Power Station was filmed outside the front entrance of the Lansing Smith Generating Plant at Lynn Haven, operated then by Gulf Power. Other scenes were shot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Norman Rockwell paintings and 1960s postcards were used as inspiration for the film&#x27;s design. Weir, Peter Biziou and Dennis Gassner researched surveillance techniques for certain shots.

===Casting===
Though Robin Williams was considered for the role of Truman, Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, citing that Carrey&#x27;s performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Gary Oldman did test footage for the role. Carrey took the role so he would be known as a multifaceted actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do &quot;The Truman Show&quot; for $12 million. Carrey also said it was the fastest that he ever accepted a role. Carrey brought his own innovations to the role, including the idea for the scene in which Truman declares &quot;this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy&quot; to the bathroom mirror.

The film started production with Dennis Hopper in the role of Christof, but he left in April 1997 soon after filming began. Hopper later stated that he was fired after two days because Weir and producer Scott Rudin had made a deal that if they did not both approve of Hopper&#x27;s performance, they would replace him. A number of other actors turned down the role after Hopper&#x27;s departure, until Ed Harris agreed to step in. Harris later stated that he pitched the notion of making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.

After Laura Linney was hired to play the actress pretending to be Meryl, Truman&#x27;s wife, she studied Sears catalogs from the 1950s to develop her character&#x27;s poses.

===Filming===
Filming took place from December 9, 1996, to April 21, 1997. Its overall look was influenced by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyes wide open, and the interior scenes are heavily lit because Weir wanted to remind viewers that &quot;in this world, everything was for sale&quot;. Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make because 1997 was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer-generated imagery (CGI). CGI was used to create the upper halves of some of the larger buildings in the film&#x27;s downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;The Truman Show: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; was composed by Burkhard Dallwitz. Dallwitz was hired after Peter Weir received a tape of his work while in Australia for the post-production. Some parts of the soundtrack were composed by Philip Glass. Philip Glass also appears in the film playing his composition &quot;Truman Sleeps&quot;.

Also featured are Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s second movement (&quot;Romanze-Larghetto&quot;) from his First Piano Concerto, performed by the &quot;New Symphony Orchestra of London&quot; under the direction of Stanisław Skrowaczewski with pianist Artur Rubinstein; Wojciech Kilar&#x27;s &quot;Father Kolbe&#x27;s Preaching&quot; performed by the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra; as well as the song &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; performed by rockabilly band The Big Six.

Although not included on the soundtrack CD, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Rondo alla turca&quot; from his Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, performed by Wilhelm Kempff, and his Horn Concerto No. 1, performed by the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra; plus &quot;Love Is Just Around the Corner&quot; by Jackie Davis were also featured in the film.

==Themes==

===Media===

Ronald Bishop&#x27;s paper in the &quot;Journal of Communication Inquiry&quot; suggested &quot;The Truman Show&quot; showcased the power of the media. Truman&#x27;s life inspires audiences around the world, meaning their lives are controlled by his. Bishop commented, &quot;In the end, the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged. In the spirit of Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s concept of hegemony, these films and television programs co-opt our enchantment (and disenchantment) with the media and sell it back to us.&quot;

Journalist Erik Sofge surmised that the film&#x27;s story reflects the falseness of reality television. &quot;Truman simply lives, and the show&#x27;s popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot;, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real.&quot; Weir declared, &quot;There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we&#x27;re giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging.&quot;

In her essay &quot;Reading &quot;The Truman Show&quot; inside out&quot;, Simone Knox argues that the film itself tries to blur the objective perspective and the show-within-the-film. Knox also draws a floor plan of the camera angles of the first scene.

===Psychoanalytic interpretation===
An essay published in the &quot;International Journal of Psychoanalysis&quot; analyzed Truman as

For the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, its official poster pays homage to the film and its final scene with their website stating that &quot;Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol&#x27;s &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998) is a modern reflection of Plato&#x27;s cave and the decisive scene urges viewers to not only experience the border between reality and its representation but to ponder the power of fiction, between manipulation and catharsis.&quot;

===Similarity to &quot;Utopia&quot;===
Parallels can be drawn from Thomas More&#x27;s 1516 book &quot;Utopia&quot;, in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to &quot;The Truman Show&quot; because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; and real-life groups such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community. It is clear that the people in Truman&#x27;s world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban &quot;picket fence&quot; appearance of the show&#x27;s set is reminiscent of the &quot;American Dream&quot; of the 1950s. The &quot;American Dream&quot; concept in Truman&#x27;s world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.

=== Gnostic ===

Truman Show is a gnostic movie, with its symbolism and Truman exiting the world clearly showing in the woodcut Flammarion engraving, exiting the world. Slowly, Truman realises the truth and he, like the figure in the Flammarion Engraving, explores the artificial seam between the sky and the sea, wondering what might lie beyond the torn canvas.   

==Release==
Originally set for August 8, 1997, the film&#x27;s theatrical release was pushed back initially to November 14, 1997, and then to the summer of 1998. NBC purchased broadcast rights in December 1997, roughly eight months before the film&#x27;s release. In March 2000, Turner Broadcasting System purchased the rights, and now airs the film on TBS.

=== Home media ===
Paramount Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on January 12, 1999, followed by DVD on January 26 that same year, and a &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-release on August 23, 2005. It was later released on Blu-ray on December 30, 2008. An Ultra HD Blu-ray was released on July 4, 2023, in celebration of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
&quot;The Truman Show&quot; grossed $125.6million domestically (United States and Canada) and $138.5million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $264.1million, against a budget of $60million. It spent its first two weeks as No.1 at the domestic box office, and its first seven weeks in the Top10.

===Critical response===

Giving the film a perfect four star score, Roger Ebert compared it to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, claiming that the film had the right balance of comedy and drama. He was also impressed with Jim Carrey&#x27;s dramatic performance. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Truman Show&quot; is emotionally involving without losing the ability to raise sharp satiric questions as well as get numerous laughs. The rare film that is disturbing despite working beautifully within standard industry norms.&quot; He would name it the best movie of 1998. In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Truman one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.

James Berardinelli liked the film&#x27;s approach of &quot;not being the casual summer blockbuster with special effects&quot;, and he likened Carrey&#x27;s &quot;[charismatic], understated and effective&quot; performance to those of Tom Hanks and James Stewart. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;Undeniably provocative and reasonably entertaining, &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is one of those high-concept movies whose concept is both clever and dumb.&quot; Tom Meek of &quot;Film Threat&quot; said the film was not funny enough but still found &quot;something rewarding in its quirky demeanor&quot;.

===Accolades===
== Legacy ==
In the decades since its release, the film&#x27;s exploration of surveillance and manufactured reality has been described as &quot;prescient&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; named &quot;The Truman Show&quot; as one of the 10 most prophetic science fiction films. In 2023, ACMI chronicled the modern societal developments that were predicted in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, with writer Anthony Frajman noting &quot;it foretold the rise of reality TV, mass surveillance, social media, influencer marketing and our increasing obsession with celebrity,&quot; along with &quot;the 24-hour news cycle, product placement, parasocial relationships, the merging of entertainment and news.&quot; Journalist Erik Sofje deemed it an eerie coincidence that &quot;Big Brother&quot; made its debut a year after the film&#x27;s release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;: &quot;Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show&#x27;s central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.&quot;

The film&#x27;s set design and setting of Seahaven served as inspiration for future films with similar themes. Director Greta Gerwig consulted Weir for the inspiration for Barbie Land in the 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot;, with the idea of creating it as an &quot;interior soundstage world&quot; reminiscent of Seahaven in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. Director Jon M. Chu cited how &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and its setting influenced the thematic portrayal of the Land of Oz in the 2024 film &quot;Wicked&quot;, saying, &quot;It helps create this idea of the rebelliousness that this new younger generation are discovering ... You start to see the truth about things that maybe you were taught differently.&quot;

===&quot;The Truman Show&quot; delusion===

Joel Gold, a psychiatrist at the Bellevue Hospital Center, revealed that by 2008, he had met five patients with schizophrenia (and had heard of another twelve) who believed their lives were reality television shows. Gold named the syndrome &quot;The Truman Show delusion&quot; after the film and attributed the delusion to a world that had become hungry for publicity. Gold stated that some patients were rendered happy by their disease, while &quot;others were tormented&quot;. One traveled to New York to check whether the World Trade Center had actually fallen—believing the 9/11 attacks to be an elaborate plot twist in his personal storyline. Another came to climb the Statue of Liberty, believing that he would be reunited with his high school girlfriend at the top and finally be released from the show.

In August 2008, the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; reported similar cases in the United Kingdom. The delusion has informally been referred to as &quot;Truman syndrome&quot;, according to an Associated Press story from 2008.

After hearing about the condition, Andrew Niccol said: &quot;You know you&#x27;ve made it when you have a disease named after you.&quot;

<text>Calw is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Karlsruhe, Enz, the district-free city Pforzheim, Böblingen, Freudenstadt and Rastatt.

== History ==
The district was created in 1938, when the &quot;Oberamt Calw&quot; together with the neighboring Neuenbürg und Nagold were merged into a district. During the communal reform in 1973 the district at first was planned to be dissolved and its municipalities split to neighboring district. However it already had the right size and population which was planned for the newly created districts, and thus this plan was abandoned. But some changes in the outline of the districts happened - 15 municipalities of the district changed to the neighboring districts Enz, Rastatt and Böblingen, and in return it gained 6 municipalities from the districts Freudenstadt and the dissolved district Horb.

== Geography ==
The district belongs to the northern part of the Black Forest mountains. The main rivers are the Nagold and the Enz.

==Partnerships==
Since 1991 the district has partnership with the district Freiberg in Saxony.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms, which is nearly identical to the coat of arms of the city Calw, shows the lion of the Counts of Calw on top of three mountains. The three mountains represent the three former counties over which the Counts of Calw once reigned, namely Calw, Löwenstein and Vaihingen. (The latter two cities are not part of the present-day district of Calw) The fountain in the bottom represents the springs and spas in the district.

<doc id="232715" wikidata="Q1758553" url="?curid=232715" title="Contraband">
<text>Contraband (from Medieval French &quot;contrebande&quot; &quot;smuggling&quot;) is any item that, relating to its nature, is illegal to be possessed or sold. It comprises goods that by their nature are considered too dangerous or offensive in the eyes of the legislator—termed contraband &quot;in se&quot;—and forbidden.

Derivative contraband consists of goods that may normally be owned, but are liable to be seized because they were used in committing an unlawful act and hence begot illegally, e.g. smuggling goods; stolen goods – knowingly participating in their trade is an offense in itself, called fencing.

==Law of armed conflict==

In international law, contraband means goods that are ultimately destined for territory under the control of the enemy and may be susceptible for use in armed conflict. Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, absolute contraband and conditional contraband. The former category includes arms, munitions, and various materials, such as chemicals and certain types of machinery that may be used directly to wage war or be converted into instruments of war.

Conditional contraband, formerly known as occasional contraband, consists of such materials as provisions and livestock feed. Cargo of that kind, presumably innocent in character, is subject to seizure if in the opinion of the belligerent nation that seizes them, the supplies are destined for the armed forces of the enemy rather than for civilian use and consumption. In former agreements among nations, certain other commodities, including soap, paper, clocks, agricultural machinery and jewelry, have been classified as non-contraband, but the distinctions have proved meaningless in practice.

Under the conditions of modern warfare, in which armed conflict has largely become a struggle involving the total populations of the contending powers, virtually all commodities are classified by belligerents as absolute contraband.

===American Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Confederate-owned slaves who sought refuge in Union military camps or who lived in territories that fell under Union control were declared &quot;contraband of war&quot;. The policy was first articulated by General Benjamin F. Butler in 1861, in what came to be known as the &quot;Fort Monroe Doctrine,&quot; established in Hampton, Virginia. By war&#x27;s end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the South, and the Roanoke Island Freedmen&#x27;s Colony (1863–1867) was developed to be a self-sustaining colony. Many adult freedmen worked for wages for the Army at such camps, teachers were recruited from the North for their schools by the American Missionary Association, and thousands of freedmen enlisted from such camps in the United States Colored Troops to fight with the Union against the Confederacy.

===Treaties===
Numerous treaties defining contraband have been concluded among nations. In time of war, the nations involved have invariably violated the agreements, formulating their own definitions as the fortunes of war indicated. The Declaration of London, drafted at the London Naval Conference of 1908–1909 and made partly effective by most of the European maritime nations at the outbreak of World War I, established comprehensive classifications of absolute and conditional contraband. As the war developed, the lists of articles in each category were constantly revised by the various belligerents despite protests by neutral powers engaged in the carrying trade. By 1916, the list of conditional contraband included practically all waterborne cargo. Thereafter, for the duration of World War I, nearly all cargo in transit to an enemy nation was treated as contraband of war by the intercepting belligerent, regardless of the nature of the cargo. A similar policy was inaugurated by the belligerent powers early in World War II.

===Neutral nations===
Under international law, the citizens of neutral nations are entitled to trade, at their own risk, with any or all powers engaged in war. No duty to restrain contraband trade is imposed on the neutral governments, but no neutral government has the right to interfere on behalf of citizens whose property is seized by one belligerent if it is in transit to another. The penalty traditionally imposed by belligerents on neutral carriers engaged in commercial traffic with the enemy consists of confiscation of cargo. By the Declaration of London, it was extended to include condemnation of the carrying vessel if more than half the cargo was contraband. The right of warring nations to sink neutral ships transporting contraband is not recognized in international law, but the practice was initiated by Germany in World War I and was often resorted to by the Axis powers in World War II.

<doc id="232719" wikidata="Q3025570" url="?curid=232719" title="Pigmeat Markham">
<text>Dewey &quot;Pigmeat&quot; Markham (April 18, 1904 – December 13, 1981) was an African American entertainer. Though best known as a comedian, Markham was also a singer, dancer, and actor. His nickname came from a stage routine, in which he declared himself to be &quot;Sweet Poppa Pigmeat&quot;. He was sometimes credited in films as Pigmeat &quot;Alamo&quot; Markham.

He is also known for his 1968 single &quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot;, which is often considered to be the earliest hip hop record.

==Early life and career==
Markham was born in Durham, North Carolina. His family was the most prominent on their street, which came to be called (and later officially named) Markham Street in the Hayti District. Markham began his career in traveling music and burlesque shows. For a time he was a member of Bessie Smith&#x27;s Traveling Revue in the 1920s. Later, he claimed he originated the &quot;Truckin&#x27; &quot;dance which became nationally popular at the start of the 1930s. In the 1940s he started making film appearances. In 1946 he recorded &quot;Open the Door, Richard&quot;.

Markham was a familiar act at New York&#x27;s famed Apollo Theater where he wore blackface makeup and huge painted white lips, despite complaints the vaudeville tradition was degrading. The book &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; suggests, &quot;He probably played the Apollo more often than any other performer.&quot;
Starting in the 1950s Pigmeat Markham began appearing on television, making multiple appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

His boisterous, indecorous &quot;heyeah (here) come da judge&quot; schtick, which made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette, became his signature routine. Markham would sit at an elevated judge&#x27;s bench (often in a black graduation cap-and-gown, to look more impressive), and deal with a series of comic miscreants. He would often deliver his &quot;judgments&quot;, as well as express frustration with the accused, by leaning over the bench and smacking the accused with an inflated bladder-balloon. He had hit comedy recordings in the 1960s on Chess Records, and saw his routine&#x27;s entry line become a catchphrase on the &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; NBC television show, as did his phrase &quot;Look that up in your Funk &amp; Wagnalls.&quot;

Markham&#x27;s most famous routine was &quot;discovered&quot; by the general public only after Sammy Davis Jr. had performed it as a guest on the March 25, 1968 episode of &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. Due to the years of racial segregation in the U.S. entertainment industry, he was not widely known by White audiences, and had almost exclusively performed on the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot; of vaudeville, theatres, and night clubs and appeared in several race films, including William D. Alexander&#x27;s 1949 revue film &quot;Burlesque in Harlem&quot;, which documented the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit.

The phenomenal ripple effect of Davis&#x27;s version of &quot;the judge&quot; led to Markham&#x27;s opportunity to perform his signature Judge character himself as a &quot;Laugh-In&quot; regular during the 1968–69 television season. Archie Campbell later adapted Markham&#x27;s routine, performing as &quot;Justus O&#x27;Peace,&quot; on the country version of &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, which borrowed heavily from the minstrel show tradition.

Thanks to his &quot;Heyeah come da judge&quot; routine, which originally was accompanied by music with a funky beat, Pigmeat Markham is regarded as a forerunner of rap. His song &quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot; peaked at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; and other charts in 1968. He published an autobiography, &quot;Here Come the Judge!&quot;, in the wake of his &quot;Laugh-In&quot; success.

The song &quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot; was prominently sampled by Big Audio Dynamite II in the song &quot;Rush&quot;.

==Death==
Markham died of a stroke at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx at the age of 77. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

<text>Charles Albert Fechter (23 October 1824 – 5 August 1879) was an Anglo-French actor.

==Biography==

Fechter was born, probably in London, of French parents, although his mother was of Piedmontese and his father of German extraction.

As a boy he had ambitions to be a sculptor but discovered his talent while appearing in some private theatricals. In 1841 he joined a travelling company that was going to Italy. The tour was a failure, and the company broke up; Fechter returned home and resumed the study of sculpture. At the same time he attended classes at the Conservatoire with the view of gaining admission to the Comédie-Française. Late in 1844 he won the grand medal of the Académie des Beaux-Arts with a piece of sculpture, and made his debut at the Comédie-Française as Seide in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot; and Valère in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. He acquitted himself with credit; but, tired of the small parts he found himself condemned to play, returned again to his sculptor&#x27;s studio in 1846.

In the same year he was invited to appear with a French company in Berlin, where he made his first decisive success as an actor. On his return to Paris in the following year he married the actress Eléonore Rabut (d. 1895). Previously he had appeared for some months in London, in a season of French classical plays given at the St James&#x27;s Theatre. In Paris for the next ten years he fulfilled a series of successful engagements at various theatres, his chief triumph being his creation at the Vaudeville on 2 February 1852 of the part of Armand Duval in &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot;. For nearly two years (1857–1858) Fechter was manager of the Odéon, where he produced &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and other classical plays.

Having received tempting offers to act in English at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London, he made a diligent study of the English language, and appeared there on 27 October 1860 in an English version of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; and &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot;; and on 20 March 1861, he attempted &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the first time. The result was an extraordinary triumph, the play running for 115 nights. This was followed by &quot;Othello&quot;, in which he played alternately the Moor and Iago. In 1863 he leased the Lyceum Theatre, where he opened with &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Motto&quot;; this was followed by &quot;The King&#x27;s Butterfly&quot;, &quot;The Mountebank&quot; (in which his son Paul, a boy of seven, appeared), &quot;The Roadside Inn&quot;, &quot;The Master of Ravenswood&quot;, &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (in the original French version, in which he had created the parts of Louis and Fabian dei Franchi) and &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot;.

After this he appeared at the Adelphi Theatre (1868) as Obenreizer in &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot;, by Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins, as Edmond Dantes in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, and as Count de Leyrac in &quot;Black and White&quot;, a play in which the actor himself collaborated with Wilkie Collins.

In 1870 he visited the United States, where (with the exception of a visit to London in 1872) he remained till his death. He played in the United States between 1870 and 1876 in most of the parts in which he had won his chief triumphs in Britain. His first appearance in New York was at Niblo&#x27;s Garden in the title role of Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; in January 1870. He leased the Globe Theatre at 730 Broadway in September 1870. The experiment was brief. Fechter&#x27;s imperious temper, aggravated by indulgence in drink, involved him in private quarrels and in discussions in the press, and he left in January 1871. He then had the same experiences at the old French theatre, renamed the Lyceum Theatre that year, and also in Boston.

He then went into a brief partnership with William Stuart at the newly completed New Park Theatre in April 1874. It had been built by Stuart and Dion Boucicault, who pulled out just before the opening. Fechter acted in his own &quot;Love&#x27;s Penance&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Le médecin des enfants&quot; by le Comte d&#x27;Avrigny. The play flopped, and Fechter retired to a farm which he had bought in the little village of Richland Centre, Bucks County, near Quakertown. The last three years of his life were spent in seclusion with his second wife, Lizzie Price, and his dogs on the farm, where he died. He was interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

A bust of the actor by himself is in the Garrick Club, London.

==Family life==
He married, 29 November 1847, Mlle Charlotte Eléonore Rabut (1819-1894), a pensionnaire of the Comédie Française, Paris, by whom he had a son, Paul, and a daughter, Marie, who became an operatic singer. From 1850 to April 1855, he had a love affair with the famous actress Pauline Virginie Déjazet (1798-1875).

<text>Joseph Autran (20 June 1813 – 6 March 1877) was a French poet.

==Biography==
Autran was born in Marseille. In 1832 he addressed an ode to Alphonse de Lamartine, who was then at Marseille on his way to the East. Lamartine persuaded the young man&#x27;s father to allow him to follow his poetic instinct, and Autran became Lamartine&#x27;s faithful disciple from then on.

His best known work is &quot;La Mer&quot; (1835), remodelled in 1852 as &quot;Les Poèmes de la mer&quot;. &quot;Ludibria ventis&quot; (1838) followed, and the success of these two volumes gained for Autran the librarianship of his native town.

In 1844/5 Franz Liszt, who met Autran in Marseille in 1844, set four of his poems, &quot;La terre&quot;, &quot;Les aquilons&quot;, &quot;Les flots&quot; and &quot;Les astres&quot;, for choir and piano as a cycle, &quot;Les quatre élémens&quot;.

Autran&#x27;s other important work is his &quot;Vie rurale&quot; (1856), a series of pictures of peasant life. The Algerian campaigns inspired him with verses in honour of the common soldier. &quot;Milianah&quot; (1842) describes the heroic defence of that town, and in the same vein is his &quot;Laboureurs et soldats&quot; (1854).

Among his other works are the &quot;Paroles de Salomon&quot; (1868), &quot;Épîtres rustiques&quot; (1861), &quot;Sonnets capricieux&quot;, and a tragedy played with great success at the Odéon in 1848, &quot;La Fille d&#x27;Eschyle&quot;. A definitive edition of his works was brought out between 1875 and 1881.

He became a member of the Académie française in 1868, and died at Marseille nine years later.

<text>Funk &amp; Wagnalls was an American publisher known for its reference works, including &quot;A Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1st ed. 1893–5), and the &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia&quot; (25 volumes, 1st ed. 1912).

The encyclopedia was renamed &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Encyclopedia&quot; in 1931 and in 1945, it was known as &quot;New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Universal Standard Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Reference Encyclopedia&quot;, and &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia&quot; (29 volumes, 1st ed. 1971).

The last printing of &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia&quot; was in 1997. , annual Yearbooks are still in production.

The I.K. Funk &amp; Company, founded in 1875, was renamed Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company after two years, and later became Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc., then Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation.

==History==

Isaac Kaufmann Funk founded the business in 1875 as I.K. Funk &amp; Company. In 1877, Adam Willis Wagnalls, one of Funk&#x27;s classmates at Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University), joined the firm as a partner and the name of the firm was changed to Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company.

During its early years, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company published religious books. The publication of &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; in 1890 marked a shift to publishing of general reference dictionaries and encyclopedias. The firm published &quot;The Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot; () in 2 volumes in 1893 and 1895, and &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia&quot; () in 1912.

In 1913, the &quot;New Standard Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was published under the supervision of Isaac K. Funk (Editor-in-Chief). The &quot;New Standard Unabridged Dictionary&quot; was revised until 1943, a later edition that was also supervised by Charles Earl Funk.

The encyclopedia was based upon &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;:
&quot;Especially are we indebted to the famous &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; ... With its publishers we have arranged to draw upon its stores as freely as we have found it of advantage so to do.&quot;

Wilfred J. Funk, the son of Isaac Funk, was president of the company from 1925 to 1940.

In 1934, Funk &amp; Wagnalls started the Literary Digest Books imprint. It launched with seven titles with up to twenty-five a year intended. The imprint lasted into mid-1935.

Unicorn Press (later known as the Standard Reference Work Publishing Co.) obtained the rights to publish the encyclopedia, and by 1953 that firm began to sell the encyclopedia through a supermarket continuity marketing campaign, encouraging consumers to include the latest volume of the encyclopedia on their shopping lists. Grocery stores in the 1970s in the Midwest (Chicago – Jewel Grocers) typically kept about four volumes in a rotation, dropping the last and adding the latest until all volumes could be acquired with the initial first volume being 99 cents. The first several volumes were gold painted along the edges and the later volumes were not. A volume was typically priced at $2.99, but toward the later volumes the price had increased with the inflation of the 1970s. If one did not go shopping on a weekly basis, or delivery was spotty, there was a good chance that a volume might be missed to complete the set. The encyclopedia was also sold as a mail order set of 36(?) volumes; one volume a month.

Also sold in grocery stores, one volume at a time, was the &quot;Family Library Of Great Music&quot;, a 22-album series of classical recordings. One famous composer was highlighted in each release. The records were manufactured exclusively for Funk &amp; Wagnalls by RCA Custom.

In 1965, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. was sold to &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

In 1971, the company, now Funk and Wagnalls, Incorporated, was sold to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Dun and Bradstreet retained &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia&quot;, but other reference works were relinquished to other publishers.

In 1984, Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Inc., to a group of Funk &amp; Wagnalls executives, who in turn sold it to Field Corporation in 1988.

In 1991, the company was sold to K-III Holdings, Inc, and then in 1993 Funk &amp; Wagnalls Corporation acquired the &quot;World Almanac&quot;.

After failing to purchase rights to the text of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; for its &quot;Encarta&quot; digital encyclopedia, Microsoft reluctantly used (under license) the text of Funk &amp; Wagnalls encyclopedia for the first editions of its encyclopedia. This licensed text was gradually replaced over the following years with content Microsoft created itself.

In 1998, as part of the Information division of Primedia Inc. (the renamed K-III), the encyclopedia content appeared on the Web site &quot;funkandwagnalls.com&quot;. This short-lived venture was shut down in 2001.

Ripplewood Holdings bought Primedia&#x27;s education division in 1999, which became part of Reader&#x27;s Digest Association in 2007. In 2009, Funk &amp; Wagnalls was acquired by &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
During certain scenes of banter between Dan Rowan and Dick Martin on the NBC comedy-variety show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, after a particular anecdote of trivia or wisdom, Dick Martin would close with: &quot;Look &quot;that&quot; up in your Funk &amp; Wagnalls!&quot; Sales of the dictionary reportedly increased by 30% as a result of this recurring joke.
On &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, sidekick Ed McMahon would begin each &quot;Carnac the Magnificent&quot; sketch by explaining that the envelopes he would hand to Johnny Carson (in character as &quot;Carnac&quot;) had been: &quot;...hermetically sealed in a mayonnaise jar on Funk and Wagnall&#x27;s porch since noon today!&quot; The envelopes contained questions, to which &quot;Carnac&quot; would divine the answers by reading a script on his desk.

In an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; (Season 7, Episode 1) entitled &quot;Cancelled&quot;, the character Eric Cartman is quoted as saying to his friends Stan, Kyle, and Kenny &quot;What the Funk &amp; Wagnalls are you guys talking about?&quot;, as the other boys are discussing a past memory of aliens abducting Cartman, which was a reference to the show&#x27;s pilot episode.

In season 1, episode 21 of &quot;West Wing&quot;, the character of C.J. tells the character of Toby, &quot;Thank you, Funk and Wagnall&#x27;s.&quot; Which Toby turns to another character Ginger as they are walking away from C.J., &quot;What&#x27;d she call me?&quot;. Ginger replies, &quot;Funk and Wagnall&#x27;s. They make the dictionary.&quot; Toby replies, &quot;I know who Funk and Wagnall&#x27;s are.&quot;

<doc id="232729" wikidata="Q1491640" url="?curid=232729" title="Galactic Civilizations">
<text>Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of an OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled &quot;Altarian Prophecy&quot; was released in 2004. A sequel, &quot;Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords&quot;, was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015, Stardock released &quot;Galactic Civilizations III&quot;. On April 26, 2022, Stardock released &quot;Galactic Civilizations IV&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The goal of the game is to eventually dominate the galaxy. It is possible to achieve victory through war, cultural domination, diplomacy or by developing overwhelming advanced technology.

===Story===
The game is set in the future. Humankind has made contact with the 5 other major alien races. Space travel is risky and expensive, requiring huge jump gates which only permit travel between two specific points. Because space travel is so difficult, the galaxy remains mostly uncolonized. The humans make a great discovery—hyperdrive. It permits fast travel between any two stars. The humans share their discovery with the other five major races. All communication stops. The humans consider that sharing their discovery may have been a mistake. Now that the galaxy is open for exploration, there&#x27;s going to be a rush to claim all the uncolonized worlds.

==Development==

&quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; was first developed for OS/2 in April 1993 by Brad Wardell. Although revenue from the initial OS/2 release was never paid by the bankrupt publisher, popular support encouraged Stardock to release &quot;Shipyards&quot;, an add-on pack that allowed users to design their own starships, and this provided enough revenue to support further development, with a simplified version being sold to IBM in 1995 as &quot;Star Emperor&quot;. The game sold above 30,000 units for OS/2.

&quot;Galactic Civilizations II&quot; was released later that year, adding several new concepts and tweaks. It was followed by another version of &quot;Shipyards&quot; (which added both the ship design feature and improved governors/AI), and an expansion pack in April 1997, before Stardock was forced to withdraw from significant OS/2 development with the loss of their market. It is possible to run OS/2 versions of the game under emulation using Virtual PC.

==Expansion pack==
An expansion pack, called Galactic Civilizations: Altarian Prophecy, was released in 2004.

==Reception==
===&quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot;===
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. By December 2005, the game had sold 75,000 copies, which &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Bruce Geryk called &quot;impressive&quot; for its genre. According to writer Greg Costikyan, the game&#x27;s sales had surpassed 100,000 units by 2008.

&quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; was named the ninth-best computer game of 2003 by &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;, and it won the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best AI&quot; award, tying with &quot;&quot;. A writer for the magazine called it &quot;the sort of game that will still be on your hard drive when all the other games you are playing right now are gathering dust on a shelf.&quot; The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; for their 2003 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic&quot;. They wrote that they &quot;found it impossible to ignore the [game&#x27;s] almost overwhelming depth of strategy&quot;.

===&quot;Altarian Prophecy&quot;===
The &quot;Altarian Prophecy&quot; expansion pack received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, although slightly less than the original, according to Metacritic.

<text>Promises is a 2001 documentary film that examines the Israeli–Palestinian conflict from the perspectives of seven children living in the Palestinian communities in the West Bank and Israeli neighborhoods of Jerusalem. &quot;Promises&quot; has been shown at many film festivals and received excellent reviews and many accolades.

The film follows Israeli-American filmmaker B.Z. Goldberg as he meets with seven Palestinian and Israeli children between the ages of nine and thirteen, seeing the Middle East conflict through their eyes. It allows &quot;ordinary&quot; kids to develop natural bonds of affection by simply playing games with each other, bonds which go beyond the clutter of prejudices that they have heard from their parents and others around them.

==Production==
&quot;Promises&quot; was shot between 1997 and 2000 and was produced in association with the Independent Television Service with partial funding provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The film has a running time of 106 minutes, and includes Arabic, Hebrew and English dialogue with English subtitles. After its theatrical run, an abridged version aired as an episode of the PBS series &quot;POV&quot;.

In 2004 the filmmakers&#x27; produced a follow-up program called &quot;Promises: Four Years On,&quot; which features interviews and updates on the children&#x27;s current lives. It lasts 25 minutes and is included as a special feature on the film&#x27;s DVD release.

==The children==
* Daniel and Yarko: Israeli boys living in west Jerusalem, secular Jews, put off more by religious Jews than Palestinians; grandsons of Holocaust survivor
* Shlomo: Jewish quarter in Jerusalem, Orthodox, son of a rabbi from Jerusalem
* Moishe: lives in Beit-El in the West-Bank, dislikes the Arabs.
* Faraj: lives in the Deheishe refugee camp in the West Bank, Palestinian; son of Palestinian refugees
* Mahmoud: Palestinian quarter in East Jerusalem; son of a merchant in the Muslim quarter of the Old City
* Sanabel: Palestinian lives also in the Deheishe refuge camp, father is in prison because he was affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Her brother died from heatstroke, he was also in prison.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Promises&quot; has an approval rating of 96% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 47 reviews, and an average rating of 7.81/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A heartbreaking and illuminating look at the Israeli and Palestinian conflict through the eyes of children&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<text>The crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), also known as the krill-eater seal, is a true seal with a circumpolar distribution around the coast of Antarctica. They are the only member of the genus Lobodon. They are medium- to large-sized (over 2 m in length), relatively slender and pale-colored, found primarily on the free-floating pack ice that extends seasonally out from the Antarctic coast, which they use as a platform for resting, mating, social aggregation and accessing their prey. They are by far the most abundant seal species in the world. While population estimates are uncertain, there are at least 7 million and possibly as many as 75 million individuals. This success of this species is due to its specialized predation on the abundant Antarctic krill of the Southern Ocean, for which it has uniquely adapted, sieve-like tooth structure. Indeed, its scientific name, translated as &quot;lobe-toothed (&quot;lobodon&quot;) crab eater (&quot;carcinophaga&quot;)&quot;, refers specifically to the finely lobed teeth adapted to filtering their small crustacean prey. 

Despite its name, the crabeater seal does not eat crabs. 

As well as being an important krill predator, the crabeater seal&#x27;s pups are an important component of the diet of leopard seals (&quot;H. leptonyx&quot;).

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The genus name of the crabeater seal, &quot;Lobodon&quot;, derives from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;lobe-toothed&quot;, and the species name &quot;carcinophaga&quot; means &quot;crab eater.&quot; The crabeater seal shares a common recent ancestor with the other Antarctic seals, which are together known as the lobodontine seals. These include the leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;), the Ross seal (&quot;Ommatophoca rossii&quot;), and the Weddell seal (&quot;Leptonychotes weddelli&quot;). These species, collectively belonging to the Lobodontini tribe of seals, share teeth adaptations including lobes and cusps useful for straining smaller prey items out of the water column. The ancestral Lobodontini likely diverged from their sister clade, the Mirounga (elephant seals) in the late Miocene to early Pliocene, when they migrated southward and diversified rapidly in the relative isolation around Antarctica.

==Description==

Adult seals (over five years old) grow to an average length of and an average weight of around . Females are on average longer and around heavier than males, though their weights fluctuate substantially according to season; females can lose up to 50% of their body weight during lactation, and males lose a significant proportion of weight as they attend to their mating partners and fight off rivals. During summer, males typically weigh , and females . A molecular genetic based technique has been established to confirm the sex of individuals in the laboratory. Large crabeater seals can weigh up to . Pups are about in length and at birth. While nursing, pups grow at a rate of about a day, and grow to be around when they are weaned at two or three weeks.

These seals are covered mostly by brown or silver fur, with darker coloration around flippers. The color fades throughout the year, and recently molted seals appear darker than the silvery-white crabeater seals that are about to molt. Their body is comparatively more slender than other seals, and the snout is pointed. Crabeater seals can raise their heads and arch their backs while on ice, and they are able to move quickly if not subject to overheating. Crabeater seals exhibit scarring either from leopard seal attacks around the flippers or, for males, during the breeding season while fighting for mates around the throat and jaw. Pups are born with a light brown, downy pelage (lanugo), until the first molt at weaning. Younger animals are marked by net-like, chocolate brown markings and flecks on the shoulders, sides and flanks, shading into the predominantly dark hind and fore flippers and head, often due to scarring from leopard seals. After molting, their fur is a darker brown fading to blonde on their bellies. The fur lightens throughout the year, becoming completely blonde in summer.

Crabeaters have relatively slender bodies and long skulls and snouts compared to other phocids. Perhaps their most distinctive adaptation is the unique dentition that enables this species to sieve Antarctic krill. The postcanine teeth are finely divided with multiple cusps. Together with the tight fit of the upper and lower jaw, a bony protuberance near the back of the mouth completes a near-perfect sieve within which krill are trapped.

==Distribution and population==
Crabeater seals have a continuous circumpolar distribution surrounding Antarctica, with only occasional sightings or strandings in the extreme southern coasts of Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. They spend the entire year on the pack ice zone as it advances and retreats seasonally, primarily staying within the continental shelf area in waters less than deep. They colonized Antarctica during the late Miocene or early Pliocene (15–25 million years ago), at a time when the region was much warmer than today. The population is connected and fairly well mixed (panmictic), and genetic evidence does not suggest any subspecies separations. A genetic survey did not detect evidence of a recent, sustained genetic bottleneck in this species, which suggests that populations do not appear to have suffered a substantial and sustained decline in the recent past.

Currently, no reliable estimates of the total crabeater seal population are available. Past estimates relied on minimal opportunistic sighting and much speculation, ranging from 2 million to 50–75 million individuals. Genetic evidence suggests that crabeater population numbers may have increased during the Pleistocene. The most recent point estimate is 7 million individuals, but this, too, is considered a likely underestimate. An international effort, the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal initiative, is currently underway to evaluate systematically collected survey data and obtain reliable estimates of all Antarctic seal abundances.

==Behavior==

Crabeater seals have a typical, serpentine gait when on ice or land, combining retractions of the foreflippers with undulations of the lumbar region. This method of locomotion leaves a distinctive sinuous body track and can be extremely effective. When not subject to overheating (i.e. on cold days), speeds on land of have been recorded for short distances. Satellite tracking data have resulted in conservative estimates of swimming speeds of 66 km/day and 12.7 km/h. While swimming, crabeaters have been known to engage in porpoising (leaping entirely out of the water) and spyhopping (raising the body vertically out of the water for visual inspection) behaviors.

The most gregarious of the Antarctic seals, crabeaters have been observed on the ice in aggregations of up to 1,000 hauled out animals and in swimming groups of several hundred individuals, breathing and diving almost synchronously. These aggregations consist primarily of younger animals. Adults are more typically encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water.

Crabeater seals give birth during the Antarctic spring from September to December. Rather than aggregate in reproductive rookeries, females haul out on ice to give birth singly. Adult males attend female-pup pairs until the female begins estrus one to two weeks after the pup is weaned before mating. Copulation has not been observed directly and presumably occurs in water. Pups are weaned in about three weeks, at which time they are also beginning to molt into a subadult coat similar to the adult pelage.

Curiously, crabeater seals have been known to wander further inland than any other pinniped. Carcasses have been found over from the water and over above sea level, where they can be mummified in the dry, cold air and conserved for centuries.
==Ecology==

===Diet===

Despite the common name of the species, the crabeater seal does not feed on crabs (the few crab species in its range are mostly found in very deep water). Rather, it is a specialist predator on Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;), which comprise over 90% of the diet. Their high abundance is a testament to the extreme success of Antarctic krill, the single species with the greatest biomass on the planet. There is little seasonality in their prey preference, but they may target adult and male krill. Other prey items include cephalopods and diverse Antarctic fish species. Although the crabeater seal is sympatric with the other Antarctic seal species (Weddell, Ross and leopard seals), the specialization on krill minimizes interspecific food competition. Among krill-feeding whales, only blue whales (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;) and minke whales (&quot;B. acutorostrata&quot;) extend their range as far south as the pack ice where the crabeater seals are most frequent.
While no reliable historical population estimates have been done, population models suggest crabeater seal populations may have increased at rates up to 9% a year in the 20th century, due to the removal of large baleen whales (especially the blue whale) during the period of industrial whaling and the subsequent explosion in krill biomass and removal of important competitive forces.

===Predation===

Young crabeater seals experience significant predation by leopard seals. Indeed, first-year mortality is exceedingly high, possibly reaching 80%, and up to 78% of crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from leopard seal attacks. Long scars and sets of parallel scars, visible on the otherwise pale and relatively unmarked pelage of crabeaters, are present on nearly all young seals. The incidence of visible scars falls off significantly after the first year, suggesting leopard seals primarily target the young of the year. The high predation pressure has clear impacts on the demography and life history of crabeater seals, and has likely had an important role in shaping social behaviors, including aggregation of subadults.

Predation by killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) is poorly documented, though all ages are hunted. While most predation occurs in the water, coordinated attacks by groups of killer whales creating a wave to wash the hauled-out seal off floating ice have been observed. Crabeaters and other Antarctic seals are mainly targeted by the B1 variety of killer whales.
