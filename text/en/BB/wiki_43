<doc id="232487" wikidata="Q861598" url="?curid=232487" title="Education in New Zealand">
<text>The education system in New Zealand implements a three-tier model which includes primary and intermediate schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and by tertiary education at universities and polytechnics. The academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from early February until mid-December for primary schools, late January to late November or early December for secondary schools and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities.

In 2018 the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), ranked New Zealand 12th-best at science, 12th-best at reading, and 27th-best in maths; however, New Zealand&#x27;s mean scores have been steadily dropping in all three categories. The Education Index, published as part of the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index, consistently ranks New Zealand&#x27;s education among the highest in the world. Following a 2019 Curia Market Research survey of general knowledge, researchers planned to release a report in 2020 assessing whether New Zealand&#x27;s education curriculum is fit for purpose. The study found that people in New Zealand lack basic knowledge in English, maths, science, geography, and history.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative found that New Zealand achieved 95.9% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to education.

==History==
Before the arrival of Europeans, Māori ran schools to pass on traditional knowledge including songs, chants, tribal history, spiritual understanding, and knowledge of medicinal plants. These &quot;wānanga&quot; were usually run by elders called tohunga, respected for their tribal knowledge and teaching was confined to the rangatira (chiefly) class. Reading and writing were unknown, but wood carving was well developed.

Formal European-style schooling was first introduced in 1815 and was well established in 1832 by the London Missionary Society missionaries, who learned Māori and built the first schools in the Bay of Islands. Both children and adults were taught. The main resources were the Christian New Testament and slates, and teaching was in the Māori language. For many years the Bible was the only literature used in teaching, and this became a major factor in how Māori viewed the European world. In the 1850s a Māori trade school was established at Te Awamutu by John Gorst to teach Māori practical skills associated with European-style farming, but in 1863 was burnt down by Rewi Maniapoto in the early stages of New Zealand Wars.

Teaching by missionaries in Native schools were in Māori between 1815 and 1900. The Young Māori Party MPs, especially Māui Pōmare and Āpirana Ngata, advocated the teaching of Māori children in English, as well as teaching hygiene to lower the Māori sickness and death rates. Pōmare was knighted after WW1 for his work in improving Māori learning and integration into New Zealand society.

The absence of a national education system meant that the first sizeable secondary education providers were grammar schools and other private institutions. The first grammar school in New Zealand, Auckland Grammar School, was established in 1850 and formally recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act. Some schools were set up by religious groups, and others by provincial governments. Nelson and Otago were better funded and more efficient education systems than northern provinces such as Auckland; Auckland Board of Education was set up in 1857, under the Education Act of that year, and had 45 schools by 1863.

The Canterbury Provincial Council passed its first Educational Ordinance in 1857, appointed a Board of Education in 1863, and had eighty-four school districts by 1873 when it changed funding from school fees to rating land to provide free secular primary education in its schools.

Following the abolition of the provinces in November 1876, New Zealand established a free, compulsory, and secular national state education system from 1 January 1878, largely modelled on the Canterbury system.

Victorian ideals had an influence on New Zealand education and schools even if open to both genders would often separate boys and girls.
==Early childhood education==
Many children attend some form of early childhood education before they begin school, such as:
* Playcentre (age zero to school age)
* Kindergarten (age three to school age)
* Kohanga Reo
* Licensed Early Childhood Centres (age 0 to school age) (usually privately owned)
* Chartered Early Childhood Centres (age 0 to school age) (state funded)

==Primary and secondary education==

All New Zealand citizens, and those entitled to reside in New Zealand indefinitely, are entitled to free primary and secondary schooling from their 5th birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday. Education is compulsory between a student&#x27;s 6th and 16th birthdays; however most students start primary school on (or shortly after) their 5th birthday, and the vast majority (around 84%) stay in school until at least their 17th birthday. In exceptional cases, 15-year-olds can apply for an early leaving exemption from the Ministry of Education (MOE). Disabled students with special educational needs can attend day specialist schools until the end of the calendar year they turn 21.

Families wishing to home-school their children can apply for an exemption. To get an exemption from enrolment at a registered school, they must satisfy the Secretary of Education that their child will be taught &quot;as regularly and as well as in a registered school&quot;.

There are three main categories of schools in New Zealand: state (public) schools, state-integrated schools (mostly faith-based), and private (independent) schools. State schools educate approximately 84.9% of students, state-integrated schools educate 11.3%, and private schools educate 3.6%.

===Years of schooling===
New Zealand schools designate school class levels based on the years of schooling of the student cohort, using 13 academic year levels, numbered 1 through to 13. a system of Forms, Standards and Juniors/Primers was used.

Students turning five enter at Year 1 if they begin school in the first half of the school year. Students starting after 1 July are classed as Year 0, though schools have some discretion and some schools consider children starting after April or May as Year 0. Students who turn five later in the year may start in Year 0 or stay in Year 1 for the next school year, depending on their academic progress and parents&#x27; wishes. The Ministry of Education draws a distinction between academic and funding year levels, the latter being based on when a student first starts school—students first starting school after July, who therefore do not appear on the July roll returns, are classified as being in Funding Year 0 that year, and are recorded as being in Year 1 on the next year&#x27;s roll returns.

Primary education lasts eight years (Years 0–8). Depending on the area, the last two years of primary education may be taken at a primary school, at a secondary school, or at a separate intermediate school. Primary schools that go up to Year 8 are known as full primaries. 

Students generally transition to secondary education at age 12–13. Secondary education, also known as high school or college, lasts five years (Years 9–13). 

===Curriculum and qualifications===
All state and state integrated schools follow the national curriculum: &quot;The New Zealand Curriculum&quot; (NZC) for English-medium schools and (TMoA) for Māori-medium schools. Private schools do not need to follow the national curriculum, but must have a curriculum that is at least equivalent to NZC or TMoA.

The New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa have eight levels, numbered 1 to 8, and eight major learning areas: English (NZC) or Māori (TMoA), the arts, health and physical education, learning languages (which includes Māori in NZC and English in TMoA), mathematics and statistics, science, social sciences, and technology.

The main secondary school qualification in New Zealand is the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), which is offered in all state and state-integrated schools. Some schools offer Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) or the International Baccalaureate (IB) alongside NCEA.

===Types of schools by funding===
New Zealand has three types of schools: state schools, which are government owned and funded; state integrated schools, which are government funded but may charge compulsory fees; and private schools, with set annual fees.

State schools, or public schools, are government funded and operated, and are free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. Students and parents however are expected to pay for stationery, uniforms, textbooks and school trips. Schools may ask for donations to supplement their government operational funding. While it is completely voluntary to pay the donation, some schools have been reported coercing parents into paying the donation by withholding school reports and not allowing students on trips for non-payment; some schools, especially those in affluent areas, request donations in excess of $1000 per year. Each state school is governed by an elected Board of Trustees, consisting of the school principal, a number of trustees (usually 5) elected by the parents of the students, one staff trustee elected by the school staff, and in secondary schools, one student trustee elected by the students. State schools follow the national curriculum, and are required to remain secular. Around 85% of students are enrolled in state schools.

====State-integrated schools====

State-integrated schools are former private schools which have chosen to integrate into the state education system, becoming state schools but retaining their &quot;special character&quot;: being run by a religious community or a specialist group. They were established in 1975 after the near-collapse of the then-private Catholic school system, which had run into financial difficulties and threatened to overwhelm the state school system were they to close. The majority of state-integrated schools are Catholic, but other Christian denominations, religions and educational philosophies are also represented. The private school owners stay on as proprietors, and sit on the school&#x27;s board of trustees to ensure the special character is maintained. State-integrated schools charge &quot;attendance dues&quot; to parents to cover the costs of the still privately owned land and buildings, and to pay off any debts accrued by the school prior to integration. Typical attendance dues range between $240 and $740 per year for Catholic schools, and between $1,150 and $2,300 per year for non-Catholic state-integrated schools. Around 10% of students are enrolled in state-integrated schools.

====Private schools====
Private schools receive less funding from the government and rely heavily on tuition fees paid by students&#x27; parents to operate, typically around NZ$20,000 per year. In 2010, 4% of school-age children attended private schools.

====Alternative schooling====
Charter schools in New Zealand were state-funded schools which operated outside of the normal state system, and did not follow the national curriculum. They began in 2014 with five small schools. Charter schools did not have to operate with any registered or trained teachers; teachers were not required to have current practicing certificates. Beginning in 2017 and culminating in September 2018 all former charter schools had become state-integrated schools.

Parents may home-school their own children, if they can prove that their child will be &quot;taught at least as regularly and as well as in a registered school&quot;, and receive an annual grant to help with costs, including services from The Correspondence School. The percentage of children home-schooled is well under 2% even in the Nelson region, the area where the concept is most popular.

===Types of schools by years===
While there is overlap in some schools, primary school traditionally runs from Year 0 to Year 8 and secondary school from Year 9 to Year 13. Depending on the area, Years 7 and 8 may be taken either at a &quot;full&quot; primary school (in contrast to a Year 0–6 &quot;contributing&quot; primary school), a separate intermediate school, or at a Year 7–13 secondary school. Schools catering for both primary school and secondary school students (Years 1 to 13) are common among private schools, and also state schools in areas where the population does not justify separate primary and secondary schools (the latter are termed &quot;area schools&quot;).

The main six types of schools are:
* Contributing primary school: Years 0–6 (ages 5–11; 4 in some cases). There are no private contributing primaries.
* Full primary school: Years 1–8 (ages 5–13). Common among integrated and private schools.
* Intermediate school: Years 7–8 (ages 10–13). Only two non-state intermediate schools exist.
* Secondary school: Years 9–13 (ages 13–18).
* Year 7–13 secondary school or Secondary school with intermediate: Years 7–13 (ages 10–18). Common among integrated and private schools, and state schools in Invercargill and South Island provincial areas.
* Composite school or Area school: Years 1–13 (ages 5–18). Common among integrated and private schools.

There are some schools that fall outside the traditional year groupings. All of the following types of schools are rare, with less than ten of each type existing.
* Middle school: Years 7–10 (ages 10–15). Only six exist.
* Senior school: Years 11–13 (ages 14–18). Only four exist (Albany Senior High School in Auckland, Auckland International College in Auckland, Rototuna Senior High School in Hamilton and Ormiston Senior College in Auckland).

In addition, there are three other types of schools defined by the Ministry of Education:
* Correspondence school: Preschool – Year 13 (Preschool – age 19). Serves distance education, for those in remote areas or for individual subjects not offered by a school. The only school of this type is the national correspondence school: Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu.
* Special school: Preschool – age 21. Serves special education to those with intellectual impairments, visual or hearing impairments, or learning and social difficulties, who receive Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) funding.
* Teen parent unit: Years 9–15 (age 12–19). Serves teenage parents in continuing secondary school education. They are under the jurisdiction of a hosting secondary school, but are largely autonomous.

=== Types of school by function ===
* Normal schools — designated as major practicum sites for trainee teachers
* Model schools

=== State school enrolment schemes ===

Geographically based state school enrolment schemes were abolished in 1991 by the Fourth National Government and the Education Amendment Act 1991. Although this greatly opened up the choice of schools for students, it had undesirable consequences. Popular high-decile schools experienced large roll growths, while less popular low-decile school experienced roll declines. Schools could operate a roll limit if there was a risk of overcrowding, but enrolments under this scheme were on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis, potentially excluding local students.

The Education Amendment Act 2000, enacted by the Fifth Labour Government, partially solved this problem by putting in place a new &quot;system for determining enrolment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding.&quot; Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined &quot;home zone&quot;. Residence in this zone, or in the school&#x27;s boarding house (if it has one) gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school&#x27;s home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of past students; children of board employees and staff; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a randomly drawn ballot. The system is complicated by some state schools having boarding facilities for students living beyond the school&#x27;s zone. Typically these students live in isolated farming regions in New Zealand, or their parents may live or work partly overseas. Many secondary schools offer limited scholarships to their boarding establishment to attract talented students in imitation of private school practice.

As of September 2010, 700 of New Zealand&#x27;s 2550 primary and secondary schools operate an enrolment scheme, while the remaining 1850 schools are &quot;open enrolment&quot;, meaning any student can enrol in the school without rejection. Enrolment schemes mostly exist in major towns and cities where school density is high and school choice is active; they rarely exist for primary schools in rural areas and secondary schools outside the major towns and cities, where school density is low and school choice is limited by the distance to the nearest alternative school.

Critics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years&#x27; imprisonment).

===Māori language in education===
While English is the dominant language of education throughout New Zealand, in recent years there have been ongoing efforts to raise the availability of Māori language education in New Zealand as one of New Zealand&#x27;s three official languages.

Prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in what would become New Zealand, traditional educational systems in Māori society (a ritual transfer of knowledge for most Māori, and the more formal whare wānanga—“house of learning”—model primarily for those of chiefly lineage) were naturally conducted through the medium of the Māori language.

In 1816, the first mission school was opened to teach the Māori in the Bay of Islands. Here too, instruction was conducted primarily in the Māori language. Though English-medium education would have also been available for children of European settlers from nearly their first arrival, ethnic Māori continued to learn primarily through the medium of the Māori language for many years. It was not until the Native Schools Act was passed in 1867 that a systematic government preference was articulated for the English language as a medium of instruction for Māori children. And even with the passage of the act, the English-language provision was not rigorously enforced until 1900.

Starting in 1903, a government policy to discourage the use of the Māori language in playgrounds was enacted. In the early 1930s the director of Education blocked an initiative by the New Zealand Federation of Teachers to have the Māori language added to the curriculum. Though not the only factor, the ban on the Māori language in education contributed to the widespread loss of Māori-language ability. By 1960 the number of Māori who could speak the language had fallen to 25% from 95% in 1900.

Focus on falling Māori academic achievement in the 1960s coupled with the loss of the language, led to heavy lobbying by Ngā Tamatoa and the Te Reo Māori Society in the 1970s for the introduction of the language into the schools. This was accompanied by the establishment of Māori Studies programs in each of the Teacher Colleges by 1973. The 1980s then marked a pivotal decade in the revival of Māori-medium education, with the establishment of the first kōhanga reo (“language nest” – essentially a total immersion Māori-medium pre-school and kindergarten) in 1981, the first kura kaupapa (established at Hoani Waititi Marae, West Auckland) in 1985, a finding by the Waitangi Tribunal that the Māori language is guaranteed protection under Article II of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1986, and the passage of the Māori Language Act in 1987, recognizing Māori as an official language.

Under New Zealand&#x27;s current education laws, Māori language education is available in many locations throughout the country, both as a subject in a normal English-medium school as well as through immersion in a Māori-medium school set up under Section 155 (s155) or Section 156 (s156) of the Education Act 1990. The full immersion schools are commonly referred to as Kura Kaupapa Māori. Though enrolment numbers in Māori language programs have remained relatively stable in the last 5 years, the raw total as well as the percentage of students enrolled fell from 2004. 

The definitions provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Education are as follows:

Māori Medium: Māori Medium includes students who are taught the curriculum in the Māori language for at least 51 percent of the time (Māori Language Immersion levels 1–2).

Māori Language in English Medium: Māori Language in English Medium includes students who are learning the Māori language as a language subject, or who are taught the curriculum in the Māori language for up to 50 percent of the time (Māori Language Immersion levels 3–5).

No Māori Language in Education: No Māori Language in Education includes those students who are only introduced to the Māori language via Taha Māori, i.e. simple words, greetings or songs in Māori (Māori Immersion Level 6), and students who are not involved in Māori language education at any level.

=== Māori education ===
In 2021 Education Review Office released a report called &quot;Te Kura Huanui&quot; with the findings indicating Māori children who were enrolled in the Māori language schools of kōhanga and kura kaupapa excelling. In 2022 the statistics in mainstream schooling for Māori students were that 35% left with NCEA level 3, compared to 58% at a kura kaupapa.Revitalising Māori education has not meant closing down Pākehā schools but instead means offering an alternative approach which is designed from top-to-bottom by Māori, to serve Māori. This system has shown us that by deploying a by Māori-for-Māori approach, better outcomes can be achieved for all New Zealanders. (Te Huia Bill Hamilton)

=== School times ===
The school day starts anywhere from 8:00–9:00 am and finishes around 3:00 pm. The school year starts at the end of January and finishes in mid-December, with the six-week summer holidays making up the second half of December and most of January. The year is divided into four terms, each lasting around ten weeks with two-week breaks in between. Typically, term one lasts from late January to mid-April, term two from early May to early July, term three from late July to late September, and term four from early October to mid-December, but term dates may be adjusted because of major sporting events or viral outbreaks.
===Manual training schools===

In response to growing criticism that New Zealand&#x27;s education system was too focused on academics and not providing practical skills to children the Liberal Government of New Zealand passed the &quot;Manual and Technical Elementary Instruction Act 1895&quot; to establish classes that taught manual and technical skills to students as part of the curriculum. This was not very effective and five years later the &quot;Manual and Technical Instruction Act 1900&quot; was passed which established grants for the education boards to establish manual training schools as a form of secondary education. Most secondary schools did not wish to change their curriculum as the prevailing belief amongst teachers was in support of academic education. Two years later the government passed an amendment in 1902 which allowed for independent manual and technical training schools.

Manual training schools initially taught for Standards 5 and 6 and taught woodwork and metalwork to boys and cookery, laundry, and sewing to girls. Following the creation of intermediate schools after the Second World War most of their functions were adopted into the curriculum and manual training schools began closing down or being integrated into other schools.

Manual and technical training is now a part of the curriculum of New Zealand.
==Tertiary education==

Tertiary education in New Zealand is used to describe all aspects of post-school education and training. This ranges from informal non-assessed community courses in schools through to undergraduate degrees and advanced, research-based postgraduate degrees. Tertiary education is regulated within the New Zealand Qualifications Framework, a unified system of national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training.

==Funding==

===Primary and secondary===
State and state integrated schools are allocated funding from the Government on a per-student basis to fund the running of the school. Smaller schools receive additional funding due to the added fixed costs of running them compared to larger schools, and schools also receive funding based on the school&#x27;s socio-economic decile rating, with low-decile schools (i.e. those in poorer areas) receiving more funds. They may also receive funds from other activities, such as hiring out school facilities outside school hours to outside groups. Schools also ask for a voluntary donation from parents, informally known as &quot;school fees&quot;, to cover extra expenses not covered by the government funding. This may range from $40 per child up to $800 per child in high decile state schools, to over $4000 in state integrated schools. The payment of this fee varies widely according to how parents perceive the school. Typically parents will also outlay $500–$1000 per year for uniforms, trips, social events, sporting equipment and stationery at state schools.

Most state integrated schools also charge &quot;attendance dues&quot;, a compulsory fee paid to the school&#x27;s proprietors to cover the cost of maintaining and upgrading school land and buildings. Unlike voluntary donations, attendance dues are not optional and parents are contractually and legally required to pay them, and schools can take action to collect these or cancel the enrolment of a student if they are not paid.

Private schools rely mainly on tuition fees paid to the school by the parents of the students, although some funding is provided by the government. As of 2013, private schools receives from the Government (exclusive of GST) $1013 for every Year 1 to 6 student, $1109 for every Year 7 and 8 student, $1420 for every Year 9 and 10 student, and $2156 for every Year 11 to 13 student. However, the government funding is more of a partial tax rebate, as the GST payable to the government on the tuition fees collected often exceeds the government funding received in turn.

Salaries and wages for teaching staff in state and state integrated schools are paid directly from the Ministry of Education to the employee, and are not paid out of a school&#x27;s funding. The salaries are fixed nationwide, and are based on the teacher&#x27;s qualifications, years of service and workload, with middle and senior management awarded extra pay through &quot;units&quot;. In 1991, following the decentralisation of school administration (the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools&quot; reforms), there was an attempt to move the responsibilities of paying teachers&#x27; salaries from the ministry to each school&#x27;s Board of Trustees, in which each board would receive a lump sum from the government for all costs, including the payment of salaries. Known as &quot;Bulk Funding&quot;, the proposal met strong opposition from teachers and their unions, particularly the Post Primary Teachers&#x27; Association, and wildcat strike action occurred among teachers as some schools&#x27; boards of trustees gradually elected to move to the new system. Bulk Funding was eventually scrapped in July 2000.

Special needs students are entitled to Ongoing Resource Scheme (ORS) funding, which is used for facilitating the adaption of the curriculum to fit the student, funding of teacher aides and specialists, and procuring any special equipment required. There are three levels of funding based on the student&#x27;s needs: very high, high or combined moderate. For example, a student who is totally blind or deaf is classified as very high needs, while a student who is partially sighted (6/36 or worse) or severely or profoundly deaf (71 dB loss or worse) is classified as high needs. ORS funding is permanent, so it continues until the student leaves school.

===Tertiary education===
Funding for tertiary education in New Zealand is through a combination of government subsidies and student fees. The government funds approved courses by a tuition grant based on the number of enrolled students in each course and the amount of study time each course requires. Courses are rated on an equivalent full-time Student (EFTS) basis. Students enrolled in courses can access Student Loans and Student Allowances to assist with fees and living costs.

Funding for Tertiary Institutions has been criticised recently due to high fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some also point out that high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore to pay for their student loans debts.

===Students===
Most tertiary education students rely on some form of state funding to pay for their tuition and living expenses. Mostly, students rely on state provided student loans and allowances. Secondary school students sitting the state run examinations are awarded scholarships, depending on their results, that assist in paying some tuition fees. Universities and other funders also provide scholarships or funding grants to promising students, though mostly at a postgraduate level. Some employers will also assist their employees to study (full-time or part-time) towards a qualification that is relevant to their work. People who receive state welfare benefits and are retraining, or returning to the workforce after raising children, may be eligible for supplementary assistance, however students already in full or part-time study are not eligible for most state welfare benefits.

====Student allowances====
Student Allowances, which are non-refundable grants to students of limited means, are means tested and the weekly amount granted depends on residential and citizenship qualifications, age, location, marital status, dependent children as well as personal, spousal or parental income. The allowance is intended for living expenses, so most students receiving an allowance will still need a student loan to pay for their tuition fees.

====Student loans====
The Student Loan Scheme is available to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. It covers course fees, course related expenses, and can also provide a weekly living allowance for full-time students. The loan must be repaid at a rate dependent on income and repayments are normally recovered via the income tax system by wage deductions. Low income earners and students in full-time study can have the interest on their loans written off.

On 26 July 2005, the Labour Party announced that they would abolish interest on Student Loans, if re-elected at the September election, which they were. From April 2006, the interest component on Student Loans was abolished for students who live in New Zealand. This has eased pressure on the government from current students. However, it caused resentment from past students many of whom have accumulated large interests amounts in the years 1992–2006.

== Educational standards in New Zealand ==
In 1995 New Zealand students finished 18th out of 24 countries on an international survey, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). There was considerable public concern so the Government created a taskforce to address the problem. In 2001, the Ministry introduced the Numeracy Development Project, which was supposed to lift student performance. Instead, the new teaching methods appear to have &quot;confused teachers, children and parents by presenting multiple alternative problem-solving strategies but neglecting basic knowledge&quot; and over the next few years New Zealand&#x27;s rating dropped even further.

In December 2012, the latest TIMSS survey found New Zealand 9-year-olds ranked 34th out of 53 countries — and were bottom equal among developed nations. Almost half could not add 218 and 191 compared to 73% internationally. Ministry of Education figures show the number of 12-year-olds who were able to answer simple multiplication questions correctly dropped from &quot;47% in 2001 — the year new maths teaching methods were introduced — to 37% in 2009&quot;. The problem flows on to high schools, where &quot;there are still students who have difficulty with the very basics such as knowledge about whole numbers and decimals&quot;.

Sir Vaughan Jones, New Zealand&#x27;s foremost mathematician, is concerned about the way maths is now taught in New Zealand arguing that children need to learn how to multiply and add and really understand those processes before moving on. Jones said children &quot;need to know basic arithmetic before they try to start problem solving&quot;.

In December 2012 a broader ranking process put New Zealand eighth out of 40 countries — seemingly giving the country one of the top education systems in the world. This ranking came from &quot;The Learning Curve&quot; global education report, published by education firm Pearson. The report assesses performance rates of pupils in reading, writing and maths and is based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, the validity of Pearsons&#x27; testing process for students has been questioned following the discovery of numerous errors in its tests and controversy regarding a question about a talking pineapple.

On a more general note, the Pearson report said the quality of teaching was key factor in a successful education system but also highlighted the importance of an underlying culture focused on children&#x27;s learning. The report noted that Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, which were all ahead of New Zealand, had societies &quot;where education and learning was of the greatest importance and where parents were very much involved with their children&#x27;s education&quot;.

=== Māori and Pacific Island standards ===

According to former Education Minister Hekia Parata, New Zealand needs to raise the academic achievement of its Māori and Pacific Island students to match those of Pākehā students. In 2013, she said that the PISA international standard showed Pākehā were ranked second in the world, Māori were 34th equal and Pacific students were ranked 44th.

== School bullying ==

Bullying is a widespread issue in New Zealand schools. In 2007, one in five New Zealand high school students reported being cyber-bullied. In regard to physical bullying, an international study in 2009 found New Zealand had the second highest incidence of bullying out of the 40 countries surveyed.

In 2009, the Ombudsman launched an investigation into school bullying and violence after serious incidents at Hutt Valley High School in Lower Hutt, which included students being dragged to the ground, sexually assaulted, a student &quot;being beaten unconscious and a student being burnt with a lighter&quot;. The Ombudsman&#x27;s report recommended schools&#x27; guidelines be amended to make anti-bullying programmes compulsory in schools. Post Primary Teachers&#x27; Association president Robin Duff said the report illustrated a systemic failure by the Ministry of Education to help schools deal with bullying.

The Government responded by putting $60 million into a &quot;Positive Behaviour for Learning&quot; plan but the results were less than satisfactory. In March 2013, Secondary Principals Association president Patrick Walsh asked the Ministry to &quot;urgently draft a comprehensive bullying policy for schools, after being surprised to find it did not have one.&quot; Mr Walsh believes that since schools are supposed to be self-managing, each school has &quot;work it out&quot; for themselves which &quot;would mean that all 2500 schools all have to reinvent the wheel&quot;.

<doc id="232495" wikidata="Q644302" url="?curid=232495" title="Motivation">
<text>Motivation is an internal state that propels individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often understood as a force that explains why people or animals initiate, continue, or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. It is a complex phenomenon and its precise definition is disputed. It contrasts with amotivation, which is a state of apathy or listlessness. Motivation is studied in fields like psychology, neuroscience, motivation science, and philosophy.

Motivational states are characterized by their direction, intensity, and persistence. The direction of a motivational state is shaped by the goal it aims to achieve. Intensity is the strength of the state and affects whether the state is translated into action and how much effort is employed. Persistence refers to how long an individual is willing to engage in an activity. Motivation is often divided into two phases: in the first phase, the individual establishes a goal, while in the second phase, they attempt to reach this goal.

Many types of motivation are discussed in the academic literature. &quot;Intrinsic motivation&quot; comes from internal factors like enjoyment and curiosity; it contrasts with &quot;extrinsic motivation&quot;, which is driven by external factors like obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment. For &quot;conscious motivation&quot;, the individual is aware of the motive driving the behavior, which is not the case for &quot;unconscious motivation&quot;. Other types include: &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational motivation&quot;; &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;cognitive motivation&quot;; &quot;short-term&quot; and &quot;long-term motivation&quot;; and &quot;egoistic&quot; and &quot;altruistic motivation&quot;.

Theories of motivation are conceptual frameworks that seek to explain motivational phenomena. Content theories aim to describe which internal factors motivate people and which goals they commonly follow. Examples are the hierarchy of needs, the two-factor theory, and the learned needs theory. They contrast with process theories, which discuss the cognitive, emotional, and decision-making processes that underlie human motivation, like expectancy theory, equity theory, goal-setting theory, self-determination theory, and reinforcement theory. Motivation is relevant to many fields. It affects educational success, work performance, athletic success, and economic behavior. It is further pertinent in the fields of personal development, health, and criminal law.

== Definition, measurement, and semantic field ==
Motivation is often understood as an internal state or force that propels individuals to engage and persist in goal-directed behavior. Motivational states explain why people or animals initiate, continue, or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states are characterized by the goal they aim for, as well as the intensity and duration of the effort devoted to the goal. Motivational states have different degrees of strength. If a state has a high degree then it is more likely to influence behavior than if it has a low degree. Motivation contrasts with amotivation, which is a lack of interest in a certain activity or a resistance to it. In a slightly different sense, the word &quot;motivation&quot; can also refer to the act of motivating someone and to a reason or goal for doing something. It comes from the Latin term (to move).

The traditional discipline studying motivation is psychology. It investigates how motivation arises, which factors influence it, and what effects it has. Motivation science is a more recent field of inquiry focused on an integrative approach that tries to link insights from different subdisciplines. Neurology is interested in the underlying neurological mechanisms, such as the involved brain areas and neurotransmitters. Philosophy aims to clarify the nature of motivation and understand its relation to other concepts.

Motivation is not directly observable but has to be inferred from other characteristics. There are different ways to do so and measure it. The most common approach is to rely on self-reports and use questionnaires. They can include direct questions like &quot;how motivated are you?&quot; but may also inquire about additional factors in relation to the goals, feelings, and effort invested in a particular activity. Another approach is based on external observation of the individual. This can concern studying behavioral changes but may also include additional methods like measuring brain activity and skin conductance.

=== Academic definitions ===
Many academic definitions of motivation have been proposed but there is little consensus on its precise characterization. This is partly because motivation is a complex phenomenon with many aspects and different definitions often focus on different aspects. Some definitions emphasize internal factors. This can involve psychological aspects in relation to desires and volitions or physiological aspects regarding physical needs. For example, John Dewey and Abraham Maslow use a psychological perspective to understand motivation as a form of desire while Jackson Beatty and Charles Ransom Gallistel see it as a physical process akin to hunger and thirst.

Some definitions stress the continuity between human and animal motivation, but others draw a clear distinction between the two. This is often emphasized by the idea that human agents act for reasons and are not mechanistically driven to follow their strongest impulse. A closely related disagreement concerns the role of awareness and rationality. Definitions emphasizing this aspect understand motivation as a mostly conscious process of rationally considering the most appropriate behavior. Another perspective emphasizes the multitude of unconscious and subconscious factors responsible.

Other definitions characterize motivation as a form of arousal that provides energy to direct and maintain behavior. For instance, K. B. Madsen sees motivation as &quot;the &#x27;driving force&#x27; behind behavior&quot; while Elliott S. Vatenstein and Roderick Wong emphasize that motivation leads to goal-oriented behavior that is interested in consequences. The role of goals in motivation is sometimes paired with the claim that it leads to flexible behavior in contrast to blind reflexes or fixed stimulus-response patterns. This is based on the idea that individuals use means to bring about the goal and are flexible in regard to what means they employ. According to this view, the feeding behavior of rats is based on motivation since they can learn to traverse through complicated mazes to satisfy their hunger, which is not the case for the stimulus-bound feeding behavior of flies.

Some psychologists define motivation as a temporary and reversible process. For example, Robert A. Hinde and John Alcock see it as a transitory state that affects responsiveness to stimuli. This approach makes it possible to contrast motivation with phenomena like learning which bring about permanent behavioral changes.

Another approach is to provide a very broad characterization to cover many different aspects of motivation. This often results in very long definitions by including many of the factors listed above. The multitude of definitions and the lack of consensus have prompted some theorists, like psychologists B. N. Bunnell and Donald A. Dewsbury, to doubt that the concept of motivation is theoretically useful and to see it instead as a mere hypothetical construct.

=== Semantic field ===
The term &quot;motivation&quot; is closely related to the term &quot;motive&quot; and the two terms are often used as synonyms. However, some theorists distinguish their precise meanings as technical terms. For example, psychologist Andrea Fuchs understands motivation as the &quot;sum of separate motives&quot;. According to psychologist Ruth Kanfer, motives are stable dispositional tendencies that contrast with the dynamic nature of motivation as a fluctuating internal state.

Motivation is closely related to ability, effort, and action. An ability is a power to perform an action, like the ability to walk or to write. Individuals can have abilities without exercising them. They are more likely to be motivated to do something if they have the ability to do it, but having an ability is not a requirement and it is possible to be motivated while lacking the corresponding ability. Effort is the physical and mental energy invested when exercising an ability. It depends on motivation and high motivation is associated with high effort. The quality of the resulting performance depends on the ability, effort, and motivation. Motivation to perform an action can be present even if the action is not executed. This is the case, for instance, if there is a stronger motivation to engage in a different action at the same time.

== Components and stages ==
Motivation is a complex phenomenon that is often analyzed in terms of different components and stages. Components are aspects that different motivational states have in common. Often-discussed components are direction, intensity, and persistence. Stages or phases are temporal parts of how motivation unfolds over time, like the initial goal-setting stage in contrast to the following goal-striving stage.

A closely related issue concerns the different types of mental phenomena that are responsible for motivation, like desires, beliefs, and rational deliberation. Some theorists hold that a desire to do something is an essential part of all motivational states. This view is based on the idea that the desire to do something justifies the effort to engage in this activity. However, this view is not generally accepted and it has been suggested that at least in some cases, actions are motivated by other mental phenomena, like beliefs or rational deliberation. For example, a person may be motivated to undergo a painful root canal treatment because they conclude that it is a necessary thing to do even though they do not actively desire it.

=== Components ===
Motivation is sometimes discussed in terms of three main components: direction, intensity, and persistence. Direction refers to the goal people choose. It is the objective in which they decide to invest their energy. For example, if one roommate decides to go to the movies while the other visits a party, they both have motivation but their motivational states differ in regard to the direction they pursue. The pursued objective often forms part of a hierarchy of means-end relationships. This implies that several steps or lower-level goals may have to be fulfilled to reach a higher-level goal. For example, to achieve the higher-level goal of writing a complete article, one needs to realize different lower-level goals, like writing different sections of the article. Some goals are specific, like reducing one&#x27;s weight by 3 kg, while others are non-specific, like losing as much weight as possible. Specific goals often affect motivation and performance positively by making it easier to plan and track progress.

The goal belongs to the individual&#x27;s motivational reason and explains why they favor an action and engage in it. Motivational reasons contrast with normative reasons, which are facts that determine what should be done or why a course of action is objectively good. Motivational reasons can be in tune with normative reasons but this is not always the case. For example, if a cake is poisoned then this is a normative reason for the host not to offer it to their guests. But if they are not aware of the poison then politeness may be their motivating reason to offer it.

The intensity of motivation corresponds to how much energy someone is willing to invest into a particular task. For instance, two athletes engaging in the same drill have the same direction but differ concerning the motivational intensity if one gives their best while the other only puts in minimal effort. Some theorists use the term &quot;effort&quot; rather than &quot;intensity&quot; for this component.

The strength of a motivational state also affects whether it is translated into action. One theory states that different motivational states compete with each other and that only the behavior with the highest net force of motivation is put into action. However, it is controversial whether this is always true. For example, it has been suggested that in cases of rational deliberation, it may be possible to act against one&#x27;s strongest motive. Another problem is that this view may lead to a form of determinism that denies the existence of free will.

Persistence is the long-term component of motivation and refers to how long an individual engages in an activity. A high level of motivational persistence manifests itself in a sustained dedication over time. The motivational persistence in relation to the chosen goal contrasts with flexibility on the level of the means: individuals may adjust their approach and try different strategies on the level of the means to reach a pursued end. This way, individuals can adapt to changes in the physical and social environment that affect the effectiveness of previously chosen means.

The components of motivation can be understood in analogy to the allocation of limited resources: direction, intensity, and persistence determine where to allocate energy, how much of it, and for how long. For effective action, it is usually relevant to have the right form of motivation on all three levels: to pursue an appropriate goal with the required intensity and persistence.

=== Stages ===
The process of motivation is commonly divided into two stages: goal-setting and goal-striving. Goal-setting is the phase in which the direction of motivation is determined. It involves considering the reasons for and against different courses of action and then committing oneself to a goal one aims to achieve. The goal-setting process by itself does not ensure that the plan is carried out. This happens in the goal-striving stage, in which the individual tries to implement the plan. It starts with the initiation of the action and includes putting in effort and trying different strategies to succeed. Various difficulties can arise in this phase. The individual has to muster the initiative to get started with the goal-directed behavior and stay committed even when faced with obstacles without giving in to distractions. They also need to ensure that the chosen means are effective and that they do not overexert themselves.
Goal-setting and goal-striving are usually understood as distinct stages but they can be intertwined in various ways. Depending on the performance during the striving phase, the individual may adjust their goal. For example, if the performance is worse than expected, they may lower their goals. This can go hand in hand with adjusting the effort invested in the activity. Emotional states affect how goals are set and which goals are prioritized. Positive emotions are associated with optimism about the value of a goal and create a tendency to seek positive outcomes. Negative emotions are associated with a more pessimistic outlook and tend to lead to the avoidance of bad outcomes.

Some theorists have suggested further phases. For example, psychologist Barry J. Zimmerman includes an additional self-reflection phase after the performance. A further approach is to distinguish two parts of the planning: the first part consists in choosing a goal while the second part is about planning how to realize this goal.

== Types ==
Many different types of motivation are discussed in the academic literature. They differ from each other based on the underlying mechanisms responsible for their manifestation, what goals are pursued, what temporal horizon they encompass, and who is intended to benefit.

=== Intrinsic and extrinsic ===

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is based on the source or origin of the motivation. Intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual, who engages in an activity out of enjoyment, curiosity, or a sense of fulfillment. It occurs when people pursue an activity for its own sake. It can be due to affective factors, when the person engages in the behavior because it feels good, or cognitive factors, when they see it as something good or meaningful. An example of intrinsic motivation is a person who plays basketball during lunch break only because they enjoy it.

Extrinsic motivation arises from external factors, such as rewards, punishments, or recognition from others. This occurs when people engage in an activity because they are interested in the effects or the outcome of the activity rather than in the activity itself. For instance, if a student does their homework because they are afraid of being punished by their parents then extrinsic motivation is responsible.

Intrinsic motivation is often more highly regarded than extrinsic motivation. It is associated with genuine passion, creativity, a sense of purpose, and personal autonomy. It also tends to come with stronger commitment and persistence. Intrinsic motivation is a key factor in cognitive, social, and physical development. The degree of intrinsic motivation is affected by various conditions, including a sense of autonomy and positive feedback from others. In the field of education, intrinsic motivation tends to result in high-quality learning. However, there are also certain advantages to extrinsic motivation: it can provide people with motivation to engage in useful or necessary tasks which they do not naturally find interesting or enjoyable. Some theorists understand the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as a spectrum rather than a clear dichotomy. This is linked to the idea that the more autonomous an activity is, the more it is associated with intrinsic motivation.

A behavior can be motivated only by intrinsic motives, only by extrinsic motives, or by a combination of both. In the latter case, there are both internal and external reasons why the person engages in the behavior. If both are present, they may work against each other. For example, the presence of a strong extrinsic motivation, like a high monetary reward, can decrease intrinsic motivation. Because of this, the individual may be less likely to further engage in the activity if it does not result in an external reward anymore. However, this is not always the case and under the right circumstances, the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation leads to higher performance.

=== Conscious and unconscious ===
Conscious motivation involves motives of which the person is aware. It includes the explicit recognition of goals and underlying values. Conscious motivation is associated with the formulation of a goal and a plan to realize it as well as its controlled step-by-step execution. Some theorists emphasize the role of the self in this process as the entity that plans, initiates, regulates, and evaluates behavior. An example of conscious motivation is a person in a clothing store who states that they want to buy a shirt and then goes on to buy one.

Unconscious motivation involves motives of which the person is not aware. It can be guided by deep-rooted beliefs, desires, and feelings operating beneath the level of consciousness. Examples include the unacknowledged influences of past experiences, unresolved conflicts, hidden fears, and defense mechanisms. These influences can affect decisions, impact behavior, and shape habits. An example of unconscious motivation is a scientist who believes that their research effort is a pure expression of their altruistic desire to benefit science while their true motive is an unacknowledged need for fame. External circumstances can also impact the motivation underlying unconscious behavior. An example is the effect of priming, in which an earlier stimulus influences the response to a later stimulus without the person&#x27;s awareness of this influence. Unconscious motivation is a central topic in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis.

Early theories of motivation often assumed that conscious motivation is the primary form of motivation. However, this view has been challenged in the subsequent literature and there is no academic consensus on the relative extent of their influence.
=== Rational and irrational ===
Closely related to the contrast between conscious and unconscious motivation is the distinction between rational and irrational motivation. A motivational state is rational if it is based on a good reason. This implies that the motive of the behavior explains why the person should engage in the behavior. In this case, the person has an insight into why the behavior is considered valuable. For example, if a person saves a drowning child because they value the child&#x27;s life then their motivation is rational.

Rational motivation contrasts with irrational motivation, in which the person has no good reason that explains the behavior. In this case, the person lacks a clear understanding of the deeper source of motivation and in what sense the behavior is in tune with their values. This can be the case for impulsive behavior, for example, when a person spontaneously acts out of anger without reflecting on the consequences of their actions.

Rational and irrational motivation play a key role in the field of economics. In order to predict the behavior of economic actors, it is often assumed that they act rationally. In this field, rational behavior is understood as behavior that is in tune with self-interest while irrational behavior goes against self-interest. For example, based on the assumption that it is in the self-interest of firms to maximize profit, actions that lead to that outcome are considered rational while actions that impede profit maximization are considered irrational. However, when understood in a wider sense, rational motivation is a broader term that also includes behavior motivated by a desire to benefit others as a form of rational altruism.

=== Biological and cognitive ===
Biological motivation concerns motives that arise due to physiological needs. Examples are hunger, thirst, sex, and the need for sleep. They are also referred to as primary, physiological, or organic motives. Biological motivation is associated with states of arousal and emotional changes. Its source lies in innate mechanisms that govern stimulus-response patterns.

Cognitive motivation concerns motives that arise from the psychological level. They include affiliation, competition, personal interests, and self-actualization as well as desires for perfection, justice, beauty, and truth. They are also called secondary, psychological, social, or personal motives. They are often seen as a higher or more refined form of motivation. The processing and interpretation of information play a key role in cognitive motivation. Cognitively motivated behavior is not an innate reflex but a flexible response to the available information that is based on past experiences and expected outcomes. It is associated with the explicit formulation of desired outcomes and engagement in goal-directed behavior to realize these outcomes.

Some theories of human motivation see biological causes as the source of all motivation. They tend to conceptualize human behavior in analogy to animal behavior. Other theories allow for both biological and cognitive motivation and some put their main emphasis on cognitive motivation.

=== Short-term and long-term ===
Short-term and long-term motivation differ in regard to the temporal horizon and the duration of the underlying motivational mechanism. Short-term motivation is focused on achieving rewards immediately or in the near future. It is associated with impulsive behavior. It is a transient and fluctuating phenomenon that may arise and subside spontaneously.

Long-term motivation involves a sustained commitment to goals in a more distant future. It encompasses a willingness to invest time and effort over an extended period before the intended goal is reached. It is often a more deliberative process that requires goal-setting and planning.

Both short-term and long-term motivation are relevant to achieving one&#x27;s goals. For example, short-term motivation is central when responding to urgent problems while long-term motivation is a key factor in pursuing far-reaching objectives. However, they sometimes conflict with each other by supporting opposing courses of action. An example is a married person who is tempted to have a one-night stand. In this case, there may be a clash between the short-term motivation to seek immediate physical gratification and the long-term motivation to preserve and nurture a successful marriage built on trust and commitment. Another example is the long-term motivation to stay healthy in contrast to the short-term motivation to smoke a cigarette.

=== Egoistic and altruistic ===
The difference between egoistic and altruistic motivation concerns who is intended to benefit from the anticipated course of action. Egoistic motivation is driven by self-interest: the person is acting for their own benefit or to fulfill their own needs and desires. This self-interest can take various forms, including immediate pleasure, career advancement, financial rewards, and gaining respect from others.

Altruistic motivation is marked by selfless intentions and involves a genuine concern for the well-being of others. It is associated with the desire to assist and help others in a non-transactional manner without the goal of obtaining personal gain or rewards in return.

According to the controversial thesis of psychological egoism, there is no altruistic motivation: all motivation is egoistic. Proponents of this view hold that even apparently altruistic behavior is caused by egoistic motives. For example, they may claim that people feel good about helping other people and that their egoistic desire to feel good is the true internal motivation behind the externally altruistic behavior.

Many religions emphasize the importance of altruistic motivation as a component of religious practice. For example, Christianity sees selfless love and compassion as a way of realizing God&#x27;s will and bringing about a better world. Buddhists emphasize the practice of loving-kindness toward all sentient beings as a means to eliminate suffering.

=== Others ===
Many other types of motivation are discussed in the academic literature. Moral motivation is closely related to altruistic motivation. Its motive is to act in tune with moral judgments and it can be characterized as the willingness to &quot;do the right thing&quot;. The desire to visit a sick friend to keep a promise is an example of moral motivation. It can conflict with other forms of motivation, like the desire to go to the movies instead. An influential debate in moral philosophy centers around the question of whether moral judgments can directly provide moral motivation, as internalists claim. Externalists provide an alternative explanation by holding that additional mental states, like desires or emotions, are needed. Externalists hold that these additional states do not always accompany moral judgments, meaning that it would be possible to have moral judgments without a moral motivation to follow them. Certain forms of psychopathy and brain damage can inhibit moral motivation.

Self-determination theorists, such as Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, distinguish between autonomous and controlled motivation. Autonomous motivation is associated with acting according to one&#x27;s free will or doing something because one wants to do it. In the case of controlled motivation, the person feels pressured into doing something by external forces.

A related contrast is between push and pull motivation. Push motivation arises from unfulfilled internal needs and aims at satisfying them. For example, hunger may push an individual to find something to eat. Pull motivation arises from an external goal and aims at achieving this goal, like the motivation to get a university degree.

Achievement motivation is the desire to overcome obstacles and strive for excellence. Its goal is to do things well and become better even in the absence of tangible external rewards. It is closely related to the fear of failure. An example of achievement motivation in sports is a person who challenges stronger opponents in an attempt to get better.

Human motivation is sometimes contrasted with animal motivation. The field of animal motivation examines the reasons and mechanisms underlying animal behavior. It belongs to psychology and zoology. It gives specific emphasis to the interplay of external stimulation and internal states. It further considers how an animal benefits from a certain behavior as an individual and in terms of evolution. There are important overlaps between the fields of animal and human motivation. Studies on animal motivation tend to focus more on the role of external stimuli and instinctive responses while the role of free decisions and delayed gratification has a more prominent place when discussing human motivation.

== Amotivation and akrasia ==
Motivation contrasts with amotivation (also known as avolition) which is an absence of interest. Individuals in the state of amotivation feel apathy or lack the willingness to engage in a particular behavior. For instance, amotivated children at school remain passive in class, do not engage in classroom activities, and fail to follow teacher instructions. Amotivation can be a significant barrier to productivity, goal attainment, and overall well-being. It can be caused by factors like unrealistic expectations, helplessness, feelings of incompetence, and the inability to see how one&#x27;s actions affect outcomes. In the field of Christian spirituality, the terms acedia and accidie are often used to describe a form of amotivation or listlessness associated with a failure to engage in spiritual practices. Amotivation is usually a temporary state. The term &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; refers to a more permanent and wide-reaching condition. It involves apathy and lack of activity in relation to a broad range of activities and is associated with incoherence, inability to concentrate, and memory disturbance. The term &quot;disorders of diminished motivation&quot; covers a wide range of related phenomena, including abulia, akinetic mutism, and other motivation-related neurological disorders.

Amotivation is closely related to akrasia. A person in the state of akrasia believes that they should perform a certain action but cannot motivate themselves to do it. This means that there is an internal conflict between what a person believes they should do and what they actually do. The cause of akrasia is sometimes that a person gives in to temptations and is not able to resist them. For this reason, akrasia is also referred to as weakness of the will. An addict who compulsively consumes drugs even though they know that it is not in their best self-interest is an example of akrasia. Akrasia contrasts with enkrasia, which is a state where a person&#x27;s motivation aligns with their beliefs.

== Theories ==
Theories of motivation are frameworks or sets of principles that aim to explain motivational phenomena. They seek to understand how motivation arises and what causes and effects it has as well as the goals that commonly motivate people. This way, they provide explanations of why an individual engages in one behavior rather than another, how much effort they invest, and how long they continue to strive toward a given goal.

Important debates in the academic literature concern to what extent motivation is innate or based on genetically determined instincts rather than learned through previous experience. A closely related issue is whether motivational processes are mechanistic and run automatically or have a more complex nature involving cognitive processes and active decision-making. Another discussion revolves around the topic of whether the primary sources of motivation are internal needs rather than external goals.
A common distinction among theories of motivation is between content theories and process theories. Content theories attempt to identify and describe the internal factors that motivate people, such as different types of needs, drives, and desires. They examine which goals motivate people. Influential content theories are Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, Frederick Herzberg&#x27;s two-factor theory, and David McClelland&#x27;s learned needs theory. Process theories discuss the cognitive, emotional, and decision-making processes that underlie human motivation. They examine how people select goals and the means to achieve them. Major process theories are expectancy theory, equity theory, goal-setting theory, self-determination theory, and reinforcement theory. Another way to classify theories of motivation focuses on the role of inborn physiological processes in contrast to cognitive processes and distinguishes between biological, psychological, and biopsychosocial theories.

=== Major content theories ===

Maslow holds that humans have different kinds of needs and that those needs are responsible for motivation. According to him, they form a hierarchy of needs that is composed of lower and higher needs. Lower needs belong to the physiological level and are characterized as &quot;deficiency&quot; needs since they indicate some form of lack. Examples are the desire for food, water, and shelter. Higher needs belong to the psychological level and are associated with the potential to grow as a person. Examples are self-esteem in the form of a positive self-image and personal development by actualizing one&#x27;s unique talents and abilities. Two key principles of Maslow&#x27;s theory are the &quot;progression principle&quot; and the &quot;deficit principle&quot;. They state that lower needs have to be fulfilled before higher needs become activated. This means that higher needs, like esteem and self-actualization, are unable to provide full motivation while lower needs, like food and shelter, remain unfulfilled. An influential extension of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs was proposed by Clayton Alderfer in the form of his ERG theory.

Herzberg&#x27;s Two-Factor Theory also analyzes motivation in terms of lower and higher needs. Herzberg applies it specifically to the workplace and distinguishes between lower-lever hygiene factors and higher-level motivators. Hygiene factors are associated with the work environment and conditions. Examples include company policies, supervision, salary, and job security. They are essential to prevent job dissatisfaction and associated negative behavior, such as frequent absence or decreased effort. Motivators are more directly related to work itself. They include the nature of the work and the associated responsibility as well as recognition and personal and professional growth opportunities. They are responsible for job satisfaction as well as increased commitment and creativity. This theory implies, for example, that increasing salary and job security may not be sufficient to fully motivate workers if their higher needs are not met.

McClelland&#x27;s learned needs theory states that individuals have three primary needs: affiliation, power, and achievement. The need for affiliation is a desire to form social connections with others. The need for power is a longing to exert control over one&#x27;s surroundings and wield influence over others. The need for achievement relates to a yearning to establish ambitious objectives and to receive positive feedback on one&#x27;s performance. McClelland holds that these needs are present in everyone but that their exact form, strength, and expression is shaped by cultural influences and the individual&#x27;s experiences. For example, affiliation-oriented individuals are primarily motivated by establishing and maintaining social relations while achievement-oriented individuals are inclined to set challenging goals and strive for personal excellence. More emphasis on the need of affiliation tends to be given in collectivist cultures in contrast to a focus on the need of achievement in individualist cultures.

=== Major process theories ===
Expectancy theory states that whether a person is motivated to perform a certain behavior depends on the expected results of this behavior: the more positive the expected results are, the higher the motivation to engage in that behavior. Expectancy theorists understand the expected results in terms of three factors: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. Expectancy concerns the relation between effort and performance. If the expectancy of a behavior is high then the person believes that their efforts will likely result in successful performance. Instrumentality concerns the relation between performance and outcomes. If the instrumentality of a performance is high then the person believes that it will likely result in the intended outcomes. Valence is the degree to which the outcomes are attractive to the person. These three components affect each other in a multiplicative way, meaning that high motivation is only present if all of them are high. In this case, the person believes it likely that they perform well, that the performance leads to the expected result, and that the result as a high value.

Equity theory sees fairness as a key aspect of motivation. According to it, people are interested in the proportion between effort and reward: they judge how much energy one has to invest and how good the outcome is. Equity theory states that individuals assess fairness by comparing their own ratio of effort and reward to the ratio of others. A key idea of equity theory is that people are motivated to reduce perceived inequity. This is especially the case if they feel that they receive less rewards than others. For example, if an employee has the impression that they work longer than their co-workers while receiving the same salary, this may motivate them to ask for a raise.

Goal-setting theory holds that having clearly defined goals is one of the key factors of motivation. It states that effective goals are specific and challenging. A goal is specific if it involves a clear objective, such as a quantifiable target one intends to reach rather than just trying to do one&#x27;s best. A goal is challenging if it is achievable but hard to reach. Two additional factors identified by goal-setting theorists are goal commitment and self-efficacy. Commitment is a person&#x27;s dedication to achieving a goal and includes an unwillingness to abandon or change the goal when meeting resistance. To have self-efficacy means to believe in oneself and in one&#x27;s ability to succeed. This belief can help people persevere through obstacles and remain motivated to reach challenging goals.

According to self-determination theory, the main factors influencing motivation are autonomy, competence, and connection. People act autonomously if they decide themselves what to do rather than following orders. This tends to increase motivation since humans usually prefer to act in accordance with their wishes, values, and goals without being coerced by external forces. If a person is competent at a certain task then they tend to feel good about the work itself and its results. Lack of competence can decrease motivation by leading to frustration if one&#x27;s efforts fail to succeed. Connection is another factor identified by self-determination theorists and concerns the social environment. Motivation tends to be reinforced for activities in which a person can positively relate to others, receives approval, and can reach out for help.

Reinforcement theory is based on behaviorism and explains motivation in relation to positive and negative outcomes of previous behavior. It uses the principle of operant conditioning, which states that behavior followed by positive consequences is more likely to be repeated, while behavior followed by negative consequences is less likely to be repeated. This theory predicts, for example, that if an aggressive behavior of a child is rewarded then this will reinforce the child&#x27;s motivation for aggressive behavior in the future.

== In various fields ==
=== Neurology ===
In neurology, motivation is studied from a physiological perspective by examining the brain processes and brain areas involved in motivational phenomena. Neurology uses data from both humans and animals, which it obtains through a variety of methods, including the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. It investigates regular motivational processes, pathological cases, and the effect of possible treatments. It is a complex discipline that relies on insights from fields like clinical, experimental, and comparative psychology.

Neurologists understand motivation as a multifaceted phenomenon that integrates and processes signals to make complex decisions and coordinate actions. Motivation is influenced by the organism&#x27;s physiological state, like stress, information about the environment, and personal history, like past experiences with this environment. All this information is integrated to perform a cost–benefit analysis, which considers the time, effort, and discomfort associated with pursuing a goal as well as positive outcomes, like fulfilling one&#x27;s needs or escaping harm. This form of reward prediction is associated with several brain areas, like the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the basolateral amygdala. The dopamine system plays a key role in learning which positive and negative outcomes are associated with a specific behavior and how certain signals, like environmental cues, are related to specific goals. Through these associations, motivation can automatically arise when the signals are present. For example, if a person associates having a certain type of food with a specific time of day then they may automatically feel motivated to eat this food when the time arrives.

=== Education ===

Motivation plays a key role in education since it affects the students&#x27; engagement with the studied topic and shapes their learning experience and academic success. Motivated students are more likely to participate in classroom activities and persevere through challenges. One of the responsibilities of educators and educational institutions is to establish a learning environment that fosters and sustains students&#x27; motivation to ensure effective learning.

Educational research is particularly interested in understanding the different effects that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation have on the learning process. In the case of intrinsic motivation, students are interested in the subject and the learning experience itself. Students driven by extrinsic motivation seek external rewards, like good grades or peer recognition. Intrinsic motivation is often seen as the preferred type of motivation since it is associated with more in-depth learning, better memory retention, and long-term commitment. Extrinsic motivation in the form of rewards and recognition also plays a key role in the learning process. However, it can conflict with intrinsic motivation in some cases and may then hinder creativity.

Various factors influence student motivation. It is usually beneficial to have an organized classroom with few distractions. The learning material should be neither too easy, which threatens to bore students, nor too difficult, which can lead to frustration. The behavior of the teacher also has a significant impact on student motivation, for example, in regard to how the material is presented, the feedback they provide on assignments, and the interpersonal relation they build with the students. Teachers who are patient and supportive can encourage interaction by interpreting mistakes as learning opportunities.

=== Work ===
Work motivation is an often-studied topic in the fields of organization studies and organizational behavior. They aim to understand human motivation in the context of organizations and investigate its role in work and work-related activities including human resource management, employee selection, training, and managerial practices. Motivation plays a key role in the workplace on various levels. It impacts how employees feel about their work, their level of determination, commitment, and overall job satisfaction. It also affects employee performance and overall business success. Lack of motivation can lead to decreased productivity due to complacency, disinterest, and absenteeism. According to a 2024 Gallup report, 8.9 trillion dollars were lost in global GDP due to low engagement. It can also manifest in the form of occupational burnout.

Various factors influence work motivation. They include the personal needs and expectations of the employees, the characteristics of the tasks they perform, and whether the work conditions are perceived as fair and just. Another key aspect is how managers communicate and provide feedback.  Understanding and managing employee motivation is essential for managers to ensure effective leadership, employee performance, and business success. Cultural differences can have a significant impact on how to motivate workers. For example, workers from economically advanced countries may respond better to higher-order goals like self-actualization while the fulfillment of more basic needs tends to be more central for workers from less economically developed countries.

There are different approaches to increasing employee motivation. Some focus on material benefits, like high salary, health care, stock ownership plans, profit-sharing, and company cars. Others aim to make changes to the design of the job itself. For example, overly simplified and segmented jobs tend to result in decreased productivity and lower employee morale. The dynamics of motivation differ between paid work and volunteer work. Intrinsic motivation plays a larger role for volunteers with key motivators being self-esteem, the desire to help others, career advancement, and self-improvement.

=== Sport ===
Motivation is a fundamental aspect of sports. It affects how consistently athletes train, how much effort they are willing to invest, and how well they persevere through challenges. Proper motivation is an influential factor for athletic success. It concerns both the long-term motivation needed to sustain progress and commitment over an extended period as well as the short-term motivation required to mobilize as much energy as possible for a high performance on the same day.

It is the responsibility of coaches not just to advise and instruct athletes on training plans and strategies but also to motivate them to put in the required effort and give their best. There are different coaching styles and the right approach may depend on the personalities of the coach, the athlete, and the group as well as the general athletic situation. Some styles focus on realizing a particular goal while others concentrate on teaching, following certain principles, or building a positive interpersonal relationship.

=== Criminal law ===
The motive of a crime is a key aspect in criminal law. It refers to reasons that the accused had for committing a crime. Motives are often used as evidence to demonstrate why the accused might have committed the crime and how they would benefit from it. The absence of a motive can be used as evidence to put the accused&#x27;s involvement in the crime into doubt. For example, financial gain is a motive to commit a crime from which the perpetrator would financially benefit, like embezzlement.

As a technical term, &quot;motive&quot; is distinguished from &quot;intent&quot;. Intent is the mental state of the defendant and belongs to mens rea. A motive is a reason that tempts a person to form an intent. Unlike intent, motive is usually not an essential element of a crime: it plays various roles in investigative considerations but is normally not required to establish the defendant&#x27;s guilt.

In a different sense, motivation also plays a role in justifying why convicted offenders should be punished. According to the deterrence theory of law, one key aspect of punishment for law violation is to motivate both the convicted individual and potential future wrongdoers to not engage in similar criminal behavior.

=== Others ===
Motivation is a central factor in implementing and maintaining lifestyle changes in the fields of personal development and health. Personal development is a process of self-improvement aimed at enhancing one&#x27;s skills, knowledge, talents, and overall well-being. It is realized through practices that promote growth and improve different areas in one&#x27;s life. Motivation is pivotal in engaging in these practices. It is especially relevant to ensure long-term commitment and to follow through with one&#x27;s plans. For example, health-related lifestyle changes may at times require high willpower and self-control to implement meaningful adjustments while resisting impulses and bad habits. This is the case when trying to resist urges to smoke, consume alcohol, and eat fattening food.

Motivation plays a key role in economics since it is what drives individuals and organizations to make economic decisions and engage in economic activities. It affects diverse processes involving consumer behavior, labor supply, and investment decisions. For example, rational choice theory, a fundamental theory in economics, postulates that individuals are motivated by self-interest and aim to maximize their utility, which guides economic behavior like consumption choices.

In video games, player motivation is what drives people to play a game and engage with its contents. Player motivation often revolves around completing certain objectives, like solving a puzzle, beating an enemy, or exploring the game world. It concerns both smaller objectives within a part of the game as well as finishing the game as a whole. Understanding different types of player motivation helps game designers make their games immersive and appealing to a wide audience.

Motivation is also relevant in the field of politics. This is true specifically for democracies to ensure active engagement, participation, and voting.

<text>Reichswehr (; ) was the official name of the German armed forces during the Weimar Republic and the first two years of Nazi Germany. After Germany was defeated in World War I, the Imperial German Army () was dissolved in order to be reshaped into a peacetime army. From it a provisional &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was formed in March 1919. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the rebuilt German Army was subject to severe limitations in size, structure and armament. The official formation of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; took place on 1 January 1921 after the limitations had been met. The German armed forces kept the name &quot;Reichswehr&quot; until Adolf Hitler&#x27;s 1935 proclamation of the &quot;restoration of military sovereignty&quot;, at which point it became part of the new .

Although ostensibly apolitical, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; acted as a state within a state, and its leadership was an important political power factor in the Weimar Republic. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; sometimes supported the democratic government, as it did in the Ebert-Groener Pact when it pledged its loyalty to the Republic, and sometimes backed anti-democratic forces through such means as the Black Reichswehr, the illegal paramilitary groups it sponsored in contravention of the Versailles Treaty. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; saw itself as a cadre army that would preserve the expertise of the old imperial military and form the basis for German rearmament.

==Structure of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;==
===Arms limitations under the Treaty of Versailles===
In Part V of the 1919 Versailles Treaty, Germany had obligated itself to limit the size and armaments of its military forces so that they could be used only as border protection and for the maintenance of order within Germany.

In accordance with the treaty&#x27;s provisions, personnel strength was limited to a professional army of 100,000 men plus a 15,000-man navy. The establishment of a general staff was prohibited. Heavy weapons above defined calibres, armoured vehicles, submarines and large warships were prohibited, as was any type of air force. The regulations were overseen by the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control until 1927.

Conscription into the German Army had traditionally been for a period of 1 to 3 years. After they had completed their terms of service, the discharged soldiers created a large pool of trained reserves. The Versailles Treaty fixed the term of service for &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officers at 25 years and for all others at 12 in order to prevent such a buildup of reservists.

===Founding===
On 9 November 1918, at the beginning of the German Revolution that led to the collapse of the German Empire and the flight of Emperor Wilhelm II, a republic was proclaimed from Berlin. The next day, German Chancellor Friedrich Ebert and General Wilhelm Groener, acting in the name of the Supreme Army Command, concluded the Ebert–Groener Pact. In it Groener assured Ebert of the loyalty of the armed forces, and in return Ebert promised that the government would take prompt action against leftist uprisings, call a national assembly, keep the military command within the professional officer corps and, most importantly, retain the military&#x27;s traditional status as &#x27;state within a state&#x27; – that is, it would continue to be largely independent of the civilian government.

As part of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the new German government agreed to the speedy evacuation of occupied territories. The withdrawal on the western front began on 12 November and by 17 January 1919 the areas on the west bank of the Rhine were free of German military forces. The task was then to gradually disarm the units of the Imperial Army which still numbered several million soldiers. This was done at previously designated demobilisation sites, usually the respective home garrisons. For the regiments with garrisons on the west bank of the Rhine, demobilisation sites were designated in the interior of the Reich.

The Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies – the &quot;de facto&quot; government of Germany from November 1918 until February 1919 – and the Supreme Army Command intended to transfer the remaining units to a peacetime army following demobilisation. On 6 March 1919 the Weimar National Assembly passed a law on the formation of a provisional army to be made up of 43 brigades. It authorised the Reich President &quot;to dissolve the existing army and to form a provisional &quot;Reichswehr&quot; which, until the creation of a new armed force to be ordered by Reich law, would protect the borders of the Reich, enforce the orders of the Reich government, and maintain domestic peace and order.&quot;

A similarly worded law on the formation of a provisional navy dated 16 April 1919 authorised it to &quot;secure the German coasts, enable safe maritime traffic by clearing mines, acting as maritime police and otherwise assisting merchant shipping, ensure the undisturbed exercise of fishing, enforce the orders of the Reich government in conjunction with the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and maintain peace and order.&quot; The strength of the navy was to be 20,000 men.

From 1 October 1919 to 1 April 1920, the forces of the Provisional Reich Army were moved into the 400,000-strong &#x27;Transitional Army&#x27; consisting of 20 brigades. At the same time, the old army&#x27;s units and duties were eliminated. After falling to 150,000 men in October 1920, the brigades were replaced by regiments, and the final army strength of 100,000 was reached by 1 January 1921. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was officially formed on that date, with the Defence Law of 23 March 1921 regulating the details. The soldiers&#x27; oath was sworn to the Weimar Constitution.

===Structure===

The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was divided into the (army) and the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; (navy). The consisted of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions, with all units renumbered. The Reich&#x27;s territory was divided into seven military districts. There were two group commands, No. 1 in Berlin and No. 2 in Kassel. The navy was allowed a limited number of certain types of ships and boats, with no submarines. It was divided into Naval Station Baltic Sea and Naval Station North Sea. Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the service period for enlisted men and non-commissioned officers in both the army and the navy was 12 years, with 25 years for officers.

The 1921 Defence Law ended the military sovereignty of the states but left Saxony, Württemberg, Baden, and Bavaria with limited independence. Bavaria was special in that Military District VII covered the entire territory of the state with the exception of the Palatinate, and only Bavarians served in the 7th (Bavarian) Division. Until 1924 this unit, known as the Bavarian &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, enjoyed certain rights of autonomy with respect to the Reich government.

===Commanders===

According to the Weimar Constitution, the Reich President had &quot;supreme command over the entire armed forces of the Reich&quot;. In general, however, he could act only if there was a countersignature by a member of the government. In terms of authority, this was the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; minister.

Two Reich Presidents held office during the Weimar Republic: Friedrich Ebert until 1925, followed by Paul von Hindenburg. The first &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister was Gustav Noske, who was replaced by Otto Gessler after the Kapp Putsch in 1920. Wilhelm Groener took office in 1928, and his deputy Kurt von Schleicher replaced him in 1932. Schleicher continued to hold office on a provisional basis during his two-month chancellorship. Prior to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Reich chancellor, Hindenburg unilaterally – not at the chancellor&#x27;s recommendation as required by the constitution – appointed Werner von Blomberg as &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister.

The head of army command was initially General Walther Reinhardt. After the Kapp Putsch, General Hans von Seeckt took over the post and had both the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Nazi Party banned in 1923. Wilhelm Heye followed him in 1926. Heye was succeeded in 1930 by Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord, who tendered his resignation on 27 December 1933. He was succeeded by Werner von Fritsch.

===Social composition===
Given the limited size of the army, careful selection of personnel was possible. Experienced leaders came from the &#x27;Old Army&#x27; of the Empire. In 1927, 20% of the officers were from the former nobility, down from 30% in 1913. This continued the long-term trend of a reduction in the percentage of noble officers. Large parts of the officer corps held a conservative, monarchist worldview and rejected the Weimar Republic. Especially within the former nobility, however, the stance towards National Socialism was not without criticism.

The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; leadership and officer corps successfully resisted the democratisation of the troops. Preference was given to recruits from the predominantly conservative rural areas of Germany. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; leadership considered them not only physically superior to young men from the cities but also as able to stand up against the &quot;temptations&quot; of social democracy.

In 1926 Reichstag President Paul Löbe proposed to make recruitment dependent on physical fitness only in order to make the composition of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; reflect more closely that of society as a whole. The proposal led to fierce opposition from the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and conservative circles, both of which believed that opening the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to all social groups would lower its effectiveness. Löbe&#x27;s proposal did not pass.

The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; saw itself as a &#x27;cadre army&#x27; or &#x27;Leader army&#x27; (&quot;), which meant that every unit kept close ties to its former members and could hope to call on them in a time of need. This was to become a basic prerequisite for the rapid growth of the army after the proclamation of military sovereignty by the Nazi regime in 1935.

===Officers in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;===
Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was allowed 4,000 officers, while the could have 1,500 officers and deck officers. The actual &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officer corps numbered 3,718, down from 227,081 in 1918, of whom 38,118 were career officers. The officers transferred to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; were almost all general staff officers. Of the approximately 15,000 men who had been promoted to officers during the war, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; took on only a few, as these front-line officers were seen as alien to officer life in the mess hall, barracks, and society. Democratically-minded officers were not accepted into the force. Radical nationalist officers were with few exceptions removed, especially after the Kapp Putsch.

The political attitude of the officer corps was monarchist, although outwardly they posed as loyal to the Republic. Even though the German nobility, which was officially abolished in August 1919, had accounted for only 0.14% of the pre-war German population, an average of 23.8% of the officers in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; were from noble backgrounds. The proportion of former noble officers in the individual branches of the armed forces varied greatly. In 1920 they made up 50% of the officers in the cavalry but only 5% in the infantry and 4% in the sappers. Of the approximately 1,000 non-commissioned officers promoted to officers in 1919, by 1928 only 117 remained, or 3.5% of the total officers in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;.

Since the Reich government did not bring the officer candidate recruitment process under state control, regimental commanders in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; continued to be responsible for selecting officer candidates, as they had in the old Imperial Army. Those admitted came almost exclusively from circles traditionally close to the military. In 1926, 96% of the officer candidates came from the upper social classes and nearly 50% from officer families. The homogeneity of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officer corps was in fact greater than it had been during the Empire. In 1912/13 only 24% of officers had come from families of active or former officers.

==&quot;Reichswehr&quot; in the Weimar Republic==
By assuring Friedrich Ebert of its loyalty in the November 1918 Ebert-Groener Pact, the military had ensured the survival of the new government. In the crisis-ridden early 1920s, the Republic used the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; primarily to fight insurgent left-wing forces, such as during the Spartacist uprising in Berlin in 1919.

===Cooperation with the &quot;Freikorps&quot;===
Wherever the Treaty of Versailles tied the &quot;Reichswehr&#x27;s&quot; hands or its own manpower was insufficient, it left &#x27;national defence&#x27; – e.g. border skirmishes against Polish and Lithuanian irregulars, or deployment in 1920 against the Ruhr uprising in the demilitarised Rhineland – to the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, which continued to operate even though it had been officially disbanded in 1920. In 1923 General von Seeckt, who had the backing of Otto Gessler, organised &quot;civilian work groups&quot; called (AKs) that were attached to &quot;Reichswehr&quot; units and received training and support from them. The AKs, better known as the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, whose members were largely ex-Freikorps, had a peak strength of about 20,000 men and allowed the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to clandestinely exceed the Versailles Treaty&#x27;s 100,000-man limit. On 1 October 1923, about 4,000 of its members attempted a putsch at Küstrin on the Oder river east of Berlin. After its failure, Seeckt quickly had the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; disbanded.

&quot;Reichswehr&quot; generals also maintained close contacts with politically right-wing, anti-republican military associations such as the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; and &quot;Kyffhäuserbund&quot;, although the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officially described itself as &quot;apolitical&quot;.

===Passivity during the Kapp Putsch===

In March 1920, Germany&#x27;s political leadership did not use the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; against the Kapp Putsch, a failed coup attempt against the Weimar Republic. It occurred after the government tried to demobilise two &quot;Freikorps&quot; brigades and one of them, the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, refused to disband. When Defence Minister Noske consulted with the &quot;Reichswehr&#x27;s&quot; leadership, only General Reinhardt, Chief of Army Command, recommended the use of army troops in defence of the government. The rest of the generals, including Hans von Seeckt, chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; – the disguised general staff of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; – advised against deploying troops. He is reported to have said, &quot;&quot;Reichswehr&quot; will not fire on &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot;. The only alternative left to the government was to flee Berlin. (By contrast, the left-wing Ruhr uprising, which began during the Kapp Putsch, was ruthlessly put down with the active involvement of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;.) As a result of the Kapp Putsch, Noske was replaced by Otto Gessler.

===Circumvention of the Treaty of Versailles===
The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; leadership began early on to circumvent the arms restrictions in the Versailles Treaty through a series of secret and illegal measures. They included the clandestine establishment of the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, unauthorised weapons testing in the Soviet Union, the establishment of a Leaders&#x27; Assistant Training School () which was intended to compensate for the forbidden General Staff training, and the maintenance of the General Staff in the newly created . Under the code name &#x27;Statistical Society&#x27;, plans for an armaments industry were worked out with the Reich Federation of German Industry. With the help of retired officers, sports schools for training infantrymen were founded, most of them near former military training areas, where exercise instructors for military sports were trained. This took place, especially in northern Germany, with the support of the veterans&#x27; group &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. Other aids in military training included the use of dummy tanks for exercise purposes.

===Secret cooperation with the Soviet Union===
In February 1923 the new Chief of the , Major General Otto Hasse, travelled to Moscow for secret negotiations. Germany was to support the development of Soviet industry, and Red Army commanders were to receive general staff training in Germany. In return, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was able to expand secretly in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles. It was given the opportunity to obtain artillery from the Soviet Union, to train aviation and tank specialists on Soviet soil, and to have chemical warfare agents manufactured and tested. A secret &quot;Reichswehr&quot; aviation school and testing facility was established at Lipetsk, where some 120 military pilots, 100 aerial observers, and numerous ground personnel were trained as the core of a future German Air Force. At Kazan, tank specialists were trained, but not until 1930 and to a number of only about thirty. At the Tomka gas test site near Saratov, chemical warfare agents were jointly tested and developed.

In December 1926, Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann disclosed the collaboration with the Soviet Union to the Reichstag, toppling the government under Wilhelm Marx. In 1931 Carl von Ossietzky and Walter Kreiser were convicted of espionage in the &quot;Weltbühne&quot; Trial for a 1929 report in the weekly &quot;Weltbühne&quot; on the collaboration, which was by then already known.

===Crisis in Bavaria and the Beer Hall Putsch===

On 26 September 1923, the Bavarian government declared a state of emergency and placed executive power in the hands of Gustav Ritter von Kahr as state commissioner. The government in Berlin responded by declaring a nationwide state of emergency, and President Ebert transferred executive power to Otto Gessler. After General Otto von Lossow, who was in command of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; troops in Bavaria, refused to act on Gessler&#x27;s order to ban the Nazi newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, the Reich government had few options to enforce the subsequent order to relieve Lossow of his command. Seeckt&#x27;s dictum that &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would not fire on &quot;Reichswehr&quot; still stood. When news of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Beer Hall Putsch reached Berlin on 8 November, Ebert transferred executive power from Gessler to Seeckt, even though there was no assurance that he would act in the interests of the Republic. Given the way events in Munich unfolded, there was no need for Seeckt to take direct action. Kahr turned against Hitler, and the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; division in Bavaria did not support the putsch. In February 1924 Seeckt relinquished the executive powers he had received through Ebert.

===Seeckt and the events of 1924–1932===
The 1925 Locarno Treaties ruled out any forcible change in Germany&#x27;s western borders, and in 1926 Germany joined the League of Nations. While war continued to be seen in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; as a means to achieve political goals, government policy under the Locarno Treaties and the Dawes Plan, which for the short term resolved the issue of German reparations payments to the victorious powers, was oriented more toward maintaining peace and international understanding. Seeckt and his officers were opposed to joining the League of Nations and saw their existence threatened by the pacifism of Germany&#x27;s left.

After the election of Paul von Hindenburg as Reich president in 1925, his status as victor in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg made him a figure with whom &quot;Reichswehr&quot; soldiers identified. In October 1926, without seeking government approval, Seeckt invited the son of former emperor Wilhelm II to attend army manoeuvres in the uniform of the old Imperial 1st Foot Guards. It created a storm when the republican press publicised the transgression. Gessler told Hindenburg that Seeckt had to resign or he would do so himself. He was supported by the cabinet, so Hindenburg asked for and received Seeckt&#x27;s resignation on 9 October.

Seeckt was succeeded by General Wilhelm Heye, although it was primarily General Kurt von Schleicher who gained additional power. Under his leadership, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; intervened in politics more often in order to achieve its goals, with the result that the Republic and the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; moved closer together.

In February 1927 the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control, which until then had supervised disarmament, withdrew from Germany.

The decision to build the pocket battleship &quot;Deutschland&quot; in 1928, which was in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and seen as a matter of prestige, caused problems for the Social Democrat Reich Chancellor Hermann Müller because his party had campaigned against the ship, but his cabinet members voted for it in order to save the coalition government. For the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; leadership, the vote was a landmark political decision. The 1929 budget included the first instalment for the &quot;Deutschland&#x27;s&quot; sister ship, the &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;.

The rapprochement between the Republic and the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; brought the greatest gains to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. It achieved an increase in the defence budget, and criticism of the increase was seen as an attack on the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and thus on the state.

===End of the Weimar Republic===
Because of Hindenburg&#x27;s support for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, the presidential cabinets from 1930 onward increased its power. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning was embraced as a former soldier by the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Franz von Papen and Kurt Schleicher, the two chancellors who followed Brüning, considered using the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; as part of their plans to abolish democracy. In addition, one of the presidential cabinets&#x27; main objectives was a revision of the Treaty of Versailles that would do away with the military limitations it imposed.

In 1931 and 1932, a series of actions by the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and its leadership showed its increasing power and drift towards the Nazis:
* When the Harzburg Front, an anti-democratic alliance that included the Nazi Party, was formed in 1931, fifteen men who were admirals or generals during the First World War – including Hans von Seeckt – were present.
* In 1932 &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister Groener, under pressure from several German states, outlawed the Nazi &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). He did so in his capacity as acting minister of the Interior, whereas his goal as &quot;Reichswehr&quot; minister was to integrate the SA into a non-partisan paramilitary force. Schleicher, Groener&#x27;s subordinate at the Ministry of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, told him that by outlawing the SA he had lost the trust of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and as a result he resigned as &quot;Reichswehr&quot; minister.
* On 13 September 1932, at the initiative of President Hindenburg, the Reich Board for Youth Training was founded for the military education of German youth. It was implemented by Chancellor Schleicher, then disbanded and merged into the Hitler Youth in 1933.
* In the Prussian coup d&#x27;état of July 1932, violent unrest in Altona (Hamburg), particularly a bloody clash between the police, the SA and communists, led Chancellor Papen to use an emergency decree issued by President Hindenburg under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to temporarily transfer executive power in Prussia to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; minister.

While Seeckt was head of the Army Command, he reorganized the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; so that it could be rapidly expanded when free of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. He had done so while accepting the Weimar Republic as the framework in which he had to work, in spite of his fundamental dislike of parliamentary democracy. Following his forced resignation in 1926, von Schleicher became the driving force behind shaping the military. He used a more &quot;modern&quot; approach that relied on a combination of political, military, and economic factors. Germany&#x27;s economic position was to be strengthened and France relegated to the role of a junior partner. The supremacy thus gained in Europe was to form the basis for a position of world power. Historian Klaus-Jürgen Müller sees in this one of the &quot;lines of continuity&quot; of German development from the Empire to National Socialism and the cause of an &quot;entente&quot; between the traditional military elites and the Hitler movement in 1933. Hitler was dependent on their support in his rise to power, while Schleicher and the military needed Hitler&#x27;s supporters as a &quot;mass base&quot;.

===State within a state===
Historians of the Weimar Republic differ on the question of whether the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was a &quot;state within a state&quot;. Those who argue that it was point to an officer corps that opposed the parliamentary republic and to General von Seeckt&#x27;s insistence that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; be apolitical, a position that was supported by the laws of the Reich, which denied members of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; the right to vote and subjected them to internal &quot;Reichswehr&quot; jurisdiction. By distancing itself from politics and the government, the &quot;Reichswehr&#x27;s&quot; relationship to the civilian leadership became problematic. Its loyalty was to an abstract state rather than the regime, and its insulation from the political world of itself led to it becoming a state within the state. In his 1929 &quot;Thoughts of a Soldier (&quot;&quot;)&quot;, Seeckt wrote, &quot;The Army should become a State within the State, but it should be merged into the State through service; in fact it should itself become the purest image of the State.&quot; The outward situation changed in 1928 when the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; created the , or Office of Ministerial Affairs, under Kurt von Schleicher to lobby the government. In the late 1920s, the parliamentary system was beginning to break down and move towards the presidential cabinets of Brüning, Papen and Schleicher. The military had strengthened itself during its period of isolation, and through President Hindenburg was able as a state within the state to exert significant control over the choice of chancellor and the political direction of the Reich.

Those on the other side of the issue argue that the subordination of the military to the constitutional institutions of the Republic prevented the creation of a state within a state. Articles 46 and 47 of the Weimar Constitution gave the president of the Reich &quot;supreme command over the entire military forces of the Reich&quot; and the power to appoint and remove military officers. Peace treaties and declarations of war required a national law (Article 45), which had to originate from and be approved by the legislature. In addition, General Seeckt was fundamentally loyal and helped the state to consolidate. When in 1923 Defence Minister Otto Gessler was given executive functions to deal with the nation&#x27;s crises, the power went in essence to Seeckt. He acted in the interests of Germany in preventing a possible civil war over the end of passive resistance to the occupation of the Ruhr and then during the communist threat of the German October in Saxony and Thuringia. Maintaining the integrity of the Reich and the Army were his top priorities. With the power in his hands, he could have staged a putsch or made himself dictator, but he did neither and voluntarily returned the powers to the political authorities when the crises had passed. And in 1926, he lost his position as head of the Army Command at the demand of &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister Gessler.

==&quot;Reichswehr&quot; under Adolf Hitler==

After becoming chancellor at the end of January 1933, Hitler presented his government program to the generals on 3 February. He promised them among other things that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would remain Germany&#x27;s sole armed force and announced the reintroduction of conscription. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; hoped for increased efforts to revise the Treaty of Versailles and to build a strong military and firm state leadership, but it also feared that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would be supplanted by the 3 million member SA. Its leader Ernst Röhm and his colleagues thought of their force as the future army of Germany, replacing the smaller &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and its professional officers. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; supported Hitler in taking power away from the SA in the summer of 1934. Röhm wanted to become &quot;Reichswehr&quot; minister, and in February 1934 demanded that the much smaller &quot;Reichswehr&quot; be merged into the SA to form a true people&#x27;s army. This alarmed both political and military leaders, and to forestall the possibility of a coup Hitler sided with conservative leaders and the military. In the Night of the Long Knives (30 June–2 July 1934) Röhm and the leadership of the SA were murdered along with many other political adversaries of the Nazis, including &quot;Reichswehr&quot; generals Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officer corps acknowledged the murders without objection.
During 1933 and 1934 the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; began a secret program of expansion. In December 1933 the army staff decided to increase the active strength to 300,000 men in 21 divisions. On 1 April 1934, between 50,000 and 60,000 new recruits entered the force and were assigned to special training battalions. The original seven infantry divisions of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; were expanded to 21, with military district headquarters increased to the size of a corps headquarters on 1 October 1934. These divisions used cover names to hide their divisional size, but during October 1935 they were dropped. Also during October 1934, the officers who had been forced to retire in 1919 were recalled. Those who were no longer fit for combat were assigned to administrative positions, thus releasing fit officers for front-line duties.

On 2 August 1934, the day Hindenburg died, &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister Werner von Blomberg, who was originally to have helped &#x27;tame&#x27; the Nazis, had the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; swear its oath personally to Hitler. Under the Weimar Republic the oath had been to the constitution.

On 1 March 1935, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was established and on 16 March universal conscription was reintroduced, both of which violated the Treaty of Versailles. In the same act, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was renamed the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. On 1 June 1935, the (the army contingent of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;) was renamed &quot; (&#x27;army&#x27;) and the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; became the Kriegsmarine (&#x27;war navy&#x27;).

<text>A free-trade zone (FTZ) is a class of special economic zone. It is a geographic area where goods may be imported, stored, handled, manufactured, or reconfigured and re-exported under specific customs regulation and generally not subject to customs duty. Free trade zones are generally organized around major seaports, international airports, and national frontiers—areas with many geographic advantages for trade.

==Definition==
The World Bank defines free trade zones as &quot;small, fenced-in, duty-free areas, offering warehousing, storage, and distribution facilities for trade, transshipment, and re-export operations&quot;. Free-trade zones can also be defined as labor-intensive manufacturing centers that involve the import of raw materials or components and the export of factory products, but this is a dated definition as more and more free-trade zones focus on service industries such as software, back-office operations, research, and financial services.

===Synonyms===
Free-trade zones are referred to as &quot;foreign-trade zones&quot; in the United States (Foreign Trade Zones Act of 1934), where FTZs provide customs-related advantages as well as exemptions from state and local inventory taxes. In other countries, they have been called &quot;duty-free export processing zones,&quot; &quot;export-free zones,&quot; &quot;export processing zones,&quot; &quot;free export zones,&quot; &quot;free zones,&quot; &quot;industrial free zones,&quot; &quot;investment promotion zones,&quot; &quot;maquiladoras,&quot; and &quot;special economic zones&quot;. Some were previously called &quot;free ports&quot;. Free zones range from specific-purpose manufacturing facilities to areas where legal systems and economic regulation vary from the normal provisions of the country concerned. 

Free zones may reduce or eliminate taxes, customs duties, and regulatory requirements for registration of business. Zones around the world often provide special exemptions from normal immigration procedures and foreign investment restrictions as well as other features. Free zones are intended to foster economic activity and employment that could occur elsewhere.

==Export-processing zone==
An export-processing zone (EPZ) is a specific type of FTZ usually set up in developing countries by their governments to promote industrial and commercial exports. According to the World Bank, &quot;an export processing zone is an industrial estate, usually a fenced-in area of 10 to 300 hectares, that specializes in manufacturing for export. It offers firms free trade conditions and a liberal regulatory environment. Its objectives are to attract foreign investors, collaborators, and buyers who can facilitate entry into the world market for some of the economy&#x27;s industrial goods, thus generating employment and foreign exchange&quot;. Most FTZs are located in developing countries; Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, El Salvador, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and Madagascar all have EPZ programs. In 1997, 93 countries had set up export processing zones, employing 22.5 million people, and five years later, in 2003, EPZs in 116 countries employed 43 million people.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, 25 Export-Processing Zones have been authorized in 17 states, and 19 of them have been implemented. Brazilian government launched the first Export processing zones in 1988, aiming to fight the unbalances in the country. First EPZ area in operation was located near of the Port of Pecém in Ceará. Companies in these areas are benefited from tax exemptions and incentives at the ICMS Tax (State Value-Added Tax). Some Brazilian states offer other regional incentives. Companies also can take advantage of a Foreign exchange treatment supported by the law that created the EPZ and proximity of Custom authorities with offices inside the EPZ.

===China===
China has specific rules differentiating an EPZ from a FTZ. For example, 70% of goods in EPZs must be exported, but there is no such quota for FTZs.
==Free economic zone==
Free economic zones (FEZ), free economic territories (FETs) or free zones (FZ) are a class of special economic zone (SEZ) designated by the trade and commerce administrations of various countries. The term is used to designate areas in which companies are taxed very lightly or not at all to encourage economic activity. The taxation rules and duties are determined by each country. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) has content on the conditions and benefits of free zones.

Some special economic zones are called free ports or free trade ports. Sometimes they have historically been endowed with favorable customs regulations, such as the free port of Trieste, or the newer free trade port on Hainan Island.

===Definition===
The definition should be understood in meaning The International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Revised Kyoto Convention) uses the term “free zones” which the revised convention describes as “a part of the territory of a Contracting Party where any goods introduced are generally regarded, insofar as import duties and taxes are concerned, as being outside the customs territory”.

According to the World Bank, the main types of special economic zones are:

# Free-trade zones (FTZ)
# Export processing zones (EPZ)
# Free economic zones (FZ/FEZ)
# Industrial parks/estates (IE)
# Free ports
# Bonded logistics parks (BLP)
# Urban enterprise zones

=== History ===
An early type of special economic zone was &quot;free ports&quot;, these historically were endowed with favorable customs regulations. In modern times, &quot;free port&quot; has come to mean a specific type of special economic zone, for example LADOL.

All &quot;free ports&quot; in the world were permitted by the respective states, save the Free Port of Trieste that with the signing of the 16th Resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations (10 January 1947) and the signing of the Treaty of Peace with Italy (10 February 1947, ratified 15 September 1947) was put territorially under the sovereignty of the United Nations itself. As cited on Annex VIII, Article 3, paragraph 2: &quot;The establishment of special zones in the Free Port under the exclusive jurisdiction of any State is incompatible with the status of the Free Territory and of the Free Port&quot;. For example, it was not possible to apply the &quot;Italian Law on Ports&quot; in the extraterritorial free zones of the UN Free Port of Trieste with the effect that all actual territorial concessions were null and void.

In 1954, the Free Territory of Trieste was dissolved and given to its neighbours, Italy and Yugoslavia.

The world&#x27;s first-documented free-trade zone was established on the Greek Island of Delos in 166 BCE. It lasted until about 69 BCE when the island was overrun by pirates. The Romans had many &quot;civitas libera,&quot; or free cities, some of which could coin money, establish their own laws, and not pay an annual tribute to the Roman Emperor. These continued through at least the first millennium CE. In the 12th century, the Hanseatic League began operating in Northern Europe and established trading colonies throughout Europe. These Free Trade Zones included Hamburg and the Steelyard in London. The Steelyard, like other Hansa stations, was a separate walled community with its own warehouses, weighing house, chapel, counting houses, and residential quarters. In 1988, remains of the former Hanseatic trading house, once the largest medieval trading complex in Britain, were uncovered by archaeologists during maintenance work on Cannon Street Station. Shannon, Ireland (Shannon Free Zone), established in 1959, has claimed to be the first &quot;modern&quot; free trade zone. The Shannon Zone was started to help the city airport adjust to a radical change in aircraft technology that permitted longer range aircraft to skip previously-required refueling stops in Shannon. It was an attempt by the Irish government to maintain employment around the airport so that the airport would continue to generate revenue for the Irish economy. It was hugely successful and is still in operation today. Other free zones to note are the Kandla Free Zone in India, which started in about 1960, and the Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone in Taiwan, which started in 1967. The number of worldwide free-trade zones proliferated in the late 20th century.

Corporations setting up in a zone may be given a number of regulatory and fiscal incentives, such as the right to establish a business, the right to import parts and equipment without duty, the right to keep and use foreign exchange earnings, and sometimes income or property tax breaks. There may also be other incentives relating the methods of customs control and filing requirements. The rationale is that the zones will attract investment, create employment, and thus reduce poverty and unemployment, stimulating the area&#x27;s economy. These zones are often used by multinational corporations to set up factories to produce goods (such as clothing, shoes, and electronics).

Free-trade zones should be distinguished from free trade areas. A free trade zone is normally established in a single country, although there are a few exceptions where a free zone may cross a national border, such as the Syrian/Jordanian Free Trade Zone. Free trade areas are set up between countries; for example, the Latin America Free Trade Association (LAFTA) was created in the 1960 Treaty of Montevideo by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay; and the North American Free Trade Agreement was established between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In free trade areas, tariffs are only lowered between member countries. They should also be distinguished from customs unions, like the former European Economic Community, where several countries agree to unify customs regulations and eliminate customs between the union members.

Free-trade zones have more recently been also called special economic zones in some countries. Special economic zones (SEZs) have been established in many countries as testing grounds for the implementation of liberal market economy principles. SEZs are viewed as instruments to enhance the acceptability and the credibility of the transformation policies and to attract domestic and foreign investment. The change in terminology has been driven by the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits members from offering certain types of fiscal incentives to promote the exports of goods, thus why the term Export Processing Zone (EPZ) is no longer used with newer zones. For example, India converted all of its EPZs to SEZs in 2000.

In 1999, there were 43 million people working in about 3,000 FTZs spanning 116 countries and producing clothes, shoes, sneakers, electronics, and toys. The basic objectives of economic zones are to enhance foreign exchange earnings, develop export-oriented industries, and generate employment opportunities.

== US Foreign-Trade Zones Board ==
In the United States, the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (FTZB), established under the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Act of 1934, is led by the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury.

In January 2009, the Foreign-Trade Zones Board adopted an FTZ Board staff proposal to make what it called the Alternative Site Framework (ASF) as a means of designating and managing general-purpose FTZ sites through reorganization. The ASF provides Foreign-Trade Zone grantees greater flexibility to meet specific requests for zone status by utilizing the minor boundary modification process. The theory of the ASF is that by more closely linking the amount of FTZ-designated space to the amount of space activated with Customs and Border Protection, Zone users would have better and quicker access to benefits. 

When an FTZ grantee evaluates whether or not to expand its FTZ project in order to improve the ease in which the Zone may be utilized by existing companies, as well as how it attracts new prospective companies, the Alternative Site Framework (ASF) should be considered. The ASF may be an appropriate option for certain Foreign-Trade Zone projects, but the decision of whether to adopt the new framework and what the configuration of the sites should be requires careful analysis and planning. Regardless of the choice to expand the FTZ project, the sites should be selected and the application drafted in such a manner as to receive swift approval while maximizing benefit to those that locate in the Zone. Successful zone projects are generally the result of a plan developed and implemented by individuals who understand all aspects of the FTZ program.

The FTZB approves the reorganization of Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) 32 under the alternative site framework. The application submitted by its grantee, the Greater Miami Foreign Trade Zone was approved and officially ordered by the FTZB on January 8, 2013. From California to Oklahoma, North Carolina, and New York State, FTZs all across the United States have recently been making use of the flexible opportunities offered by the Alternative Site Framework (ASF) program. The ASF program is designed to serve zone projects that want the flexibility to both attract users/operators to certain fixed sites but also want the ability to serve companies at other locations where the demand for FTZ services will arise in the future. FTZ 32 was founded in 1979 and processes over $1 billion in goods with products from more than 65 countries and exported to more than 75 countries worldwide with speed and efficiency. According to the official order from the FTZB, FTZ 32 existing site 1, Miami Free Zone, will be classified as a magnet site.

== UAE Free Zones ==

Due to growing business opportunities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the UAE government has introduced &#x27;Free Zones&#x27; to make it easier for foreigners to invest and operate in the UAE. In these Free Zones, investors benefit from maintaining full business ownership and receiving tax exemptions.

Some of the benefits of setting up business in UAE Free Zones are:

* No Corporate Tax, 100% exemption provided that business done between the free zone company and any mainland companies are under 375,000 AED a year.
* 100% ownership of business 
* Bank accounts can be opened in a business&#x27;s name
* Reasonable renewal fees
* 100% import and export tax exemptions
* 100% repatriation of profits and capital
* Investor VISA

Some Free Zones in UAE are:
* Ajman Free Zone
* Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ)
* International Free Zone Authority (IFZA)
* Sharjah Media City Free Zone (SHAMS)
* Hamriyah-Free Zone

== Kuwait Free Trade Zone ==
Kuwait&#x27;s free trade zone (FTZ) was formally established in 1999 to expand businesses and lure the export industry. The zone was located in the western part of the commercial port of Shuwaikh. It was the only free trade zone in the country.

In 2019, the Council of Ministers cancelled the free-zone, leaving Kuwait without a special economic zone.

==Strategic benefits==
Aberdeen Group research published in 2013 noted that best-in-class companies make strategic use of free-trade zones as a means of reducing inbound trade costs, shortening import timescales, and optimising the balance of their corporate sourcing and operational activities.

==Criminal use==
The European Union, in 2020, introduced new stricter rules to identify and report suspicious activities at free ports and zones in response to the &quot;high incidence of corruption, tax evasion, and criminal activity&quot;, with a further review to take place in the following year, The European Parliament suggested that increasing demand for free ports could be partly a response to global crackdowns on tax evasion. The European Commission in a report said that free ports were popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold, and wine as alternative assets to cash, and posed an emerging threat in multiple ways: allowing counterfeiters to land consignments and tamper with loads and paperwork, then re-export the products without customs formalities, disguising the actual origin and nature of the goods and their supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering. &quot;Legal businesses owned by criminals remain key to money-laundering activities... free ports are perceived as facilities that protect their clients&quot; identity and financial dealings, much as private banks used to.&quot; 

As an example, the commission cited Swiss authorities&#x27; 2016 seizure of cultural relics looted from the Middle East being stored in Geneva&#x27;s free ports.

The free port system has been accused of facilitating international art crime, allowing stolen artworks to remain undetected in storage for decades. Freeports&#x27; lax regulation enables criminals to operate in secrecy. Freeports may facilitate money laundering and tax evasion by obscuring the real beneficial owners of criminal assets, which hinders authorities&#x27; efforts to trace criminal profits and recover taxes.

==Criticism==

Sometimes the domestic government pays part of the initial cost of factory setup, loosens environmental protections and rules regarding negligence and the treatment of workers, and promises not to ask payment of taxes for the next few years. When the taxation-free years are over, the corporation that set up the factory without fully assuming its costs is often able to set up operations elsewhere for less expense than the taxes to be paid, giving it leverage to take the host government to the bargaining table with more demands, but parent companies in the United States are rarely held accountable.

Political writer Naomi Klein has also criticized the transient nature of FTZs, noting the factory closures connected to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. She criticized the low wages and long hours, citing workdays of twelve or more hours in Indonesia, Philippines, Southern China, and Sri Lanka circa 2000.

<text>The Dictators are an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973. Known for their acerbic and provocative approach in their music, the Dictators underwent several changes in their lineups. Its founding members included musicians Andy &quot;Adny&quot; Shernoff (electric bass, keyboards, vocals), Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman (lead guitar, vocals) and Scott &quot;Top Ten&quot; Kempner (rhythm guitar, vocals). At one point, the lineup included &quot;Handsome&quot; Dick Manitoba (vocals) and Mark &quot;The Animal&quot; Mendoza (electric bass, vocals). Throughout varying lineups, Shernoff, Friedman and Kempner have been constant members.

With albums like &quot;The Dictators Go Girl Crazy!&quot;, &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; and &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot;, the Dictators did not initially have any commercial success outside the punk rock scene in the 1970s and courted some controversies, but later grew to be respected as one of the pioneers in punk rock with a strong cult following. Critic John Dougan said that they were &quot;one of the finest and most influential proto-punk bands to walk the earth.&quot;

==History==
===Origins===
The band was formed in 1972 by Andy &quot;Adny&quot; Shernoff, who was attending the State University of New York at New Paltz, and Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman who was playing in a local band called Total Crudd. Scott &quot;Top Ten&quot; Kempner was asked to join, and the trio rented a house in Kerhonkson, New York, where they lived and rehearsed with various drummers. 

The original recording line-up consisted of vocalist/bassist/songwriter Andy Shernoff, lead guitarist Ross Friedman, rhythm guitarist Scott Kempner, and drummer Stu Boy King. They recorded their 1975 debut album, &quot;The Dictators Go Girl Crazy!&quot; for Epic Records, produced by manager Sandy Pearlman, and Murray Krugman (best known for their work with Blue Öyster Cult). Sandy Pearlman was also instrumental in crafting the image of the Dictators, where roadie and &quot;secret weapon&quot; Richard Blum, who also joined the lineup of the band, was named Handsome Dick Manitoba. Pearlman also suggested that Friedman use the surname &quot;Funichello&quot;, but Friedman disliked it and the name was used once for the album.

&quot;The Dictators Go Girl Crazy!&quot; sold poorly at the time but is now considered to be a starting point for American punk rock. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Go Girl Crazy&quot;&#x27;s junk-generation culture and sensibility did provide an essential blueprint for &#x27;70s punk. With its TV references and homely vocals, this ground-breaking and long-unavailable album continues to inspire underground groups everywhere.&quot; In a 2006 book, &quot;The Heebie-Jeebies at CBGB&#x27;s&quot;, Steven Beeber argued that this all-Jewish band was an early musical expression in rock music of the New York sarcasm and toughness found among this alienated population, who significantly contributed to punk rock (humor of Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Richman, Suicide, Lou Reed, Hilly Kristal (founder of CBGB), Danny Fields, the Ramones).

Frustrated by the lack of sales, the band broke up for a few months in late 1975, but reconvened in early 1976, with bassist Mark &quot;The Animal&quot; Mendoza replacing Shernoff and Ritchie Teeter replacing King. After a few months Shernoff was persuaded to return to the group as the group&#x27;s keyboardist. This line-up soon secured a contract with Asylum Records (at least partly due to the notoriety the group had developed following a well-publicized brawl between Manitoba and Jayne County) and released their second album, &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, in 1977. The album was produced by Pearlman and Krugman with songs written by Shernoff. Andy Shernoff observed the growing fanbase of the band, and employed a commercial sound in &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, stating that it was necessary to not &quot;fuck things up&quot;. &quot;Handsome&quot; Dick Manitoba later recalled that in &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, the commercial sound, which he described as &quot;zero punk&quot; and &quot;overproduced&quot; did not reflect what he considered the ethos of the Dictators, &quot;rock and roll snotty&quot;. Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman was more forgiving of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, describing it as &quot;experimental&quot; and acknowledging that Shernoff went &quot;wild on his pop side&quot;: Friedman then reflected on his guitar works in the album and was favorable to some of the songs, such as &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;.

Early in 1978, Mendoza had left the band (he soon joined Twisted Sister), and Shernoff had returned to his original position on bass guitar. It was this line-up of Manitoba, Shernoff, Friedman, Kempner, and Teeter which recorded &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot; (yet again produced by Pearlman and Krugman with songs written by Shernoff). It was the first album to feature Manitoba as the group&#x27;s vocalist on all the songs, though Bruce Springsteen–a big fan of the group to this day–can be heard counting &quot;1-2-1-2-3-4&quot; during the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Faster and Louder.&quot; The album&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Let&#x27;s Twist&quot; was a minor hit on a number of East Coast radio stations, but the lack of mainstream success caused the band to split again the following year. Shortly before the split, drummer Mel Anderson had left Twisted Sister and joined The Dictators, replacing Teeter.

===1980s===
After the break-up, Manitoba drove a taxi cab, Shernoff worked as a record producer and songwriter and Friedman worked first with the French hard-rock band Shakin&#x27; Street, and then became a founding member of Manowar in 1982 (with whom he recorded the band&#x27;s first six albums, leaving the band after the 1988 album &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;), and producing the first demo for Anthrax.

The members of the band began reuniting occasionally and in 1981, ROIR released the cassette-only &quot;Fuck &#x27;Em If They Can&#x27;t Take a Joke&quot; produced by Andy Shernoff, which featured numbers from all three of the group&#x27;s studio albums, covers of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;What Goes On&quot; and Mott the Hoople&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Upstairs,&quot; plus two new Shernoff numbers, &quot;Loyola&quot; and &quot;New York New York&quot;.

Other than occasional reunion shows, little was heard from The Dictators during the next five years. However, in late 1986 Shernoff and Manitoba (along with guitarist Daniel Rey) formed Wild Kingdom, releasing a version of &quot;New York New York&quot; on the 1988 soundtrack to &quot;Mondo New York&quot;.

===1990s===

In 1990, MCA Records released the Wild Kingdom debut, &quot;...And You?&quot; written and produced by Andy Shernoff, though they were now billed as Manitoba&#x27;s Wild Kingdom to avoid a lawsuit from the TV show Wild Kingdom. By this time Rey had left the group and had been replaced by Friedman (the group was rounded out by drummer J.P. Patterson). &quot;...And You?&quot; - a brief 25 minutes in length - received excellent reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling it &quot;the first great punk rock album of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

The &quot;...And You?&quot; album cover was a source of some controversy, since it was lifted from a World War II Nazi recruiting poster. It was not the first time members of the band (most of whom were Jewish) had been associated with charges of this sort since &quot;Go Girl Crazy&quot; had featured the songs &quot;Master Race Rock&quot; and &quot;Back to Africa.&quot;

By the 1990s, much about the lives of the band&#x27;s members had changed markedly. Shernoff recorded and toured with The Fleshtones in 1989 and 1990, wrote and recorded with The Ramones, became a successful record producer and worked as a sommelier. Manitoba opened an East-Village bar called Manitoba&#x27;s in 1999. Kempner had developed a certain degree of respect from roots-rock audiences due to his 1980s work with The Del-Lords. In 1992, he released his solo album &quot;Tenement Angels&quot; and joined The Brandos in 1993. Friedman&#x27;s work with Manowar and Brain Surgeons had given him a certain cachet with heavy metal audiences.

However, the group - first with Frank Funaro on drums, then again with Patterson - began recording a new Dictators album written and produced by Andy Shernoff in the late 1990s, which was eventually released as &quot;D.F.F.D.&quot; in 2001. AllMusic called the album a &quot;non-stop barrage of spitfire precision rock. The material is, unbelievably, their best and most consistent ever for an album&quot;.

===2000s===

The Dictators continued to perform to a devoted audience releasing a live album, &quot;Viva Dictators&quot; in 2005, produced by Shernoff. In 2007, they compiled an album of demos, rarities, and unreleased songs which were recorded at various times over their thirty-plus year career called &quot;Every Day Is Saturday&quot; on Norton Records. The title was a line in the song &quot;Weekend&quot; from the band&#x27;s first album &quot;The Dictators Go Girl Crazy&quot;.

Shernoff formed The Master Plan with The Fleshtones&#x27; Keith Streng, releasing &quot;Colossus of Destiny&quot; on Alive-Total Energy Records in 2003, and &quot;Maximum Respect&quot; on Green Mist Records in 2011.

Manitoba sang with the surviving members of the MC5 and worked as a DJ in Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage on Sirius XM Radio, till he was fired, then re-hired to work on Steven&#x27;s station, which did not work out, as he left in January 2018.

In October 2006, the band (Manitoba, Shernoff, Friedman, Patterson, Kempner) headlined the second and third to last shows ever at CBGB. The second to last show featured Blondie on the bill as well, and during the Dictators final song on the CBGB stage, they were joined by Tommy Ramone, the last surviving original member of The Ramones for a rendition of the Ramones song &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;.

In November 2007, Manitoba, along with author Amy Wallace, put out &quot;The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists&quot; on BackBeat Books, a small book company owned by Hal Leonard Publishing.

Manitoba&#x27;s Wild Kingdom reunited in May 2008 to play at the Joey Ramone Birthday Bash at The Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, with a lineup featuring Manitoba, Shernoff, Friedman and Patterson.

In July 2008, Kempner released his second solo album &quot;Saving Grace&quot;.

In October 2008, The Dictators reunited for a series of four concerts in Spain.

Ross The Boss released his debut solo album, &quot;New Metal Leader&quot;, in August 2008. He and his band have released their second album &quot;Hailstorm&quot; in 2010.

Patterson released his second album, entitled &quot;The LP Is Dead&quot;, in November 2009 via No Fun Records.

===2010s===
Kempner and the rest of The Del-Lords re-united in early 2010 for a successful tour of Spain and began working on an album of all new material. Kempner&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Tenement Angels&quot;, was released on March 1, 2011, on GB Music. The release is on CD (remastered with a bonus track) and on vinyl. The LP is a limited edition on 500, and comes with a digital download and a hand signed poster by Kempner.

Manitoba, Ross the Boss, Dean Rispler (ex-Murphys Law), JP Paterson, and Daniel Rey formed Manitoba in January 2012. In April 2013, the band changed its name to The Dictators NYC. A single &quot;Supply and Demand,&quot; composed by Boss, Manitoba, and Manitoba&#x27;s son Jake, and backed with a live version of the MC5&#x27;s &quot;Kick Out the Jams,&quot; was released in November 2015. In July 2017, it was announced that the band name would be changed back to Manitoba, &quot;due to legal threats by ex-bandmates, Andy Shernoff and Scott Kempner&quot;. In December of that year the band announced it had broken up.

Shernoff released his first solo EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Fade Away&quot; on Yazoo Squelch Records in 2012. Critic Mark Deming wrote &quot;the man is still writing excellent songs and singing them straight from the heart, which is what his best work has always been about, and it&#x27;s great news that well over three decades into his career, he&#x27;s still got fresh and worthwhile things to say.&quot; He released his second EP &quot;On The First Day, Man Created God&quot; in 2013 again on Yazoo Squelch records. In August 2015, he released a video collaboration with Lydia Lunch for the song &quot;A Good Night To Say Goodbye&quot;. Another video to celebrate Joey Ramone&#x27;s 65th birthday was released on May 15, 2016.

Former member Richard Teeter, who played drums for The Dictators between 1976 and 1979, died on April 10, 2012, due to complications from esophageal cancer. He was 61.

In November 2015, &quot;Go Girl Crazy!&quot; received an expanded and remastered CD reissue, featuring several unreleased selections and remixes of three tunes by Andrew W.K.

On May 1, 2018, the Dictators original drummer, Stuart &#x27;Stu Boy&#x27; King, died from pancreatic cancer.

In November 2019, Manitoba released his first solo album &quot;Born in the Bronx&quot;.

===2020s===
On May 28, 2020, Andy Shernoff announced that the Dictators were reforming to record some new material and possibly play live, with a line-up comprising Shernoff on bass and vocals, Ross The Boss and Kempner on guitars and Albert Bouchard (formerly of Blue Öyster Cult) on drums. On January 8, 2021, Shernoff announced on Facebook that a new Dictators song and video would be released on January 15. On April 6 that year, the Dictators announced &quot;Scott Kempner will be leaving the band due to health reasons.&quot; On October 18, the band announced that Keith Roth (David Johansen, Earl Slick, Cherie Currie, Cheetah Crome) would join the band on vocals and guitar. Kempner died from complications of dementia in a nursing home in Connecticut on November 29, 2023, at the age of 69. The Dictators released their sixth album &quot;The Dictators&quot; in September 2024.

<text>The Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelo-Finnish SSR), also called Soviet Karelia or simply known as Karelia, was a republic of the Soviet Union. It existed from 31 March 1940 until it was made part of the Russian SFSR on 16 July 1956 as the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The latter became the Republic of Karelia, a federal subject of Russia, on 13 November 1991.

==History==
The Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic was established by the Soviet government on 31 March 1940 by merging the KASSR with the Finnish Democratic Republic. The latter was created in territory ceded by Finland in the Winter War by the Moscow Peace Treaty, namely the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia, including the cities of Viipuri and Sortavala.

Virtually the entire Karelian population of the ceded areas, about 422,000 people, was evacuated to Finland, and the territories were settled by peoples from other parts of the Soviet Union.

Creating a new Republic of the Union for an ethnic group that was not large in absolute terms, nor constituted anything close to a majority in its territory, nor had been a separate independent nation before its incorporation into the USSR, was unprecedented in the history of the USSR. Some later historians believe that the elevation of Soviet Karelia from an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (within the RSFSR) to an SSR was a political move as a &quot;convenient means for facilitating the possible incorporation of additional Finnish territory&quot; (or, possibly, the whole of Finland) into the USSR.
In 1941, Finland retook the territory that it had lost in 1940 and occupied most of the Karelian lands that had been within the USSR before 1940, including the capital Petrozavodsk (Petroskoi). In 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured the area. Soviet sovereignty was recognized by Finland in the Moscow Armistice and Paris Peace Treaty. The Finnish Karelians were evacuated to Finland again.

In September 1944, the Karelian Isthmus with Vyborg (Viipuri) was transferred from the Karelo-Finnish SSR to the Leningrad Oblast of the RSFSR, but Ladoga Karelia remained a part of the republic.

On 16 July 1956, the republic was incorporated into the Russian SFSR as the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This move can perhaps be explained in the context of the general post-war improvement of Finno-Soviet relations, which also included such steps as the Soviets&#x27; return of the Porkkala Naval Base leased territory to full Finnish sovereignty (January 1956), and leasing Maly Vysotsky Island and the Soviet section of the Saimaa Canal (conquered by the USSR in 1940 and 1944) back to Finland (1963).

The abolition of the Karelian SSR in 1956 was the only case in the history of the USSR (1922–1991) of merging a member republic of the USSR into another republic. The state emblem of the Soviet Union had to be changed to reflect this, with one of the 16 ribbons symbolizing constituent republics (that in the Finnish language) removed. Soviet banknotes bearing the emblem were also changed accordingly.

In the last days of the USSR, the Karelian ASSR became the Republic of Karelia, a subdivision of the Russian Federation, on 13 November 1991.

==Politics==
The chairman of the Karelo-Finnish Supreme Soviet (1940–1956) was a Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen. In the republic, there was also a separate Karelo-Finnish Communist Party led in the 1940s by G.N. Kupriyanov.

Yuri Andropov served for some years as the first secretary of the republic&#x27;s Komsomol branch, the Leninist Communist Youth League of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.

<doc id="232522" wikidata="Q845203" url="?curid=232522" title="Operation Chastise">
<text>Operation Chastise, commonly known as the Dambusters Raid, was an attack on German dams carried out on the night of 16/17 May 1943 by 617 Squadron RAF Bomber Command, later called the Dam Busters, using special bouncing bombs developed by Barnes Wallis. The Möhne and Edersee dams were breached, causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley; the Sorpe Dam sustained only minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and several more damaged. Factories and mines were also damaged and destroyed. An estimated 1,600 civilians – about 600 Germans and 1,000 enslaved labourers, mainly Soviet – were killed by the flooding. Despite rapid repairs by the Germans, production did not return to normal until September. The RAF lost 56 aircrew, with 53 dead and 3 captured, amid losses of 8 aircraft.

==Background==
Before the Second World War, the British Air Ministry had identified the industrialised Ruhr Valley, especially its dams, as important strategic targets. The dams provided hydroelectric power and pure water for steel-making, drinking water and water for the canal transport system. Calculations indicated that attacks with large bombs could be effective but required a degree of accuracy which RAF Bomber Command had been unable to attain when attacking a well-defended target. A one-off surprise attack might succeed but the RAF lacked a weapon suitable for the task.

==Concept==

The mission grew out of a concept for a bomb designed by Barnes Wallis, assistant chief designer at Vickers. Wallis had worked on the Vickers Wellesley and Vickers Wellington bombers and while working on the Vickers Windsor, he had also begun work, with Admiralty support, on an anti-shipping bomb, although dam destruction was soon considered. At first, Wallis wanted to drop a bomb from an altitude of about , part of the earthquake bomb concept. No bomber aircraft was capable of flying at such an altitude or of carrying such a heavy bomb and although Wallis proposed the six-engined Victory Bomber for this purpose this was rejected. Wallis realized that a much smaller explosive charge would suffice if it exploded against the dam wall under the water but German reservoir dams were protected by heavy torpedo nets to prevent an explosive device from travelling through the water.

Wallis devised a bomb (more accurately, a mine) in the shape of a cylinder, equivalent to a very large depth charge armed with a hydrostatic fuse, designed to be given a backspin of 500 rpm. Dropped at and from the release point, the mine would skip across the surface of the water before hitting the dam wall as its forward speed ceased. Initially the backspin was intended to increase the range of the mine but it was later realized that it would also cause the mine, after submerging, to run down the side of the dam towards its base, thus maximising the explosive effect against the dam. This weapon was code-named &quot;Upkeep&quot;.
Testing of the concept included blowing up a scale model dam at the Building Research Establishment, Watford, in May 1942 and then the breaching of the disused Nant-y-Gro dam in Wales in July. A subsequent test suggested that a charge of exploded under water would breach a full-size dam; crucially this weight would be within the carrying capacity of an Avro Lancaster. The first air drop trials were at Chesil Beach in December 1942; these used a spinning 4 ft 6 in sphere dropped from a modified Vickers Wellington, serial BJ895/G; the same aircraft was used until April 1943 when the first modified Lancasters became available. The tests continued at Chesil Beach and Reculver, often unsuccessfully, using revised designs of the mine and variations of speed and height.

Avro Chief Designer Roy Chadwick adapted the Lancaster to carry the mine. To reduce weight, much of the internal armour was removed, as was the mid-upper (dorsal) gun turret. The dimensions of the mine and its unusual shape meant that the bomb-bay doors had to be removed and the mine hung partly below the fuselage. It was mounted on two crutches and before dropping it was spun by an auxiliary motor. Chadwick also worked out the design and installation of controls and gear for the carriage and release of the mine in conjunction with Barnes Wallis. The Avro Lancaster B Mk IIIs so modified were known as &quot;Lancaster B Mark III Special (Type 464 Provisioning)&quot;.
In February 1943, Air Vice-Marshal Francis Linnell at the Ministry of Aircraft Production thought the work was diverting Wallis from the development of the Vickers Windsor bomber (which did not become operational). Pressure from Linnell via the chairman of Vickers, Sir Charles Worthington Craven, caused Wallis to offer to resign. Sir Arthur Harris, head of Bomber Command, after a briefing by Linnell also opposed the allocation of his bombers; Harris was about to start the strategic bombing campaign against Germany and Lancasters were just entering service. Wallis had written to an influential intelligence officer, Group Captain Frederick Winterbotham, who ensured that the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal, heard of the project. Portal saw the film of the Chesil Beach trials and was convinced. On 26 February 1943, Portal over-ruled Harris and ordered that thirty Lancasters were to be allocated to the mission and the target date was set for May, when water levels would be at their highest and breaches in the dams would cause the most damage. With eight weeks to go, the larger Upkeep mine that was needed for the mission and the modifications to the Lancasters had yet to be designed.

===Assignment===

The operation was given to No. 5 Group RAF, which formed a new squadron to undertake the dams mission. It was initially called Squadron X, as the speed of its formation outstripped the RAF process for naming squadrons. Led by 24-year-old Wing Commander Guy Gibson, a veteran of more than 170 bombing and night-fighter missions, twenty-one bomber crews were selected from 5 Group squadrons. The crews included RAF personnel of several nationalities, members of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). The squadron was based at RAF Scampton, about north of Lincoln.

The targets selected were the Möhne Dam and the Sorpe Dam, upstream from the Ruhr industrial area, with the Eder Dam on the Eder River, which feeds into the Weser, as a secondary target. The loss of hydroelectric power was important but the loss of water to industry, cities and canals would have greater effect and there was potential for devastating flooding if the dams broke.

===Preparations===

Bombing from an altitude of , at an air speed of and at set distance from the target called for expert crews. Intensive night-time and low-altitude training began. There were also technical problems to solve, the first one being to determine when the aircraft was at optimum distance from its target. The Möhne and Eder Dams had towers at each end. A special targeting device with two prongs, making the same angle as the two towers at the correct distance from the dam, showed when to release the bomb. (The BBC documentary &quot;Dambusters Declassified&quot; (2010) stated that the pronged device was ultimately not used, owing to problems related to vibration, and that other methods were employed, including a length of string tied in a loop and pulled back centrally to a fixed point, in the manner of a catapult.)

The second problem was determining the aircraft&#x27;s altitude, as barometric altimeters lacked accuracy. Two spotlights were mounted, one under the aircraft&#x27;s nose and the other under the fuselage, so that at the correct height their light beams would converge on the surface of the water. The crews practised at the Eyebrook Reservoir, near Uppingham, Rutland; Abberton Reservoir near Colchester; Derwent Reservoir in the Derbyshire Peak District; and Fleet Lagoon on Chesil Beach. Wallis&#x27;s bomb was first tested at the Elan Valley Reservoirs. 

Gibson also had VHF radios (normally reserved for fighters) fitted to the Lancasters so that he could control the operation while over the target, an early example of what became the master bomber role.

The squadron took delivery of the bombs on 13 May, after the final tests on 29 April. At 18:00 on 15 May, at a meeting in Whitworth&#x27;s house, Gibson and Wallis briefed the squadron&#x27;s two flight commanders, Squadron Leader Henry Eric Maudslay and Sqn Ldr H. M. &quot;Dinghy&quot; Young, Gibson&#x27;s deputy for the Möhne attack, Flt Lt John V. Hopgood and the squadron bombing leader, Flight Lieutenant Bob Hay. The rest of the crews were told at a series of briefings the following day, which began with a briefing of pilots, navigators and bomb-aimers at about midday.

===Organisation===
Formation No. 1 was composed of nine aircraft in three groups (listed by pilot): Gibson, Hopgood and Flt Lt H. B. &quot;Micky&quot; Martin (an Australian serving in the RAF); Young, Flt Lt David Maltby and Flt Lt Dave Shannon (RAAF); and Maudslay, Flt Lt Bill Astell and Pilot Officer Les Knight (RAAF). Its mission was to attack the Möhne; any aircraft with bombs remaining would then attack the Eder.

Formation No. 2, numbering five aircraft, piloted by Flt Lt Joe McCarthy (an American serving in the RCAF), P/O Vernon Byers (RCAF), Flt Lt Norman Barlow (RAAF), P/O Geoff Rice and Flt Lt Les Munro (RNZAF), was to attack the Sorpe.

Formation No. 3 was a mobile reserve consisting of aircraft piloted by Flight Sergeant Cyril Anderson, Flt Sgt Bill Townsend, Flt Sgt Ken Brown (RCAF), P/O Warner Ottley and P/O Lewis Burpee (RCAF), taking off two hours later on 17 May, either to bomb the main dams or to attack three smaller secondary target dams: the Lister, the Ennepe and the Diemel.

Two crews were unable to make the mission owing to illness.

The Operations Room for the mission was at 5 Group Headquarters in St Vincents Hall, Grantham, Lincolnshire. The mission codes (transmitted in morse) were: &quot;Goner&quot;, meaning &quot;bomb dropped&quot;; &quot;Nigger&quot;, meaning that the Möhne was breached; and &quot;Dinghy&quot;, meaning that the Eder was breached. Nigger was the name of Gibson&#x27;s dog, a black labrador retriever that had been run over and killed on the morning of the attack. Dinghy was Young&#x27;s nickname, a reference to the fact that he had twice survived crash landings at sea where he and his crew were rescued from the aircraft&#x27;s inflatable rubber dinghy.

==The attacks==

===Outbound===

The aircraft used two routes, carefully avoiding known concentrations of flak, and were timed to cross the enemy coast simultaneously. The first aircraft, those of Formation No. 2 and heading for the longer, northern route, took off at 21:28 on 16 May. McCarthy&#x27;s bomber developed a coolant leak and he took off in the reserve aircraft 34 minutes late.

Formation No. 1 took off in groups of three at 10-minute intervals beginning at 21:39. The reserve formation did not begin taking off until 00:09 on 17 May.

Formation No. 1 entered continental Europe between Walcheren and Schouwen, flew over the Netherlands, skirted the airbases at Gilze-Rijen and Eindhoven, curved around the Ruhr defences, and turned north to avoid Hamm before turning south to head for the Möhne River. Formation No. 2 flew further north, cutting over Vlieland and crossing the IJsselmeer before joining the first route near Wesel and then flying south beyond the Möhne to the Sorpe River.

The bombers flew low, at about altitude, to avoid radar detection. Flight Sergeant George Chalmers, radio operator on &quot;O for Orange&quot;, looked out through the astrodome and was astonished to see that his pilot was flying towards the target along a forest&#x27;s firebreak, below treetop level.

===First casualties===
The first casualties were suffered soon after reaching the Dutch coast. Formation No. 2 did not fare well: Munro&#x27;s aircraft lost its radio to flak and turned back over the IJsselmeer, while Rice flew too low and struck the sea, losing his bomb in the water; he recovered and returned to base. After the completion of the raid Gibson sympathised with Rice, telling him how he had also nearly lost his bomb to the sea. Barlow and Byers crossed the coast around the island of Texel. Byers was shot down by flak shortly afterwards, crashing into the Waddenzee. Barlow&#x27;s aircraft hit electricity pylons and crashed 5 km east of Rees, near Haldern. The bomb was thrown clear of the crash and was examined intact by Heinz Schweizer. Only the delayed bomber piloted by McCarthy survived to cross the Netherlands. Formation No. 1 lost Astell&#x27;s bomber near the German hamlet of Marbeck when his Lancaster hit high voltage electrical cables and crashed into a field.

===Attack on the Möhne Dam===
Formation No. 1 arrived over the Möhne lake and Gibson&#x27;s aircraft (G for George) made the first run, followed by Hopgood (M for Mother). Hopgood&#x27;s aircraft was hit by flak as it made its low-level run and was caught in the blast of its own bomb, crashing shortly afterwards when a wing disintegrated. Three crew members successfully abandoned the aircraft, but only two survived. Subsequently, Gibson flew his aircraft across the dam to draw the flak away from Martin&#x27;s run. Martin (P for Popsie) bombed third; his aircraft was damaged, but made a successful attack. Next, Young (A for Apple) made a successful run, and after him Maltby (J for Johnny), when finally the dam was breached. Gibson, with Young accompanying, led Shannon, Maudslay and Knight to the Eder.

===Attack on the Eder Dam===

The Eder Valley was covered by heavy fog, but the dam was not defended with anti-aircraft positions as the difficult topography of the surrounding hills was thought to make an attack virtually impossible. With approach so difficult the first aircraft, Shannon&#x27;s, made six runs before taking a break. Maudslay (Z for Zebra) then attempted a run but the bomb struck the top of the dam and the aircraft was severely damaged in the blast. Shannon made another run and successfully dropped his bomb. The final bomb of the formation, from Knight&#x27;s aircraft (N for Nut), breached the dam.

===Attacks on the Sorpe and Ennepe Dams===
The Sorpe dam was the one least likely to be breached. It was a huge earthen dam, unlike the two concrete-and-steel gravity dams that were attacked successfully. Due to various problems, only two Lancasters reached the Sorpe Dam: Joe McCarthy (in T for Tommy, a delayed aircraft from the second wave) and later Brown (F for Freddie) from the third formation. This attack differed from the previous ones in two ways: the &#x27;Upkeep&#x27; bomb was not spun, and due to the topography of the valley the approach was made along the length of the dam, not at right angles over the reservoir.

McCarthy&#x27;s plane was on its own when it arrived over the Sorpe Dam at 00:15 hours, and realised the approach was even more difficult than expected: the flight path led over a church steeple in the village of Langscheid, located on the hillcrest overlooking the dam. With only seconds to go before the bomber had to pull up, to avoid hitting the hillside at the other end of the dam, the bomb aimer George Johnson had no time to correct the bomber&#x27;s height and heading.

McCarthy made nine attempted bombing runs before Johnson was satisfied. The &#x27;Upkeep&#x27; bomb was dropped on the tenth run. The bomb exploded but when he turned his Lancaster to assess the damage, it turned out that only a section of the crest of the dam had been blown off; the main body of the dam remained.

Three of the reserve aircraft had been directed to the Sorpe Dam. Burpee (S for Sugar) never arrived, and it was later determined that the plane had been shot down while skirting the Gilze-Rijen airfield. Brown (F for Freddie) reached the Sorpe Dam: in the increasingly dense fog, after 7 runs, Brown conferred with his bomb aimer and dropped incendiary devices on either side of the valley, which ignited a fire which subsequently lifted the fog enough to drop a direct hit on the eighth run. The bomb cracked but failed to breach the dam. Anderson (Y for York) never arrived having been delayed by damage to his rear turret and dense fog which made his attempts to find the target impossible. The remaining two bombers were then sent to secondary targets, with Ottley (C for Charlie) being shot down en route to the Lister Dam. Townsend (O for Orange) eventually dropped his bomb at the Ennepe Dam without harming it.

===Possible attack on Bever Dam===
There is some evidence that Townsend might have attacked the by mistake rather than the Ennepe Dam. The War Diary of the German Naval Staff reported that the Bever Dam was attacked at nearly the same time that the Sorpe Dam was. In addition, the &quot;Wupperverband&quot; authority responsible for the Bever Dam is said to have recovered the remains of a &quot;mine&quot;; and Paul Keiser, a 19-year-old soldier on leave at his home close to the Bever Dam, reported a bomber making several approaches to the dam and then dropping a bomb that caused a large explosion and a great pillar of flame.

In the book &quot;The Dambusters&#x27; Raid&quot;, author John Sweetman suggests Townsend&#x27;s report of the moon&#x27;s reflecting on the mist and water is consistent with an attack that was heading to the Bever Dam rather than to the Ennepe Dam, given the moon&#x27;s azimuth and altitude during the bombing attacks. Sweetman also points out that the &quot;Ennepe-Wasserverband&quot; authority was adamant that only a single bomb was dropped near the Ennepe Dam during the entire war, and that this bomb fell into the woods by the side of the dam, not in the water, as in Townsend&#x27;s report. Finally, members of Townsend&#x27;s crew independently reported seeing a manor house and attacking an earthen dam, which is consistent with the Bever Dam rather than the Ennepe Dam. The main evidence supporting the hypothesis of an attack of the Ennepe Dam is Townsend&#x27;s post-flight report that he attacked the Ennepe Dam on a heading of 355 degrees magnetic. Assuming that the heading was incorrect, all other evidence points toward an attack on the Bever Dam.

Townsend reported difficulty in finding his dam, and in his post-raid report he complained that the map of the Ennepe Dam was incorrect. The Bever Dam is only about southwest of the Ennepe Dam. With the early-morning fog that filled the valleys, it would be understandable for him to have mistaken the two reservoirs.

===Return flight===
On the way back, flying again at treetop level, two more Lancasters were lost. The damaged aircraft of Maudslay was struck by flak near Netterden, and Young&#x27;s (A for Apple) was hit by flak north of IJmuiden and crashed into the North Sea just off the coast of the Netherlands. On the return flight over the Dutch coast, some German flak aimed at the aircraft was aimed so low that shells were seen to bounce off the sea.

Eleven bombers began landing at Scampton at 03:11 hours, with Gibson returning at 04:15. The last of the survivors, Townsend&#x27;s bomber, landed at 06:15. It was the last to land because one of its engines had been shut down after passing the Dutch coast. Air Chief Marshal Harris was among those who came out to greet the last crew to land.
==List of aircraft involved==
==Bomb damage assessment==

Bomber Command wanted a bomb damage assessment as soon as possible and the CO of 542 Squadron was informed of the estimated time of the attacks. A photo-reconnaissance Spitfire, piloted by Flying Officer Frank &#x27;Jerry&#x27; Fray, took off from RAF Benson at 07:30 hours and arrived over the Ruhr River some hours after first light. Photos were taken of the breached dams and the huge floods. The pilot later described the experience:

==After the raid==

Three aircrew from Hopgood&#x27;s aircraft parachuted but one later died from wounds and the others were captured. A crewman in Ottley&#x27;s aircraft survived its crash. In total, therefore, 53 of the 133 aircrew who participated in the attack were killed, a casualty rate of almost 40 percent. Thirteen of those killed were members of the RCAF and two belonged to the RAAF.
Of the survivors, 34 were decorated at Buckingham Palace on 22 June, with Gibson awarded the Victoria Cross. There were five Distinguished Service Orders, 10 Distinguished Flying Crosses and four bars, two Conspicuous Gallantry Medals, eleven Distinguished Flying Medals and one bar.

Initial German casualty estimates from the floods were 1,294 killed, including 749 French, Belgian, Dutch and Ukrainian prisoners of war and labourers. Later estimates put the death toll in the Möhne Valley at about 1,600, including people who drowned in the flood wave downstream from the dam.

After a public relations tour of North America, and time spent working in the Air Ministry in London writing the book published as &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;, Gibson returned to operations and was killed on a Mosquito operation in 1944.

Following the Dams Raid, 617 Squadron was kept together as a specialist unit. A motto, &quot;Après moi le déluge&quot; (&quot;After me the flood&quot;), and a squadron badge were chosen. According to Paul Brickhill there was some controversy over the motto, with the original version &quot;Après nous le déluge&quot; (&quot;After &quot;us&quot; the flood&quot;) being rejected by the Heralds as having inappropriate provenance (having been coined, reportedly, by Madame de Pompadour) and &quot;après moi le déluge&quot; having been said by Louis XV in an &quot;irresponsible&quot; context. The motto having been chosen by King George VI, the latter was finally deemed acceptable. The squadron went on to drop the Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs and attacked the German battleship , using an advanced bomb sight, which enabled the bombing of small targets with far greater accuracy than conventional bomb aiming techniques.

In 1977, Article 56 of the Protocol I amendment to the Geneva Conventions outlawed attacks on dams &quot;if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population&quot;. There is however an exception if &quot;it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support&quot;.

The last surviving member of the 617 Squadron (aka Dambusters) responsible for the Operation, Johnny Johnson, died in 2022.

==Effect on the war==

===Tactical view===

The two direct mine hits on the Möhnesee dam resulted in a breach around wide and deep. The destroyed dam poured around 330 million tons of water into the western Ruhr region. A torrent of water around high and travelling at around swept through the valleys of the Möhne and Ruhr rivers. A few mines were flooded; 11 small factories and 92 houses were destroyed and 114 factories and 971 houses were damaged. The floods washed away about 25 roads, railways and bridges as the flood waters spread for around from the source. Estimates show that before 15 May 1943 steel production on the Ruhr was 1 million tonnes; this dropped to a quarter of that level after the raid.

The Eder drains towards the east into the Fulda which runs into the Weser to the North Sea. The main purpose of the Edersee was then, as it is now, to act as a reservoir to keep the Weser and the Mittellandkanal navigable during the summer months. The wave from the breach was not strong enough to result in significant damage by the time it hit Kassel, approximately downstream.

The greatest impact on the Ruhr armaments production was the loss of hydroelectric power. Two power stations (producing 5,100 kilowatts) associated with the dam were destroyed and seven others were damaged. This resulted in a loss of electrical power in the factories and many households in the region for two weeks. In May 1943 coal production dropped by 400,000 tons which German sources attribute to the effects of the raid.

According to an article by German historian , at least 1,650 people were killed: around 70 of these were in the Eder Valley, and at least 1,579 bodies were found along the Möhne and Ruhr rivers, with hundreds missing. Of the bodies found downriver of the Möhne Dam, 1,026 were foreign prisoners of war and forced labourers in different camps, mainly from the Soviet Union. Worst hit was the city of Neheim (now part of Neheim-Hüsten) at the confluence of the Möhne and Ruhr rivers, where over 800 people perished, among them at least 493 female forced labourers from the Soviet Union. Some non-German sources cite an earlier total of 749 for all foreigners in all camps in the Möhne and Ruhr valleys as the casualty count at a camp just below the Eder Dam.) One source states that the raid was no more than a minor inconvenience to the Ruhr&#x27;s industrial output, although that is contradicted by others. The bombing boosted British morale.

In his book &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;, Albert Speer acknowledged the attempt: &quot;That night, employing just a few bombers, the British came close to a success which would have been greater than anything they had achieved hitherto with a commitment of thousands of bombers.&quot; He also expressed puzzlement at the raids: the disruption of temporarily having to shift 7,000 construction workers to the Möhne and Eder repairs was offset by the failure of the Allies to follow up with additional (conventional) raids during the dams&#x27; reconstruction, and that represented a major lost opportunity. Barnes Wallis was also of this view; he revealed his deep frustration that Bomber Command never sent a high-level bombing force to hit the Möhne dam while repairs were being carried out. He argued that extreme precision would have been unnecessary and that even a few hits by conventional HE bombs would have prevented the rapid repair of the dam which was undertaken by the Germans.

===Strategic view===
The Dams Raid was, like many British air raids, undertaken with a view to the need to keep drawing German defensive effort back into Germany and away from actual and potential theatres of ground war, a policy which culminated in the Berlin raids of the winter of 1943–1944. In May 1943 this meant keeping the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft and anti-aircraft defences away from the Soviet Union; in early 1944, it meant clearing the way for the aerial side of the forthcoming Operation Overlord. The considerable amount of labour and strategic resources committed to repairing the dams, factories, mines and railways could not be used in other ways, on the construction of the Atlantic Wall, for example. The pictures of the broken dams proved to be a propaganda and morale boost to the Allies, especially to the British, still suffering from the German bombing of the Baedeker Blitz that had peaked roughly a year earlier.

Even within Germany, as evidenced by Gauleiters&#x27; reports to Berlin at the time, the German population regarded the raids as a legitimate attack on military targets and thought they were &quot;an extraordinary success on the part of the English&quot; [sic]. They were not regarded as a pure terror attack by the Germans, even in the Ruhr region, and in response the German authorities released relatively accurate (not exaggerated) estimates of the dead.

An effect of the dam raids was that Barnes Wallis&#x27;s ideas on earthquake bombing, which had previously been rejected, came to be accepted by &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Harris. Prior to this raid, bombing had used the tactic of area bombardment with many light bombs, in the hope that one would hit the target. Work on the earthquake bombs resulted in the Tallboy and Grand Slam weapons, which caused damage to German infrastructure in the later stages of the war. They rendered the V-2 rocket launch complex at Calais unusable, buried the V-3 guns, and destroyed bridges and other fortified installations, such as the Grand Slam attack on the railway viaduct at Bielefeld. The most notable successes were the partial collapse of reinforced concrete roofs of U-boat pens at Brest, and the sinking of the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

Harris regarded the raid as a failure and a waste of resources.

==Books and film==
The raid was the subject of two books, &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot; (1946) by Guy Gibson and &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1951) by Paul Brickhill, and a film, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955).

<doc id="232526" wikidata="Q632546" url="?curid=232526" title="Bertrand's postulate">
<text>In number theory, Bertrand&#x27;s postulate is the theorem that for any integer formula_1, there exists at least one prime number formula_2 with 
:formula_3
A less restrictive formulation is: for every formula_4, there is always at least one prime formula_2 such that 
:formula_6
Another formulation, where formula_7 is the formula_8-th prime, is: for formula_9
:formula_10

This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand (1822–1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all integers formula_11.

His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev (1821–1894) in 1852 and so the postulate is also called the Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev&#x27;s theorem. Chebyshev&#x27;s theorem can also be stated as a relationship with formula_12, the prime-counting function (number of primes less than or equal to formula_13):
:formula_14

== Prime number theorem ==

The prime number theorem (PNT) implies that the number of primes up to &quot;x&quot;, &quot;π(x)&quot;, is roughly &quot;x&quot;/log(&quot;x&quot;), so if we replace &quot;x&quot; with 2&quot;x&quot; then we see the number of primes up to 2&quot;x&quot; is asymptotically twice the number of primes up to &quot;x&quot; (the terms log(2&quot;x&quot;) and log(&quot;x&quot;) are asymptotically equivalent). Therefore, the number of primes between &quot;n&quot; and 2&quot;n&quot; is roughly &quot;n&quot;/log(&quot;n&quot;) when &quot;n&quot; is large, and so in particular there are many more primes in this interval than are guaranteed by Bertrand&#x27;s postulate. So Bertrand&#x27;s postulate is comparatively weaker than the PNT. But PNT is a deep theorem, while Bertrand&#x27;s Postulate can be stated more memorably and proved more easily, and also makes precise claims about what happens for small values of &quot;n&quot;. (In addition, Chebyshev&#x27;s theorem was proved before the PNT and so has historical interest.)

The similar and still unsolved Legendre&#x27;s conjecture asks whether for every &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1, there is a prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;n&quot;2 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; (&quot;n&quot; + 1)2. Again we expect that there will be not just one but many primes between &quot;n&quot;2 and (&quot;n&quot; + 1)2, but in this case the PNT does not help: the number of primes up to &quot;x&quot;2 is asymptotic to &quot;x&quot;2/log(&quot;x&quot;2) while the number of primes up to (&quot;x&quot; + 1)2 is asymptotic to (&quot;x&quot; + 1)2/log((&quot;x&quot; + 1)2), which is asymptotic to the estimate on primes up to &quot;x&quot;2. So, unlike the previous case of &quot;x&quot; and 2&quot;x&quot;, we do not get a proof of Legendre&#x27;s conjecture for large &quot;n&quot;. Error estimates on the PNT are not (indeed, cannot be) sufficient to prove the existence of even one prime in this interval. In greater detail, the PNT allows to estimate the boundaries for all &quot;ε &gt; 0&quot;, there exists an &quot;S&quot; such that for &quot;x &gt; S&quot;:
: formula_15
: formula_16

The ratio between the lower bound &quot;π((x+1)2)&quot; and the upper bound of &quot;π(x2)&quot; is
: formula_17

Note that since formula_18 when formula_19, formula_20 for all &quot;x &gt; 0&quot;, and formula_21 for a fixed &quot;ε&quot;, there exists an &quot;R&quot; such that the ratio above is less that 1 for all &quot;x &gt; R&quot;. Thus, it does not ensure that there exists a prime between &quot;π(x2)&quot; and &quot;π((x+1)2)&quot;. More generally, these simple bounds are not enough to prove that there exists a prime between &quot;π(xn)&quot; and &quot;π((x+1)n)&quot; for any positive integer &quot;n &gt; 1&quot;.

== Generalizations ==

In 1919, Ramanujan (1887–1920) used properties of the Gamma function to give a simpler proof than Chebyshev&#x27;s. His short paper included a generalization of the postulate, from which would later arise the concept of Ramanujan primes. Further generalizations of Ramanujan primes have also been discovered; for instance, there is a proof that

:formula_22

with &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; the &quot;k&quot;th prime and &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; the &quot;n&quot;th Ramanujan prime.

Other generalizations of Bertrand&#x27;s postulate have been obtained using elementary methods. (In the following, &quot;n&quot; runs through the set of positive integers.) In 1973, Denis Hanson proved that there exists a prime between 3&quot;n&quot; and 4&quot;n&quot;.
In 2006, apparently unaware of Hanson&#x27;s result, M. El Bachraoui proposed a proof that there exists a prime between 2&quot;n&quot; and 3&quot;n&quot;. El Bachraoui&#x27;s proof is an extension of Erdős&#x27;s arguments for the primes between n and 2n. Shevelev, Greathouse, and Moses (2013) discuss related results for similar intervals.

Bertrand’s postulate over the Gaussian integers is an extension of the idea of the distribution of primes, but in this case on the complex plane. Thus, as Gaussian primes extend over the plane and not only along a line, and doubling a complex number is not simply multiplying by 2 but doubling its norm (multiplying by 1+i), different definitions lead to different results, some are still conjectures, some proven.

== Sylvester&#x27;s theorem ==

Bertrand&#x27;s postulate was proposed for applications to permutation groups. Sylvester (1814–1897) generalized the weaker statement with the statement: the product of &quot;k&quot; consecutive integers greater than &quot;k&quot; is divisible by a prime greater than &quot;k&quot;. Bertrand&#x27;s (weaker) postulate follows from this by taking &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, and considering the &quot;k&quot; numbers &quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot; + 2, up to and including &quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. According to Sylvester&#x27;s generalization, one of these numbers has a prime factor greater than &quot;k&quot;. Since all these numbers are less than 2(&quot;k&quot; + 1), the number with a prime factor greater than &quot;k&quot; has only one prime factor, and thus is a prime. Note that 2&quot;n&quot; is not prime, and thus indeed we now know there exists a prime &quot;p&quot; with &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot;.

== Erdős&#x27;s theorems ==

In 1932, Erdős (1913–1996) also published a simpler proof using binomial coefficients and the Chebyshev function formula_23, defined as:

:formula_24

where &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; runs over primes. See proof of Bertrand&#x27;s postulate for the details.

Erdős proved in 1934 that for any positive integer &quot;k&quot;, there is a natural number &quot;N&quot; such that for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;, there are at least &quot;k&quot; primes between &quot;n&quot; and 2&quot;n&quot;. An equivalent statement had been proved in 1919 by Ramanujan (see Ramanujan prime).

== Better results ==

It follows from the prime number theorem that for any real formula_25 there is a formula_26 such that for all formula_27 there is a prime formula_2 such that formula_29. It can be shown, for instance, that

:formula_30

which implies that formula_31 goes to infinity (and, in particular, is greater than 1 for sufficiently large formula_8).

Non-asymptotic bounds have also been proved. In 1952, Jitsuro Nagura proved that for formula_33 there is always a prime between formula_8 and formula_35.

In 1976, Lowell Schoenfeld showed that for formula_36, there is always a prime formula_2 in the open interval formula_38.

In his 1998 doctoral thesis, Pierre Dusart improved the above result, showing that for formula_39, 
formula_40,
and in particular for formula_41, there exists a prime formula_2 in the interval formula_43.

In 2010 Pierre Dusart proved that for formula_44 there is at least one prime formula_2 in the interval formula_46.

In 2016, Pierre Dusart improved his result from 2010, showing (Proposition 5.4) that if formula_47, there is at least one prime formula_2 in the interval formula_49. He also shows (Corollary 5.5) that for formula_50, there is at least one prime formula_2 in the interval formula_52.

Baker, Harman and Pintz proved that there is a prime in the interval formula_53 for all sufficiently large formula_13.

Dudek proved that for all formula_55, there is at least one prime between formula_56 and formula_57.

Dudek also proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies that for all formula_58 there is a prime formula_2 satisfying
:formula_60

==Consequences==
*The sequence of primes, along with 1, is a complete sequence; any positive integer can be written as a sum of primes (and 1) using each at most once.
*The only harmonic number that is an integer is the number 1.

<text>Alexander Comfort (10 February 1920 – 26 March 2000) was a British scientist and physician, writer and activist, known best for his nonfiction sex manual, &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; (1972). He was a poet and author of both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a gerontologist, geriatrician, sexologist, political theorist and commentator, anarchist, and pacifist.

==Early life and education==
Comfort was born in Palmers Green, North London, and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, then a London suburb. His parents were Alexander Charles Comfort, an administrator in education at the London County Council, and Daisy Elizabeth (Fenner) Comfort, a former teacher, who taught her son French and some Latin by the time he began school. He was educated at Highgate School in London. While he was a student there he tried to develop an improved compound of gunpowder. During his experiments he inadvertently blew up his left hand, of which only the thumb remained. Later he claimed that his left hand proved &quot;very useful for performing uterine inversions&quot;.

Comfort had a passion for molluscs, developed on family holidays in Hartland, on the Devon coast, and he joined the Conchological Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland when he was eighteen years old. He made many contributions to the literature.

He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge and studied medicine, qualifying in 1944 with the conjoint diplomas of Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) London, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) England, and Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery or MB BChir.

==Life and work==

Comfort served as a house physician at the London Hospital and later became a lecturer in physiology at the London Hospital Medical College. During 1945 he obtained the Conjoint Board&#x27;s Diploma in Child Health. He progressed to a PhD in 1949 for a dissertation titled “The Acid-Soluble Pigments of Molluscan Shells (with Special Reference to Porphyrins)&quot; from the University of London, and a DSc in the field of gerontology, also from the University of London, in 1962.

A pacifist, Comfort considered himself &quot;an aggressive anti-militarist&quot;, and he believed that pacifism rested &quot;solely upon the historical theory of anarchism&quot;. During World War Two, Comfort wrote a letter to the &quot;Tribune&quot; (2 April 1943) denouncing the Allied bombing of civilians:
The bombardment of Europe is not the work of soldiers nor of responsible statesmen. It is the work of bloodthirsty fools. ... Night after night those Europeans who risk their liberty to listen can hear the emetic threatenings and boastings of bloody-minded and reactionary civilians. They contrast the alacrity and satisfaction which attend each contemptible operation with the subterfuge and sloth which we have displayed in such tasks of constructive policy as the admission to sanctuary of the Jewish refugees.
In a letter to &quot;Horizon&quot; in 1942 Comfort claimed that a Nazi victory over the United Kingdom would lead to a literary renaissance, for which he was fiercely criticised by George Orwell in the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Comfort was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU) and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and a conscientious objector in World War II. In 1951 Comfort was a signatory of the Authors&#x27; World Peace Appeal, but later resigned from its committee, claiming the AWPA had become dominated by Soviet sympathisers. Later in the decade he actively endorsed both the Direct Action Committee against Nuclear War, 1957, and the Committee of 100, 1960. Comfort was imprisoned for a month, with Bertrand Russell and other leading members of the Committee of 100, for refusing to be bound not to continue organising the Parliament Square/Trafalgar Square protest of 17 September 1961.

Among the publications by Comfort concerning anarchism are &quot;Peace and Disobedience&quot; (1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for &quot;Peace News&quot; and PPU, and &quot;Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State&quot; (1950). He exchanged public correspondence with George Orwell defending pacifism in the open letter/poem, &quot;Letter to an American Visitor,&quot; under the pseudonym Obadiah Hornbrooke.

Comfort&#x27;s book &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; (1972) earned him worldwide fame and $3 million. But he was unhappy about becoming known as &quot;Dr. Sex&quot; and having his other works given little attention.

Comfort devoted much of the 1950s and 1960s to studying the biology of ageing (biogerontology) and popularised the subject. During 1969 he suggested that life expectancy (not simply maximum life span) could be extended to 120 years of age within the next 20 years. Although Comfort believed that ageing could be postponed, he did not believe that it could be eliminated, and he did not write about rejuvenation.

In 1989 Comfort made an extended appearance on the television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside, among others, Ian McColl and David Widgery.

One of Comfort&#x27;s final letters was to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1989, protesting against the Thatcher government&#x27;s introduction of the poll tax.

==Personal life==

&quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; made Comfort known internationally as &quot;Dr. Sex&quot; and soon thereafter he and his wife of thirty years divorced. A few months later, during 1973, Comfort married his mistress (and ex-wife&#x27;s best friend) Jane Henderson, with whom he had been having an affair for more than a decade. The Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal research institute, offered Comfort a job, and so, during 1973, the couple relocated to Santa Barbara, California.

They frequented the Sandstone Retreat, a clothing-optional community in California espousing open sexuality. In his 1981 nonfiction publication concerning sexuality in America, &quot;Thy Neighbor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, Gay Talese noted, &quot;Often the nude biologist Dr. Alex Comfort, brandishing a cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a lepidopterist strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net&quot;.

Jane Henderson, however, eventually became tired of the &quot;open love&quot; community and Comfort became involved in lawsuits with his employer concerning a claimed breach of contract. In 1985, the couple returned to England, where they lived the remainder of their lives in Kent.

During 1991, Comfort suffered a severe cerebral hemorrhage, after which his son from his first marriage acted as his caretaker and business manager. His second wife Jane Henderson died soon after the haemorrhage. He died on 26 March 2000; he was eighty years old.
== Collections ==
In 1973 Comfort deposited his archive to University College London; it was supplemented by a second donation in 1992 by his son Nicholas. The Comfort Papers span over 80 boxes of material and primarily focus on Comfort&#x27;s career and research.

<text>Geraldine Anne Ferraro (August 26, 1935 March 26, 2011) was an American politician, diplomat, and attorney. She served in the United States House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985, and was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president in the 1984 presidential election, running alongside Walter Mondale; this made her the first female vice-presidential nominee representing a major American political party. She was also a journalist, author, and businesswoman.

Ferraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the Queens County District Attorney&#x27;s Office in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. In 1978 she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she rose rapidly in the party hierarchy while focusing on legislation to bring equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans.

In 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. In doing so Ferraro also became the first widely recognized Italian American to be a major-party national nominee. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband&#x27;s finances and wealth and her congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.

Ferraro twice ran campaigns for a seat in the United States Senate from New York, in 1992 and in 1998, both times starting as the front-runner for her party&#x27;s nomination before losing in the primary election. She served as the Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1993 until 1996 during the presidential administration of Bill Clinton. She also continued her career as a journalist, author, and businesswoman, and served in the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator Hillary Clinton. Ferraro died in 2011 from multiple myeloma, 12 years after being diagnosed.

==Early life and education==

Geraldine Anne Ferraro was born on August 26, 1935, in Newburgh, New York, the daughter of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, Campania) and owner of two restaurants. She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s in Newburgh when she was young. Her father died of a heart attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro&#x27;s mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family&#x27;s money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro&#x27;s mother worked in the garment industry to support them.

Ferraro stayed on at Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s as a boarder for a while, then briefly attended a parochial school in the South Bronx. Beginning in 1947, she attended and lived at the parochial Marymount Academy in Tarrytown, New York, using income from a family rental property in Italy and skipping seventh grade. At Marymount Ferraro was a member of the honor society, active in several clubs and sports, voted most likely to succeed, and graduated in 1952. Her mother was adamant that she get a full education, despite an uncle in the family saying, &quot;Why bother? She&#x27;s pretty. She&#x27;s a girl. She&#x27;ll get married.&quot; Ferraro attended Marymount Manhattan College with a scholarship while sometimes holding two or three jobs at the same time. During her senior year she began dating John Zaccaro of Forest Hills, Queens, who had graduated from Iona College with a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps. Ferraro received a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1956; she was the first woman in her family to gain a college degree. She also passed the city exam to become a licensed school teacher.

Ferraro began working as an elementary school teacher in public schools in Astoria, Queens, &quot;because that&#x27;s what women were supposed to do.&quot; Unsatisfied, she decided to attend law school; an admissions officer said to her, &quot;I hope you&#x27;re serious, Gerry. You&#x27;re taking a man&#x27;s place, you know.&quot; She earned a Juris Doctor degree with honors from Fordham University School of Law in 1960, going to classes at night while continuing to work as a second-grade teacher at schools such as P.S. 57 during the day. Ferraro was one of only two women in her graduating class of 179. She was admitted to the bar of New York State in .

==Family, lawyer, prosecutor==
Ferraro became engaged to Zaccaro in and married him on , 1960. He became a realtor and businessman. She kept her birth name professionally, as a way to honor her mother for having supported the family after her father&#x27;s death, but used his name in parts of her private life. The couple had three children, Donna (born 1962), John Jr. (born 1964), and Laura (born 1966). They lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, and in 1971, added a vacation house in Saltaire on Fire Island. They would buy a condominium in Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1983.

While raising the children, Ferraro worked part-time as a civil lawyer in her husband&#x27;s real estate firm for 13 years. She also occasionally worked for other clients and did some &quot;pro bono&quot; work for women in family court. She spent time at local Democratic clubs, which allowed her to maintain contacts within the legal profession and become involved in local politics and campaigns. While organizing community opposition to a proposed building, Ferraro met lawyer and Democratic figure Mario Cuomo, who became a political mentor. In 1970, she was elected president of the Queens County Women&#x27;s Bar Association.

Ferraro&#x27;s first full-time political job came in , when she was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. Grumblings that she was the beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978.

As part of the D.A. office, Ferraro worked long hours, and gained a reputation for being a tough prosecutor but fair in plea negotiations. Although her unit was supposed to turn over cases which were bound for trial to another division, she took an active role in trying some cases herself, and juries were persuaded by her summations. Ferraro was upset to discover that her superior was paying her less than equivalent male colleagues because she was a married woman and already had a husband. Moreover, Ferraro found the nature of the cases she dealt with debilitating; the work left her &quot;drained and angry&quot; and she developed an ulcer. She grew frustrated that she was unable to deal with root causes, and talked about running for legislative office; Cuomo, now Secretary of State of New York, suggested the United States Congress.

==House of Representatives==

Ferraro ran for election to the U.S. House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 9th Congressional District in Queens in 1978, after longtime Democratic incumbent James Delaney announced his retirement. The location for the television series &quot;All in the Family&quot;, the district, which stretched from Astoria to Ozone Park, was known for its ethnic composition and conservative views. In a three-candidate primary race for the Democratic nomination, Ferraro faced two better-known rivals, the party organization candidate, City Councilman Thomas J. Manton and Patrick Deignan. Her main issues were law and order, support for the elderly, and neighborhood preservation. She labeled herself a &quot;&#x27;small c&#x27; conservative&quot; and emphasized that she was not a bleeding-heart liberal; her campaign slogan was &quot;Finally, A Tough Democrat&quot;. Her Italian heritage also appealed to ethnic residents in the district. She won the three-way primary with 53 percent of the vote, and then captured the general election as well, defeating Republican Alfred A. DelliBovi by a 10-percentage-point margin in a contest in which dealing with crime was the major issue and personal attacks by DelliBovi were frequent. She had been aided by $130,000 in campaign loans and donations from her own family, including $110,000 in loans from Zaccaro, of which only $4,000 was legal. The source and nature of these transactions were declared illegal by the Federal Election Commission shortly before the primary, causing Ferraro to pay back the loans in , via several real estate transactions. In 1979, the campaign and Zaccaro paid $750 in fines for civil violations of election law.
Despite being a newcomer to the House, Ferraro made a vivid impression upon arrival and quickly found prominence. She became a protégé of House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill, established a rapport with other House Democratic leaders, and rose rapidly in the party hierarchy. She was elected Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus for 1981–1983 and again for 1983–1985; this entitled her to a seat on the influential Steering and Policy Committee. In 1983, she was named to the powerful House Budget Committee. She also served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee and the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, both of which allowed Ferraro to push through projects to benefit her district. In particular, she assisted the successful effort of the Ridgewood and Glendale neighborhoods to get their ZIP codes changed from Brooklyn to their native Queens. Male colleagues viewed her with respect as someone who was tough and ambitious and in turn she was, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; later wrote, &quot;comfortable with the boys&quot;.

Ferraro was active in Democratic presidential politics as well. She served as one of the deputy chairs for the 1980 Carter-Mondale campaign. Following the election, she served actively on the Hunt Commission that in 1982, rewrote the Democratic delegate selection rules; Ferraro was credited as having been the prime agent behind the creation of superdelegates. By 1983, she was regarded as one of the up-and-coming stars of the party. She was the Chairwoman of the Platform Committee for the 1984 Democratic National Convention, the first woman to hold that position. There she held multiple hearings around the country and further gained in visibility.

While in Congress, Ferraro focused much of her legislative attention on equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. She was a cosponsor of the 1981 Economic Equity Act. On the House Select Committee on Aging, she concentrated on the problems of elderly women. In 1984, she championed a pension equity law revision that would improve the benefits of people who left work for long periods and then returned, a typical case for women with families. The Reagan administration, at first lukewarm to the measure, decided to sign it to gain the benefits of its popular appeal.
Ferraro also worked on some environmental issues. During 1980, she tried to prevent the federal government from gaining the power to override local laws on hazardous materials transportation, an effort she continued in subsequent years. In , she led passage of a Superfund renewal bill and attacked the Reagan administration&#x27;s handling of environmental site cleanups.

Ferraro took a congressional trip to Nicaragua at the start of 1984, where she spoke to the Contras. She decided that the Reagan administration&#x27;s military interventions there and in El Salvador were counterproductive towards reaching U.S. security goals, and that regional negotiations would be better.

In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982. Her vote shares increased to 58 percent and then 73 percent and much of her funding came from political action committees. While Ferraro&#x27;s pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents as well as the Catholic Church to which she belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported deployment of the Pershing II missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.

While in the House, Ferraro&#x27;s political self-description evolved to &quot;moderate&quot;. In 1982, she said her experiences as assistant district attorney had changed some of her views: &quot;... because no matter how concerned I am about spending, I have seen first hand what poverty can do to people&#x27;s lives and I just can&#x27;t, in good conscience, not do something about it.&quot; For her six years in Congress, Ferraro had an average 78 percent &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; from Americans for Democratic Action and an average 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union. The AFL–CIO&#x27;s Committee on Political Education gave her an average approval rating of 91 percent.

==1984 vice-presidential candidacy==


As the 1984 U.S. presidential election primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, the idea of picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The National Organization for Women and the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill. Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, both of whom were on Mondale&#x27;s five-person short list.

Mondale selected Ferraro to be his vice-presidential candidate on , 1984. She stated, &quot;I am absolutely thrilled.&quot; The Mondale campaign hoped that her selection would change a campaign in which he was well behind; in addition to attracting women, they hoped she could attract ethnic Democrats in the Northeast U.S. who had abandoned their party for Reagan in 1980. Her personality, variously described as blunt, feisty, spirited, and somewhat saucy, was also viewed as an asset. In turn, Mondale accepted the risk that came with her inexperience.

As Ferraro was the first woman to run on a major party national ticket in the United States, and the first Italian American, her nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention was one of the most emotional moments of that gathering, with female delegates appearing joyous and proud at the historic occasion. In her acceptance speech, Ferraro said, &quot;The daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for vice president in the new land my father came to love.&quot; Convention attendees were in tears during the speech, not just for its significance for women but for all those who had immigrated to America. The speech was listed as number 56 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century.

Ferraro gained immediate, large-scale media attention. At first, journalists focused on her novelty as a woman and her poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question &quot;Are you tough enough?&quot; was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during &quot;Meet the Press&quot; she was asked, &quot;Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?&quot;

The choice of Ferraro was viewed as a gamble, and pundits were uncertain whether it would result in a net gain or loss of votes for the Mondale campaign. While her choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22 percent of women were excited about Ferraro&#x27;s selection, versus 18 percent who agreed that it was a &quot;bad idea&quot;. By a three-to-one margin, voters thought that pressure from women&#x27;s groups had led to Mondale&#x27;s decision rather than his having chosen the best available candidate. Nonetheless, in the days after the convention Ferraro proved an effective campaigner, with a brash and confident style that forcefully criticized the Reagan administration and sometimes almost overshadowed Mondale. Mondale had been 16 points behind Reagan in polls before the pick, and after the convention he pulled even for a short time.
By the last week of July, however, questions—due initially to reporting by &quot;The New York Times&quot;—began about Ferraro&#x27;s finances, the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro, and their separately filed tax returns. (While the Mondale campaign had anticipated some questions, it had only spent 48 hours on vetting Ferraro&#x27;s family&#x27;s finances.) This was also the first time the American media had to deal with a national candidate&#x27;s husband.

Ferraro said she would release both their returns within a month, but maintained she was correct not to have included her husband&#x27;s financial holdings on her past annual congressional disclosure statements. The media also reported on the FEC&#x27;s past investigation into Ferraro&#x27;s 1978 campaign funds. Although Ferraro and Zaccaro&#x27;s finances were often interwoven on paper, with each half partners in Zaccaro&#x27;s company, Ferraro had little knowledge of his business, or even how much he was worth. Zaccaro did not understand the greater public exposure that his wife&#x27;s new position brought to their family, and resisted releasing his financial information. On , Ferraro announced that her husband would not in fact be releasing his tax returns, on the grounds that to do so would disadvantage his real estate business and that such a disclosure was voluntary and not part of election law. She joked, &quot;So you people married to Italian men, you know what it&#x27;s like.&quot;

The tax announcement dominated television and newspapers, as Ferraro was besieged by questions regarding her family finances. Furthermore, her remark about Italian men brought criticism for ethnic stereotyping, especially from fellow Italian Americans. As she later wrote, &quot;I had created a monster.&quot; Republicans saw her finances as a &quot;genderless&quot; issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might have to leave the ticket. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, followed by &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and a few other mainstream newspapers, went even further in their investigations, reporting that Zaccaro was the landlord of a company owned by pornography tycoon and Gambino crime family member Robert DiBernardo. Many other newspapers minimized their coverage of possible connections between Zaccaro and the mob, however, and law enforcement officials downplayed the allegations.

A week after her previous statement, Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, which was done on . The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant&#x27;s error. Ferraro said the statements proved overall that she had nothing to hide and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4 million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, but the disclosures hurt Ferraro&#x27;s image as a rags-to-riches story. Ferraro&#x27;s strong performance at an press conference covering the final disclosure—where she answered all questions for two hours—effectively ended the issue for the remainder of the campaign, but significant damage had been done. No campaign issue during the entire 1984 presidential campaign received more media attention than Ferraro&#x27;s finances. The exposure diminished Ferraro&#x27;s rising stardom, removed whatever momentum the Mondale–Ferraro ticket gained out of the convention, and delayed formation of a coherent message for the fall campaign.

Sharp criticism from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro on the defensive during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances with a level of fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that &quot;the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue.&quot; Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church&#x27;s position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, &quot;the Catholic Church&#x27;s position on abortion is monolithic&quot; but went on to say that &quot;But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church&quot;. Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a &quot;good Christian&quot; because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion&quot;.

Ferraro drew large crowds on the campaign trail, many of whom wished to see the history-making candidate in person, who often chanted, &quot;Ger-ry! Ger-ry!&quot; Mondale and Ferraro rarely touched during their appearances together, to the point that he would not even place his palm on her back when they stood side by side; Ferraro later said this was because anything more and &quot;people were afraid that it would look like, &#x27;Oh, my God, they&#x27;re dating.&#x27;&quot;.

There was one vice-presidential debate between Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , the result was proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan&#x27;s initial refusal to support an extension to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush&#x27;s extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, &quot;Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.&quot; She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In the days leading up to the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as &quot;that four-million-dollar—I can&#x27;t say it, but it rhymes with &#x27;rich&#x27;.&quot; Barbara Bush soon apologized, saying she had not meant to imply Ferraro was &quot;a witch&quot;. Peter Teeley, Vice President Bush&#x27;s press secretary, said of Ferraro just prior to the debate, &quot;She&#x27;s too bitchy. She&#x27;s very arrogant. Humility isn&#x27;t one of her strong points and I think that comes through.&quot; Teeley declined to apologize for the remark, saying it had no sexist implications and the Ferraro campaign was being &quot;hypersensitive&quot; in complaining about it.

On October 18 the &quot;New York Post&quot; accurately reported that Ferraro&#x27;s father had been arrested for possession of numbers slips in Newburgh shortly before his death, and inaccurately speculated that something mysterious had been covered up about that death. Ferraro&#x27;s mother had never told her about his arrest; she had been also arrested as an accomplice but released after her husband&#x27;s death. The printing of the story led Ferraro to state that &quot;Post&quot; publisher Rupert Murdoch &quot;does not have the worth to wipe the dirt under [my mother&#x27;s] shoes.&quot;

Ferraro&#x27;s womanhood was consistently discussed during the campaign; one study found that a quarter of newspaper articles written about her contained gendered language. Throughout, Ferraro kept campaigning, taking on the traditional running mate role of attacking the opposition vigorously. By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined.

On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro lost the general election in a landslide. They received only 41 percent of the popular vote compared to Reagan and Bush&#x27;s 59 percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale&#x27;s home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro&#x27;s congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro&#x27;s presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55 percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54 percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8 percent. Reagan&#x27;s personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and &quot;It&#x27;s morning again in America&quot; were quite strong, while Mondale&#x27;s liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that &quot;I knew that I was in for it with Reagan&quot; and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.

After the election, the House Ethics Committee found that Ferraro had technically violated the Ethics in Government Act by failing to report, or reporting incorrectly, details of her family&#x27;s finances, and that she should have reported her husband&#x27;s holdings on her congressional disclosure forms. However, the committee concluded that she had acted without &quot;deceptive intent&quot;, and since she was leaving Congress anyway, no action against her was taken. Ferraro said, &quot;I consider myself completely vindicated.&quot; The scrutiny of her husband and his business dealings presaged a trend that women candidates would face in American electoral politics.

Ferraro is one of only four U.S. women to run on a major party national ticket. The others are Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee; Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee; and Kamala Harris, the 2020 Democratic vice-presidential nominee and the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. 

The campaign did lead to the greater adoption of the honorific &quot;Ms.&quot; Although &quot;The New York Times&quot; refused to use it at the time for her, the paper&#x27;s iconoclastic columnist and language expert William Safire became convinced it ought to be part of the English language by the case of Ferraro, who was a married woman who used her birth surname professionally rather than her husband&#x27;s (Zaccaro). Safire wrote in August 1984 that it would be equally incorrect to call her &quot;Miss Ferraro&quot; (as she was married) or &quot;Mrs. Ferraro&quot; (as her husband was not &quot;Mr. Ferraro&quot;, although this is the formulation the &quot;Times&quot; used), and that calling her &quot;Mrs. Zaccaro&quot; would confuse the reader. Two years after the campaign, the &quot;Times&quot; finally changed its policy and began using &quot;Ms.&quot;

==First Senate run and ambassadorship==
Ferraro had relinquished her House seat to run for the vice presidency. Her new-found fame led to an appearance in a Diet Pepsi commercial in 1985. She published &quot;Ferraro: My Story&quot;, an account of the campaign with some of her life leading up to it, in . It was a best seller and earned her $1 million. She also earned over $300,000 by giving speeches.

Despite the one-sided national loss in 1984, Ferraro was still viewed as someone with a bright political future. Many expected her to run in the 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D&#x27;Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale&#x27;s ticket. But in , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband&#x27;s finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.

Members of Ferraro&#x27;s family were indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had pleaded guilty in to fraudulently obtaining bank financing in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150 hours of community service. Then, in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense did not have to present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple&#x27;s son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months&#x27; imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in whether she would have accepted the vice presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, &quot;More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it ... I think the candidacy opened a door for women in national politics, and I don&#x27;t regret that for one minute. I&#x27;m proud of that. But I just wish it could have been done in a different way.&quot;

Ferraro remained active in raising money for Democratic candidates nationwide, especially women candidates. She founded the Americans Concerned for Tomorrow political action committee, which focused on getting ten women candidates elected in the 1986 congressional elections (eight of whom would be successful). During the 1988 presidential election, Ferraro served as vice chair of the party&#x27;s Victory Fund.

She also did some commentating for television. Ferraro was a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics from 1988 to 1992, teaching in-demand seminars such as &quot;So You Want to be President?&quot; She also took care of her mother, who suffered from emphysema for several years before her death in early 1990.

By October 1991, Ferraro was ready to enter elective politics again, and ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D&#x27;Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro&#x27;s finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife&#x27;s activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.

Holtzman, who was trailing in polls, borrowed over $400,000 from Fleet Bank to run a negative ad accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro of taking more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from the DiBernardo-run pornography company whose presence in Zaccaro&#x27;s building had been raised during her 1984 vice-presidential campaign. Ferraro said there had been efforts to oust the company at the time, but they had remained in the building for three more years. In addition, a report by an investigator for the New York State Organized Crime Task Force found its way to the media via a tip from a Holtzman aide; it said that Zaccaro had been seen meeting with DiBernardo in 1985. Ferraro said in response that those two had never met.

The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in particular constantly attacked Ferraro&#x27;s integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about &quot;the ethnic slur that I am somehow or other connected to organized crime. There&#x27;s lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of the fact that I am an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype ...&quot; In the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37 percent of the vote to 36 percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.

Abrams spent much of the remainder of the campaign trying to get Ferraro&#x27;s endorsement. Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, ignored Abrams and accepted Bill Clinton&#x27;s request to campaign for his presidential bid instead. She was eventually persuaded by Governor Mario Cuomo and state party leaders into giving an unenthusiastic endorsement with just three days to go before the general election, in exchange for an apology by Abrams for the tone of the primary. D&#x27;Amato won the election by a very narrow margin. Overall the 1992 U.S. Senate elections saw five victories that it became known as the &quot;Year of the Woman&quot;. The Ferraro-Holtzman fighting of the campaign was viewed as a disaster by many feminists, however, with Ferraro denied her political comeback while Holtzman also politically damaged herself. The feud between Ferraro and Holtzman from the 1992 Senate primary lingered, as the following year Ferraro supported Assemblyman Alan Hevesi&#x27;s successful primary challenge that unseated Holtzman as New York City Comptroller; Ferraro denied that her endorsement was motivated by revenge against Holtzman, saying it was due to Hevesi&#x27;s liberal State Assembly voting record.

Following the Senate primary loss, Ferraro became a managing partner in the New York office of Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate, a Chicago-based law firm. There she organized the office and spoke with clients, but did not actively practice law and left before the firm fell into difficulties. Ferraro&#x27;s second book, a collection of her speeches, was titled &quot;Changing History: Women, Power and Politics&quot; and was published in 1993.

President Clinton appointed Ferraro as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in . She attended the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna as the alternate U.S. delegate. Then in , Clinton promoted her to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, saying that Ferraro had been &quot;a highly effective voice for the human rights of women around the world.&quot; The Clinton administration named Ferraro vice-chair of the U.S. delegation to the landmark Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing; in this role she picked a strong team of experts in human rights issues to serve with her. During her stint on the commission, it for the first time condemned anti-Semitism as a human rights violation, and also for the first time prevented China from blocking a motion criticizing its human rights record. Regarding a previous China motion that had failed, Ferraro had told the commission, &quot;Let us do what we were sent here to do—decide important questions of human rights on their merits, not avoid them.&quot; Ferraro held the U.N. position into 1996.

==Commentator and second Senate run==
In February 1996, Ferraro joined the high-visibility CNN political talk show &quot;Crossfire&quot;, as the co-host representing the &quot;from the left&quot; vantage. She kept her brassy, rapid-fire speech and New York accent intact, and her trial experience from her prosecutor days was a good fit for the program&#x27;s format. She sparred effectively with &quot;from the right&quot; co-host Pat Buchanan, for whom she developed a personal liking. The show stayed strong in ratings for CNN, and the job was lucrative. She welcomed how the role &quot;keeps me visible [and] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues.&quot;

At the start of 1998, Ferraro left &quot;Crossfire&quot; and ran for the Democratic nomination again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Chuck Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her &quot;Crossfire&quot; job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25 percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51 percent to 26 percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D&#x27;Amato in the general election.

The 1998 primary defeat brought an end to Ferraro&#x27;s political career. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote at the time: &quot;If Ms. Ferraro&#x27;s rise was meteoric, her political career&#x27;s denouement was protracted, often agonizing and, at first glance, baffling.&quot; She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus, noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state&#x27;s notoriously fierce primary races, and said: &quot;This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate. Her attempts, and even her losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished by winning.&quot;

==Business career, illness and medical activism==
In 1980, Ferraro co-founded the National Organization of Italian American Women, which sought to support the educational and professional goals of its members and put forward positive role models in order to fight ethnic stereotyping, and was still a distinguished member of its board at the time of her death. Ferraro was connected with many other political and non-profit organizations. She was a board member of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She became president of the newly established International Institute for Women&#x27;s Political Leadership in 1989. In 1992, she was on the founding board of Project Vote Smart. By 1993, she was serving on the Fordham Law School Board of Visitors, as well as on the boards of the National Breast Cancer Research Fund, the New York Easter Seal Society, and the Pension Rights Center, and was one of hundreds of public figures on the Planned Parenthood Federation of America&#x27;s Board of Advocates. In 1999, she joined the board of the Bertarelli Foundation, and in 2003, the board of the National Women&#x27;s Health Resource Center. During the 2000s she was on the board of advisors to the Committee to Free Lori Berenson.

&quot;Framing a Life: A Family Memoir&quot; was published by Ferraro in . It depicts the life story of her mother and immigrant grandmother; it also portrays the rest of her family, and is a memoir of her early life, but includes relatively little about her political career.

Ferraro had felt unusually tired at the end of her second Senate campaign. In , she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

Though initially given only three to five years to live, by virtue of several new drug therapies and a bone marrow transplant in 2005, she would beat the disease&#x27;s Stage 1 survival mean of 62 months by over a factor of two. Her advocacy helped make the new treatments approved and available for others as well. For much of the last decade of her life, Ferraro was not in remission, but the disease was managed by continually adjusting her treatments.

Ferraro joined Fox News Channel as a regular political commentator in . By 2005, she was making sporadic appearances on the channel, which continued into 2007, and beyond. She partnered with Laura Ingraham, starting in , in writing the alternate-weeks column &quot;Campaign Countdown&quot; on the 2000 presidential election for The New York Times Syndicate. During the 2000s, Ferraro was an affiliated faculty member at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute.
In January 2000, Ferraro and Lynn Martin—a former Republican Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of Labor who had played Ferraro in George H. W. Bush&#x27;s debate preparations in 1984—co-founded, and served as co-presidents of, G&amp;L Strategies, a management consulting firm underneath Weber McGinn. Its goal was to advise corporations on how to develop more women leaders and make their workplaces more amenable to female employees. G&amp;L Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made executive vice president and managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth. There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. She continued there as a senior advisor working about two days a month.

After living for many years in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, she and her husband moved to Manhattan in 2002. She republished &quot;Ferraro: My Story&quot; in 2004, with a postscript summarizing her life in the twenty years since the campaign.

Ferraro was a member of the board of directors of Goodrich Petroleum beginning in . She was also a board member for New York Bancorp in the 1990s.

Ferraro became a principal in the government relations practice of the Blank Rome law firm in , working both in New York and Washington about two days a week in their lobbying and communications activities. As she passed the age of 70, she was thankful for still being alive, and said &quot;This is about as retired as I get, which is part time,&quot; and that if she fully retired, she would &quot;go nuts&quot;.

==2008 presidential election involvement==
In December 2006, Ferraro announced her support for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Later, she vowed to help defend Clinton from being &quot;swiftboated&quot; in a manner akin to 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry. She assisted with fundraising by assuming an honorary post on the finance committee for Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

A heated nomination battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught when one of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying &quot;What is the matter with you? You &quot;know&quot; Hillary. You have &quot;seen&quot; my involvement with her.&quot; When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, &quot;What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?&quot; This was seen as an example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro&#x27;s generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton&#x27;s history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called &quot;the milestone of electing an African American president&quot;. According to Kornblut, younger voters saw &quot;Clinton [as] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn&#x27;t gotten there on her own&quot;.

The campaign between the two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. In March 2008 Ferraro gave an interview with the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; in which she said: &quot;If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.&quot; (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson&#x27;s candidacy in the party&#x27;s presidential primaries, saying that because of his &quot;radical&quot; views, &quot;if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn&#x27;t be in the race.&quot;) Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that &quot;I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) if you go back to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification.&quot; Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them &quot;patently absurd&quot;. Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro&#x27;s remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the &quot;Breeze&quot;, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: &quot;I really think they&#x27;re attacking me because I&#x27;m white. How&#x27;s that?&quot; Ferraro resigned from Clinton&#x27;s finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn&#x27;t want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton&#x27;s campaign.

Ferraro continued to engage the issue and criticize the Obama campaign via her position as a Fox News Channel contributor. By early April, Ferraro said people were deluging her with negative comments and trying to get her removed from one of the boards she was on: &quot;This has been the worst three weeks of my life.&quot; Ferraro stated in mid- that Clinton had &quot;raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran&quot;. She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him.

During September 2008, Ferraro gained attention yet again after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, &quot;It&#x27;s great to be the first, but I don&#x27;t want to be the only. And so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket.&quot; Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama&#x27;s lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media&#x27;s scrutiny of Palin&#x27;s background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro&#x27;s time to Palin&#x27;s, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that &quot;little girls [could] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [Biden].&quot; McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that &quot;Every time a woman runs, women win.&quot;

==Later years and death==
After her 1998 diagnosis, Ferraro continued to battle multiple myeloma, making repeated visits to hospitals during her last year and undergoing difficult procedures. Much of her care took place at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where she also acted as an informal advocate for other patients. She was able to make a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News Channel&#x27;s coverage of the November 2010 midterm elections.

In she went to Massachusetts General Hospital to receive treatment for pain caused by a fracture, a common complication of multiple myeloma. Once there, however, doctors discovered she had come down with pneumonia. Unable to return to her New York home, Ferraro died at Massachusetts General on , 2011. In addition to her husband and three children, who were all present, she was survived by eight grandchildren.

President Obama said upon her death that &quot;Geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women, and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life&quot;, and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what Ferraro had done. Mondale called her &quot;a remarkable woman and a dear human being ... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it&#x27;s a better country for what she did.&quot; George H. W. Bush said, &quot;Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, not the least of which was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics.&quot; Sarah Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, &quot;She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women.&quot; Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, &quot;Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original.&quot;

A funeral Mass was held for her on March 31 at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in New York, the site where Ferraro and Zaccaro had been married and had renewed their vows on their 50th anniversary the year before. Figures from local, state, and national politics were present, and Mondale and both Clintons were among the speakers. She is buried in St. John Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens, within her old congressional district.

When Hillary Clinton finally captured the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to do so for a major party, there was considerable media commentary recalling, and relating this to, Ferraro&#x27;s breakthrough 32 years earlier.

==Awards and honors==

Ferraro was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1994.

Ferraro received honorary degrees during the 1980s and early 1990s, from Marymount Manhattan College (1982), New York University Law School (1984), Hunter College (1985), Plattsburgh College (1985), College of Boca Raton (1989), Virginia State University (1989), Muhlenberg College (1990), Briarcliffe College for Business (1990), and Potsdam College (1991). She subsequently received an honorary degree from Case Western Reserve University (2003).

During her time in Congress, Ferraro received numerous awards from local organizations in Queens.

In 2007, Ferraro received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation. In 2008, Ferraro was the initial recipient of the annual Trailblazer Award from the National Conference of Women&#x27;s Bar Associations, and received the Edith I. Spivack Award from the New York County Lawyers&#x27; Association. In 2009, legislation passed the House of Representatives calling for a post office in Long Island City in Queens to be renamed for Ferraro, and in 2010, the Geraldine A. Ferraro Post Office was accordingly rededicated.

In the fall of 2013, P.S. 290Q in Ridgewood, Queens, was reopened as the A.C.E. Academy for Scholars on the Geraldine A. Ferraro Campus.

In 2018 she was chosen by the National Women&#x27;s History Project as one of its honorees for Women&#x27;s History Month in the United States.

<text>In mathematics, a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices. In contrast, in an ordinary graph, an edge connects exactly two vertices.

Formally, a directed hypergraph is a pair formula_1, where formula_2 is a set of elements called &quot;nodes&quot;, &quot;vertices&quot;, &quot;points&quot;, or &quot;elements&quot; and formula_3 is a set of pairs of subsets of formula_2. Each of these pairs formula_5 is called an &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;hyperedge&quot;; the vertex subset formula_6 is known as its &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;domain&quot;, and formula_7 as its &quot;head&quot; or &quot;codomain&quot;.

The order of a hypergraph formula_1 is the number of vertices in formula_2. The size of the hypergraph is the number of edges in formula_3. The order of an edge formula_11 in a directed hypergraph is formula_12: that is, the number of vertices in its tail followed by the number of vertices in its head.

The definition above generalizes from a directed graph to a directed hypergraph by defining the head or tail of each edge as a set of vertices (formula_13 or formula_14) rather than as a single vertex. A graph is then the special case where each of these sets contains only one element. Hence any standard graph theoretic concept that is independent of the edge orders formula_15 will generalize to hypergraph theory.

An undirected hypergraph formula_16 is an undirected graph whose edges connect not just two vertices, but an arbitrary number. An undirected hypergraph is also called a &quot;set system&quot; or a &quot;family of sets&quot; drawn from the universal set.

Hypergraphs can be viewed as incidence structures. In particular, there is a bipartite &quot;incidence graph&quot; or &quot;Levi graph&quot; corresponding to every hypergraph, and conversely, every bipartite graph can be regarded as the incidence graph of a hypergraph when it is 2-colored and it is indicated which color class corresponds to hypergraph vertices and which to hypergraph edges.

Hypergraphs have many other names. In computational geometry, an undirected hypergraph may sometimes be called a range space and then the hyperedges are called &quot;ranges&quot;.
In cooperative game theory, hypergraphs are called simple games (voting games); this notion is applied to solve problems in social choice theory. In some literature edges are referred to as &quot;hyperlinks&quot; or &quot;connectors&quot;.

The collection of hypergraphs is a category with hypergraph homomorphisms as morphisms.

==Applications==
Undirected hypergraphs are useful in modelling such things as satisfiability problems, databases, machine learning, and Steiner tree problems. They have been extensively used in machine learning tasks as the data model and classifier regularization (mathematics). The applications include recommender system (communities as hyperedges), image retrieval (correlations as hyperedges), and bioinformatics (biochemical interactions as hyperedges). Representative hypergraph learning techniques include hypergraph spectral clustering that extends the spectral graph theory with hypergraph Laplacian, and hypergraph semi-supervised learning that introduces extra hypergraph structural cost to restrict the learning results. For large scale hypergraphs, a distributed framework built using Apache Spark is also available. It can be desirable to study hypergraphs where all hyperedges have the same cardinality; a &quot;k-uniform hypergraph&quot; is a hypergraph such that all its hyperedges have size &quot;k&quot;. (In other words, one such hypergraph is a collection of sets, each such set a hyperedge connecting &quot;k&quot; nodes.) So a 2-uniform hypergraph is a graph, a 3-uniform hypergraph is a collection of unordered triples, and so on.

Directed hypergraphs can be used to model things including telephony applications, detecting money laundering, operations research, and transportation planning. They can also be used to model Horn-satisfiability.

==Generalizations of concepts from graphs==
Many theorems and concepts involving graphs also hold for hypergraphs, in particular:

*Matching in hypergraphs;
*Vertex cover in hypergraphs (also known as: transversal);
*Line graph of a hypergraph;
*Hypergraph grammar - created by augmenting a class of hypergraphs with a set of replacement rules;
*Ramsey&#x27;s theorem;
*Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem;
*Kruskal–Katona theorem on uniform hypergraphs;
*Hall-type theorems for hypergraphs.

In directed hypergraphs: transitive closure, and shortest path problems.

==Hypergraph drawing==

Although hypergraphs are more difficult to draw on paper than graphs, several researchers have studied methods for the visualization of hypergraphs.

In one possible visual representation for hypergraphs, similar to the standard graph drawing style in which curves in the plane are used to depict graph edges, a hypergraph&#x27;s vertices are depicted as points, disks, or boxes, and its hyperedges are depicted as trees that have the vertices as their leaves. If the vertices are represented as points, the hyperedges may also be shown as smooth curves that connect sets of points, or as simple closed curves that enclose sets of points.
In another style of hypergraph visualization, the subdivision model of hypergraph drawing, the plane is subdivided into regions, each of which represents a single vertex of the hypergraph. The hyperedges of the hypergraph are represented by contiguous subsets of these regions, which may be indicated by coloring, by drawing outlines around them, or both. An order-&quot;n&quot; Venn diagram, for instance, may be viewed as a subdivision drawing of a hypergraph with &quot;n&quot; hyperedges (the curves defining the diagram) and 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 vertices (represented by the regions into which these curves subdivide the plane). In contrast with the polynomial-time recognition of planar graphs, it is NP-complete to determine whether a hypergraph has a planar subdivision drawing, but the existence of a drawing of this type may be tested efficiently when the adjacency pattern of the regions is constrained to be a path, cycle, or tree.

An alternative representation of the hypergraph called PAOH is shown in the figure on top of this article. Edges are vertical lines connecting vertices. Vertices are aligned on the left. The legend on the right shows the names of the edges. It has been designed for dynamic hypergraphs but can be used for simple hypergraphs as well.

==Hypergraph coloring==
Classic hypergraph coloring is assigning one of the colors from set formula_17 to every vertex of a hypergraph in such a way that each hyperedge contains at least two vertices of distinct colors. In other words, there must be no monochromatic hyperedge with cardinality at least 2. In this sense it is a direct generalization of graph coloring. Minimum number of used distinct colors over all colorings is called the chromatic number of a hypergraph.

Hypergraphs for which there exists a coloring using up to &quot;k&quot; colors are referred to as &quot;k-colorable&quot;. The 2-colorable hypergraphs are exactly the bipartite ones.

There are many generalizations of classic hypergraph coloring. One of them is the so-called mixed hypergraph coloring, when monochromatic edges are allowed. Some mixed hypergraphs are uncolorable for any number of colors. A general criterion for uncolorability is unknown. When a mixed hypergraph is colorable, then the minimum and maximum number of used colors are called the lower and upper chromatic numbers respectively.

==Properties of hypergraphs==
A hypergraph can have various properties, such as:
* Empty - has no edges.
* Non-simple &quot;(or&quot; multiple&quot;)&quot; - has loops (hyperedges with a single vertex) or repeated edges, which means there can be two or more edges containing the same set of vertices.
* Simple - has no loops and no repeated edges.
* formula_18-regular - every vertex has degree formula_18, i.e., contained in exactly formula_18 hyperedges.
*2-colorable - its vertices can be partitioned into two classes &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; in such a way that each hyperedge with cardinality at least 2 contains at least one vertex from both classes. An alternative term is Property B.
** Two stronger properties are bipartite and balanced.
* formula_21-uniform - each hyperedge contains precisely formula_22 vertices.
* formula_21-partite - the vertices are partitioned into formula_22 parts, and each hyperedge contains precisely one vertex of each type.
** Every formula_21-partite hypergraph (for formula_26) is both formula_21-uniform and bipartite (and 2-colorable).
* Reduced: no hyperedge is a strict subset of another hyperedge; equivalently, every hyperedge is maximal for inclusion. The reduction of a hypergraph is the reduced hypergraph obtained by removing every hyperedge which is included in another hyperedge.
* Downward-closed - every subset of an undirected hypergraph&#x27;s edges is a hyperedge too. A downward-closed hypergraph is usually called an abstract simplicial complex. It is generally not reduced, unless all hyperedges have cardinality 1.
** An abstract simplicial complex with the &quot;augmentation property&quot; is called a matroid.
* Laminar: for any two hyperedges, either they are disjoint, or one is included in the other. In other words, the set of hyperedges forms a laminar set family.

== Related hypergraphs ==
Because hypergraph links can have any cardinality, there are several notions of the concept of a subgraph, called &quot;subhypergraphs&quot;, &quot;partial hypergraphs&quot; and &quot;section hypergraphs&quot;.

Let formula_28 be the hypergraph consisting of vertices

:formula_29

and having &quot;edge set&quot;

:formula_30

where formula_31 and formula_32 are the index sets of the vertices and edges respectively.

A subhypergraph is a hypergraph with some vertices removed. Formally, the subhypergraph formula_33 induced by formula_34 is defined as

:formula_35

An alternative term is the restriction of &quot;H&quot; to &quot;A&quot;.

An extension of a subhypergraph is a hypergraph where each hyperedge of formula_36 which is partially contained in the subhypergraph formula_33 is fully contained in the extension formula_38. Formally
:formula_39 with formula_40 and formula_41.

The partial hypergraph is a hypergraph with some edges removed. Given a subset formula_42 of the edge index set, the partial hypergraph generated by formula_43 is the hypergraph

:formula_44

Given a subset formula_45, the section hypergraph is the partial hypergraph

:formula_46
The dual formula_47 of formula_36 is a hypergraph whose vertices and edges are interchanged, so that the vertices are given by formula_49 and whose edges are given by formula_50 where

:formula_51

When a notion of equality is properly defined, as done below, the operation of taking the dual of a hypergraph is an involution, i.e.,

:formula_52

A connected graph &quot;G&quot; with the same vertex set as a connected hypergraph &quot;H&quot; is a host graph for &quot;H&quot; if every hyperedge of &quot;H&quot; induces a connected subgraph in &quot;G&quot;. For a disconnected hypergraph &quot;H&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is a host graph if there is a bijection between the connected components of &quot;G&quot; and of &quot;H&quot;, such that each connected component &quot;G&#x27;&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is a host of the corresponding &quot;H&#x27;&quot;.

The 2-section (or clique graph, representing graph, primal graph, Gaifman graph) of a hypergraph is the graph with the same vertices of the hypergraph, and edges between all pairs of vertices contained in the same hyperedge.

==Incidence matrix==
Let formula_53 and formula_54. Every hypergraph has an formula_55 incidence matrix.

For an undirected hypergraph, formula_56 where
:formula_57
The transpose formula_58 of the incidence matrix defines a hypergraph formula_59 called the dual of formula_36, where formula_61 is an &quot;m&quot;-element set and formula_62 is an &quot;n&quot;-element set of subsets of formula_61. For formula_64 and formula_65 if and only if formula_66.

For a directed hypergraph, the heads and tails of each hyperedge formula_67 are denoted by formula_68 and formula_69 respectively. formula_56 where
:formula_71

===Incidence graph===
A hypergraph &quot;H&quot; may be represented by a bipartite graph &quot;BG&quot; as follows: the sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are the parts of &quot;BG&quot;, and (&quot;x1&quot;, &quot;e1&quot;) are connected with an edge if and only if vertex &quot;x1&quot; is contained in edge &quot;e1&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

Conversely, any bipartite graph with fixed parts and no unconnected nodes in the second part represents some hypergraph in the manner described above. This bipartite graph is also called incidence graph.

== Adjacency matrix ==
A parallel for the adjacency matrix of a hypergraph can be drawn from the adjacency matrix of a graph. In the case of a graph, the adjacency matrix is a square matrix which indicates whether pairs of vertices are adjacent. Likewise, we can define the adjacency matrix formula_72 for a hypergraph in general where the hyperedges formula_73have real weights formula_74 with 

formula_75

==Cycles==
In contrast with ordinary undirected graphs for which there is a single natural notion of cycles and acyclic graphs, there are multiple natural non-equivalent definitions of acyclicity for hypergraphs which collapse to ordinary graph acyclicity for the special case of ordinary graphs.

A first definition of acyclicity for hypergraphs was given by Claude Berge: a hypergraph is Berge-acyclic if its incidence graph (the bipartite graph defined above) is acyclic. This definition is very restrictive: for instance, if a hypergraph has some pair formula_76 of vertices and some pair formula_77 of hyperedges such that formula_78 and formula_79, then it is Berge-cyclic. Berge-cyclicity can obviously be tested in linear time by an exploration of the incidence graph.

We can define a weaker notion of hypergraph acyclicity, later termed α-acyclicity. This notion of acyclicity is equivalent to the hypergraph being conformal (every clique of the primal graph is covered by some hyperedge) and its primal graph being chordal; it is also equivalent to reducibility to the empty graph through the GYO algorithm (also known as Graham&#x27;s algorithm), a confluent iterative process which removes hyperedges using a generalized definition of ears. In the domain of database theory, it is known that a database schema enjoys certain desirable properties if its underlying hypergraph is α-acyclic. Besides, α-acyclicity is also related to the expressiveness of the guarded fragment of first-order logic.

We can test in linear time if a hypergraph is α-acyclic.

Note that α-acyclicity has the counter-intuitive property that adding hyperedges to an α-cyclic hypergraph may make it α-acyclic (for instance, adding a hyperedge containing all vertices of the hypergraph will always make it α-acyclic). Motivated in part by this perceived shortcoming, Ronald Fagin defined the stronger notions of β-acyclicity and γ-acyclicity. We can state β-acyclicity as the requirement that all subhypergraphs of the hypergraph are α-acyclic, which is equivalent to an earlier definition by Graham. The notion of γ-acyclicity is a more restrictive condition which is equivalent to several desirable properties of database schemas and is related to Bachman diagrams. Both β-acyclicity and γ-acyclicity can be tested in polynomial time.

Those four notions of acyclicity are comparable: Berge-acyclicity implies γ-acyclicity which implies β-acyclicity which implies α-acyclicity. However, none of the reverse implications hold, so those four notions are different.

==Isomorphism, symmetry, and equality==
A hypergraph homomorphism is a map from the vertex set of one hypergraph to another such that each edge maps to one other edge.

A hypergraph formula_28 is &quot;isomorphic&quot; to a hypergraph formula_81, written as formula_82 if there exists a bijection

:formula_83

and a permutation formula_84 of formula_85 such that

:formula_86

The bijection formula_87 is then called the isomorphism of the graphs. Note that

:formula_82 if and only if formula_89.

When the edges of a hypergraph are explicitly labeled, one has the additional notion of &quot;strong isomorphism&quot;. One says that formula_36 is &quot;strongly isomorphic&quot; to formula_91 if the permutation is the identity. One then writes formula_92. Note that all strongly isomorphic graphs are isomorphic, but not vice versa.

When the vertices of a hypergraph are explicitly labeled, one has the notions of &quot;equivalence&quot;, and also of &quot;equality&quot;. One says that formula_36 is &quot;equivalent&quot; to formula_91, and writes formula_95 if the isomorphism formula_87 has

:formula_97

and

:formula_86

Note that

:formula_95 if and only if formula_100

If, in addition, the permutation formula_84 is the identity, one says that formula_36 equals formula_91, and writes formula_104. Note that, with this definition of equality, graphs are self-dual:

:formula_105

A hypergraph automorphism is an isomorphism from a vertex set into itself, that is a relabeling of vertices. The set of automorphisms of a hypergraph &quot;H&quot; (= (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;E&quot;)) is a group under composition, called the automorphism group of the hypergraph and written Aut(&quot;H&quot;).

===Examples===
Consider the hypergraph formula_36 with edges
:formula_107
and
:formula_108

Then clearly formula_36 and formula_91 are isomorphic (with formula_111, &quot;etc.&quot;), but they are not strongly isomorphic. So, for example, in formula_36, vertex formula_113 meets edges 1, 4 and 6, so that,

:formula_114

In graph formula_91, there does not exist any vertex that meets edges 1, 4 and 6:

:formula_116

In this example, formula_36 and formula_91 are equivalent, formula_95, and the duals are strongly isomorphic: formula_120.

===Symmetry===
The &quot;&quot; formula_121 of a hypergraph formula_36 is the maximum cardinality of any of the edges in the hypergraph. If all edges have the same cardinality &quot;k&quot;, the hypergraph is said to be &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;k-uniform&quot;, or is called a &quot;k-hypergraph&quot;. A graph is just a 2-uniform hypergraph.

The degree &quot;d(v)&quot; of a vertex &quot;v&quot; is the number of edges that contain it. &quot;H&quot; is &quot;k-regular&quot; if every vertex has degree &quot;k&quot;.

The dual of a uniform hypergraph is regular and vice versa.

Two vertices &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;H&quot; are called &quot;symmetric&quot; if there exists an automorphism such that formula_123. Two edges formula_124 and formula_67 are said to be &quot;symmetric&quot; if there exists an automorphism such that formula_126.

A hypergraph is said to be &quot;vertex-transitive&quot; (or &quot;vertex-symmetric&quot;) if all of its vertices are symmetric. Similarly, a hypergraph is &quot;edge-transitive&quot; if all edges are symmetric. If a hypergraph is both edge- and vertex-symmetric, then the hypergraph is simply &quot;transitive&quot;.

Because of hypergraph duality, the study of edge-transitivity is identical to the study of vertex-transitivity.

==Partitions==
A partition theorem due to E. Dauber states that, for an edge-transitive hypergraph formula_28, there exists a partition

:formula_128

of the vertex set formula_2 such that the subhypergraph formula_130 generated by formula_131 is transitive for each formula_132, and such that

:formula_133

where formula_121 is the rank of &quot;H&quot;.

As a corollary, an edge-transitive hypergraph that is not vertex-transitive is bicolorable.

Graph partitioning (and in particular, hypergraph partitioning) has many applications to IC design and parallel computing. Efficient and scalable hypergraph partitioning algorithms are also important for processing large scale hypergraphs in machine learning tasks.

==Further generalizations==

One possible generalization of a hypergraph is to allow edges to point at other edges. There are two variations of this generalization. In one, the edges consist not only of a set of vertices, but may also contain subsets of vertices, subsets of subsets of vertices and so on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. In essence, every edge is just an internal node of a tree or directed acyclic graph, and vertices are the leaf nodes. A hypergraph is then just a collection of trees with common, shared nodes (that is, a given internal node or leaf may occur in several different trees). Conversely, every collection of trees can be understood as this generalized hypergraph. Since trees are widely used throughout computer science and many other branches of mathematics, one could say that hypergraphs appear naturally as well. So, for example, this generalization arises naturally as a model of term algebra; edges correspond to terms and vertices correspond to constants or variables.

For such a hypergraph, set membership then provides an ordering, but the ordering is neither a partial order nor a preorder, since it is not transitive. The graph corresponding to the Levi graph of this generalization is a directed acyclic graph. Consider, for example, the generalized hypergraph whose vertex set is formula_135 and whose edges are formula_136 and formula_137. Then, although formula_138 and formula_139, it is not true that formula_140. However, the transitive closure of set membership for such hypergraphs does induce a partial order, and &quot;flattens&quot; the hypergraph into a partially ordered set.

Alternately, edges can be allowed to point at other edges, irrespective of the requirement that the edges be ordered as directed, acyclic graphs. This allows graphs with edge-loops, which need not contain vertices at all. For example, consider the generalized hypergraph consisting of two edges formula_141 and formula_142, and zero vertices, so that formula_143 and formula_144. As this loop is infinitely recursive, sets that are the edges violate the axiom of foundation. In particular, there is no transitive closure of set membership for such hypergraphs. Although such structures may seem strange at first, they can be readily understood by noting that the equivalent generalization of their Levi graph is no longer bipartite, but is rather just some general directed graph.

The generalized incidence matrix for such hypergraphs is, by definition, a square matrix, of a rank equal to the total number of vertices plus edges. Thus, for the above example, the incidence matrix is simply

:formula_145

<text>Christopher Frank Foss (born 1946) is a British artist and science fiction illustrator. He is best known for his science fiction book covers and the black and white illustrations for the original editions of &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
Born in 1946 in Guernsey, Channel Islands, Foss started working there as an artist in his teens, creating signage for local companies. He went to a boarding school in Dorset; his master encouraged him to train for an art scholarship. While studying at Magdalene College, Cambridge, he started pursuing professional magazine commissions, including the then recently launched &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine.

===Science-fiction illustrations===
Books featuring Foss illustrations include the 1970s British paperback covers for Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Foundation Trilogy, several of Edmund Cooper&#x27;s novels, and E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&#x27;s Lensman and &quot;Skylark&quot; series. Some of the art he did produce was specific to the stories and some examples of this are the covers he did for the Grafton publications of the Demon Princes novels by Jack Vance in the late 1980s, &quot;Star King&quot;, &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;, &quot;The Palace of Love&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;.

Not being a fan of science fiction, Foss typically did not read the books he illustrated, preferring to paint scenes entirely from his imagination.

In 1975, Foss was hired by director Alejandro Jodorowsky for an intended film version of the science-fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; by author Frank Herbert. He delivered several conceptual studies published in the book &quot;21st Century Foss&quot;, , containing a foreword by Jodorowsky. The project failed. In 1977 Foss worked for several months on studies for the movie &quot;Alien&quot; (not being used in the movie) and also did some designs of the planet Krypton for the movie &quot;Superman&quot;. Some of his crystal structures for the planet were realised in the movie, although they were used as ice-structures.

During this period Chris Foss illustrated the sleeve of the album &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot; for the Ian Gillan Band.

Painter Glenn Brown controversially appropriated individual space scene paintings by Foss and in the one case copying and altering it (&quot;Exercise One (for Ian Curtis)&quot;, 1995) and in the other, leaving it entirely unchanged (&quot;Dark Angel (for Ian Curtis)&quot;, 2002).

Chris Foss created much of the colour concept art for Sweetpea Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Traveller&quot; franchise, as produced by Imperium Games. He produced 12 pages of artwork for the new &quot;Traveller&quot; edition&#x27;s first supplement, &quot;Starships&quot; (1996). He also illustrated a number of covers for Imperium&#x27;s &quot;Traveller&quot;.

===&quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;===
In contrast, Foss&#x27;s numerous illustrations for the sex manual &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; are done in a soft, natural style. The illustrations were based on photographs taken by Chris in his studio in Fulham, London.

<text>Imogen Cunningham (; April 12, 1883 – June 23, 1976) was an American photographer known for her botanical photography, nudes, and industrial landscapes. Cunningham was a member of the California-based Group f/64, known for its dedication to the sharp-focus rendition of simple subjects.

== Early life ==
Cunningham was born in Portland, Oregon to father Isaac Burns Cunningham and mother Susan Elizabeth Cunningham (née Johnson). Her parents were from Missouri, though both of their families originally came from Virginia. Cunningham was the fifth of 10 children. Although art was not included in the traditional school curriculum, as a child Cunningham took art lessons on weekends and during vacations.

She grew up in Seattle, Washington and attended the Denny School at 5th and Battery Streets in Seattle.

In 1901, at the age of eighteen, Cunningham bought her first camera, a 4x5 inch view camera, via mail order from the American School of Art in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

She entered the University of Washington in 1903, where she became a charter member of the Washington Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi fraternity for Women. It was not until 1906, while studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, that she was inspired to take up photography again by an encounter with the work of Gertrude Käsebier. Her first photographs in 1906 were portraits taken with a 4-by-5-inch-format camera. With the help of her chemistry professor, Horace Byers, she began to study the chemistry behind photography while paying for her tuition by photographing plants for the botany department.

In 1907, Cunningham graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in chemistry. Her thesis was titled &quot;Modern Processes of Photography.&quot; While there, she served as class vice-president, participated in the German Club and Chemistry Club, and was on the yearbook staff.

== Career ==
After graduating from college in 1907, Cunningham went to work for Edward S. Curtis in his Seattle studio, gaining knowledge about the portrait business and practical photography. Cunningham worked for Curtis on his project of documenting American Indian tribes for the book &quot;The North American Indian&quot;, which was published in twenty volumes between 1907 and 1930. Cunningham learned the technique of platinum printing under Curtis&#x27;s supervision and became fascinated by the process.

=== Germany===
In 1909, Cunningham was awarded the Pi Beta Phi Graduate Fellowship. This grant allowed her to continue her studies at the Technische Hochschule (trans.: Technical University) in Dresden, Germany, with Professor Robert Luther, the founder of the university&#x27;s &quot;Institut für Photographie&quot;. There, she didn&#x27;t take many photographs, but helped the photographic chemistry department find cheaper solutions for the expensive and rare platinum used for printing. In May 1910, she finished her paper, &quot;About the direct development of platinum paper for brown tones&quot;, describing her process aiming to increase printing speed, improve clarity of highlights tones, and produce sepia tones.

On her way back to Seattle, she met with photographers Alvin Langdon Coburn (in London) and Alfred Stieglitz and Gertrude Käsebier in New York.

=== Seattle ===
In Seattle, Cunningham opened a studio and later won acclaim for portraiture and pictorial work. Most of her studio work of this time consisted of sitters in their own homes, in her living room, or in the woods surrounding her cottage. At one point she and her husband Roi Partridge, a Seattle artist and print maker, climbed up to the Alpine wild flower fields on Mt. Rainier where Roi posed nude as a mystical woodland faun. Her images were shown by the Seattle Fine Arts Society and were later published in the Seattle newspaper the &quot;Town Crier&quot;, where they caused a scandal due to a woman photographing a male nude. One critic wrote that her work was vulgar and charged her with being an immoral woman, but Cunningham stated that, &quot;It didn&#x27;t make a single bit of difference in my business. Nobody thought worse of me.&quot; Cunningham didn&#x27;t revisit those photographs for another fifty-five years.

Cunningham was also known to take nude photos of herself of which her granddaughter, Meg Partridge, said: &quot;Her self-portraits really show her sense of humor, and she was smart about her career. She actively published her work in magazines and newspapers. She had a good eye, but she was a great editor. She knew how to edit her work, so what the world sees is an impressive selection of work.&quot;

She became a sought-after photographer and exhibited at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1913. In 1914, Cunningham&#x27;s portraits were shown at &quot;An International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography&quot; in New York. &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Photographic Magazine&quot; published a portfolio of her work.

The next year, she married Partridge. Between 1915 and 1920, Cunningham continued her work and had three children (Gryffyd, Rondal, who also became a photographer, and Padraic) with Partridge.

=== California ===

In 1917, the family moved to San Francisco, and in 1920 they moved to the Mills College campus in Oakland, where Partridge taught art.

Cunningham refined her style, taking a greater interest in pattern and detail and becoming increasingly interested in botanical photography, especially flowers. Between 1923 and 1925 she carried out an in-depth study of the Magnolia flower. In 1933, Cunningham founded the California Horticultural Society in which her images were so detailed and clear that many horticulturalist and scientists used her images in their studies. Later in the decade she turned her attention toward industry, creating several series of industrial landscapes in Los Angeles and Oakland.

In 1929, Edward Weston nominated 10 of Cunningham&#x27;s photographs (8 botanical, 1 industrial, and 1 nude) for inclusion in the &quot;Film und Foto&quot; exhibition. Her renowned &quot;Two Callas&quot; debuted in that exhibition.

Cunningham once again changed direction, becoming more interested in the human form, particularly hands, and she was fascinated with the hands of artists and musicians. This interest led to her employment by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, photographing stars without make-up.

==== Group f/64 ====
As Cunningham moved away from pictorialism to embrace sharp-focus photography she joined with like-minded photographers, including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Willard Van Dyke. Together these individuals formed Group f/64 to promote a more relevant and meaningful style of photography, that rejected soft and pictorial and promoted what they called &quot;pure or straight photography.&quot; They aimed to promote simple and straightforward photography technique that employed the smallest focal apertures (f/64 being the smallest) to create finely detailed images. In an interview Cunningham mentioned that the f/64 group &quot;is not only American, it is Western American. It isn&#x27;t even American. It&#x27;s western.&quot; She also mentioned, &quot;This does not mean that we all used the small aperture, but we were for reality. That was what we talked about too. Not being phony, you know.&quot;

==== &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; ====
In 1932, Cunningham was invited to do some work in New York for &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; They commissioned her to make portraits of &quot;ugly men&quot; that were prominent in the arts. She created photographs that highlighted actors Wallace Beery and Spencer Tracy. Her work with Vanity Fair, Sunset and other magazines included portraits of Gertrude Stein, Minor White, James Broughton, Martha Graham, August Sander, Man Ray and Theodore Roethke. She continued with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; until it stopped publication in 1936.

== Later career ==

=== Street photography ===
In the 1940s, Cunningham turned to documentary street photography, which she executed as a side project while supporting herself with her commercial and studio photography. In 1945, Cunningham was invited by Ansel Adams to accept a position as a faculty member for the art photography department at the California School of Fine Arts. Dorothea Lange and Minor White joined as well.

=== Mentorship ===

In 1964, Imogen Cunningham met the photographer Judy Dater while leading a workshop focusing on the life and work of Edward Weston in Big Sur Hot Springs, California which later became the Esalen Institute. Dater was greatly inspired by Cunningham&#x27;s life and work. Cunningham is featured in one of Dater&#x27;s most popular photographs, &quot;Imogen and Twinka at Yosemite&quot;, which depicts elderly Cunningham encountering nude model Twinka Thiebaud behind a tree in Yosemite National Park. The two shared an interest in portraiture and remained friends until Cunningham&#x27;s death in 1976. Three years later, Dater published Imogen &quot;Cunningham: A Portrait,&quot; containing interviews with many of Cunningham&#x27;s photographic contemporaries, friends, and family along with photographs by both Dater and Cunningham.

In 1973, her work was exhibited at the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles photography festival in France through the group exhibition: &quot;Trois photographes américaines, Imogen Cunningham, Linda Connor, Judy Dater.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On February 11, 1915, Cunningham married etching artist, printmaker and teacher Roi Partridge. They had three sons: Gryffyd Partridge and twins Rondal Partridge and Padraic Partridge. The couple divorced in 1934. Rondal&#x27;s daughter, Meg Partridge, cataloged Cunningham&#x27;s work.

As of 1940, Cunningham lived in Oakland, California, though she had studios in various locations in San Francisco.

Cunningham continued to take photographs until shortly before her death at age 93, on June 23, 1976, in San Francisco, California.

Cunningham was named Imogen after the heroine of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline.&quot;

<text>Edward Henry Weston (March 24, 1886 – January 1, 1958) was an American photographer. He has been called &quot;one of the most innovative and influential American photographers&quot; and &quot;one of the masters of 20th century photography.&quot; Over the course of his 40-year career Weston photographed an increasingly expansive set of subjects, including landscapes, still lifes, nudes, portraits, genre scenes, and even whimsical parodies. It is said that he developed a 
&quot;quintessentially American, and especially Californian, approach to modern photography&quot; because of his focus on the people and places of the American West. In 1937 Weston was the first photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, and over the next two years he produced nearly 1,400 negatives using his 8 × 10 view camera. Some of his most famous 
photographs were taken of the trees and rocks at Point Lobos, California, near where he lived for many years.

Weston was born in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. He knew he wanted to be a photographer from an early age, and initially his work was typical of the soft focus pictorialism that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.

In 1947 he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and he soon stopped photographing. He spent the remaining ten years of his life overseeing the printing of more than 1,000 of his most famous images.

==Life and work==

=== 1886–1906: Early life ===

Weston was born in Highland Park, Illinois, the second child and only son of Edward Burbank Weston, an obstetrician, and Alice Jeanette Brett, a Shakespearean actress. His mother died when he was five years old and he was raised mostly by his sister Mary, whom he called &quot;May&quot; or &quot;Maisie&quot;. She was nine years older than he, and they developed a very close bond that was one of the few steady relationships in Weston&#x27;s life.

His father remarried when he was nine, but neither Weston nor his sister got along with their new stepmother and stepbrother. After May was married and left their home in 1897, Weston&#x27;s father devoted most of his time to his new wife and her son. Weston was left on his own much of the time; he stopped going to school and withdrew into his own room in their large home.

As a present for his 16th birthday Weston&#x27;s father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull&#x27;s-Eye No. 2, which was a simple box camera. He took it on vacation in the Midwest, and by the time he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7 inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, &quot;I feel that my earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913 to 1920, a period in which I was trying to be artistic.&quot;

In 1904 May and her family moved to California, leaving Weston further isolated in Chicago. He earned a living by taking a job at a local department store, but he continued to spend most of his free time taking photos, Within two years he felt confident enough of his photography that he submitted his work to the magazine &quot;Camera and Darkroom&quot;, and in the April 1906 issue they published a full-page reproduction of his picture &quot;Spring, Chicago&quot;. This is the first known publication of any of his photographs.

In September 1904, Weston took part in the men&#x27;s double American round archery event at the 1904 Summer Olympics with his father also taking part in the same event.

=== 1906–1923: Becoming a photographer ===
At his sister&#x27;s urging Weston left Chicago in the spring of 1906 and moved near May&#x27;s home in Tropico, California (now a neighborhood in Glendale). He decided to stay there and pursue a career in photography, but he soon realized he needed more professional training. A year later he moved to Effingham, Illinois, to enroll in the Illinois College of Photography. They taught a nine-month course, but Weston finished all of the class work in six months. The school refused to give him a diploma unless he paid for the full nine months; Weston refused and instead moved back to California in the spring of 1908.

He briefly worked at the photography studio of George Steckel in Los Angeles, as a negative retoucher. Within a few months he moved to the more established studio of Louis Mojonier. For the next several years he learned the techniques and business of operating a photography studio under Mojonier&#x27;s direction.

Within days of his visit to Tropico, Weston was introduced to his sister&#x27;s best friend, Flora May Chandler. She was a graduate of the Normal School, later to become UCLA. She assumed the position of a grade-school teacher in Tropico.
She was seven years older than Weston and a distant relative of Harry Chandler, who at that time was described as the head of &quot;the single most powerful family in Southern California&quot;. This fact did not go unnoticed by Weston and his biographers.

On January 30, 1909, Weston and Chandler married in a simple ceremony. The first of their four sons, Edward Chandler Weston (1910–1993), known as Chandler, was born on April 26, 1910. 
Named Edward Chandler, after Weston and his wife, he later became a photographer as well.

In 1910 Weston opened his own business, called &quot;The Little Studio&quot;, in Tropico. His sister later asked him why he opened his studio in Tropico rather than in the nearby metropolis of Los Angeles, and he replied &quot;Sis, I&#x27;m going to make my name so famous that it won&#x27;t matter where I live.&quot;

For the next three years he worked, alone and sometimes with the assistance of family members in his studio. Even at that early stage of his career he was highly particular about his work; in an interview at that time he said &quot;Photographic plates are nothing to me unless I get what I want. I have used thirty of them at a sitting if I did not secure the effect to suit me.&quot;

His critical eye paid off for him and he quickly gained more recognition for his work. He won prizes in national competitions, published several more photographs and wrote articles for magazines such as &quot;Photo-Era&quot; and &quot;American Photography&quot;, championing the pictorial style.

On December 16, 1911, Weston&#x27;s second son, Theodore Brett Weston (1911–1993), was born. He became a long-time artistic collaborator with his father and an important photographer on his own.
Sometime in the fall of 1913, Los Angeles photographer, Margrethe Mather visited Weston&#x27;s studio because of his growing reputation, and within a few months they developed an intense relationship. Weston was a quiet Midwestern transplant to California, and Mather was a part of the growing bohemian cultural scene in Los Angeles. She was very outgoing and artistic in a flamboyant way, and her permissive sexual morals were far different from the conservative Weston at the time – Mather had been a prostitute and was bisexual with a preference for women. Mather presented a stark contrast to Weston&#x27;s home life; his wife Flora was described as a &quot;homely, rigid Puritan, and an utterly conventional woman, with whom he had little in common since he abhorred conventions&quot; ‒ and he found Mather&#x27;s uninhibited lifestyle irresistible and her photographic vision intriguing.

He asked Mather to be his studio assistant, and for the next decade they worked closely together, making individual and jointly signed portraits of writers Carl Sandburg and Max Eastman. A joint exhibition of their work in 2001 revealed that during this period Weston emulated Mather&#x27;s style and, later, her choice of subjects. On her own Mather photographed &quot;fans, hands, eggs, melons, waves, bathroom fixtures, seashells and birds wings, all subjects that Weston would also explore.&quot; A decade later he described her as &quot;the first important person in my life, and perhaps even now, though personal contact has gone, the most important.&quot;
In early 1915 Weston began keeping detailed journals he later came to call his &quot;Daybooks&quot;. For the next two decades he recorded his thoughts about his work, observations about photography, and his interactions with friends, lovers and family. On December 6, 1916, a third son, Lawrence Neil Weston, was born. He also followed in the footsteps of his father and became a well-known photographer. It was during this period that Weston first met photographer Johan Hagemeyer, whom Weston mentored and lent his studio to from time to time. Later, Hagemeyer would return the favor by letting Weston use his studio in Carmel after he returned from Mexico. For the next several years Weston continued to earn a living by taking portraits in his small studio which he called &quot;the shack&quot;.

Meanwhile, Flora was spending all of her time caring for their children. Their fourth son, Cole Weston (1919–2003), was born on January 30, 1919, and afterward she rarely had time to leave their home.

Over the summer of 1920 Weston met two people who were part of the growing Los Angeles cultural scene: Roubaix de l&#x27;Abrie Richey, known as &quot;Robo&quot; and a woman he called his wife, Tina Modotti. Modotti, who was then known only as a stage and film actress, was never married to Robo, but they pretended to be for the sake of his family. Weston and Modotti were immediately attracted to each other, and they soon became lovers. Richey knew of Modotti&#x27;s affair, but he continued to be friends with Weston and later invited him to come to Mexico and share his studio.

The following year Weston agreed to allow Mather to become an equal partner in his studio. For several months they took portraits that they signed with both of their names. This was the only time in his long career that Weston shared credit with another photographer.

Sometime in 1920 he began photographing nude models for the first time. His first models were his wife Flora and their children, but soon thereafter he took at least three nude studies of Mather. He followed these with several more photographs of nude models, the first of dozens of figure studies he would make of friends and lovers over the next twenty years.

Until now Weston had kept his relationships with other women a secret from his wife, but as he began to photograph more nudes Flora became suspicious about what went on with him and his models. Chandler recalled that his mother regularly sent him on &quot;errands&quot; to his father&#x27;s studio and asked him to tell her who was there and what they were doing.

One of the first who agreed to model nude for Weston was Modotti. She became his primary model for the next several years.


In 1922 he visited his sister May, who had moved to Middletown, Ohio. While there he made five or six photographs of the tall smoke stacks at the nearby Armco steel mill. These images signaled a change in Weston&#x27;s photographic style, a transition from the soft-focus pictorialism of the past to a new, cleaner-edge style. He immediately recognized the change and later recorded it in his notes: &quot;The Middletown visit was something to remember...most of all in importance was my photographing of &#x27;Armco&#x27;...That day I made great photographs, even Stieglitz thought they were important!&quot; Weston Naef, former curator of photography at the J. Paul Getty Museum, has praised the &quot;technical virtuosity&quot; of Weston&#x27;s most successful Armco image (a print of which is owned by the Getty): &quot;The range of grays across that forest of columns has about every gray you can image.&quot;

At that time New York City was the cultural center for photography as an art form in America, and Alfred Stieglitz was the most influential figure in photography. Weston badly wanted to go to New York to meet with him, but he did not have enough money to make the trip. His brother-in-law gave him enough money to continue on from Middletown to New York City, and he spent most of October and early November there. While there he met artist Charles Sheeler and photographers Clarence H. White, Gertrude Kasebier, as well as Stieglitz. Weston wrote that Stieglitz told him, &quot;Your work and attitude reassures me. You have shown me at least several prints which have given me a great deal of joy. And I can seldom say that of photographs.&quot;

Soon after Weston returned from New York, Robo moved to Mexico and set up a studio there to create batiks. Within a short while he had arranged for a joint exhibition of his work and of photographs by Weston, Mather and a few others. In early 1923 Modotti left by train to be with Robo in Mexico, but he contracted smallpox and died shortly before she arrived. Modotti was grief-stricken, but within a few weeks she felt well enough that she decided to stay and carry out the exhibition that Robo had planned. The show was a success, and due in no small part to his nude studies of Modotti, it firmly established Weston&#x27;s artistic reputation in Mexico.

After the show closed Modotti returned to California, and Weston and she made plans to return to Mexico together. He wanted to spend a couple of months there photographing and promoting his work, and, conveniently, he could travel under the pretense of Modotti being his assistant and translator.

The week before he left for Mexico, Weston briefly reunited with Mather and took several nudes of her lying in the sand at Redondo Beach. These images were very different from his previous nude studies – sharply focused and showing her entire body in relation to the natural setting. They have been called the artistic prototypes for his most famous nudes, those of Charis Wilson which he would take more than a decade later.

=== 1923–1927: Mexico ===

On July 30, 1923, Weston, his son Chandler, and Modotti left on a steamer for the extended trip to Mexico. His wife, Flora, and their other three sons waved goodbye to them at the dock. It&#x27;s unknown what Flora understood or thought about the relationship between Weston and Modotti, but she is reported to have called out at the dock, &quot;Tina, take good care of my boys.&quot;

They arrived in Mexico City on August 11 and rented a large hacienda outside of the city. Within a month he had arranged for an exhibition of his work at the Aztec Land Gallery, and on October 17 the show opened to glowing press reviews. He was particularly proud of a review by Marius de Zayas that said &quot;Photography is beginning to be photography, for until now it has only been art.&quot;

The different culture and scenery in Mexico forced Weston to look at things in new ways. He became more responsive to what was in front of him, and he turned his camera on everyday objects like toys, doorways and bathroom fixtures. He also made several intimate nudes and portraits of Modotti. He wrote in his &quot;Daybooks&quot;:

Weston continued to photograph the people and things around him, and his reputation in Mexico increased the longer he stayed. He had a second exhibition at the Aztec Land Gallery in 1924, and he had a steady stream of local socialites asking him to take their portraits. At the same time, Weston began to miss his other sons back in the U.S. As with many of his actions, though, it was a woman who motivated him most. He had recently corresponded with a woman he had known for several years named Miriam Lerner, and as her letters became more passionate he longed to see her again.

He and Chandler returned to San Francisco at the end of 1924, and the next month he set up a studio with Johan Hagemeyer. Weston seemed to be struggling with his past and his future during this period. He burned all of his pre-Mexico journals, as though trying to erase the past, and started a new series of nudes with Lerner and with his son Neil. He wrote that these images were &quot;the start of a new period in my approach and attitude towards photography.&quot;

His new relationship with Lerner did not last long, and in August 1925 he returned to Mexico, this time with his son Brett. Modotti had arranged a joint show of their photographs, and it opened the week he returned. He received new critical acclaim and six of his prints were purchased for the State Museum. For the next several months he concentrated once again on photographing folk art, toys and local scenes. One of his strongest images of this period is of three black clay pots that art historian Rene d&#x27;Harnoncourt described as &quot;the beginning of a new art.&quot;

In May 1926 Weston signed a contract with writer Anita Brenner for $1,000 to make photographs for a book she was writing about Mexican folk art. In June he, Modotti and Brett started traveling around the country in search of lesser known native arts and crafts. His contract required him to give Brenner three finished prints from 400 8x10 negatives, and it took him until November of that year to complete the work. During their travels, Brett received a crash course in photography from his father, and he made more than two dozen prints which his father judged to be of exceptional quality.

By the time they returned from their trip, Weston and Modotti&#x27;s relationship had crumbled, and within less than two weeks he and Brett returned to California. He never traveled to Mexico again.

=== 1927–1935: Glendale to Carmel ===
Weston initially returned to his old studio in Glendale (previously called Tropico). He hastily arranged a dual exhibition at University of California of the photographs that he and Brett had made the year before. The father showed 100 prints and the son showed 20. Brett was only 15 years old at the time.

In February he started a new series of nudes, this time of dancer Bertha Wardell. One of this series, of her kneeling body cut off at the shoulders, is one of Weston&#x27;s most well-known figure studies. At this same time he met Canadian painter Henrietta Shore, whom he asked to comment on the photos of Wardell. He was surprised by her honest critique: &quot;I wish you would not do so many nudes – you are getting &quot;used&quot; to them, the subject no longer amazes you ‒ most of these are &quot;just&quot; nudes.&quot;

He asked to look at her work and was intrigued by her large paintings of sea shells. He borrowed several shells from her, thinking he might find some inspiration for a new still life series. Over the next few weeks he explored many different kinds of shell and background combinations – in his log of photographs taken for 1927 he listed fourteen negatives of shells. One of these, simply called &quot;Nautilus&quot;, 1927&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Shell&quot;, 1927), became one of his most famous images. Modotti called the image &quot;mystical and erotic,&quot; and when she showed it to Rene d&#x27;Harnoncourt he said he felt &quot;weak at the knees.&quot; Weston is known to have made at least twenty-eight prints of this image, more than he had made of any other shell image.

In September of that year Weston had a major exhibition at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. At the opening of the show he met fellow photographer Willard Van Dyke, who later introduced Weston to Ansel Adams.

In May 1928, Weston and Brett made a brief but important trip to the Mojave Desert. It was there that he first explored and photographed landscapes as an art form. He found the stark rock forms and empty spaces to be a visual revelation, and over a long weekend he took twenty-seven photographs. In his journal he declared &quot;these negatives are the most important I have ever done.&quot;

Later that year he and Brett moved to San Francisco, where they lived and worked in a small studio owned by Hagemeyer. He made portraits to earn an income, but he longed to get away by himself and get back to his art. In early 1929 he moved to Johan Hagemeyer&#x27;s cottage in Carmel, and it was there that he finally found the solitude and the inspiration that he was seeking. He placed a sign in studio window that said, &quot;Edward Weston, photographer, Unretouched Portraits, Prints for Collectors.&quot;

He started making regular trips to nearby Point Lobos, where he would continue to photograph until the end of his career. It was there that he learned to fine-tune his photographic vision to match the visual space of his view camera, and the images he took there, of kelp, rocks and wind-blown trees, are among his finest. Looking at his work from this period, one biographer wrote:

In early April 1929, Weston met photographer Sonya Noskowiak at a party, and by the end of the month she was living with him. As with many of his other relationships, she became his model, muse, pupil and assistant. They would continue to live together for five years.

Intrigued by the many kinds and shapes of kelp he found on the beaches near Carmel, in 1930 Weston began taking close-ups of vegetables and fruits. He made a variety of photographs of cabbage, kale, onions, bananas, and finally, his most iconic image, peppers. In August of that year Noskowiak brought him several green peppers, and over a four-day period he shot at least thirty different negatives. Of these, &quot;Pepper No. 30&quot;, is among the all-time masterpieces of photography.

Weston had a series of important one-man exhibitions in 1930–31. The first was at Alma Reed&#x27;s Delphic Studio Gallery in New York, followed closely by a mounting of the same show at the Denny Watrous Gallery in Carmel. Both received rave reviews, including a two-page article in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. These were followed by shows at the De Young Museum in San Francisco and the Galerie Jean Naert in Paris.

Although he was succeeding professionally his personal life was very complex. For most of their marriage, Flora was able to take care of their children because of an inheritance from her parents. However, the Wall Street crash of 1929 had wiped out most of her savings, and Weston felt increased pressure to help provide more for her and his sons. He described this time as &quot;the most trying economic period of my life.&quot;

In 1932, &quot; The Art of Edward Weston&quot;, the first book devoted exclusively to Weston&#x27;s work, was published. It was edited by Merle Armitage and dedicated to Alice Rohrer, an admirer and patron of Weston whose $500 donation helped pay for the book to be published.

During the same time a small group of like-minded photographers in the San Francisco area, led by Van Dyke and Ansel Adams, began informally meeting to discuss their common interest and aesthetics. Inspired by Weston&#x27;s show at the De Young Museum the previous year, they approached the museum with the idea of mounting a group exhibition of their work. They named themselves Group f/64, and in November 1932, an exhibition of 80 of their prints opened at the museum. The show was a critical success.

In 1933 Weston bought a 4 × 5 Graflex camera, which was much smaller and lighter than the large view camera he had used for many years. He began taking close-up nudes of Noskowiak and other models. The smaller camera allowed him to interact more with his models, while at the same time the nudes he took during this period began to resemble some of the contorted root and vegetables he had taken the year before.

In early 1934, &quot;a new and important chapter opened&quot; in Weston&#x27;s life when he met Charis Wilson at a concert. Even more than with his previous lovers, Weston was immediately captivated by her beauty and her personality. He wrote: &quot;A new love came into my life, a most beautiful one, one which will, I believe, stand the test of time.&quot; On April 22 he photographed her nude for the first time, and they entered into an intense relationship. He was still living with Noskowiak at that time, but within two weeks he asked her to move out, declaring that for him other women were &quot;as inevitable as the tides&quot;.

Perhaps because of the intensity of his new relationship, he stopped writing in his Daybooks at this same time. Six months later he wrote one final entry, looking back from April 22:

*After eight months we are closer together than ever. Perhaps C. will be remembered as the great love of my life. Already I have achieved certain heights reached with no other love.

=== 1935–1945: Guggenheim grant to Wildcat Hill ===
In January 1935 Weston was facing increasing financial difficulties. He closed his studio in Carmel and moved to Santa Monica Canyon, California, where he opened a new studio with Brett. He implored Wilson to come and live with him, and in August 1935 she finally agreed. While she had an intense interest in his work, Wilson was the first woman Weston had lived with since Flora who had no interest in becoming a photographer. This allowed Weston to concentrate on her as his muse and model, and in turn Wilson devoted her time to promoting Weston&#x27;s art as his assistant and quasi-agent.

Almost immediately he began taking a new series of nudes with Wilson as the model. One of the first photographs he took of her, on the balcony of their home, became one of his most published images (&quot;Nude (Charis, Santa Monica)&quot;). Soon after they took the first of several trips to Oceano Dunes. It was there that Weston made some of his most daring and intimate photographs of any of his models, capturing Wilson in completely uninhibited poses in the sand dunes. He exhibited only one or two of this series in his lifetime, thinking several of the others were &quot;too erotic&quot; for the general public.

Although his recent work had received critical acclaim, he was not earning enough income from his artistic images to provide a steady income. Rather than going back to relying solely on portraiture, he started the &quot;Edward Weston Print of the Month Club&quot;, offering selections of his photos for a monthly $5 subscription. Each month subscribers would receive a new print from Weston, with a limited edition of 40 copies of each print. Although he created these prints with the same high standards that he did for his exhibition prints, it is thought that he never had more than eleven subscribers.

At the suggestion of Beaumont Newhall, Weston decided to apply for a Guggenheim Foundation grant (now known as a Guggenheim Fellowship). He wrote a two-sentence description about his work, assembled thirty-five of his favorite prints, and sent it in. Afterward Dorothea Lange and her husband suggested that the application was too brief to be seriously considered, and Weston resubmitted it with a four-page letter and work plan. He did not mention that Wilson had written the new application for him.

On March 22, 1937, Weston received notification that he had been awarded a Guggenheim grant, the first ever given to a photographer. The award was $2,000 for one year, a significant amount of money at that time. He was able to further capitalize on the award by arranging to provide the editor of &quot;AAA Westway Magazine&quot; with 8–10 photos per month for $50 during their travels, with Wilson getting an additional $15 monthly for photo captions and short narratives. They purchased a new car and set out on Weston&#x27;s dream trip to go and photograph whatever he wanted. Over the next twelve months they made seventeen trips and covered 16,697 miles according to Wilson&#x27;s detailed log. Weston made 1,260 negatives during the trip.

The freedom of this trip with the &quot;love of his life&quot;, combined with all of his sons now reaching the age of adulthood, gave Weston the motivation to finally divorce his wife. They had been living apart for sixteen years.

Due to the success of the past year, Weston applied for and received a second year of Guggenheim support. Although he wanted to do some additional traveling, he intended to use most of the money to allow him to print his past year&#x27;s work. He commissioned Neil to build a small home in the Carmel Highlands on property owned by Wilson&#x27;s father. They named the place &quot;Wildcat Hill&quot; because of the many domestic cats that soon occupied the grounds.

Wilson set up a writing studio in what was intended to be a small garage behind the house, and she spent several months writing and editing stories from their travels.

In 1939, &quot;Seeing California with Edward Weston&quot; was published, with photographs by Weston and writing by Wilson. Finally relieved from the financial stresses of the past and inordinately happy with his work and his relationship, Weston married Wilson in a small ceremony on April 24.

Buoyed by the success of their first book, in 1940 they published &quot;California and the West&quot;. The first edition, featuring 96 of Weston&#x27;s photos with text by Wilson, sold for $3.95. Over the summer, Weston taught photography at the first Ansel Adams Workshop at Yosemite National Park.

Just as the Guggenheim money was running out, Weston was invited to illustrate a new edition of Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. He would receive $1,000 for photographs and $500 travel expenses. Weston insisted on having artistic control of the images he would take and insisted that he would not be taking literal illustrations of Whitman&#x27;s text. On May 28 he and Wilson began a trip that would cover 20,000 miles through 24 states; he took between 700 and 800 8x10 negatives as well as dozens of Graflex portraits.

On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked, and the United States entered World War II. Weston was near the end of the Whitman trip, and he was deeply affected by the outbreak of the war. He wrote: &quot;When the war broke out we scurried home. Charis did not want to scurry. I did.&quot;

He spent the first few months of 1942 organizing and printing the negatives from the Whitman trip. Of the hundreds of images he took, forty-nine were selected for publication.

Due to the war, Point Lobos was closed to the public for several years. Weston continued to work on images centered on Wildcat Hill, including shots of the many cats that lived there. Weston treated them with the same serious intent that he applied to all of his other subjects, and Charis assembled the results into their most unusual publication, &quot;The Cats of Wildcat Hill,&quot; which was finally published in 1947.

The year 1945 marked the beginning of significant changes for Weston. He began to experience the first symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a debilitating ailment that gradually stole his strength and his ability to photograph. He withdrew from Wilson, who at the same time began to become more involved in local politics and the Carmel cultural scene. A strength that originally brought them together – her lack of interest in becoming a photographer herself – eventually led to their break-up. She wrote, &quot;My flight from Edward was also partly an escape from photography, which had taken up so much room in my life for so many years.&quot;

While working on a major retrospective exhibition for the Museum of Modern Art, he and Wilson separated. Weston returned to Glendale since the land for their cabin at Wildcat Hill still belonged to Wilson&#x27;s father. Within a few months she moved out and arranged to sell the property to him.

=== 1946–1958: Final years ===

In February 1946, Weston&#x27;s major retrospective opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He and Beaumont Newhall selected 313 prints for the exhibition, and eventually 250 photographs were displayed along with 11 negatives. At that time many of his prints were still for sale, and he sold 97 prints from the exhibit at $25 per print. Later that year, Weston was asked by Dr. George L. Waters of Kodak to produce 8 × 10 Kodachrome transparencies for their advertising campaign. Weston had never worked in color before, primarily because he had no means of developing or printing the more complicated color process. He accepted their offer in no small part because they offered him $250 per image, the highest amount he would be paid for any single work in his lifetime. He eventually sold seven color works to Kodak of landscapes and scenery at Point Lobos and nearby Monterey harbor.

In 1947 as his Parkinson&#x27;s disease progressed, Weston began looking for an assistant. Serendipitously, an eager young photographic enthusiast, Dody Weston Thompson, contacted him in search of employment.

Weston mentioned he had just that morning written a letter to Ansel Adams, looking for someone seeking to learn photography in exchange for carrying his bulky large-format camera and to provide a much needed automobile. There was a swift meeting of creative minds. For the remainder of 1947 through the beginning of 1948, Dody commuted from San Francisco on weekends to learn from Weston the basics of photography. In early 1948, Dody moved into &quot;Bodie House&quot;, the guest cottage at Edward&#x27;s Wildcat Hill compound, as his full-time assistant.

By late 1948 he was no longer physically able to use his large view camera. That year he took his last photographs, at Point Lobos. His final negative was an image he called &quot;Rocks and Pebbles, 1948&quot;. Although diminished in his capacity, Weston never stopped being a photographer. He worked with his sons and Dody to catalog his images and especially to oversee the publication and printing of his work. In 1950 there was a major retrospective of his work at the Musee National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris, and in 1952 he published a Fiftieth Anniversary portfolio, with images printed by Brett.

During this time he worked with Cole, Brett, and Dody Thompson (Brett&#x27;s wife by 1952), to select and have them print a master set of what he considered his best work. They spent many long hours together in the darkroom, and by 1956 they had produced what Weston called &quot;The Project Prints&quot;, eight sets of 8&quot; × 10&quot; prints from 830 of his negatives. The only complete set today is housed at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Later that same year the Smithsonian Institution displayed nearly 100 of these prints at a major exhibit, &quot;The World of Edward Weston&quot;, paying tribute to his accomplishments in American photography.

Weston died at his home on Wildcat Hill on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1958. His sons scattered his ashes into the Pacific Ocean at an area then known as Pebbly Beach on Point Lobos. Due to Weston&#x27;s significant influence in the area, the beach was later renamed Weston Beach. He had $300 in his bank account at the time of his death.

== Equipment and techniques ==
===Cameras and lenses===
During his lifetime Weston worked with several cameras. He began as a more serious photographer in 1902 when he purchased a 5 × 7 camera. When he moved to Tropico, now part of Glendale, and opened his studio in 1911, he acquired an enormous 11 x 14 Graf Variable studio portrait camera. Roi Partridge, Imogen Cunningham&#x27;s husband, later made an etching of Weston in his studio, dwarfed by the giant camera in front of him. After he began taking more portraits of children, he bought a 3 ¼ x 4 ¼ Graflex in 1912 to better capture their quickly changing expressions.

When he went to Mexico in 1924 he took an 8 × 10 Seneca folding-bed view camera with several lenses, including a Graf Variable and a Wollensak Verito. While in Mexico he purchased a used Rapid Rectilinear lens which was his primary lens for many years. The lens, now in the George Eastman House, did not have a manufacturer&#x27;s name. He also took to Mexico a 3¼ × 4¼ Graflex with a ƒ/4.5 Tessar lens, which he used for portraits.

In 1933 he purchased a 4 × 5 R. B. Auto-Graflex] and used it thereafter for all portraits. He continued to use the Seneca view camera for all other work.

In 1939 he listed the following items as his standard equipment:

*8 x 10 Century Universal
*Triple convertible Turner Reich, 12&quot;, 21&quot;, 28&quot;
*K2, G, A filters
*12 film holders
*Paul Ries Tripod

He continued to use this equipment throughout his life.

===Film===
Prior to 1921 Weston used an orthochromatic sheet film, but when panchromatic film became widely available in 1921 he switched to it for all of his work. According to his son Cole, after Agfa Isopan film came out in the 1930s Weston used it for his black-and-white images for the rest of his life. This film was rated at about ISO 25, but the developing technique Weston used reduced the effective rating to about ISO 12.

The 8 × 10 cameras he preferred were large and heavy, and due to the weight and the cost of the film he never carried more than twelve sheet film holders with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, unload the film holders and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.

In spite of the bulky size of the view camera, Weston boasted he could &quot;set up the tripod, fasten the camera securely to it, attach the lens to the camera, open the shutter, study the image on the ground glass, focus it, close the shutter, insert the plate holder, cock the shutter, set it to the appropriate aperture and speed, remove the slide from the plate holder, make the exposure, replace the slide, and remove the plate holder in two minutes and twenty seconds.&quot;

The smaller Graflex cameras he used had the advantage of using film magazines that held either 12 or 18 sheets of film. Weston preferred these cameras when taking portraits because he could respond more quickly to the sitter. He reported that with his Graflex he once made three dozen negatives of Tina Modotti within 20 minutes.In 1946 a representative from Kodak asked Weston to try out their new Kodachrome film, and over the next two years he made at least 60 8 x 10 color images using this film.&quot; They were some of the last photographs he took, since by late 1948 he was no longer able to operate a camera due to the effects of his Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Exposures===
During the first 20 years of his photography Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, &quot;I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only &quot;felt&quot;.&quot; In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston exposure meter and continued to use it as an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that &quot;Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground under his feet. He is &quot;feeling the light&quot; and checking his own observations. After which he puts the meter away and does what &quot;he&quot; thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, film, speed, and so on ‒ and doubles the computation.&quot; Weston, Newhall noted, believed in &quot;massive exposure&quot;, which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.

The low ISO rating of the sheet film Weston used necessitated very long exposures when using his view camera, ranging from 1 to 3 seconds for outdoor landscape exposures to as long as 4½ hours for still lifes such as peppers or shells. When he used one of the Graflex cameras the exposure times were much shorter (usually less than ¼ second), and he was sometimes able to work without a tripod.

===Darkroom===
Weston always made contact prints, meaning that the print was exactly the same size as the negative. This was essential for the platinum printing that he preferred early in his career, since at that time the platinum papers required ultra-violet light to activate. Weston did not have an artificial ultra-violet light source, so he had to place the contact print directly in sunlight to expose it. This limited him to printing only on sunny days.

When he wanted a print that was larger than the original negative size, he used an enlarger to create a larger inter-positive, then contact printed it to a new negative. The new larger negative was then used to make a print of that size. This process was very labor-intensive; he once wrote in his &quot;Daybooks&quot; &quot;I am utterly exhausted tonight after a whole day in the darkroom, making eight contact negatives from the enlarged positives.&quot;

In 1924 Weston wrote this about his darkroom process, &quot;I have returned, after several years use of Metol-Hydroquinine open-tank&quot; developer to a three-solution Pyro developer, and I develop one at a time in a tray instead of a dozen in a tank.&quot; Each sheet of film was viewed under either a green or an orange safelight in his darkroom, allowing him to control the individual development of a negative. He continued to use this technique for the rest of his life.

Weston was known to extensively use dodging and burning to achieve the look he wanted in his prints.

===Paper===
Early in his career Weston printed on several kinds of paper, including Velox, Apex, Convira, Defender Velour Black and Haloid. When he went to Mexico he learned how to use platinum and palladium paper, made by Willis &amp; Clement and imported from England. After his return to California, he abandoned platinum and palladium printing due to the scarcity and increasing price of the paper. Eventually he was able to get most of the same qualities he preferred with Kodak&#x27;s Azo glossy silver gelatin paper developed in Amidol. He continued to use this paper almost exclusively until he stopped printing.

==Writings==
Weston was a prolific writer. His &quot;Daybooks&quot; were published in two volumes totaling more than 500 pages in the first edition. This does not include the years of the journal he kept between 1915 and 1923; for reasons he never made clear he destroyed those before leaving for Mexico. He also wrote dozens of articles and commentaries, beginning in 1906 and ending in 1957. He hand-wrote or typed at least 5,000 letters to colleagues, friends, lovers, his wives and his children.

In addition, Weston kept very thorough notes on the technical and business aspects of his work. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, which now houses most of Weston&#x27;s archives, reports that it houses 75 linear feet of pages from his Daybooks, correspondence, financial records, memorabilia, and other personal documents in his possession when he died.

Among Weston&#x27;s most important early writings are those that provide insights into his development of the concept of previsualization. He first spoke and wrote about the concept in 1922, at least a decade before Ansel Adams began utilizing the term, and he continued to expand upon this idea both in writing and in his teachings. Historian Beaumont Newhall noted the significance of Weston&#x27;s innovation in his book &quot;The History of Photography&quot;, saying &quot;The most important part of Edward Weston&#x27;s approach was his insistence that the photographer should previsualize the final print before making the exposure.&quot;

In his &quot;Daybooks&quot; he provided an unusually detailed record of his evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed that he had come to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations of photographers.

==Quotations==

*&quot;Form follows function.&quot; Who said this I don&#x27;t know, but the writer spoke well.
*I am not a technician and have no interest in technique for its own sake. If my technique is adequate to present my seeing then I need nothing more.
*I see no reason for recording the obvious.
*If there is symbolism in my work, it can only be the seeing of parts ‒ fragments ‒ as universal symbols. All basic forms are so closely related as to be visually equivalent.
*My own eyes are no more than scouts on a preliminary search, for the camera&#x27;s eye may entirely change my idea.
*My work-purpose, my theme, can most nearly be stated as the recognition, recording and presentation of the interdependence, the relativity, of all things ‒ the universality of basic form.
*The camera sees more than the eye, so why not make use of it?
*This then: to photograph a rock, have it look like a rock, but be more than a rock.
*What then is the end toward which I work? To present the significance of facts, so that they are transformed from things &quot;seen&quot; to things &quot;known&quot;.
*When money enters in ‒ then, for a price, I become a liar ‒ and a good one I can be whether with pencil or subtle lighting or viewpoint. I hate it all, but so do I support not only my family, but my own work.

==Legacy==
As of 2013, two of Weston&#x27;s photographs feature among the most expensive photographs ever sold. The &quot;Nude, 1925&quot; taken in 1925 was bought by the gallerist Peter MacGill for $1.6 million in 2008. &quot;Nautilus&quot; of 1927 was sold for $1.1 million in 2010, also to MacGill.

In 1984 Weston was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<text>John Graham &quot;Mitch&quot; Mitchell (9 July 194612 November 2008) was an English drummer and child actor, best known for his work in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2016, Mitchell was ranked number 8 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early days===
Mitchell was born in Ealing, Middlesex, to Phyliss C. (née Preston) and Thomas J. Mitchell on 9 July 1946 (although several modern sources have incorrectly claimed that he was born in 1947). As a 13 year old, he had a leading role in the British film &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (1960) with Jimmy Edwards. As a teenager he starred in a children&#x27;s television programme, &quot;Jennings at School&quot; and also had a bit part in the 1963 film &quot;Live It Up!&quot; which starred Heinz Burt, David Hemmings and Steve Marriott.

Mitchell became a musician through working at Jim Marshall&#x27;s drum shop on Saturdays while still at school. Among drummers, his chief influences were Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. One of his first bands was the Soul Messengers, formed in November 1963 at the Ealing Club with tenor saxophonist Terry Marshall (born 15 March 1944), son of Jim Marshall. Mitchell left this band in .

Early in his career, he gained considerable musical experience as a touring and session musician, working with Pete Nelson and the Travellers, Frankie Reid and the Casuals (1962), Johnny Harris and the Shades, the Pretty Things, Bill Knight &amp; the Sceptres, the Riot Squad, and the Who as a session drummer while the band was in the process of replacing Doug Sandom with Keith Moon. In 1965, he also temporarily replaced Viv Prince as drummer in the Pretty Things.

===Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames===
From December 1965 until October 1966, Mitchell was the drummer of Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, appearing on their 1966 album &quot;Sweet Things&quot;. In a 2015 interview, Fame recalled: &quot;His main hero was jazz drummer Ronnie Stephenson and if you look at early film clips of Mitch, he had that Ronnie Stephenson look, the way he set his jaw. And he loved crashing around on the cymbals like Ronnie, but in my band I liked the arrangements pretty tight. When he started splashing around I&#x27;d say &#x27;just play the hi-hat!&#x27;&quot;.

===The Jimi Hendrix Experience===

Mitchell auditioned for the Jimi Hendrix Experience on 6 October 1966 and was chosen over Aynsley Dunbar in a coin toss. Mitchell&#x27;s fast, driving, jazz-influenced playing meshed well with Hendrix&#x27;s open-ended, revolutionary approach to the electric guitar. He played on the three best-selling Experience studio albums, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; (1967), &quot;&quot; (1968), and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968).

Mitchell remained with Hendrix after the Experience broke up when Noel Redding quit in June 1969. He performed with Hendrix&#x27;s expanded lineup at Woodstock (August 1969). Mitchell was replaced briefly with Buddy Miles for the &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; album (1970), but rejoined Hendrix (with Billy Cox on bass) for the April–September 1970 the Cry of Love Tour. He played drums for most of the songs included on the posthumously-released Hendrix studio albums &quot;The Cry of Love&quot; (1971) (also listed as a co-producer), &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; (1971), and &quot;War Heroes&quot; (1972).

===Drum sets===
Mitchell debuted with the Hendrix Experience playing a Premier drum kit in England and Europe in 1967. When the Experience came to the US for the Monterey Pop Music Festival in June 1967 Mitchell was playing that same set. Later in the summer, Mitchell switched to a Ludwig drum set and stayed with Ludwig through the rest of the year, 1967, and continued with Ludwig in 1968 and 1969. In 1970, Mitchell switched to a double-bass Gretsch Drums set, his last year with the Hendrix Experience. With the exception of the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival, during which he played a Rodgers Powertone snare drum, during his time with the JHE, Mitch played a Ludwig Supraphonic 400, a 5- by 14-inch metal snare drum. Much later, and until his untimely passing, he played DW drums.

On April 11, 1969, Mitchell played with Jimi in Dorton Arena, in Raleigh, NC, using George Hayman Drums. 
===Other projects===
In December 1968, Mitchell played with the Dirty Mac, an impromptu band assembled for &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;. Others included John Lennon as vocalist and rhythm guitarist &quot;Winston Leg-Thigh&quot;; Yoko Ono providing improvised primal screams; Eric Clapton as guitarist, and Keith Richards as bassist. The group recorded a cover of &quot;Yer Blues&quot; as well as a jam called &quot;Whole Lotta Yoko&quot;. While working with Hendrix from late 1969 until early 1970, Mitchell also collaborated with the Jack Bruce and Friends band fronted by ex-Cream bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce, with keyboardist Mike Mandel and jazz-fusion guitarist and future the Eleventh House frontman Larry Coryell.

===Post-Hendrix===
After Hendrix&#x27; death, Mitchell finished production work with engineer Eddie Kramer on incomplete Hendrix recordings, resulting in the releases &quot;The Cry of Love&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot;. In 1972, he teamed up with guitarists Mike Pinera and April Lawton to form Ramatam. They recorded the first of Ramatam&#x27;s two albums and were an opening act for Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer at a number of concerts. Mitchell and Hendrix had been offered spots in the band Keith Emerson and Greg Lake were forming, but Carl Palmer got the drum position instead. Ramatam never achieved commercial success, and Mitchell left the act before their second album was released. He also performed in concerts with Terry Reid, Jack Bruce, and Jeff Beck as a substitute for drummer Cozy Powell. Mitchell drummed alongside John Halsey in the 1970s jam band Hinkley&#x27;s Heroes, the only time he played alongside another drummer. In 1974, he auditioned for Paul McCartney&#x27;s band Wings but lost the part to Geoff Britton in another coin toss.

For the rest of the 1970s through to the 1990s, Mitchell, semi-retired and living in Europe, continued to perform and occasionally record. In 1986, Mitchell teamed up with jazz musician Greg Parker and made a music video session of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;. He did session work on Junior Brown&#x27;s &quot;Long Walk Back&quot; and participated in various Hendrix-related recordings, videos, and interviews. In 1999, Mitchell was part of the Gypsy Sun Experience, along with former Hendrix bassist Billy Cox and guitarist Gary Serkin. He also appeared on Bruce Cameron&#x27;s album &quot;Midnight Daydream&quot; that included Billy Cox, Buddy Miles and Jack Bruce.

===Death===

Mitchell was part of the 2008 Experience Hendrix Tour which for nearly four weeks in October and November 2008 travelled on an 18-city tour of the US, finishing in Portland, Oregon. The tour also featured Billy Cox, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, Robby Krieger, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, Cesar Rosas, David Hidalgo, Brad Whitford, Hubert Sumlin, Chris Layton, Eric Gales, and Mato Nanji.

Five days after the tour ended, Mitchell died in his sleep on 12 November, in his room at the Benson Hotel in Portland of natural causes. Mitchell had been in ill health for many years due to an immune system disorder and cancer. Mitchell had suffered bouts of extreme fatigue in 2007 and 2008, but he had recovered from them after a few days&#x27; rest. By the end of the 2008 show, however, Mitchell was playing only two or three songs and always with a backup drummer alongside. At his last concert in Portland, Oregon, Mitchell looked so weak that his drum technician and tour manager asked him to sit out the entire show. The drum tech filled in for him on the drums on this, the last show of the tour, and the last show of his life. Afterwards, he asked to rest up for a few days due to exhaustion. From Seattle, he had planned to return to his home in England. The tour manager respected Mitchell&#x27;s request but had outspoken reservations about its wisdom.

==Legacy==
Queen drummer Roger Taylor has described Mitchell as his early role model. He said: &quot;I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic&quot;. Matt Sorum, drummer with the Cult, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Velvet Revolver, has praised his &quot;pure musicianship&quot; and called him &quot;one of the greatest drummers of all time&quot;.

In an interview with the Police drummer Stewart Copeland in the late 2000s, Copeland listed the Jimi Hendrix Experience debut album &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; as his favourite drum album of all time, and relates that as a child in school, he would walk around with drum beats in his head and wonder how Mitch Mitchell would carve out a rhythm were he to play that song.

In 2016, Mitchell was named the eighth-greatest drummer of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

<doc id="232550" wikidata="Q7437829" url="?curid=232550" title="Scottish Labour Party (1976)">
<text>The Scottish Labour Party (SLP) was a socialist party in Scotland that was active between 1976 and 1981. It formed as a breakaway from the UK Labour Party. It won three council seats in 1977 but lost its MPs at the 1979 election and was dissolved two years later.

==History==
The party formed on 18 January 1976 as a breakaway from the UK Labour Party, by members disaffected with the then Labour Government&#x27;s failure to secure a devolved Scottish Assembly, as well as with its social and economic agenda. The formation of the SLP was led by Jim Sillars, then MP for South Ayrshire, John Robertson, then MP for Paisley, and Alex Neil, the UK Labour Party&#x27;s senior Scottish researcher. The split came just before the resignation of Harold Wilson as prime minister and party leader and the election of James Callaghan as his successor.

Within a few weeks of its formation, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; reported that a System Three opinion poll showed the party was taking a quarter of the Labour Party&#x27;s electoral support in Scotland. The same poll also gave the SLP a higher share of support in Scotland (8%) than the well-established Liberal Party (6%). Neil was reported to be &quot;staggered and delighted by this wonderful result&quot; and warned that SLP could expect to make gains in areas of urban deprivation in the west of Scotland that usually supported Labour.

Almost immediately the SLP became the focus for entryism from the International Marxist Group (IMG), and at the party&#x27;s first congress in October 1976 the IMG was expelled, along with a number of branches whose members were not associated with the IMG. According to Henry Drucker&#x27;s account, the IMG&#x27;s role was rather limited; Sillars used this as an excuse for purging anyone he did not see entirely eye-to-eye with or who represented a significant threat to his leadership. The expellees formed a rival Scottish Labour Party (Democratic Wing), and this in turn later renamed itself the Scottish Socialist League (SSL). Gradually, those members of the SSL who had not been associated with the IMG drifted out, and the SSL was reabsorbed into the Trotskyist Fourth International.

The SLP had little electoral success, winning only three council seats at the 1977 local elections. The party polled only 583 votes in the Garscadden by-election in 1978. At the 1979 general election, the SLP fought three seats, including Sillars&#x27;s attempt at being re-elected (Robertson chose to step down). Sillars came close to retaining his seat in South Ayrshire, but this was clearly a personal vote built up over the years he had already served as an MP, as the other two candidates – standing in Paisley and Edinburgh Central respectively – polled very poorly indeed.

This failure prompted the SLP to disband in 1981; and members either fell out of active politics, re-joined the Labour Party, or chose to join the Scottish National Party (SNP), which both Sillars and Neil did, with both rising to high office in the SNP.

The SLP adventure is generally looked upon as an ambitious failure, but Sillars has himself put this down to a lack of planning before the decision to launch the party. Unlike the SLP, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) meticulously planned their breakaway from the Labour Party, and were much more successful. Sillars has claimed that the SLP did at least provide a forerunner to the SNP&#x27;s later dialogue with the left.

==Membership==
Although the SLP was initially reported (usually by the party&#x27;s leaders) to have as many as 2,000 to 3,000 members, Drucker later estimated that numbers had actually peaked at 883 in October 1976, the same month that the party split in two. This figure disguised a strong imbalance in favour of Sillars&#x27;s Ayrshire fiefdom, with 276 members (nearly one-third of the total) recorded as being represented by that county&#x27;s delegation to the party&#x27;s 1976 congress. Thus a highly unusual situation emerged whereby branches in small Ayrshire villages such as Patna and Ochiltree reported membership numbers higher than those for the cities of Aberdeen and Stirling.

The SLP did, however, contain a number of committed activists who would later go on to achieve a name for themselves as mainstream politicians, including John McAllion, who became MP and then MSP for Dundee East; Maria Fyfe, one time MP for Glasgow Maryhill; Sheila Gilmore, later MP for Edinburgh East; and Charlie Gordon, future leader of Glasgow City Council and MSP for Glasgow Cathcart. These individuals all chose to join (or in some cases re-join) the Labour Party rather than follow Sillars into the SNP.

Also involved as members of the SLP were:
* Neal Ascherson
* Chris Bambery
* Colin Boyd, Baron Boyd of Duncansby
* George Kerevan
* Tom Nairn
* Danus Skene

Neal Ascherson was the Scottish political correspondent for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; at this time, and was the most prominent example of a curious phenomenon that distinguished the party from its rivals: namely, the relatively high proportion of journalists on its membership roll. Other leading figures from the Scottish press who joined the SLP were Bob Brown of &quot;The Times&quot; (who was the party&#x27;s first chairman), Stewart MacLachlan and Ruth Wishart of the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, James Fyfe (husband of Maria) of the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;, and James Frame of the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News.&quot; Chris Baur, Scottish political correspondent for both the BBC and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, was a sympathiser who was consulted by the others, but did not join the party.

<text>Sara Elizabeth Carter (née Dougherty, later Bayes; July 21, 1898 – January 8, 1979) was an American country music musician, singer, and songwriter. Remembered mostly for her deep, distinctive, mature singing voice, she was the lead singer on most of the recordings of the historic Carter Family act in the 1920s and 1930s. In her earliest recordings her voice was pitched very high.

== Life and career ==

Born in Copper Creek, Virginia, the daughter of William Sevier Dougherty and Nancy Elizabeth Kilgore, at age 16 she married A. P. Carter on June 18, 1915; they divorced in 1936. They had three children: Gladys (Mrs. Millard), Janette (Mrs. Jett), and Joe.

In 1927, she and A. P. began performing as the Carter Family, perhaps the first commercial rural country music group. They were joined by her cousin, Maybelle, who was married to A. P.&#x27;s brother, Ezra Carter. Later, Sara married Coy Bayes, A. P.&#x27;s first cousin, and moved to California in 1943, and the original group disbanded. In the late 1940s, Maybelle began performing with her daughters Helen, June, and Anita as The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle (the act was renamed The Carter Family during the 1960s).

On Carter Family recordings, Sara is credited as author of the songs &quot;Fifty Miles of Elbow Room&quot; and &quot;Keep on the Firing Line&quot;; in truth she discovered these public domain songs when they were being sung at a Seventh-day Adventist church she visited.

RCA gave her songwriter credit, as it did A.P. Carter on his public domain discoveries. The Carter Family recordings of these tunes brought the songs worldwide fame. Sara wrote or co-wrote several other songs, including &quot;My Foothills Home&quot;, &quot;The Dying Soldier&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Pine Special&quot;, &quot;Farther On&quot;, and &quot;Railroading on the Great Divide&quot;.

Sara reunited with Maybelle in 1966 for a Columbia Records album titled &quot;An Historic Reunion,&quot; which was later re-issued on Bear Family Records, with additional songs, as &quot;Sara and Maybelle Carter.&quot; They performed together during the folk music craze of the 1960s at the Newport Folk Festival. The duo were featured as guests in a late 1960s episode of the Wilburn Brothers television show, singing &quot;Little Moses&quot; and &quot;As the Band Played Dixie&quot;. Following this period, Sara retired to California, although she and Maybelle remained close for the rest of their lives and Sara and Coy journeyed yearly from California to Virginia by car, pulling a travel trailer.

In the early 1970s, Sara and Maybelle reunited to appear on Johnny Cash&#x27;s network television show and to perform together at the first annual A.P. Carter Memorial Festival in Hiltons, Virginia.

== Family tree==




== Legacy ==
Carter was inducted as part of the Original Carter Family in the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970, along with Bill Monroe.
 In 1993, her image appeared on a U.S. postage stamp honoring the Carter Family. In 2001 she was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor.

On her 2008 album &quot;All I Intended to Be&quot;, Emmylou Harris includes the song &quot;How She Could Sing the Wildwood Flower&quot;, co-written with Kate and Anna McGarrigle about the relationship between Sara and A.P., inspired by a documentary that the three of them saw on television.

<text>This article lists political parties in Scotland.

==Overview==
The Scottish National Party (SNP) is the main political party in Scotland which primarily supports Scotland becoming an independent nation. They have also supported further devolution as a progression towards independence. They are overall centre-left, and sometimes considered big-tent, advocating social democracy, nuclear disarmament and closer ties to the European Union. They were founded in 1934 and formed a permanent grouping in House of Commons in 1967. Their best election result in the 20th century was at the general election of October 1974 in which they won 11 of Scotland&#x27;s 72 Westminster seats as well as around 30% of the popular vote, however they lost all but two of these seats in 1979. Support for the party was bolstered under the leadership of Alex Salmond, who in 2011 led the SNP to their best electoral performance to date, in which they became the first party in the devolved Scottish Parliament to win a majority of seats. They form the Scottish government, and are now led by Scotland&#x27;s First Minister, John Swinney. They have 64 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and 9 Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (MPs).

The Scottish Conservatives are the Scottish wing of the UK-wide Conservative Party. They were founded in 1965 out of the merger of the Scottish Unionist Party, which had been a dominant political force in Scotland for much of the early 20th century, winning the majority of votes and seats in the 1931 general election and 1955 general election. However the party went into decline, being reduced from 21 Scottish seats in 1983, to 10 in 1987. The 1997 general election was a catastrophe for the Scottish Conservatives, who were left with no Scottish seats whatsoever. However the party won 18 seats in the Scottish Parliament in the 1999 election due to proportional representation. From 2001 to 2017, the Conservatives held one Scottish seat in the UK parliament, but had its best result in the 21st century in the 2017 general election when it returned 13 seats and just short of a third of the vote. Like the wider UK Conservative Party, the party is a centre-right party, which promotes conservatism and British unionism. They currently have 31 MSPs, led in the Scottish Parliament until recently by Douglas Ross, and 5 MPs.

Scottish Labour is the Scottish wing of the Great Britain-wide Labour Party. It was the most successful party in Scottish elections from 1964 to 2007. Like the wider UK Labour Party, they are centre-left and they promote British unionism. They first overtook the Conservatives as Scotland&#x27;s largest party at the 1959 general election. In 1997, the UK Labour Party under Tony Blair offered Scotland a referendum on devolution which was passed with around 74% of the electorate in favour. From 1999 to 2007, they were in power in the Scottish Parliament through a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. From 2008 to 2011, the party was led by Iain Gray in the Scottish Parliament, who announced his resignation after the party&#x27;s defeat at the 2011 Scottish election. Johann Lamont became leader in 2011 and resigned in 2014 after an internal dispute within the party. Subsequently, they were led by Jim Murphy, Kezia Dugdale and Richard Leonard. They currently have 37 MPs and 22 MSPs. they are led by Anas Sarwar MSP.

The Scottish Liberal Democrats are the Scottish wing of the Great Britain-wide Liberal Democrats party. It is a centrist, social liberal and British unionist party. The British Liberal Democrats they are part of were formed in 1988 when the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party merged. Their leader is Alex Cole-Hamilton. Since the formation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition at Westminster, support for the Liberal Democrats has fallen sharply, and the party won five seats at the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election. They also lost their Scottish MEP at the 2014 European elections. They also lost 10 of their 11 House of Commons seats at the 2015 general election, with Deputy Leader Alistair Carmichael the only MP managing to keep his seat. They currently have four MSPs and six MPs.

The Scottish Greens sit between the centre-left and the left-wing. The party promotes green politics, Scottish independence, equality and radical democracy. It retains close ties with the Green Party of England and Wales and the Green Party Northern Ireland, having all originated in the breakup of the UK Green Party. However, all three parties are now fully independent. The Scottish Greens won their first seat in the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and currently have 7 MSPs, but have never returned any MPs.

Reform UK Scotland is the Scottish wing of the UK-wide Reform UK. It is a Eurosceptic and right-wing populist party. The party gained its first elected representative in January 2021, when sitting independent MSP Michelle Ballantyne joined the party and became leader of the party in Scotland. Ballantyne was previously a Conservative MSP. She resigned from the party in November 2020, citing differences with the new leader Douglas Ross before joining. Ballantyne lost this seat in the 2021 Scottish Scottish Parliament election, leaving the party with no elected representatives in Scotland.

The Alba Party is a Scottish independence supporting party formed in February 2021 and led by former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond. Shortly after it announced its plans to run in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, two SNP MPs defected to the new party, making the Alba Party the fourth largest Scottish party at the Westminster Parliament after the SNP, Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives. In the run up to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election there was a succession of SNP representatives defecting to the party. The party failed to win any seats in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, after attracting only 1.7% of the vote.

==Parties with elected representation==
===Scottish Parliament and/or House of Commons===
There are six parties in Scotland that have elected representation in either the Scottish Parliament or the House of Commons. All except the Scottish Greens and the Alba Party have representation in both. In addition, all parties except the Alba Party have elected representation at the local government level.

===Local government===

There are four parties in Scotland that have elected representation only at the local government level.

==Parties with no elected representation==
===Notable registered parties===
There are a number of notable registered parties in Scotland with no elected representation. Some operate exclusively within Scotland, while others may also be active in other parts of the United Kingdom.

<text>Richard Stockton (October 1, 1730 – February 28, 1781) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, jurist, legislator, and signer of the Declaration of Independence.

==Early life==

Stockton was the son of John Stockton (1701–1758), a wealthy landowner who donated land and helped bring what is now Princeton University (then known as the College of New Jersey, located in Newark) to Princeton, New Jersey. He was born at the Stockton family home now known as Morven in the Stony Brook neighborhood of Princeton. He attended Samuel Finley&#x27;s academy at Nottingham, which later became West Nottingham Academy, and the College of New Jersey located in Newark, graduating in 1748. He studied law with David Ogden of Newark, who was at that time the head of the legal profession in the province.

Stockton was admitted to the bar in 1754 and soon rose to great distinction. In 1763, he received the degree of serjeant-at-law, the highest degree of law at that time. He was a longtime friend of George Washington. His wife was poet Annis Boudinot Stockton, sister of New Jersey statesman Elias Boudinot. The Stocktons had six children. Their son Richard Stockton became an eminent lawyer and prominent Federalist leader. Elias Boudinot was married to Stockton&#x27;s sister Hannah Stockton (1736–1808).

Stockton initially showed little interest in politics. He once wrote, &quot;The public is generally unthankful, and I never will become a Servant of it, till I am convinced that by neglecting my own affairs I am doing more acceptable Service to God and Man.&quot; Stockton, however, took an active role as a trustee of the College of New Jersey.

==Political career==
Stockton served the college, afterwards known as Princeton University, as a trustee for 26 years. In 1766 and 1767, he gave up his law practice for the purpose of visiting England, Scotland, and Ireland. His fame preceded him, and he was received by the most eminent men of the kingdom. Stockton had the honor of personally presenting to King George III an address of the trustees of the College of New Jersey, acknowledging the repeal of the Stamp Act, and his address was favorably received by the king. He was consulted on the state of American affairs by such notable men as the Marquess of Rockingham with whom he spent a week at his country estate. He met with Edmund Burke, the Earl of Chatham, and many other distinguished members of Parliament who were friendly to the American colonies.

In Scotland, his personal efforts resulted in the acceptance of the presidency of the college by the Reverend John Witherspoon. Witherspoon&#x27;s wife had opposed her husband&#x27;s taking the position, but her objections were overcome with the aid of his future son-in-law Benjamin Rush, who was a medical student in Edinburgh. That was an exceedingly important event in the history of higher education in America. One night in Edinburgh, Stockton was attacked by a robber, he defended himself skillfully with a small sword, and the surprised and wounded robber fled.

Stockton returned to America in August 1767. In 1768, Stockton had his first taste of government service when he was elevated to a seat in the New Jersey Provincial Council; in 1774 he was appointed to the provincial New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

He first took a moderate stance in the troubles between the American colonies and Great Britain. In 1774, he drafted and sent to Lord Dartmouth &quot;a plan of self-government for America, independent of Parliament, without renouncing the Crown.&quot; That Commonwealth approach was not acceptable to the king. When Parliament resolved to raise revenue in the colonies in 1775, Stockton declared the colonies &quot;must each of them send one or two of their most ingenious fellows, and enable them to get into the House of Commons, maintain them there till they can maintain themselves, or else we shall be fleeced to some purpose.&quot;

==Revolutionary War==
In 1776, Stockton was elected to the Second Continental Congress, where he took a very active role. That August, when elections were held for the state governments of the new nation, Stockton and William Livingston each received the same number of votes to be the governor of New Jersey on the first ballot. Although Livingston later won the election by one vote, Stockton was unanimously elected to serve as the chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, but he turned down that position to remain in Congress. Stockton was the first person from New Jersey to sign the Declaration of Independence.

Stockton was sent by Congress, along with fellow signer George Clymer, on an exhausting two-month journey to Fort Ticonderoga in New York to assist the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. On his return to Princeton, he traveled 30 miles east to the home of a friend, John Covenhoven, to evacuate his family to safety. While there, on November 30, 1776, he and Covenhoven were captured in the middle of the night, dragged from their beds by Loyalists, stripped of their property and marched to Perth Amboy and turned over to the British. The day Stockton was captured, General William Howe had written a proclamation offering protection papers and a full and free pardon to those willing to remain in peaceable obedience to the king. As many took the pardon, Stockton eventually did but first was placed in irons and treated as a criminal.

He was then moved to Provost Prison in New York. After nearly five weeks of, Stockton was released on parole with his health impaired. His estate, Morven, in Princeton was occupied by General Charles Cornwallis during Stockton&#x27;s imprisonment. American historian William Stryker had written that &quot;Morven[,] the home of the Hon. Richard Stockton, was denuded of its library and furniture.&quot; Stockton&#x27;s treatment in the New York prisons prompted the Continental Congress to pass a resolution directing General George Washington to inquire into the circumstances; not long afterward, Stockton was paroled on January 13, 1777. The U.S. National Archives contains other messages showing that Washington duly contacted General Howe in New York regarding the exchange or release of Stockton and others.

Dr. Benjamin Rush wrote, &quot;At Princeton I met my wife&#x27;s father who had been plundered of all his household furniture and stock by the British army, and carried a prisoner to New York, from whence he was permitted to return to his family upon parole.&quot; Howe&#x27;s document that Stockton signed, giving his word of honor not to meddle in the American affairs during the war, was the parole Dr. Rush said Stockton was given when he was released from prison in New York. On March 25, 1777, General Howe and his brother Lord Howe wrote to Lord George Germain, secretary of state for the Colonies, &quot;My Lord, We have the honor to enclose to your Lordship a state of the Declarations subscribed in consequence of our Proclamation of the 30th of November. &#x27;Although none of the Leaders, nor principal Instigators and Abettors of the Rebellion, thought fit to avail themselves of the opportunity given them to return to their Duty&#x27;, we have some satisfaction in observing that so considerable a number of His Majesty&#x27;s deluded Subjects, of inferior Rank, in those Provinces where the Proclamation could be expect to have Effect, were disposed to relinquish the unjust Cause they had been once induced to support.&quot; 4,836 declarations were subscribed but Stockton, as a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a leading rebel, never did, according to General Howe.

In 1777, all members of Congress and Washington&#x27;s Continental Army were required to take the oath of allegiance to the United States. Stockton, as a prisoner of war and taken behind enemy lines, was also required to take the oath. He was called before the Board, took the oath, and was dismissed. Stockton did not turn in any protection papers, as was required if one signed Howe&#x27;s proclamation and was given a pardon. Because of the parole document Stockton signed with General Howe to gain his freedom that gave his word of honor not to meddle in the war, which was required to be given a parole, Stockton resigned from Congress. It took nearly two years to regain his health, according to Dr. Rush. In Princeton, a rumor was started by Mr. Cochran, a Tory, who claimed Stockton had taken General Howe&#x27;s protection, which caused Stockton to be spoken against for a short time, but &quot;Mr. Cochran&#x27;s known quarrel with him makes it very doubtful to candid persons,&quot; Rev. John Witherspoon wrote in a letter to his son David. &quot;Common report, moreover, may be attributed to Judge Stockton some of the exploits of a distant cousin, Major Richard Stockton an obnoxious Tory, who did take Howe&#x27;s protection and went over to the British until he was captured in Feb. 1777.&quot; The major Richard Stockton referenced was, in fact, the first cousin of Richard &quot;the Signer&quot; Stockton, Major Richard Witham Stockton of Princeton, New Jersey, a commissioned officer in the British Army. Major Richard Witham Stockton remained loyal to the crown, and at the conclusion of hostilities, emigrated, along with members of his family and other United Empire Loyalist, to what would become New Brunswick, Canada.

==Death and legacy==
Nothing was ever written about doubts of Stockton&#x27;s loyalty in any of the papers of members of Congress or in any newspapers or books of the time. When his health permitted, Stockton attempted to earn a living by reopening his law practice and teaching new students. Two years after his parole from prison, he developed cancer of the lip that spread to his throat. He was never free of pain until he died on February 28, 1781, at Morven. His remains were conveyed to Nassau Hall, where a large audience of citizens, friends, and students of the college were in attendance. The eulogy was delivered by Rev. Doctor Samuel Smith, vice president of the College of New Jersey and son-in-law of Rev. John Witherspoon. Smith said, &quot;The remains of a man who hath been long among the foremost of his country, for power, for wisdom, and for fortune; and who, if what honors this young country can bestow, if many and great personal talents, could save man from the grave, would not thus have been lamented here by you. Behold here &#x27;the end of all perfection.&#x27; The office of a judge of the province, was never filled with more integrity and learning than it was by him, for several years before the revolution. Since that period, he hath represented New-Jersey in the congress of the United States. But a declining health, and a constitution worn out with application and with service, obliged him, shortly after, to retire from the line of public duty, and hath at length dismissed him from the world.&quot;

On March 7, 1781, &quot;The New Jersey Gazette&quot; acknowledged Stockton&#x27;s worth to his country: &quot;The ability, dignity, and integrity, with which this gentleman discharged the duties of the several important offices to which he was called by the voice of this country are well known.&quot; For two generations his family had been Quakers, and it was his wish to be buried at the Stony Brook Meeting House Cemetery in Princeton. Stockton and his wife Annis were close friends of General Washington. After Stockton&#x27;s death, Annis, one of America&#x27;s first published female poets, became a favorite correspondent of Washington. Washington and his wife Martha were frequent visitors to Morven.

In 1888, the state of New Jersey donated a marble statue of Stockton to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. He is one of only six signers to be so honored. In 1969, the New Jersey Legislature passed legislation establishing a state college which was named after Stockton, to honor the memory of New Jersey&#x27;s signer of the Declaration of Independence. Previously known as &quot;Stockton State College&quot;, &quot;Richard Stockton State College&quot;, and &quot;Richard Stockton College of New Jersey&quot;, it is now known as Stockton University. A rest area on the southbound New Jersey Turnpike, south of Interstate 195, is named after Stockton.

A small town in New York south of Buffalo is named after Stockton. Stockton Street in Trenton, New Jersey is also named in his honor.

==Family==
Stockton and his wife had six children, four daughters and two sons: Julia Stockton (married to Benjamin Rush, also a signer of the Declaration), Mary (married to Rev. Andrew Hunter and mother of General David Hunter), Benjamin Rush, Susan, Richard, Lucius and Abigail. Stockton&#x27;s oldest son Richard was a lawyer and U.S. Senator representing New Jersey. His grandson, Commodore Robert Field Stockton, was a hero of the War of 1812 and in 1846 became the military governor of California and a Senator from New Jersey. A living relative from Joliet, Illinois is Anthony Stockton, an extremely well known and successful magician. He is the winner and reining champion of the Society of American Magician&#x27;s Chicago Magic competition for 7 years and running.

<text>Storm is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). Descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses, Storm is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with superhuman abilities known as mutants. She is able to control the weather and atmosphere and is considered to be one of the most powerful mutants on the planet. Storm is a member of the X-Men, a group of mutant heroes fighting for peace and equal rights between mutants and humans. She was the most prominently featured X-Men character in the 1980s, at which time it was the best-selling comic book in America. During this decade, she also acted as the acknowledged leader of the team.

Born Ororo Munroe to a tribal princess of Kenya and an African-American photojournalist father, Storm was raised in Harlem, New York City and Cairo, Egypt. She was made an orphan after her parents were killed when a plane crashed into their house. An incident at this time also traumatized Ororo, leaving her with claustrophobia that she would struggle with for decades. Under the tutelage of a master thief, an adolescent Ororo became a skilled pickpocket. By coincidence, she meets the powerful mutant Professor X. Professor X later convinces Ororo to join the X-Men and use her abilities for a greater cause and purpose. Possessing natural leadership skills and formidable powers of her own, Storm has been a member of teams such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, as well as the X-Men. Storm is also a part of a highly promoted romantic relationship with Black Panther. While she was married to him, she was also made queen consort of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. While she lost the title when the marriage was annulled, she has maintained her relationship with Black Panther in many subsequent stories.

Storm is the first Black leader of a Marvel superhero team, as well as the first female leader of a Marvel superhero team. She is the second Black female superhero for Marvel, after Misty Knight, who was created two months earlier. Storm is one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes.

One of the most prominent characters in the X-Men series, Storm has appeared in various forms of media relating to the franchise, including animation, television, video games, and a series of films. The character was a main cast member in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, which aired on Fox Kids from 1992 to 1997, voiced by Alison Sealy-Smith. Sealy-Smith would reprise her role in the revival series &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;, airing on Disney+ since 2024, and the third season of &quot;What If...?&quot;. Storm was first portrayed in live-action by Halle Berry in the 2000 film &quot;X-Men&quot;. Berry returned to portray the role in sequels, &quot;X2&quot; (2003), &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), and &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014). The younger version of Storm was portrayed by Alexandra Shipp in the film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016). Shipp had a cameo in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) and reprised her role in &quot;X-Men: Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019).

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Storm was created to appear as part of an ensemble: The &quot;all-new, all-different X-Men&quot;, a re-invention of the traditional X-Men team of the 1960s that had fallen out of popularity. This new team replaced the previous members with the exception of Cyclops, who remained. This team differed greatly from the original. Unlike in the early issues of the original series, the new team was not made up of teenagers and they also had a more diverse background. Marvel&#x27;s corporate owners, Cadence Industries, had suggested the new team should be international, feeling it needed characters with &quot;foreign appeal&quot;. So each character was from a different country with varying cultural and philosophical beliefs, and all were already well-versed in using their mutant powers, several being experienced in combat. 
In addition to Storm, from Kenya, the new X-Men included Cyclops (United States) alongside the newly created Colossus (from the Soviet Union/Russia), Nightcrawler (from West Germany/Germany), and Thunderbird (a Native American of Apache descent), and three previously introduced characters: Banshee (from Ireland), Sunfire (from Japan), and Wolverine (from Canada).

Storm was an amalgam of two characters Cockrum created: The Black Cat and Typhoon. The Black Cat had Storm&#x27;s costume, minus the cape, and was submitted for the new X-Men&#x27;s original lineup. However, during a hiatus in the new X-Men project, other female cat characters like Tigra were introduced, making the Black Cat redundant.

Since the creative team did not want the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat&#x27;s costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm&#x27;s white hair would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.

===1975–1979: Origin and early stories===

Storm first appeared in 1975 in the comic book &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum. In this comic, Wein portrays a battle against the living island Krakoa that results in the replacement of first-generation X-Men of the 1960s by new X-Men.

Chris Claremont followed up Wein as the writer of &quot;The X-Men&quot; in 1975. The title of the series was changed to &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; three years later. Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to Western culture, e.g. calling the obligation to wear clothing in public &quot;absurd.&quot; Claremont remained the main writer of &quot;X-Men&quot; for the next 16 years, and consequently wrote most of the publications containing Storm. Following &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;, Storm becomes the most prominent character in the X-Men during Claremont&#x27;s tenure. She is often a viewpoint character whose thought processes guide the narrative. She is the character who is most frequently represented in the Claremont era, appearing in 4,155 panels, and the most frequently pictured on issue covers, appearing on 97 of the 182 total issues in Claremont&#x27;s run.

===1980s: Punk look and loss of powers===
By the early 1980s, &quot;X-Men&quot; was Marvel&#x27;s top-selling comic title. Its sales were such that distributors and retailers began using an &quot;X-Men index&quot;, rating each comic book publication by how many orders it garnered compared to that month&#x27;s issue of &quot;X-Men&quot;. In this period, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #139 (November 1980), Claremont established her as the leader of the X-Men after Cyclops takes a leave of absence. Claremont also established a maternal relationship between Storm and her 13-year-old teammate, Kitty Pryde. A short story by Claremont set during Storm&#x27;s childhood in Kenya that ran in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100 (December 1980), establishes that when she was 12 years old, Storm saved a young Black Panther from racist thugs. This story would later become the basis for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.

In the early 1980s, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a space opera arc, in which the X-Men fight parasitic beings called the Brood. Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but is saved at the last minute by the benign whale-like Acanti aliens. Subsequently, Storm&#x27;s fellow X-Man Angel is abducted by a rogue mutant group called the Morlocks. The Morlocks are &quot;subterranean mutant refugees ... living in the tunnels of the New York City sewer system,&quot; and constitute an underclass of outcasts. The X-Men are outnumbered, and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called Plague. To save Kitty&#x27;s life, Storm challenges the Morlocks&#x27; leader Callisto, in a duel to the death for the leadership of the Morlocks. Callisto is presented as a complex character who rebels against her position of low social status. Despite Storm&#x27;s illness, she defeats Callisto by stabbing her with a knife. Callisto is saved through the efforts of a Morlock healer, and Storm offers the Morlocks refuge at the Xavier Mansion, though they decline. Storm is then made leader of the Morlocks. This fight with Callisto has strong effects on Storm&#x27;s character, who becomes more defiantly non-conformist. Following this incident, Storm has an encounter with Yukio, a ninja companion of Wolverine&#x27;s. Storm has a close and intimate bond with her. While the characters&#x27; relationship was conceived of as romantic, it was relegated to subtext after Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter mandated that no same-gender couples could be depicted at Marvel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross 2002 https://archive.org/details/upfrominvisibili0000gros/page/213 213&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences lead Storm to drastically change her appearance.
In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #173 (October 1983), Claremont and artist Paul Smith created a new look for Storm, replacing her old costume with a punk fashion aesthetic: A black leather top and pants with spikes and a mohawk. The change in appearance was inspired by the decision of colleague Walt Simonson to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife, &quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson. Upon their return, Simonson&#x27;s daughter, Julie, upset at her father&#x27;s new appearance, ran from the room. When the editors decided to change Storm&#x27;s appearance, Smith submitted a number of designs to them, explaining in a 2008 interview:

I did a number of portraits, all quite lovely and feminine. As a joke, I included a shot of her as Mr. T. You know, the kind of shot where they HAVE to go the other way. Weezie [&quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson]&#x27;s response? &#x27;They&#x27;re going to hang us whichever way we go. Let&#x27;s commit the murder.&#x27; I argued it was a joke and a monstrously bad idea but, given my departure following 175 was set prior to beginning my run, my vote didn&#x27;t count. So I did what I could with what I had left... So we went with the Mohawk ...But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand.

Julie Simonson&#x27;s reaction to her father&#x27;s new appearance would be mirrored in X-Man Kitty Pryde&#x27;s heartbroken rejection of Storm&#x27;s new look. These changes alienate her from Kitty for a time. Comics scholar andre m. carrington views this incident as a challenge to the stereotype of Black women as universal caregivers, demonstrating unconscious expectations of race and gender.

A year later, Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant Forge develops a mutant power neutralizing gun. The intended target is another X-Man, Rogue, but Storm is hit instead, taking away her powers. Forge takes her back to his home in Dallas, Texas to recover. They fall in love, but when she learns that Forge built the weapon that took her powers, she is heartbroken and leaves him.

By 1986, the question arises of whether the X-Men should be led by Storm or by Cyclops, who was now married to Madelyne Pryor and an expectant husband. The two settle the matter in a duel in the Danger Room that saw Storm victorious. J. Andrew Deman describes other instances in which Storm establishes her power and authority by commanding or overruling &quot;highly masculinized white characters,&quot; such as Wolverine.

Marc Silvestri became the primary artist of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; in the late 1980s. Regarding Storm, he said that &quot;She has a certain attitude that&#x27;s tough to capture without dropping into clichés and certain poses. ... You have to have an unusual energy level the day you have to draw Storm.&quot;

During the 1988 &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; storyline, Storm is trapped in another dimension with Forge, who restores her elemental powers. Following her rejoining the X-Men, they fight a demonic enemy called the Adversary. While they defeat the Adversary, the battle creates the public appearance that the X-Men have all died. In fact, they have survived with the help of a celestial being known as Roma. Roma casts a spell on them to be invisible to electronic equipment. The X-Men set up new headquarters in a small frontier village in the Australian Outback, after expelling a group of mutant-hunting cyborgs called Reavers who had been living there. Storm is captured by Nanny and Orphan-Maker. Although believed slain in that encounter, she resurfaces alive but bodily regressed to childhood by Nanny, with accompanying amnesia. She is hunted by the evil telepath Shadow King and framed for murder, and finally returns to thieving. While she slowly starts to regain her memories, she meets with a new character, the Cajun mutant Gambit, and they return to the X-Men together.

In the following arc, &quot;The X-Tinction Agenda&quot;, she is kidnapped by the mutant-exploiting nation of Genosha and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed slave. In the end, however, she is restored physically and mentally to her adult prime.

===1990s: Leadership of Gold team===

In October 1991, the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise was re-launched, centering on the new eponymous &quot;X-Men&quot; comic. The team was split in two; &quot;X-Men&quot; depicts the Blue team led by her colleague Cyclops and the continuing legacy series &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; portrays the Gold team. Led by Storm, the Gold team also comprises Colossus, Warren Worthington III, Iceman, and Jean Grey. In early issues of this run, Storm and the Gold Team confront the Hellfire Club and meet Bishop, a traveler from a possible future. Uncanny X-Men was originally a collaboration between Whilce Portacio and John Byrne.

In later issues of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, now written by Scott Lobdell, Storm&#x27;s relationship with Forge continues and culminates in Forge&#x27;s proposal of marriage in 1992. Forge misinterprets Storm&#x27;s slight hesitation, and he then rescinds his offer before it can be accepted. Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he wrote a reconciliation between the deeply pained Storm and Forge. John Romita Jr. provided most of the drawing for the series in 1993. There were multiple crossovers among the various X-Men comic series in this period that featured Storm as one character among others, such as X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song, Fatal Attractions, and Phalanx Covenant. In 1994, Joe Madureira took over as the main penciler of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

In 1995, all of the X-Men titles were temporarily replaced by an alternate reality storyline called Age of Apocalypse. Storm was a relatively minor character in this new reality. When the original series were restored, Lobdell continued an arc again pitting the X-Men against the Morlocks. As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983, Lobdell has Storm ending the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart. Here, Storm rips out one heart of the two-hearted Morlock girl Marrow, which has a bomb affixed to it. In February 1996, Storm appeared in her first miniseries, the eponymous &quot;Storm.&quot; Warren Ellis wrote this series, in which Storm is sucked into an alternate dimension and pitted against villain Mikhail Rasputin.

===2000s: &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; and marriage to Black Panther===
Sales for X-Men titles declined in the late 1990s, and at the turn of the century there were various efforts to revive them.

One of these was the Ultimate Marvel imprint, a new collection of titles featuring reimagined versions of Marvel&#x27;s characters. An alternate Storm appeared in February 2001 with &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, written by Mark Millar. In this version, Storm is a teenager from Morocco.

Marvel also renewed the relationship between Storm and Black Panther. Written by Christopher Priest, &quot;Black Panther&quot; #25-27 (December 2000-February 2001) reintroduces Storm as a major character in Black Panther&#x27;s world. Storm immediately says, &quot;I have been away from Africa far too long.&quot; Storm is called to Wakanda to protect a child from aliens. The dispute eventually involves Doctor Doom and Namor. In their renewed interactions, Storm compares Black Panther&#x27;s sense of commitment and certainty to that of Magneto. The issue establishes that Storm continues to believe that someday she and T&#x27;Challa may have a permanent marriage, but this must be deferred because of T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s exclusive commitment to his nation. Priest later said that he believed the two characters had a profound love affair, but that in his view they could never have a permanent relationship, precisely because &quot;Storm is the only human being on the planet Panther cannot B.S. She sees right through him, knows him far too intimately.&quot;

Chris Claremont returned to the character in his title &quot;X-Treme X-Men,&quot; beginning in July 2001. Storm was written as the leader of this team, and the central character of the book, until its end in issue #46 (June 2004). Salvador Larocca was the primary artist. Alongside Storm, other members included Rogue, Gambit, and Bishop. During this time, Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man Slipstream and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord Khan. In the series, Storm also becomes the leader of the X-Treme Sanctions Executive, a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.

During the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, an alternate reality is created by Scarlet Witch in which mutants are dominant and humans are oppressed. In this reality, Africa is a united independent power ruled by Storm alongside Black Panther. Storm is critical of Magneto&#x27;s mutant-supremacist ideas and practices. This is the first time that Storm and Black Panther are depicted as a royal couple, although their relationship in this reality is strained and they are not married. In the subsequent &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, the previous timeline is restored by 90% of mutants lose their powers. Storm is among the 198 mutants who retain their powers. Also that year, the miniseries &quot;Ororo: Before the Storm&quot; by writer Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail, concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el-Gibar during her childhood. In late 2005, there was a crossover storyline between &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2 and &quot;Black Panther&quot; in which Storm and Black Panther rekindled their relationship in the mainstream shared universe.

The following year, Marvel Comics announced that Storm would marry fellow African super hero Black Panther. Collaborating writer Eric Jerome Dickey explained that it was a move to explicitly target the female and African American audience. Storm&#x27;s history with Black Panther, including the initial meeting of the characters, was retconned by Marvel during the lead up to their marriage. Initially, in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100 (1980), Storm is seen at age twelve rescuing Black Panther from a white racist called Andreas de Ruyter, but in Dickey&#x27;s miniseries, T&#x27;Challa saves Ororo (who is still twelve) from de Ruyter and his brother. A &quot;Black Panther&quot; #24 (2006) flashback is ambiguous when it comes to the physical aspect of their first meeting, while the miniseries depicts Ororo giving her virginity to T&#x27;Challa a few days after they meet. Collaborating writer Axel Alonso, editor of &quot;Black Panther&quot;, has stated: &quot;Eric&#x27;s story, for all intents and purposes (...) is Ororo&#x27;s origin story.&quot;

The relationship led to the marriage of the two most prominent black African Marvel Comics heroes in &quot;Black Panther&quot; #18 by writer Reginald Hudlin, July 2006, as a tie-in to the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada was highly supportive of this marriage, stating it was the Marvel Comics equivalent of the marriage of &quot;Lady Diana and Prince Charles&quot;, and he expected both characters to emerge strengthened. Shawn Dudley, the Emmy-Award Winning Costume Designer for TV&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot; designed Storm&#x27;s wedding dress, which was revealed in the April 17 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, though the design was greatly altered for the comic event. The series establishes that Black Panther and Storm are both well-known and respected political leaders and celebrities worldwide; real-life figures such as George W. Bush, Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and Oprah Winfrey are depicted as attending the wedding, as well as many Marvel superheroes. Some critics and fans felt that the marriage was &quot;forced&quot; or &quot;rushed&quot; rather than developing organically. Hudlin, the writer, responded that the event was set up by earlier storylines and that some of the criticisms may have been motivated by the desire to see Storm in a relationship with a character of long-standing popularity, such as Wolverine.

Subsequent to the marriage, Storm has many adventures with Black Panther, and she temporarily leaves the X-Men. She is a featured character throughout the remainder of Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s run, from 2006 to 2009. In 2007, when Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman take time off from the Fantastic Four to work on their marriage in the aftermath of the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Storm and Black Panther become temporary members of the Fantastic Four. Written by a Black author, Storm&#x27;s stories with Black Panther delve more deeply into African-American culture than her previous portrayals. For example, in one story Storm and Black Panther visit an alien planet and meet alternate versions of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, and the cover of one issue depicts Storm as resembling Angela Davis and accompanied by members of the Black Panther Party.

In 2008, Storm re-joins the X-Men in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #25, written by Warren Ellis. She explains that Wakanda supports an organization called Mutantes Sans Frontières (inspired by Médecins Sans Frontières) that now funds the X-Men, and that she should return to the team to research its current methods; she also says that she instigated the idea, because she &quot;never knew that guilt-free shopping and constant lovemaking could get so boring.&quot; Subsequently, Storm is the featured protagonist of the four-issue &quot;X-Men: Worlds Apart&quot; miniseries, written by Christopher Yost. In this story, the reemergence of the Shadow King forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X-Man. Confronting the Panther God Bast, Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other, and that she is unafraid to do whatever is necessary to fulfill those responsibilities. Regaining Bast&#x27;s favor, the two defeat the Shadow King and Storm decides that she will remain Queen of Wakanda as well as a member of the X-Men, refusing to choose between them. For a period, Storm is active in both of these roles. She is also a prominent supporting character in &quot;Doomwar&quot;, in which she helps Black Panther to recover from injuries sustained in battle.

===2010s: End of marriage and conflicts with Avengers and Inhumans===
In 2010, Storm featured in &quot;X-Women&quot;, a one-shot story written by the veteran &quot;X-Men&quot; author Chris Claremont and illustrated by Milo Manara.

In 2011, Black Panther leaves Wakanda and takes a new role as the guardian of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, replacing Daredevil. Storm maintains a relationship with him and supports his decision, but they become increasingly estranged. She visits him once against his wishes, to rescue him and help him fight Kraven the Hunter.

After the 2011 revamp of the X-Men related comic books Storm appears as the leader of a defensive, reconnaissance-based team of X-Men in the ongoing &quot;X-Men&quot; title. In November that year, Storm joined the Avengers in &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 4 #19. However, in the following year she leaves the team to fight alongside the X-Men during the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline. This leads to a rift with Black Panther, when he sides with the Avengers. After a Phoenix-empowered Namor destroys Wakanda, Storm realizes the mutants have become irrationally destructive, and returns to help the Avengers. However, she is stunned when T&#x27;Challa tells her he has annulled their marriage.

In April 2013, Marvel debuted a new all-female series simply named &quot;X-Men&quot;. Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel, &quot;X-Men&quot; features a roster of Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke.

In late 2013, Marvel debuted &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot; by writer Jason Aaron, which featured Storm as a member of the team.

July 2014 saw the debut of a &quot;Storm&quot; solo series written by Greg Pak with art by Victor Inanez.

In the aftermath of &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Storm became the leader of the &quot;Extraordinary X-Men&quot;. The aim of the team was to provide a safe haven for mutants following the release of the Terrigen Mist, which is toxic to mutants. To protects the mutants, Storm relocated the team to Limbo. During Civil War II, Storm sided with Captain Marvel and was pitted against Magneto. Despite the tension between mutants and the Inhumans, Storm attempted to build an alliance with Medusa. When Magneto&#x27;s X-Men attacked New Attilan, Storm&#x27;s team clashed with the former villain. Storm reluctantly led the X-Men into a war with the Inhumans.

Following the war with the Inhumans, Storm steps down as leader of the X-Men and is replaced by Kitty Pryde. However, she continues to be a team member in X-Men: Gold. Storm&#x27;s magical hammer, known as Stormcaster, briefly returned to her. Later, Ororo joins the &quot;X-Men: Red&quot; roster, led by the newly resurrected Jean Grey. During the Hunt for Wolverine, Storm helps the X-Men search for Logan in Madripoor. The mission results in a confrontation between the X-Men and the Femme Fatales, led by Viper.

In 2016, Storm re-appears a supporting character for Black Panther in the series written by well-known journalist and public intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates, A Nation Under Our Feet. The following year, Storm appears as a member of a six-issue series examining Black superheroes also written by Coates, &quot;Black Panther and The Crew&quot;. In the series, Storm, Black Panther, Misty Knight, Luke Cage, and Eden Fesi discuss gentrification, racism, and police brutality. In the course of the Coates storyline, Storm re-kindles her relationship with Black Panther, although she remains independent of the Wakandan monarchy.

2019 begins a new era for the X-Men. Beginning in House of X and Powers of X, by Jonathan Hickman, the mutants found a new nation on the living island of Krakoa, where they are capable of regularly resurrecting mutants after their death. Storm gives a rousing speech of mutant unity on the island, affirming their shared community and identity. Storm features in the ensuing Marauders series written by Gerry Duggan, along with Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler, Iceman, Emma Frost, Bishop, and Pyro. The new Marauders team attempt to locate mutants whose freedom of movement is restricted and to help them to emigrate to Krakoa.

===2020s===
The Krakoa era continues in the first years of the 2020s. As one component of this story arc, Storm appears in &quot;Giant-Size Storm&quot; (2020).

Ann Nocenti wrote a new &quot;Storm&quot; mini-series in 2023. This takes in the place in the 1980s period, when Storm led the X-Men and shaved her hair into a mohawk.

With the end of the Krakoa era after Fall of X, Storm re-joins the Avengers team in issue #17 (August 2024), written by Jed MacKay and drawn by Valerio Schiti. Storm also appears in a solo series by Murewa Ayodele and Lucas Werneck, as part of the X-Men: From the Ashes relaunch. The first issue was released in October 2024.

==Characterization==
Richard Reynolds, in his book &quot;Superheroes&quot; (1992), describes Storm&#x27;s character as withdrawn and cerebral, despite her elemental power, and sexually remote, despite her fetishistic costume. He argues that she has a quasi-maternal role with many of X-Men and often acts to resolve their various contradictions and disputes. Carol Cooper points out that Storm is often noted by other prominent characters for her magnetic attractiveness and sex appeal, but that this is always made secondary to her other qualities and capacities. Margaret Galvan sees Jean Grey as Phoenix as a character foil to Storm, because Grey loses control of her enormous powers and lapses into narcissism, while Storm avoids this pitfall. Galvan argues that this is an allegory for the transformation of liberal feminism from the 1970s to the 1980s. Ramzi Fawaz argues that Storm is defined by a capacity to &quot;balance collective intimacies with her need for personal autonomy&quot; and that this mirrors her superpowers&#x27; connection to the unpredictability of the natural world. Fawaz argues that Storm&#x27;s claustrophobia also links her awareness of the natural environment with human politics and history.

===Fictional character biography===
In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #102 (December 1976), Claremont established Storm&#x27;s backstory. Storm&#x27;s mother, N&#x27;Dare, was the princess of a tribe in Kenya and descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses with white hair, blue eyes, and a natural gift for sorcery. N&#x27;Dare falls in love with and marries American photojournalist, David Munroe. They move to Harlem in uptown New York City, where Ororo is born. They later moved to Egypt and lived there until they die during the Suez Crisis in a botched aircraft attack, leaving six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. Her violent claustrophobia is established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack. She becomes a skilled thief in Cairo under the benign Achmed el-Gibar and wanders into the Serengeti as a young woman. She is worshipped as a goddess when her powers appear before being recruited by Professor X for the X-Men.

Claremont fleshed out Storm&#x27;s backstory in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #117 (January 1979). He retroactively added that Professor X had met Storm as a child in Cairo, prior to his formation of the X-Men. While Ororo was a child thief, she stole from Charles Francis Xavier, later known as Professor X. He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her. However, when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King, the two men are preoccupied with their battle, allowing the girl to escape. Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later.
Ever since her inception in 1975, Storm&#x27;s biography has largely stayed the same. Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006, when writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jerome Dickey, respectively, rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries &quot;Ororo: Before the Storm&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; vol. 2.

In established Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is born in New York City as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N&#x27;Dare and American photographer David Munroe. According to Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s &quot;Black Panther&quot; series, David Munroe&#x27;s mother, Harriet, was an aide to Malcolm X who accompanied him on his journey throughout African, including Wakanda. Munroe&#x27;s childhood experience of Africa led him to pursue his degree at the fictional University of Kenya. where he met N&#x27;Dare.

When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Five years later, during the Suez Crisis, a fighter jet crashes into her parents&#x27; house, killing them. Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is orphaned and left with intense claustrophobia. Her fear was once so intense that she was known to curl into a fetal position and approach a catatonic state. In late 2000s storylines, however, writers like Ed Brubaker and Christopher Yost have indicated that Storm had largely conquered her claustrophobia, and can freely move in tight spaces, even over long periods of time. After the death of her parents, Ororo wanders Cairo&#x27;s back-alleys for a few weeks, until she is picked up by the benign street lord Achmed el-Gibar and becomes a prolific thief; among her victims is her future mentor Professor X who is there to meet the Shadow King. Following an inner urge, she wanders into the Serengeti as a teenager and meets T&#x27;Challa, who would become her future husband. Despite strong mutual feelings, the two part ways.

In the Serengeti, Ororo first displays her mutant ability to control the weather. Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village was going through a terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm that her kind but poorly considered gesture had unintended consequences. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.

For a time, she is worshiped as a rain goddess to an African tribe, practicing nudism and tribal spirituality, before being recruited by Professor X into the X-Men. Ororo receives the code name &quot;Storm&quot; and is established as a strong, serene character. In her early career with the X-Men, she suffers a major claustrophobic attack, which prompts a revelation of her origin to her teammates. Jean Grey becomes a close friend as Ororo acclimatizes to the team and the United States, the two supporting each other as the only female X-Men. When Magneto captures the team, Storm frees the X-Men from captivity. Storm is later captured by the White Queen, leading up to the X-Men&#x27;s clash with Dark Phoenix. She becomes deputy leader of the X-Men, and supplants her colleague Cyclops as leader of the X-Men, a role she fills out during most of her time as a superhero. She briefly became &quot;Rogue Storm&quot;, and even switched bodies with the White Queen. She is attacked by Dracula, and defeats Callisto, becoming the new leader of the Morlocks. Following her leadership of the Morlocks through combat with Callisto, Storm begins to develop a darker side. Eventually, the X-Men are invited to Japan for Wolverine&#x27;s wedding to Mariko Yashida. It is here that she meets Wolverine&#x27;s old friend Yukio, and the two become fast friends. Storm is inspired by Yukio, who encourages Storm to embrace her emerging darker side. This leads Storm to drastically change her outward appearance to match her inner self and thus don her iconic punk drab.

In a storyline that began in 1984, Storm is deprived of her superhuman powers by an energy weapon fired by Henry Peter Gyrich; unknown to her, this device was designed by the mutant inventor Forge. The depowered Ororo subsequently meets and falls in love with Forge, but leaves him when she discovers that he is the inventor of the weapon behind her power loss. She helps Forge battle Dire Wraiths, before leaving him to rejoin the X-Men. She aids the New Mutants against the Shadow King Amahl Farouk. She next journeys to Asgard with the X-Men, where she is briefly enslaved by Loki. She is nearly killed in a confrontation with Andreas von Strucker. She defeats Cyclops in a competition to become the X-Men&#x27;s leader. During the &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; storyline, she is reunited with Forge, regains her superhuman powers, and dies with the X-Men in giving her life force to defeat the Adversary; she is resurrected by Roma. She is reverted to childhood by the mutant Nanny, meets Gambit, and is finally returned to adulthood – however, she is enslaved by the Genoshans, but regains her free will and escapes captivity. Concerning her personal life, she is for a long time romantically involved with fellow X-Man Forge, and even considers marrying him before their relationship dissolves.

After 90% of the mutants of the world lose their powers, Storm leaves the X-Men to go to Africa. She rekindles her relationship with T&#x27;Challa, now a superhero known as Black Panther, marries him, and becomes the queen of the kingdom of Wakanda. She joins the new Fantastic Four alongside her husband when Reed and Sue take a vacation. On a mission in space, the Watcher tells Black Panther and Storm that their children will have a special destiny. Upon Reed&#x27;s and Sue&#x27;s return to the Fantastic Four, Storm and the Black Panther leave, with Storm returning to the Uncanny X-Men to help out with events in &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;. After joining with the X-Men again, Storm is confronted by Cyclops over her position as an X-Man and a Queen. Cyclops reminds her that she made him choose between family and duty before, and she needs to make the same decision. Storm reacts by returning to Wakanda to face a despondent Black Panther, with the two seemingly falling out with each other, although it is later revealed that the Black Panther had been possessed by the Shadow King. After incapacitating the possessed T&#x27;Challa, Storm battles Cyclops, who had been mentally enthralled by the Shadow King to kill the other X-Men. After being forced to drive him out by striking Cyclops through the chest with a massive lightning bolt, the Shadow King then takes control of Storm, only to be devoured in vengeance by Bast, the Panther God, who had agreed to hide inside of Storm&#x27;s mind to take revenge on the Shadow King for possessing T&#x27;Challa.

Around the early 2010s, Storm assumes a leadership position in a team operating from the island of Utopia, near San Francisco, after the X-Men: Schism. She took Cyclops&#x27;s side in the Schism and thus becomes a member of his new X-Tinction Team. After Avengers vs. X-Men, when T&#x27;Challa officially annuls their marriage, Storm returns to Wolverine&#x27;s side and they both begin a relationship. During &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; (early- to mid-2010s), she also goes back to a punk mohawk look with a new costume, and becomes a member of the Uncanny X-Force (with Psylocke, Spiral, Puck and a female Fantomex) and of an all-female incarnation of X-Men (with Jubilee, Rachel Grey, Rogue, Psylocke, Omega Sentinel and Monet/M). She also stars in her own short-lived solo title.

After the Marvel Universe reboot in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover (2015), Storm returns to the fold in &quot;Extraordinay X-Men&quot;, trying to deal with a new plague called M-Pox. The M-Pox is based on the dispersal on the atmosphere of the Terrigen Mists, and this situation rises the tensions between mutants and Inhumans, culminating in the crossover &quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot;.

When Kitty Pryde returns from space to lead the X-Men, Storm joins her and a few familiar faces in the new &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; title. During the same period, she also rekindles her friendship with a resurrected Jean Grey and joins her Red team.

In the new status quo for mutants post &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. Storm takes part in a quasi-religious ceremony to welcome their newly resurrected comrades, after an attack on an Orchis-made Master Mold base in space.

Storm is seen attacking the last compound of Orchis on Earth with Magneto, Polaris and Cyclops. She also is part of the Marauders crew with White Queen, Captain Kitty Pryde, Iceman, Pyro and Bishop.

Another parallel storyline involves her attempts to find a cure for a technorganic infection. Later, after the Hellfire Gala and the terraforming of planet Mars, Storm leaves the Marauders and becomes the regent of Arakko and Voice of the Sol System.

==Powers and abilities==
===Weather control===

Storm is one of the most powerful mutants on Earth and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to manipulate the weather. Storm possesses the psionic ability to control all forms of weather over vast areas. She has been able to control both terrestrial and extraterrestrial ecosystems. She can modify the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity, and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated control over atmospheric pressure. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, blizzards, and hurricanes, as well as mist. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.

Her precise control over the atmosphere allows her to create special weather effects. She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal, make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, channel ambient electromagnetism through her body to generate electric blasts, flash freeze objects and people, coalesce atmospheric pollutants into acid rain or toxic fog, and summon wind currents strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself (or others) to fly at high altitudes and speeds. Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person&#x27;s lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.

Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include cosmic storms, solar wind, ocean currents, and the electromagnetic field. She has demonstrated the ability to separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis, allowing her to breathe underwater. While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic media. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of kinetic, thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will.

Storm has been shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over the weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm&#x27;s mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body.

===Magical potential===
Storm&#x27;s ancestry supports the use of magic and witchcraft. Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses. Storm&#x27;s matrilineal powers have even been linked to the &quot;real-world&quot; Rain Queens of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor from the Hyborian Age, Ayosha, hails. The Mystic Arcana series deals with Storm&#x27;s ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess Ma&#x27;at, also known as Oshtur – the mother of Agamotto. For some unknown reason, since the dawn of Atlantis, this line of African women has been given distinguishing features of white hair, blue eyes, and powerful magic potential. Although Storm has not developed her magical potential, it has been hinted at. The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck. The Tarot asserts Storm as being &quot;High Priestess&quot;, the First Tarot&#x27;s choice one-third of the time. The other draws were the Scarlet Witch and Agatha Harkness. These three characters split the High Priestess card equally. A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to Magik and some of Storm&#x27;s alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent. On a separate note, it has been stated that Storm&#x27;s spirit is so strong that she was able to host the consciousness of an avatar (or &quot;manifestation body&quot;) of Eternity; in a gathering consisting of herself, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Silver Surfer and the Fantastic Four, she and Doctor Strange were the only viable candidates. In Wakanda, Storm is called Hadari-Yao (&quot;Walker of Clouds&quot; in ancient Alkamite), a goddess who preserves the balance of natural things.

===Combat and thievery===
Storm&#x27;s willpower is strong enough to defy Dracula&#x27;s commands after he bites her. She is an expert thief, and a skilled, cunning and gifted hand-to-hand fighter, trained by Achmed el-Gibar, Professor X, Wolverine and Black Panther. By strategy, Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like Callisto and the Crimson Commando in hand-to-hand combat. Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns, and is proficient in the use of knives. Storm is also fluent in Russian, Arabic, and Swahili. As part of her paraphernalia, Storm carries a set of lock-picks (with which she has an extraordinary ability at picking locks, including her teeth while her physical coordination was reduced to the level of an infant) and her ancestral ruby, which allows inter-dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning.

===Physical abilities and traits===
Storm&#x27;s weather powers allow her body to compensate for climate extremes; on one occasion as she was trying to control an unnatural storm she becomes overwhelmed as her body temperature rises too high. In &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; – X-Men (2004), it is stated that her powers enable her to breathe while moving at any speed and protect her from air friction, while granting her protection from temperature extremes of heat and cold. The &quot;All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update&quot; #1 (2007) states that Storm&#x27;s body changes temperature to adapt to her environment.

Her body compensates for rapid decreases or increases in atmospheric pressure. She can see in near-complete darkness and has superb dexterity. Storm has one of the strongest wills among the X-Men, making her highly resistant to psychic attacks especially in tandem with electrical fields she creates around herself. Telepaths have found it difficult to track her down and probe her thoughts. Several of these traits are independent of her mutant status and are a result of her ancestry. Also, when using her powers, Storm&#x27;s eyes turn solid white.

Her full potential has not yet been realized, and on one occasion the Super Giant stated that Storm was an &quot;Omega-Level Mutate&quot;, grouping and targeting her with Omega-Level mutants such as Iceman and Rachel Grey. Her Omega-Level status was eventually confirmed.

==Themes and motifs==
Storm is among the most famous Black female superheroes, and as a result has been widely viewed as an icon of third wave feminism and intersectionality, conceptual innovations that address the intertwining of race and gender. Gladys L. Knight, author of &quot;Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video games, Film, and Television&quot; (2010) wrote that &quot;two defining aspects of her persona are her racial identity and her social status as a mutant.&quot; The X-Men have symbolically represented marginalized minorities and the debut of the &quot;X-Men&quot; series coincided with the Civil Rights Movement, in which their plight as mutants mirrored that of African Americans. Storm&#x27;s creation in particular &quot;was during the heyday of blaxploitation films.&quot;

J. Andrew Deman argues that her early appearances are somewhat stereotypical and demonstrate sexual exoticism, catering to the male gaze. Carol Cooper also views the early appearances of the character as emblematic of &quot;the mythic earth-mother/matriarch figure critiqued by many black feminists as both unrealistic and racist in its glib projection of inhuman perfection.&quot; While Storm has always been presented as a Black woman, she is also often drawn with more European features and canonically has blue eyes; some have criticized these choices as concessions to aesthetic standards of white Americans.

However, Ramzi Fawaz writes, &quot;Ororo is a character with few, if any, genuine antecedents in American superhero comic books: a superpowered black woman, who grew up a vagabond.&quot; Many scholars, such as Deborah Whaley, have argued that in subsequent appearances she overcomes these stereotypical origins to become &quot;a visionary social subject that propels social change.&quot; Storm&#x27;s leadership of the X-Men has been read as a utopian vision of overcoming racism and sexism. Fawaz argues that Storm &quot;represents a new affective relation between the teammates that derails the heterosexual order that had prevailed in the original team.&quot; Fawaz interprets Storm as embodying the &quot;black female disco diva&quot; that dominated gay and African American visual culture&quot; by means of her costume and &quot;hyperbolic performance of an &#x27;African goddess&#x27; persona.&quot; Fawaz is particularly interested in Storm&#x27;s bond with Jean Grey in the mid-1970s, which he sees as a representation of &quot;radical political attempts to articulate cross-racial alliances and mutual recognition between women.&quot;

Storm also unites African-American and continental African notions of Black identity, particularly in the storyline which she takes a leave of absence of the X-Men in order to return to her homeland for a year, titled &quot;Lifedeath II&quot;. While Deman writes that some of the depictions of Africa are stereotypical, the illustration of a diasporic identity and its links to ancestry are potentially progressive for readers. Since then, Storm has become a notable fictional example of a contemporary African woman. In 2014, Karen Attiah of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asserted, &quot;African women are having a bit of a moment in American pop culture. From Nigerian author Chimamanda Adichie to Ghanaian-Nigerian author Taiye Selasie, to Kenyan star Lupita Nyong’o, African immigrant women are finding that their stories and performances resonate with American audiences. Now, a fictional woman is joining their ranks: Ororo Munroe, known as Storm, a member of Marvel’s X-Men team. [...] Even as a supporting character or member of an ensemble, Storm’s done it all. She’s been an African queen, a street thief, an X-Men team leader and the headmistress of the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning. In the world of comic book fantasy where black characters are scarce, the fact that Storm was one of the most powerful mutants in the X-Men universe was a point of pride growing up.&quot;

==Supporting characters==
===Allies===
Storm has notable bonds with all of the main X-Men. In the first period that she led the team, its line-up comprised Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Rogue, and Kitty Pryde. In particular, she has a maternal connection to Pryde. Particularly in stories of the 1970s, she has a close friendship with Jean Grey. Ramzi Fawaz views this friendship as an allegory for bonds between the liberation projects of Black women and white women. In stories of the 2010s, she works together with The Crew, an all-Black superhero team that also includes her former husband Black Panther, Luke Cage and Misty Knight. Her friendship with Cage and Knight had been previously established in the 1970s.

===Romantic relationships and sexuality===
Storm had a long-standing relationship with Forge that culminated in his proposal of marriage, which he later withdrew as a result of misinterpreting her hesitation. Storm&#x27;s longest and most prominent relationship is with Black Panther. In 2006, during Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s authorship of &quot;Black Panther&quot;, Storm marries Black Panther, and she appeared as a prominent supporting character in many subsequent storylines. Readers and critics compared the wedding to the relationship of Jay-Z and Beyoncé, although they did not marry until two years later. The marriage was later annulled during the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;. However, Storm has resumed the relationship in later storylines. Storm also had a significant romantic relationship with Wolverine.

In the Claremont period, Storm&#x27;s bisexuality is implied. She has a close relationship with Yukio, a partner of Wolverine&#x27;s. While the characters&#x27; relationship was conceived of as romantic, it was relegated to subtext after Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter mandated that no same-gender couples could be depicted in comic books. Because of this relationship, some secondary sources identify Storm as bisexual. Generally speaking, later storylines do not explore this aspect of Storm&#x27;s character. In 1994, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #312 revisited the relationship between Storm and Yukio; the narrator of the story describes them as &quot;More than friends ... Less than sisters ... these two are kindred spirits.&quot;

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

Storm was one of the first Black superheroes in mainstream comic books, and the second Black female superhero in Marvel Comics, after Misty Knight, who debuted in March 1975. She was the third Black female superhero in mainstream comics; DC had previously introduced Nubia, a supporting character for Wonder Woman, in 1973.

In Marvel Comics, other preceding Black characters with superpowers were Black Panther (1966), Hobie Brown (the Prowler) and The Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972), Blade (1973), and Abe Brown (1974). In DC Comics, she was also preceded by &quot;Teen Titans&quot; member Mal Duncan who debuted in 1970, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; wielder John Stewart (1971), and Mister Miracle protégé Shilo Norman (1973).

Since her creation, Storm has remained one of the most successful and recognizable Black superheroes. Storm is the first Black leader of a Marvel superhero team, as well as the first female leader of a Marvel superhero team.

=== Critical reception ===
Andrew Wheeler of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; described Storm as &quot;the first major black female superhero,&quot; stating, &quot;Storm was designed to stand out from previous super-women, and not only by dint of her race. She also had long white hair and strange oval irises, and arguably the most formidable power set in the new team. From the start, her weather-control powers allowed her to summon raging winds and lightning strikes. She was a heavyweight who had been worshiped as a goddess, and there was never any question of her using her powers only to defend or evade. She wasn&#x27;t introduced as a damsel, and she wasn&#x27;t introduced as a love interest.&quot; Alex Abad-Santos of &quot;Vox&quot; called Storm &quot;one of Marvel&#x27;s most iconic characters,&quot; saying, &quot;Marvel, for the past couple of years, has built up a notably diverse cast of heroes, and started to get serious about featuring its female leads. But arguably the most iconic non-white character the company has introduced to date is Storm, aka Ororo Munroe, who was first introduced in 1975. Clocking in at 5&#x27;11&quot; with white hair, black skin, and the power to control the weather, Storm was startling, beautiful, and something readers had never seen before. She&#x27;s a big reason writer Greg Pak picked up comic books.&quot; Ashanti El of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; referred to Storm as a &quot;veteran X-Men hero and weather goddess,&quot; writing, &quot;Storm&#x27;s fame in media stems from her unmatched representation as a black woman. In a time when the majority of superheroes were only white men in capes, Ororo broke the mold and proved that diversity in comics was possible and lucrative with the X-Men starring in several pop-culture landmarks, including the popular &#x27;90s animated series. A trailblazer among trailblazers, Storm&#x27;s roles in comics helped to usher in a new wave of comic book heroes like Riri Williams, Lunella Lafayette, and Shuri. Cosplayers and fans also marvel at the mutant&#x27;s stylish costumes including the iconic self-empowering &#x27;80s mohawk look.&quot; Danielle Broadway of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; stated, &quot;The Marvel character Storm is not only a staple of the X-Men franchise, but also a notorious fan favorite. From her epic weather control powers to her unique style, Storm has stolen the hearts of many. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, she’s one of the first and only Black woman superheroes in Marvel comics. [...] She illustrates what it means to be a Black woman as she fights to oppose stereotypes, violence, and commodification.&quot;

Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; said, &quot;It’s no secret that Ororo Munroe is a FANGRRLS favorite. This is a woman that has been around the world and even a pretty fair amount of the galaxy yet she remains perhaps the most emotionally grounded X-Man. She’s an omega level mutant and finds herself regularly seated at tables of Marvel’s most powerful players. She has done everything from pickpocket to queen. She is kind of the best.&quot; David Harth of &quot;CBR.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Storm has been on a long strange trip throughout her life in comics, one that&#x27;s always seen her on an upward trajectory. From a thief on the streets of Cairo to a goddess on the African plains to a superhero and leader of the highest caliber, Ororo Munroe has proven nothing can hold her back. Storm remained one of the most beloved X-Men and an irreplaceable part of the team&#x27;s mythos. Debuting on a stacked X-Men team, she was still able to stand out. Marvel and the creators who worked on Storm did their best to make her a better character, creating a superhero unlike any other.&quot; Chris Arrant of &quot;Newsarama&quot; wrote, &quot;While her mutant ability to control the weather is a pivotal part of her, thanks to the writers and artists that have added layers to her character, it&#x27;s Storm the woman and her often dueling qualities of tenacity, anger, forgiveness, and compassion that have forged her into a titan of modern fiction and cemented her into the bedrock foundation of Marvel Comics most important characters.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; stated, &quot;Storm&#x27;s ability to manipulate and harness the weather makes her one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. But power like that comes at a great cost. Storm lives every day in a state of carefully maintained composure. Too much stress could be deadly for everyone around her. Fans have seen Storm as a thief, an X-Man, a fighter, and even a queen. Through it all, she remains one of the most relatable mutant heroes.&quot;

==In other media==
Storm has made numerous appearances in other media. She appeared in six 20th Century Fox live-action &quot;X-Men&quot; films; she is portrayed by actress Halle Berry in four of the films. Her younger self is portrayed by Alexandra Shipp in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;X-Men: Dark Phoenix&quot;. In animation, she is voiced by Alison Sealy-Smith in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;, and &quot;What If ...?&quot; season 3. Other actresses voice the character in &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;.

She has also been in a large number of video games: a guest appearance in &quot;Spider-Man: Web of Shadows&quot; and a playable character in every game in the &quot;X-Men Legends&quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot; series.

<doc id="232565" wikidata="Q6974819" url="?curid=232565" title="National Party of Scotland">
<text>The National Party of Scotland (NPS) was a centre-left political party in Scotland which was one of the predecessors of the current Scottish National Party (SNP). The NPS was the first Scottish nationalist political party, and the first which campaigned for Scottish self-determination.

The National Party of Scotland was founded in 1928 by the amalgamation of the Scots National League (SNL), the Scottish National Movement (SNM) and the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA). The NPS emerged from the consensus among members of these groups, and the Scottish Home Rule Association, that an independent political party, free of any connections to any existing parties, was the best way forward for achieving Scottish Home Rule.

The NPS contested the 1929 and 1931 United Kingdom general elections, and a number of by-elections. In 1934 the NPS merged with the Scottish Party to form the Scottish National Party (SNP).

==Origins and history==
The NPS was formed in 1928 after John MacCormick of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association called a meeting of all those favouring the establishment of a party favouring Scottish Home Rule. The meeting was presided over by Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, who had been a Liberal Party, then Scottish Labour Party politician. The NPS was formed by the amalgamation of GUSNA with the Scots National League, Lewis Spence&#x27;s Scots National Movement and the Scottish Home Rule Movement. On 23 June an inauguration took place in Stirling.

The NPS was a left-of-centre party. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid was a member, but was expelled on account of his communist views (ironically, he would later be expelled from the Communist Party of Great Britain for his Scottish Nationalist beliefs). Other figures besides MacDiarmid were involved. Eric Linklater stood as an NPS candidate in the 1933 East Fife by-election, and Neil Gunn played a role in aiding the NPS amalgamation with the Scottish Party.

==Merger==
In 1932 a home rule organisation, the Scottish Party, was formed by former members of the then Unionist Party, precursor of the modern Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. MacCormick desired unity amongst the Scottish Nationalist movement and made contact with the Scottish Party. Increasingly the two parties began to co-operate, and when the Scottish Party chose to contest the Kilmarnock by-election in November 1933 the NPS endorsed their candidate. In 1934 the NPS and Scottish Party merged to form the Scottish National Party.

==Electoral performance==
Lewis Spence was the first nationalist to stand for election. He contested Midlothian and Peebles Northern at a by-election in 1929 and came fourth, with 4.5% of the vote.

The NPS contested many elections in its short existence but never managed to get any of its candidates elected to parliament.

<doc id="232567" wikidata="Q348666" url="?curid=232567" title="Dom Pérignon (monk)">
<text>Dom Pierre Pérignon (; December 163814 September 1715), was a French Benedictine monk who made important contributions to the production and quality of Champagne wine in an era when the region&#x27;s wines were predominantly still red. Popular myths frequently, but erroneously, credit him with the invention of sparkling Champagne, which did not become the dominant style of Champagne until the mid-19th century.

The famous Champagne Dom Pérignon, the prestige &quot;cuvée&quot; of Moët &amp; Chandon, is named for him. The remains of the monastery where he spent his adult life is now the property of that winery.

Dom Pérignon was a contemporary of Louis XIV (1638–1715).

==Biography==
Pérignon was born to a clerk of the local marshal in the town of Sainte-Menehould in the ancient Province of Champagne in the Kingdom of France. He was born in December 1638 and was baptized on 5 January 1639. He was the youngest of his parents&#x27; seven children, as his mother died the following summer. His father&#x27;s family owned several vineyards in the region.

As a child Pérignon became a member of the boys&#x27; choir school operated by the Benedictine Abbey of Moiremont, studying there until 1651, when he went to study at the Jesuit college in Châlons-sur-Marne. When he was 17 he entered the Benedictine Order near the town of Verdun at the Abbey of Saint-Vanne, the leading monastery of the Congregation of St. Vanne. The congregation was a reform movement of monastic life, and he followed a regimen of prayer, study and manual labor, as prescribed in the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;. In 1668 he was transferred to the Abbaye Saint-Pierre d&#x27;Hautvillers, where he served as cellarer for the rest of his life. Under his stewardship, the abbey flourished and doubled the size of its vineyard holdings, while he worked to improve their product with the help of Dom Thierry Ruinart, a noted scholar of the abbey.

When Pérignon died in 1715, as a sign of honor and respect, he was buried in a section of the abbey cemetery traditionally reserved only for abbots. That cemetery is now the property of the local commune.

The most photographed statue of Dom Pérignon stands at the entrance to Moët &amp; Chandon&#x27;s headquarters in Épernay, though as of summer 2022, a significantly more artistic one was unveiled in Hautvillers. The latter bronze integrates a very large glass champagne bottle into the figure&#x27;s lower portion as well as a motif at its base which represents the trunk of the grape vine. The two cellar keys hanging from his belt sash represents the coat of arms of the same village.

==Influence on champagne production==

In Perignon&#x27;s era, the in-bottle refermentation (now used to give sparkling wine its sparkle) was an enormous problem for winemakers. When the weather cooled off in the autumn, fermentation would sometimes stop before all the fermentable sugars had been converted to alcohol. If the wine was bottled in this state, it became a literal time bomb. When the weather warmed in the spring, dormant yeast roused themselves and began generating carbon dioxide that would at best push the cork out of the bottle, and at worst explode, starting a chain reaction. Nearby bottles, also under pressure, would break from the shock of the first breakage, and so on, which was a hazard to employees and to that year&#x27;s production. Dom Pérignon thus tried to avoid refermentation. He did introduce some features that are hallmarks of Champagne today, particularly extensive blending of grapes from multiple vineyards.

In 1718, the Canon Godinot published a set of wine-making rules that were said to be established by Dom Pérignon. Among these rules was the detail that fine wine should only be made from Pinot noir. Pérignon was not fond of white grapes because of their tendency to enter re-fermentation. Other rules that Godinot included was Pérignon&#x27;s guidance to aggressively prune vines so that they grow no higher than three feet and produce a smaller crop. Harvest should be done in cool, damp conditions (such as early morning) with every precaution being taken to ensure that the grapes don&#x27;t bruise or break. Rotten and overly large grapes were to be thrown out. Pérignon did not allow grapes to be trodden and favored the use of multiple presses to help minimize maceration of the juice and the skins.

Pérignon was also an early advocate of wine-making using only natural processes, without the addition of foreign substances.

==Misconceptions with myths==
The quote attributed to Perignon—&quot;Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!&quot;—is supposedly what he said when tasting the first sparkling champagne. However, the first appearance of that quote appears to have been in a print advertisement in the late 19th century.

A major proponent of the misconceptions surrounding Dom Pérignon came from one of his successors at the Abbey of Hautvillers, Dom Groussard, who in 1821 gave an account of Dom Pérignon &quot;inventing&quot; Champagne among other exaggerated tales about the Abbey in order to garner historical importance and prestige for the church.

Groussard&#x27;s myth achieved more than prestige for the church, it helped commercialize champagne at the turn of the twentieth century. The Syndicat du Commerce used the myth to promote Champagne and the Champagne region, producing a pamphlet called &quot;Le Vin de Champagne&quot; in 1896 that celebrated Perignon as the inventor of Champagne by following &quot;ancient traditions&quot;. The myth served to protect Champagne made in Marne as the original sparkling wine and dismiss other wines as imitators. The myth also helped distance Champagne from its associations with aristocratic decadence and transform it as a drink made from a monk&#x27;s labor and persistence.

The myths about Pérignon being the first to use corks and being able to name the precise vineyard by tasting a single grape likely originated from Groussard&#x27;s account.

Prior to blending he would taste the grapes without knowing the source vineyard to avoid influencing his perceptions. References to his &quot;blind tasting of wine&quot; have led to the common misconception that Dom Pérignon was blind.

Contrary to popular belief, Dom Pérignon did not introduce blending to Champagne wines but rather the method of blending the grapes &quot;prior&quot; to sending them to press.

<doc id="232571" wikidata="Q7437896" url="?curid=232571" title="Scottish Party">
<text>The Scottish (Self-Government) Party was a Scottish nationalist political party formed in 1932 by a group of members of the Unionist Party who favoured the establishment of a Dominion Scottish Parliament within the British Empire. The Scottish Party differed from the existing National Party of Scotland (NPS) on the grounds that the NPS and the form of Scottish independence it advocated was ambiguous about the Empire, and they also disagreed with the left-of-centre platform of the NPS.

==Origins==
The Scottish Party emerged in November 1932 as a breakaway from the Cathcart Unionist Association in Glasgow. In June that same year, members of the Association had set up an &#x27;Imperial Committee&#x27;, which was a pro-Scottish Home Rule front. The committee arranged meetings, made statements in support of Home Rule, and produced a manifesto which proposed replacing the Westminster Parliament with an Imperial Parliament, containing representatives from the British Empire, and establishing dominion Parliaments for Scotland, England, and Wales. This provoked outrage amongst the leadership of the Unionist Party, who were opposed to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.

John Kevan McDowall, a Glasgow solicitor and the chairman of the committee, was accused by the Glasgow Unionist Association of disloyalty and unconstitutional practices. McDowall, Andrew Dewar Gibb, and around thirty other pro-Home Rule rebels resigned from the Unionist Party and founded the Scottish Party.

==Activities==
McDowall and Gibb were able to enlist the support of James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose (who became the party&#x27;s chairman) and Sir Alexander MacEwen, both champions of moderate Home Rule. Broadly, the Scottish Party consisted mainly of Unionist and Liberal elements (a mixture of lairds, provosts and business people). The party also included some distinguished figures in Scottish public life, such as John Bannerman, Sir Henry Keith and Sir Daniel Stevenson. The Scottish Party functioned more as a think tank than as an active political party. Its membership was less than 1,000, and it fielded one candidate, MacEwen, only in the 1933 Kilmarnock by-election. He was backed by the National Party of Scotland (NPS) but came fourth with 6,098 votes.

==Merger==
By 1933 the Scottish Party had received overtures from John MacCormick, secretary of the NPS, who sought to negotiate a merger between the two parties in order to unify these two elements of the Scottish independence movement. Gibb was especially enthusiastic about the merger, but it was met with scepticism from McDowell. In 1934 the NPS and Scottish Party merged to form the Scottish National Party.

<text>&quot;Mother&quot; Maybelle Carter (born Maybelle Addington; May 10, 1909 – October 23, 1978) was an American country musician and &quot;among the first&quot; to use the Carter scratch, with which she &quot;helped to turn the guitar into a lead instrument.&quot; It was named after her. She was a member of the original Carter Family act from the late 1920s until the early 1940s and a member of the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle group.

==Biography==
She was born Maybelle Addington on May 10, 1909, in Nickelsville, Virginia, the daughter of Margaret Elizabeth (née Kilgore; 1879–1960) and Hugh Jackson Addington (1877–1929).

On March 13, 1926, Maybelle married Ezra Carter. They had three daughters, Helen, June, and Anita.

She was a member of the Carter Family, formed in 1927 by her brother-in-law, A. P. Carter, who was married to her cousin Sara, also a part of the trio. The Carter Family was one of the first commercial rural country music groups. Maybelle helped create the group&#x27;s unique sound with her innovative style of guitar playing, using her thumb to play the melody on the bass strings and her index finger to fill out the rhythm. Her technique, sometimes known as the Carter Scratch, influenced the guitar&#x27;s shift from rhythm to lead instrument.

The Grand Ole Opry community of the early 1950s widely respected her, a matriarchal figure in country music circles who was popularly known as &quot;Mother Maybelle.&quot; However, she was only in her forties. Maybelle and her daughters toured from the 1940s through the 1960s as &quot;The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle,&quot; but after the death of A. P. Carter in 1960, the group revived the name &quot;The Carter Family.&quot; They frequently toured with Johnny Cash, her son-in-law, from 1968 on. The group performed regularly on Cash&#x27;s weekly network variety show from 1969 to 1971. She briefly reunited with former Carter Family member Sara Carter during the 1960s folk music craze, with Sara singing lead and Maybelle providing harmony as before in their 1966 reunion album.

Carter made occasional solo recordings during the 1960s and 1970s, usually full-length albums. Her final such work, a two-record set released on Columbia Records, placed on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s best-selling country albums chart in 1973 when she was 64. Maybelle was also featured on The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s 1972 recording &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;.

Carter died in 1978 after a few years of poor health. She was interred next to her husband, Ezra, in Hendersonville Memory Gardens in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Two of their daughters – Helen and Anita – are buried nearby.

==Family tree==




==Musicianship==

=== Guitar ===
According to statements made by Carter during a transcribed public performance, she began studying guitar at age 13 when she acquired an instrument. She was both an early female guitarist with national exposure and one of the first to use the guitar as a lead instrument in country music.

Writers have identified at least three or four styles played by Maybelle Carter. She often tuned her guitar down, sometimes as many as five frets, but sometimes used a capo to increase the instrument&#x27;s range. Her most famous and widely recorded style is sometimes called &quot;the Carter Scratch,&quot; or &quot;thumb-lead style.&quot; This technique involved playing a melody on the instrument&#x27;s three bass strings while strumming the three treble strings for rhythm. She used thumb and finger picks while playing.

Another style, later popularized by other musicians, was essentially the reverse of the thumb-lead style. In this style, Carter fingerpicked a melody on the three treble strings while brushing a rhythm on the bass strings with her thumb. It is often said that she first saw this style played by African American musician Lesley Riddle. A third style of Carter&#x27;s guitar playing involved rapid flatpicking in a country blues rhythm. Her most obscure style was utilized on a few recordings by the Original Carter Family in the 1920s and early 1930s. It may be described as a Hawaiian-influenced slide technique that sometimes sounded like a modern dobro. Finally, if other musicians were playing a lead instrument, Maybelle would often strum chords on the guitar to accompany them. Maybelle once filled in for Jimmie Rodgers during a recording session, perfectly mimicking his guitar playing style, in 1932. Rodgers was ill with tuberculosis at that time and had waning stamina during the session.

Carter recorded her signature guitar piece, &quot;Wildwood Flower,&quot; on numerous occasions, beginning with the original 1928 version. &quot;The Cannon Ball,&quot; recorded with the Original Carter Family in 1930, illustrates Carter&#x27;s fingerpicking style with thumb/bass fill. Her final recording in the slide guitar style was &quot;My Old Cottage Home&quot; in 1931. &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Blues,&quot; recorded for Decca, is an excellent flatpicking illustration.

Guitar recordings she made with the Carter Sisters: &quot;Fourteen Karat Nothing,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Working on a Building,&quot; &quot;Take Good Care of Him&quot; — a rapid-tempo re-recording of &quot;Waves on the Sea&quot; — as well as a contemporary-sounding revision of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be All Smiles Tonight.&quot;

Solo guitar recordings: &quot;Cumberland Gap,&quot; &quot;Victory Rag,&quot; &quot;Red Wing,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Allie Lee.&quot;

=== Autoharp ===
The autoharp was relatively obscure in the earliest days of recorded country music. The Original Carter Family often used the instrument for rhythm. Still, it was played by Maybelle Carter&#x27;s cousin and bandmate, Sara Carter, in her intricate style. Maybelle Carter is widely credited with the autoharp&#x27;s popularity and it is still played in country and roots music, . The autoharp was Maybelle&#x27;s first instrument. She began tinkering with it as early as the age of four but did not turn a serious focus toward the instrument until around 1940.

Traditionally the autoharp was strummed as a rhythm instrument. Maybelle developed (alone or perhaps independently of other musicians who did the same) a &quot;pinch and pluck&quot; technique that forms the basis of most modern autoharp playing styles. This technique allows for playing melodic lead notes on the instrument. Carter&#x27;s style later evolved to add a fill-in rhythm, similar to her guitar technique. While playing the autoharp, Maybelle would often press cord bars between notes. The effect was a note slurring, a sound similar to a guitar hammer-on. It has been said that pianist Floyd Cramer was especially interested in these embellishments to Maybelle&#x27;s playing and that they helped to shape his piano technique.

As she began to feature the autoharp more and more in concerts and radio work, Carter became frustrated with trying to steady the instrument close enough to a microphone often shared by others. She utilized tables and music stands at first but later got the idea of holding the instrument upside down, across her chest, and playing along what was essentially the head of the harp (nearest the tuning pegs). Before then, musicians played below the cord bars at the opposite end. She discovered this technique allowed more space for her complicated playing style and produced a sweeter tone. During at least one public performance, Maybelle stated that autoharps were manufactured differently to accommodate the playing style she popularized.

Maybelle Carter taught at least one workshop on autoharp playing in conjunction with her various appearances at Newport Folk Festivals. A moderator at the workshop noted that Maybelle should be credited with the first fingerpicked autoharp solo to be captured on commercial recording, referencing &quot;Fair and Tender Ladies&quot; recorded by the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle on Columbia Records about 1950. She often played the autoharp in that group. Other examples include a simplistic but moving solo she added to &quot;Mountain Lady&quot; on the family&#x27;s final album before her death. In addition to recordings with the Carter Sisters, which featured her autoharp playing, Maybelle Carter often featured the instrument in her solo work. On her earliest solo album, she offered an old fiddle tune, &quot;Liberty,&quot; for the session. Later, Smash Records issued an album of autoharp solos by Maybelle Carter, which included a few backing musicians and subtle background vocals by the Stephen Scott Singers. &quot;Green Valley Waltz&quot; and &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; were included along with ten other titles. The bulk of her final solo album (from 1973) was composed of autoharp solos in which a whole band of studio musicians accompanied her.

Mother Maybelle frequently found studio work with other artists to capture the fresh sound she had created. She recorded at least two songs with Johnnie &amp; Jack and at least two with the Wilburn Brothers. The latter collaboration registered a top-ten hit (to which Maybelle Carter was not credited), &quot;Go Away with Me.&quot; She also played autoharp on Carl Smith&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Down South&quot; gospel album. A similar pairing with Flatt &amp; Scruggs led to the &quot;Songs of the Famous Carter Family&quot; album, on which Maybelle contributed mostly through her autoharp playing. In the 1960s, Maybelle helped record an instructional record sold with an autoharp through a mail-order chain store. She contributed a demonstration of the instrument and a small amount of dialogue.

== Singing ==

=== Original Carter Family ===
The moniker &quot;Original Carter Family&quot; predates the original group&#x27;s breakup by several years, being used during their radio programs on Mexican border stations. Other groups used the name &quot;Carter Family,&quot; so adding &quot;Original&quot; helped distinguish the trio. Eventually, the name &quot;Original Carter Family&quot; came to be used to differentiate between the original trio, formed in the 1920s, and later versions of the group, particularly Maybelle and her daughters. Maybelle Carter worked with the Original Carter Family from about 1926 until about 1943 (when the group officially disbanded) on personal appearances, radio shows, and commercial recordings. The group reunited for a performance in May 1953 at the first Jimmie Rodgers Memorial Festival. They sang two songs, with A. P. Carter serving as emcee for their portion of the program. The performance was captured on a home movie camera, but the film deteriorated in storage. An audio recording of the performance does survive. Maybelle sang on two or three of the first six songs recorded by the family in 1927. Initially, her vocal contributions to the group were mostly subdued, but she gradually took on a more prominent role. It became routine for her to harmonize with the whole trio. She and Sara Carter frequently sang duets without A. P.

In 1937, the two recorded a duet on &quot;Hello Stranger,&quot; which featured both voices equally in an unusual call-and-response vocal arrangement. Maybelle sang opening phrases for all verses on the group&#x27;s 1940 recording of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forsake You.&quot; During their final commercial session, Maybelle&#x27;s voice was slightly dominant to Sara&#x27;s on selections such as &quot;Why Do You Cry Little Darling,&quot; &quot;You Tied a Love Knot in My Heart,&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Be Sorry You Let Me Down.&quot; She rarely sing lead for the group on radio shows but sometimes played and sang solos. In the mid-1960s through the early 1970s, Maybelle and Sara would periodically reunite for personal appearances and television work, recording an album for Columbia during this time as well.

=== Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle ===
Following A. P. Carter&#x27;s death in 1960, the group previously known as the &quot;Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle&quot; assumed &quot;Carter Family&quot; as their official band name. Maybelle Carter performed with this group, mostly with her three daughters but in various other versions of the group as well, from the late 1930s and early 1940s almost until she died in 1978. They toured, did many radio programs and TV appearances, and made several commercial recordings together. As the Carter Sisters &amp; Mother Maybelle, the group made their first commercial recordings for RCA Victor in 1949. The sales were better than average but produced no major hits. Those recordings were among the first to be issued in the new 45-rpm single format.

Maybelle sang lead on a number of the RCA recordings, including &quot;My Darling&#x27;s Home at Last,&quot; &quot;Why Do You Weep Dear Willow,&quot; &quot;Walk a Little Closer,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Home Up in Glory.&quot; One of the more popular recordings of that era to feature Maybelle was &quot;Someone&#x27;s Last Day;&quot; on a radio transcription, the emcee notes that &quot;she gets more requests for it than any of them.&quot; By the early 1950s, the group changed labels to Columbia. In that era, Maybelle frequently sang a verse on a song with her daughters singing others. Likely the most popular recording from that era was a single featuring &quot;Fair and Tender Ladies&quot; on one side and &quot;Foggy Mountain Top&quot; on the other.

In the early 1960s, the group featuring Maybelle and her daughters (now called simply the &quot;Carter Family&quot;) moved to the Liberty label, where they had an album and at least one single released. Shortly after, they returned to Columbia, where the group remained under contract throughout Maybelle&#x27;s life. It was on Columbia that almost all the group&#x27;s significantly successful discs were released. Maybelle&#x27;s role as a vocal soloist was diminished during this time, but she did a lot of harmony singing on those recordings. She would periodically sing whole songs or verses within songs. Examples include &quot;Homestead on the Farm,&quot; on the group&#x27;s &quot;The Country Album,&quot; &quot;Picture on the Wall,&quot; from the &quot;Three Generations&quot; collection, and an enduring rendition of &quot;Will the Circle be Unbroken&quot; on their &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; album.

=== Solo career ===
The album &quot;Mother Maybelle Carter&quot; on the Briar label was the first commercial recording to feature Maybelle as a headliner . It was recorded in 1959 but was not released until a couple of years later. Maybelle recruited the help of her daughters Helen and Anita as backing vocalists. Group members often utilized other family members on their various solo recordings. Some singles were released from the album, and a slightly edited version of the album was later released under the title &quot;Queen of the Autoharp&quot; on the Kapp label. That transaction offered a more robust distribution. Maybelle sang several interesting selections, including &quot;Sweeter than the Flowers&quot; and &quot;My Native Home.&quot; Someone suggested adding the Carter Scratch to a reverberating electric guitar on some of the tracks. The strange effect was a &quot;Carter Family beach music&quot; sound. Maybelle filled out the album with other vocal performances and some instrumentals.

In the early to mid-1960s, Maybelle Carter&#x27;s solo work was recorded by Mercury Records and released on its subsidiary labels Smash and Cumberland. There were three albums and at least one non-album single. Representative solo vocals from those recordings include &quot;Faded Coat of Blue,&quot; &quot;Flowers Blooming in the Wildwood,&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Darling on Earth.&quot; A single &quot;Strumming My Guitaro&quot; also featured Maybelle&#x27;s work on a new autoharp-like instrument of the same name. Finally, &quot;Foggy Mountain Top,&quot; an album cut, stands out as being the only commercial recording Maybelle sang with her banjo accompaniment.

By the late 1960s, Maybelle Carter and the entire family had re-signed with Columbia records. Shortly after, the label released another solo album on Maybelle, &quot;Living Legend&quot;. Vocal examples from that album include &quot;Give Me Your Love and I&#x27;ll Give You Mine,&quot; &quot;We All Miss You Joe,&quot; and &quot;A Letter from Home,&quot; One single from the album &quot;I Told them What You Were Fighting For&quot; was a small chart hit. A double album of instrumentals, discussed above, was also released.

=== Collaborations with other artists ===
As part of the Carter Family and a soloist, Maybelle often sang and/or played as a guest on other artists&#x27; recordings. Many times she went uncredited on the label. Likely her most commercially successful venture in this realm was her collaboration on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; from the early 1970s. Maybelle contributed dialogue during the sessions. She also sang lead and played on &quot;Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Wildwood Flower.&quot; On the album&#x27;s title track, she played throughout the song and sang the first solo verse. She received a Grammy nomination and her only gold record for the performances. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 4 on the country charts, and making a respectable showing on the pop charts. It was eventually certified at platinum sales. Maybelle and Johnny Cash released a top 40 single in 1973, &quot;Pick the Wildwood Flower,&quot; which featured her guitar playing and brief dialogue. The single&#x27;s B side, &quot;Diamonds in the Rough,&quot; was a vocal duet accompanied by Maybelle&#x27;s guitar playing.

==Awards, recognition, and legacy==
Her first major award from an organized music body came in 1966 when she was presented with a trophy that read &quot;Mother of Country Music.&quot;

Maybelle Carter was elected with the Original Carter Family to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970. She and Sara Carter became the first female performers to be inducted (simultaneously) into the institution.

Maybelle Carter was nominated at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards (1972) in the category of Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for her collaboration on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken.&quot;

The Carter Family (Maybelle, Helen, June, and Anita) received the &quot;Favorite Country Group&quot; trophy from the American Music Awards in 1973. The following year Maybelle was individually honored with the first Tex Ritter Award by the International Fan Club Organization at Fan Fair in Nashville, TN.

Following Maybelle Carter&#x27;s death, the CBS network aired a television special called &quot;The Unbroken Circle: A Tribute to Maybelle Carter&quot; in 1979. The following year she and her daughters were given the &quot;Gospel Act of the Year&quot; by the Music City News Cover Awards Show. Maybelle received the &quot;Acoustic Pioneer Award&quot; from Frets Magazine in 1986.

By 1992, Carter was inducted into the Autoharp Hall of Fame.

In 1993, her image appeared on a U.S. postage stamp honoring the Carter Family. She would rank No. 8 in &quot;CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot; in 2002. In 2005, she was portrayed by Sandra Ellis Lafferty in the Johnny Cash biographical film &quot;Walk the Line&quot;. Actress Frances Conroy portrayed her in the 2013 TV Movie &quot;Ring of Fire.&quot; Carter has also been depicted in musicals such as &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; and &quot;Wildwood Flowers: The June Carter Story&quot; by actresses and singers such as Joy Lynn White, Gina Stewart, and Teresa Williams.

She was the subject of her granddaughter Carlene Carter&#x27;s 1990 song &quot;Me and the Wildwood Rose.&quot; Her death was the subject of Johnny Cash&#x27;s song &quot;Tears in the Holston River.&quot; Numerous other tribute songs have been written and recorded about Maybelle Carter.

The Original Carter Family (with Maybelle) were inducted into the International Bluegrass Association&#x27;s Hall of Honor in 2001 and were -given a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2005.

In 2007, Carter was honored as one of the Library of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Virginia Women in History&quot; for her musical career.

In 2010, Lipscomb University in Nashville named the stage in Collins Alumni Auditorium after her.

The A. P. and Sara Carter House, A. P. Carter Homeplace, A. P. Carter Store, Maybelle and Ezra Carter House, and Mt. Vernon Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as components of the Carter Family Thematic Resource.

Carter was named the 17th greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2023.

<text>Darl Charles McBride (24 November 195916 September 2024) was an entrepreneur and CEO of Shout TV Inc. McBride was known as the former CEO of The SCO Group. On March 7, 2003, during McBride&#x27;s tenure as CEO of the company, The SCO Group initiated litigation (&quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;) against IBM, alleging breach of contract and copyright infringement claims connected to Unix. SCO Group lost in a series of court battles, and was eventually forced into bankruptcy.

==Early life and education==
McBride graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in sociology and then earned a master&#x27;s degree in industrial relations from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. While at the University of Illinois McBride was awarded a fellowship from IBM.

McBride was fluent in Japanese and spent two years in Japan as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Early career==
From 1988 to 1996, McBride was a manager at Novell, where he managed the business relationship with Novell KK (Japan) and later was promoted to vice president and general manager of the Novell Extended Networks Division for Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST). He later left Novell to become senior vice president of IKON Office Solutions.

IKON fired him in 1998 after his involvement in the execution of 33 business acquisitions. McBride then sued IKON for $10 million, claiming breach of contract, nonpayment of wages, and fraud. IKON counter-sued, and the case was eventually settled.

McBride was subsequently involved in two startups: SBI and Company, a professional services company, which he founded and served as CEO, and later PointServe, a software company of which he was also CEO. He raised venture capital for both of these companies. McBride was the president of Franklin Covey&#x27;s online planning business from August 2000 until a few months prior to joining the SCO Group as CEO.

== Leadership of The SCO Group ==

McBride has been controversial in the information technology industry for his role as the CEO of SCO in asserting broad claims of intellectual property ownership of the various UNIX operating systems derivatives developed by IBM under a license originally granted by AT&amp;T Corporation. Open source, free software and Linux developers and supporters, and the computer industry at large have been outspoken and highly critical and skeptical of McBride and SCO&#x27;s claims in these areas.

Ty Mattingly, a former Novell Executive Vice President and co-worker of McBride was quoted as saying, &quot;Congratulations. In a few short months you&#x27;ve dethroned Bill Gates as the most hated man in the industry.&quot; McBride claimed he received death threats as a result of the SCO-IBM lawsuits, and had a package of worms mailed to his home, prompting him to carry a firearm and to employ multiple bodyguards. During an interview, when asked about the popularity of the lawsuit against IBM, McBride answered: &quot;We&#x27;re either right or we&#x27;re not. If we&#x27;re wrong, we deserve people throwing rocks at us.&quot;

Under McBride&#x27;s leadership, SCO saw a surge in stock price from under $2 in March 2003 to over $20 just six months later. Following several adverse rulings issued by the United States District Court in Utah, SCO&#x27;s stock value dropped to under $1. On April 27, 2007, NASDAQ served notice that the company would be delisted if SCO&#x27;s stock price did not increase above $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive days over the course of 180 business days, ending October 22, 2007.

On August 10, 2007, the United States District Court in Utah issued a ruling that Novell had retained ownership of the System V UNIX copyrights and that SCO was in breach of its covenants to provide Novell with the previously agreed royalties to the Unix technology Novell had originally sold to SCO. Following this ruling, the value of SCO stock fell to just $0.44 per share, a one-day drop of more than 70%. On September 14, 2007, SCO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and by September 18 its share price had reached $0.18 per share.

On December 21, 2007, SCO received a NASDAQ delisting notice and trading was suspended on December 27, 2007. The stock price was $0.12 per share.

One of the reorganization plans put forward by SCO as part of its bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware required McBride to resign from SCO. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between SCO and SNCP (Stephen Norris &amp; Co. Capital Partners) included the note that &quot;upon the effective date of the Proposed Plan of Reorganization, the existing CEO of the Company, Darl McBride, will resign immediately.&quot; The plan called for &quot;a favorable resolution of the Novell/IBM Litigation&quot;. The plan was withdrawn by SCO following objections which highlighted the lack of detail given to the court and other interested parties about the plan.

On October 14, 2009, McBride was terminated as Chief Executive Officer and President of The SCO Group.

==Subsequent career==
On April 9, 2010 McBride purchased the SCO Mobility intellectual property from The SCO Group for $100,000.

The company is now known as Me Inc. and as of June 2011, McBride was president and CEO.

After McBride left SCO, he bought some software in a SCO bankruptcy sale and with it started a company called Shout. It developed a mobile app called SHOUT, a free trivia game that integrated with live sporting events and awarded winners with cash and other prizes. In 2013, the app had a deal with Deron Williams as a celebrity endorser.

==Death==
According to his published obituary, Darl McBride lost his life to ALS complications on Monday, September 16, 2024. He is survived by a wife, seven children, and nine grandchildren.

<text>William Bradford (November 4, 1729 – July 6, 1808) was a physician, lawyer, and politician, serving as United States Senator from Rhode Island and deputy governor of the state.

==Early life and education==

William Bradford was born at Plympton, Massachusetts, to Lt. Samuel Bradford and Sarah Gray. He was a great-great-grandson of the William Bradford who had been Governor of the Plymouth Colony. The younger man first studied medicine at Hingham, Massachusetts, and then practiced at Warren, Rhode Island.

==Career and revolution==

Bradford moved to Mount Hope Farm in Bristol, Rhode Island, where he was elected to the colonial assembly in 1761. He was elected to additional terms at various times up until 1803, and served as Speaker of the Assembly in several terms. He expanded his abilities with the study of law, was admitted to the bar in 1767, and established a practice at Bristol. He served as Deputy Governor of Rhode Island from November 1775 to May 1778. He served as major general in command of the colony&#x27;s militia from June–October 1775 until being relieved by Major General Joshua Babcock. He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1776, but did not attend.

Bradford served on the &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; of Bristol County, Rhode Island, and from 1773 to 1776 on the &quot;Committee of Correspondence&quot; for the Rhode Island colony. When the British Navy bombarded Bristol on October 7, 1775, his home was among the buildings destroyed. He afterward went aboard ship to negotiate a cease fire.

After the United States government was established, Bradford was elected to the United States Senate, taking office on March 4, 1793. He was the President pro tempore of the Senate from July 6, 1797, until he resigned from the Senate in October of that year. He returned to his home in Bristol and died there in 1808. Originally buried in Bristol&#x27;s East Burying Ground, his grave was later moved to the Juniper Hill Cemetery.

==Personal life==
He married and had a family, including daughter Nancy Ann Bradford. In 1790, she married James DeWolf of Bristol, who was a successful slave trader and belonged to a large and influential family that also went into banking and insurance. He was elected to the US Senate in the 1820s. They were the great-great-grandparents of artist and publisher Charles Dana Gibson.

<doc id="232581" wikidata="Q2639150" url="?curid=232581" title="Gambit (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Gambit (Remy Étienne LeBeau) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Jim Lee. Drawn by artist Mike Collins, Gambit made his first appearances in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #14 (July 1990) and &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #266 (August 1990). Belonging to a subspecies of humans called mutants, Gambit can mentally create, control, and manipulate pure kinetic energy. He is also incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in card throwing, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of a bō. Gambit is known to charge playing cards and other objects with kinetic energy, using them as explosive projectiles.

He was part of the Thieves Guild before becoming a member of the X-Men. Given his history, few X-Men trusted Gambit when he joined the group. There was consistently a source of stress between him and his on-again, off-again love interest and eventual wife Rogue. This was exacerbated when Gambit&#x27;s connections to villain Mister Sinister were revealed, although some of his team members accept that Gambit honestly seeks redemption. Often portrayed as a &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;, Gambit has shown a more vulnerable side of himself over the years, especially when it comes to Rogue. Gambit is a Cajun from New Orleans; he is fiercely proud of his heritage and speaks both Cajun English and Louisiana French. His solo series consist of &quot;X-Men: Gambit&quot;, &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Gambit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, while his team series consist of &quot;Gambit &amp; Bishop&quot;, &quot;Wolverine/Gambit&quot;, &quot;Deadpool v. Gambit&quot;, &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot;, and &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot;.

Gambit made his live-action debut in the 2009 film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, portrayed by Taylor Kitsch. Channing Tatum was attached to star in a solo Gambit film, which remained in development hell for five years and was cancelled upon the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. Tatum ultimately portrayed the character in the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
Gambit was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Jim Lee. The character was introduced in-story in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #266 (Aug. 1990), which was written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Mike Collins. His next in-story appearance was intended to be in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #14 (July 1990), but that book was published three weeks early by mistake, before issue #266 was published. Because the story in the annual is set after the story in #266, there is some debate about which issue is the &quot;true&quot; first appearance of the character. Gambit joined the X-Men and appeared in almost every issue until &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #281 before moving to the &quot;X-Men&quot; title for a number of years. When Storm created a splinter group to hunt for Destiny&#x27;s diaries in the pages of &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, Gambit joined her in issue #5 and co-starred for the remainder of the series.

Gambit has starred or co-starred in four mini-series:

* &quot;Gambit&quot; Volume One (1993) and &quot;Gambit&quot; Volume Two (1997) explored the character&#x27;s mysterious past and his ties to the New Orleans Thieves&#x27; Guild.
* &quot;Wolverine/Gambit: Victims&quot; (1995) teamed the two popular X-Men on a mystery involving what appears to be a modern-day Jack the Ripper.
* &quot;Gambit &amp; Bishop: Sons of the Atom&quot; (2001) was advertised as a sequel to the character&#x27;s first series and involves the two X-Men in Stryfe&#x27;s return.

Gambit has starred in three ongoing series. The first, &quot;X-Men: Gambit&quot;, which lasted 25 issues and two annuals, ran from December 1998 to February 2001. The second, &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Gambit&quot;, lasted 12 issues and ran from November 2004 to August 2005. The third series, &quot;&quot;, lasted 17 issues, from August 2012 to September 2013.

Additionally, &quot;Gambit &amp; the X-Ternals&quot;, published in 1995, featured a group of renegade mutants led by Gambit who has been living on the edge of law during the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline. In 2009, Gambit&#x27;s past was explored in the one-shot &quot;X-Men Origins: Gambit&quot;. In 2010, the one-shot &quot;Curse of the Mutants: Storm &amp; Gambit&quot; was released. In June 2011, he began co-starring in &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;.

It was announced at the C2E2 convention by Marvel Comics that in August 2012 Gambit gets his own solo series that takes him back to his roots as a charismatic, cool, mutant master thief, written by James Asmus and drawn by Clay Mann. When asked about the upcoming series Asmus was quoted saying &quot;This book focuses on the two most important aspects of Gambit: #1 that he&#x27;s sexy, and #2 that he&#x27;s the preeminent bad-ass thief of the Marvel Universe.&quot; Marvel canceled the series at issue #17.

Gambit was one of the principal characters in the 2013 series &quot;All-New X-Factor&quot; written by Peter David and drawn by Carmine Di Giandomenico. The series was cancelled after issue #20, with David suggesting it would be some time before Marvel would consider featuring Gambit in a leading role again due to a persistently low sales record in this and previous titles.

In October 2017, Gambit co-starred in his own comic with his love interest Rogue titled &quot;Rogue and Gambit&quot;, which was released in 2018.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Remy Étienne LeBeau was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was kidnapped from the hospital where he was born, then raised by the LeBeau Clan Thieves Guild led by Jean-Luc LeBeau and given to the Antiquary as a tribute.

They referred to the child as &quot;Le Diable Blanc&quot; (&quot;the White Devil&quot;) and believed he was prophesied to unite the warring Thieves Guild and Assassins Guild. Soon after, Remy was placed in the care of Fagan&#x27;s Mob, a gang of street thieves who raised the child and taught him the ways of thievery. After living as an orphan on the streets, a 10-year-old Remy attempted to pick the pocket of Jean-Luc LeBeau, then patriarch of the Thieves&#x27; Guild. Jean-Luc took the boy off the streets and adopted him into his own family.

Remy&#x27;s bio-kinetic charging abilities manifested early in his teens, although he kept his powers secret from his family and friends, practicing his powers away from prying eyes. When he was 15, he accompanied his cousin Étienne Marceaux on his &quot;Tithing&quot;, the ritual initiation test of the Thieves&#x27; Guild. However, it went awry as they were assigned to steal from the powerful immortal mutant Candra, who quickly captured them. Candra recognized Remy from an encounter that had taken place in her past but in his future (due to a time travel mission to the 19th Century that Remy would take as an adult) and sold them to the deformed mutant gangster and child slave trader known as the Pig, who planned to sell them and others their age to HYDRA as boy soldiers. Remy used his powers to escape their holding pen, but the physically enhanced Pig quickly caught up to them. Remy discovered his signature attack when he picked up a playing card that Étienne had dropped, charged it, and threw it in the Pig&#x27;s face, taking out his eye. Finally escaping his clifftop headquarters by diving into the sea, Remy was ultimately rescued by the Guild; Étienne drowned.

Later during his teen years, Remy was first hired by Mister Sinister, then in the disguise of Dr. Nathaniel Essex. Essex wanted his stolen diaries back from the Weapon X program. Remy and the Thieves&#x27; Guild accepted the mission and sent out Remy to retrieve said diaries. Standing in the cold, scouting the Weapon X facility, Remy could not bear the cold and swore he would steal a long, stylish jacket in New Orleans after the mission, which he did. Upon entering the facility, Remy witnessed Wolverine escaping from his adamantium procedure and found the diaries. However, deeming them to be too dangerous for Essex to have, as Remy did not fully trust him, Remy burned the diaries. He headed back home, only to find a disappointed Thieves&#x27; Guild and Essex.

In an attempt to reconcile the Thieves&#x27; and Assassins&#x27; Guilds, Remy married Bella Donna Boudreaux, granddaughter of the head Assassin, whom he met at the age of eight. Unfortunately, he was challenged by her brother Julien to a duel after the wedding. In the duel, Gambit killed Julien, and he was exiled from the city, ending his romantic relationship with Bella Donna.

===The Mutant Massacre===
After his exile from New Orleans, he wandered the world and became a master professional thief, making many contacts (and quite a few enemies). During this period, Gambit found he had an uncontrollable amount of energy flowing through him, to the point that he could not withstand it. Desperate, Gambit went to Mister Sinister for help. Sinister modified Gambit&#x27;s power by removing a portion of Gambit&#x27;s brain stem, making him significantly less powerful, but able to control the still considerably large amount of power in him. Years later, a much younger version of Mister Sinister surgically returned it, upon Gambit&#x27;s request, when Gambit time-traveled to the 19th century.

However, Sinister wanted the favor returned, so Gambit carried out various missions for him. For the last of these operations, Gambit gathered together a group of mercenaries which Sinister named the Marauders. Mister Sinister then ordered Gambit to lead Sabretooth, Blockbuster, Prism, and Riptide into the tunnels under New York City — while unknown to Gambit however — Mister Sinister had also ordered Scalphunter, Arclight, Harpoon, Malice, Scrambler and Vertigo into the tunnels. The group of Scalphunter followed the Morlock Tommy and their goal was to wipe out the Morlocks. Gambit was unable to prevent the Marauders from killing a considerable number of Morlocks, but he was able to save a single child named Sarah, who would grow up to be Marrow, the leader of the mutant terrorist group Gene Nation. Gambit long kept his involvement with Mister Sinister and his mission in the massacre a secret from his fellow X-Men, much to their eventual displeasure.

===X-Men===
After wandering around the world, he encountered a de-aged and powerless Storm, and helped her escape from the Shadow King. He then rescued her from Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, helping her battle them. Afterwards, the young amnesiac Storm, who had reverted to thieving to stay alive, joined Gambit, and she eventually brought him back to the X-Men. Soon after, Gambit helped the X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants battle the Genoshans. Only Wolverine expressed his doubts about the Cajun, which led to a Danger Room duel between the two. Gambit was able to triumph by using a robotic doppelganger of Lady Deathstrike to distract Wolverine while taking advantage of Wolverine&#x27;s injuries, inflicted by the Reavers. Gambit and the X-Men were then taken to the Shi&#x27;ar galaxy by Lila Cheney. Alongside the X-Men and Starjammers, Gambit battled Deathbird, the Imperial Guard, and a band of Warskrulls. Upon their return to Earth, Gambit assisted the X-Men and X-Factor in battling the Shadow King, though he was temporarily controlled by the Shadow King.

When the original five X-Men rejoined and the team was divided into two squads, Gambit became part of the Blue team under Cyclops&#x27; leadership. Alongside the X-Men, he battled Magneto and his newly formed Acolytes, Fenris, the Hand, Omega Red, and Sabretooth, and then Mojo. Gambit then fought Bishop and was attacked by his estranged wife Bella Donna. Gambit recounted how he had fled from New Orleans after killing his brother-in-law in self-defense. Alongside the X-Men, Gambit first encountered the second Ghost Rider. Gambit battled the Brood Queen and the Brood-possessed Ghost Rider and witnessed the apparent death of his now ex-wife, Bella Donna.

Gambit became romantically interested in one of his teammates, Rogue, and started flirting with her. Despite her off-putting manner and the obstacle of her uncontrollable mutant ability that prevented anyone from touching her, he began romancing and seducing Rogue. Their strong romantic relationship was originally written as a one-time, flirtatious moment; ironically, their romantic relationship is listed as one of the longest and most popular ongoing deep and close romantic relationships in the X-Men series, probably only second to Jean Grey and Cyclops. Although their early &quot;courtship&quot; portrayed him as very &quot;devil may care&quot; in his flirtation with her, later issues revealed that, beneath his bravado and swagger, he truly had genuine romantic feelings for her. Similarly, despite her initial aggressive rejection of his advances, Rogue found that she was not only flattered by his attention but that she felt equally romantically attracted to him.

Many publishing years later, it had become apparent Remy had a dark secret. Sabretooth had hinted to it on numerous occasions during his &quot;residency&quot; at the X-Mansion, prompting Rogue to ask him to reveal whatever he knew about Gambit&#x27;s past. Remy was captured and brought before a mock trial held by Magneto, the mutant Master of Magnetism, disguised as Erik the Red. Rogue was forced to kiss him again, revealing that he had gathered information on the Morlocks and assembled the team of Marauders for Mr. Sinister who did not inform Remy of his ultimate intent for the mutant tribe. When the Marauders later began killing most of the Morlocks, it was revealed that Gambit saved a single girl from the Marauders during the massacre. This apparent revelation and absorbing Gambit&#x27;s own guilty memories caused Rogue to reject him. Gambit was similarly cast out of the X-Men and was abandoned in the frozen wastes of Antarctica.

Starving, and haunted by the betrayal of his lover, Gambit made his way back into Magneto&#x27;s citadel, where he encountered the psionic essence of a dead mutant named Mary Purcell. The wraith-like Mary bonded with him, allowing him to survive until he reached the Savage Land, a hidden jungle nestled in the icy wasteland. There, Remy struck a deal with an enigmatic being known as the New Son. In exchange for passage back to America, Gambit agreed to run errands with the help of shapeshifting best friend Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Gavin Jr. / Courier. During this period, Remy&#x27;s command over his abilities strengthened and amplified significantly, although his actions lead to Courier being trapped in the body of a woman by Mister Sinister.

When Gambit&#x27;s psyche absorption had worn off, Rogue spent months searching for him, to no avail. Gambit encountered Storm and Shadowcat when he attempted to steal the fabled Crimson Gem of Cyttorak for his new employer. He agreed to return to the X-Men, mainly for his self-respect and for Rogue. At one point, he became the field leader of a branch of X-Men. His romantic love for Rogue was still intact, but her inability to control her powers made her break it off out of fear of hurting him.

Meanwhile, the New Son revealed his true identity as an alternate universe version of Gambit himself, after organizing an assassination game for a cadre of superpowered mercenaries with Remy as the target. During the final confrontation, Gambit burned out his enhanced abilities, thus returning to his original level of power. Courier asks if Gambit will miss being so powerful, asking what Gambit wants, before Gambit suddenly kisses him, saying he wants to keep everyone on their toes.

===Bishop&#x27;s future===
In Bishop&#x27;s future timeline, Bishop stumbles upon a video from the past with Jean Grey making a frantic call to any X-Men she can find. She says that the X-Men have been betrayed by &quot;one of their own&quot; and it appears in the video that she is the last one left and is killed in the video. Disturbed by this, Bishop seeks &quot;The Witness&quot;, a man who is said to be the last person who has ever seen the X-Men of the past alive. He enters a citadel of sorts where he confronts an old and withered but plucky man with long gray hair sitting on a throne, with two blonde women to either side of him. When Bishop confronts him as to who killed the X-Men the Witness acts as though he knows but refuses to tell and Bishop is thrown out of the citadel.

When Bishop comes to the X-Men in their original timeline, he meets Gambit and is sure that he is the same old man in Bishop&#x27;s future and that it was Gambit who was the &quot;Traitor&quot; who killed the X-Men. For some time, he continues to watch Gambit&#x27;s every step until he is finally convinced sometime later that Gambit is not the Traitor (with Onslaught being revealed to be the traitor). The reason behind Gambit being called the Witness in Bishop&#x27;s timeline has not been revealed. In the Messiah Complex, it was revealed that the Witness was killed by the Marauders in their efforts to destroy anyone with knowledge of the future.

===2000s===
====X-Treme X-Men: XSE====
When Storm leads a team of X-Men in search of Destiny&#x27;s diaries, the thirteen-volume Books of Truth, Gambit volunteered to join them, but Rogue — afraid that her increasingly uncontrolled powers would bring him harm — flatly refused to allow him along. He returned to thievery instead and was soon after framed by mutant businessman Sebastian Shaw for the death of the Australian crime lord named Viceroy. With the assistance of Rogue, Storm&#x27;s team of X-Treme X-Men, and former Triad member Red Lotus, Gambit was able to clear his name. Soon after, Remy was captured and his powers were used to open a portal intended for an alien invasion of Earth led by the interdimensional warlord Khan.

The X-Treme team&#x27;s enemy, the enhanced human named Vargas, used the invasion as a chance to attempt to kill more of Storm&#x27;s team, particularly Rogue who was depicted by Destiny as slaying him. Rogue&#x27;s attempt at rescuing and shielding Gambit got her stuck and Vargas used the opportunity to impale them both. Gambit was seriously wounded, but Beast&#x27;s surgical skills and Rogue&#x27;s pleading with Gambit on the astral plane, resulted in both surviving their ordeal. As they lost their mutant powers, they decided to sort out their romantic relationship by retiring from the X-Men temporarily and moving to California.

Although he is powerless, Gambit later joins Storm in infiltrating the US President&#x27;s Texan ranch for obtaining information on a closed-group meeting proposing worldwide policies on mutants.

====Rejoining the team====
Gambit and Rogue rejoined the X-Men soon after Sage jump-started their powers, and they were placed on Havok&#x27;s team. In their first mission back, Gambit was temporarily blinded by one of his energized cards that went off by his face. Rogue tried to console Gambit during his recovery, but their romantic relationship became strained once more as he became more and more frustrated with his blindness and their lack of touch after Rogue&#x27;s powers returned. He started lashing out at Rogue, most of the time verbally. As a result, Rogue took some time away from Gambit. While he lost his vision, Gambit developed an ability to read his playing cards like they were tarot cards and he was able to predict the attack by the Brotherhood. A little while later, during Christmas celebrations, Rogue asked Sage to once again jumpstart Gambit&#x27;s powers, in the process, healing his vision.

During the story arc with Golgotha, Gambit revealed some deep insecurities he had about his romantic relationship with Rogue, saying that &quot;Maybe dis no-touching thing is getting to me... more den I thought&quot;. He also told Rogue that she should just get together with Logan, thinking that there was a hidden attraction between the two. As a result of the accusation, Logan kissed Rogue, but she broke it off before it caused any major damage. Gambit then began to realize what he was saying, questioning his romantic love for Rogue, but soon after began to suffer from hallucinations that he was fighting Mister Sinister. However, Rogue and Gambit soon realized that Golgotha made them say things they did not mean and before the final battle, they &quot;kissed&quot; through their spacesuit helmets.

Once back at the mansion, Gambit and Rogue moved into the same room to try rebuilding some intimacy and began telepathic therapy with Emma Frost. They soon found out that with all the emotional baggage going on in their minds, they were still unable to make physical contact mentally. This would cause even more strain when the new student, Foxx, joins Gambit&#x27;s team and attempts to seduce him.

====Horseman of Apocalypse====

Rogue&#x27;s foster mother Mystique was displeased with Rogue&#x27;s choice of lovers and infiltrated Xavier&#x27;s Institute by shapeshifting into a student called Foxx. She joined Gambit&#x27;s squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue. After Gambit resisted her charms, Mystique reverted to her true form and then offered Gambit something significantly more difficult to refuse: she transformed into Rogue and offered Gambit a Rogue with whom he could have a physical relationship, claiming that she was only trying to help relieve the increasing frustrations between the two lovers; &quot;... if one of you could have some physical release...&quot;. Rogue eventually discovered her mother&#x27;s presence in the school and that Gambit knew she was there. Gambit denies that he slept with Mystique.

Upon the return of Apocalypse, Gambit submitted himself to the villain and was transformed into one of Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen, Death. Gambit intended to infiltrate himself into Apocalypse&#x27;s ranks in order to protect the X-Men from the Dark Lord&#x27;s eventual betrayal, but he miscalculated, as the transformation process warped his mind as well as his body. After becoming Death, Gambit&#x27;s hair turned white and his skin turned deep black. Despite having his mind and body twisted, Gambit retained a large portion of his former self, stating to Apocalypse, &quot;I&#x27;m both Death and Gambit&quot;, and he also remembered his love for Rogue as he could not bring himself to kill her. Gambit and Sunfire then returned to the Xavier Institute to claim Polaris. Gambit, in an attempt to free all ties with his old self, tried to kill Rogue and would have been successful had it not been for Pulse neutralizing Gambit&#x27;s powers. After the X-Men defeated Apocalypse, Sunfire left with Gambit to help him clear Apocalypse&#x27;s brainwashing and live as entirely new beings, only to then be approached by Mister Sinister.

====Marauders====
Gambit returned to his original appearance and powers (presumably with the aid of Mr. Sinister) and reemerged as a member of the Marauders. On a mission for Mr. Sinister (involving obtaining knowledge of the future) Gambit and Sunfire encountered Cable on the recently evacuated island of Providence. Before the fight Gambit said, &quot;I dropped that whole new look, wit&#x27; the help of a friend.&quot; He then asked Cable to use his super-computer to answer a question referring to the phrase &quot;one minute before dawn&quot;, which tied into the then-upcoming Messiah Complex storyline. As a result, Gambit and Sunfire attacked him eventually forcing Cable to activate a self-destruct sequence destroying the entire island. Gambit and Sunfire escaped empty-handed.

During the fight, Cable noted that Gambit&#x27;s accent sounded &#x27;forced&#x27; either for comic effect or perhaps to indicate that things may not be as &#x27;back to normal&#x27; as they seem with Gambit. As Gambit returned to Mr. Sinister&#x27;s base to discuss the next step of the plan, he reprimanded Mystique for shooting Rogue when they abducted her, being placated only by Mr. Sinister&#x27;s assurance that Rogue was still needed and would survive. In a recent confrontation with Cannonball and Iceman, he seemed to sympathize with a beaten Cannonball. He interfered when Scalphunter was about to kill Cannonball by attacking Cannonball and by his actions he was able to save Cannonball from certain death. At the same time, he also destroyed Destiny&#x27;s diaries, preventing Sinister and the Marauders from getting them.

====Messiah Complex====
During the 2007–2008 &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, Gambit is personally targeted by Wolverine during the X-Men&#x27;s assault on Mister Sinister&#x27;s Antarctic base. After being tortured by the Canadian mutant, Gambit reveals that Cable has the baby before Sinister manages to regain the advantage and drive the X-Men off with Gambit later revealed not to be harmed. Later, as Bishop attempts to kill the baby (after immobilizing Cable), Gambit and several of the Marauders quickly stop him with Gambit bringing a section of the ceiling down on Bishop. Knowing the X-Men will arrive in moments, the Marauders depart with the baby, but not before Gambit ponders what could make Bishop turn on the X-Men.

Tracking Gambit using Cerebro, the X-Men find that the Marauders&#x27; hideout was on Muir Island. However, what they did not know is that Gambit let them track him. It appears that Gambit, along with Mystique, has plans of their own for the newborn mutant as evidenced by his lack of surprise when he delivers the baby to Sinister, who then reveals himself to be Mystique as the real Sinister lies on the floor with shock etched into his face, and the fact that Mystique told Gambit that it is time for the next step.

A flashback sequence shows that Mystique used Rogue&#x27;s intensified powers to kill Sinister. In the present, she explains that everything she and Gambit have done has led to this moment as foretold by Destiny. Mystique touches the baby&#x27;s face to Rogue&#x27;s in the hope of sacrificing the child to save her. After an energy burst Gambit snatches the baby, saying that Rogue would never want an innocent life used to save hers. However, the child was unharmed by Rogue&#x27;s touch. Gambit gives the baby to Xavier and says he wishes to stay with Rogue. Shortly after, Rogue awakens and tries to kill Mystique. However, somehow the baby cures her of her intensified powers, as well as any psyches she had ever absorbed; this leaves her with the psyche of only one other individual: Mystique. She tells Gambit she needs time alone and if he still cares for her, he would not follow.

====&quot;Divided We Stand&quot;====

In the 2008 &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; storyline, Gambit, received news that the Assassins Guild of New Orleans was approached to kill Charles Xavier, goes to track Xavier down and save him from possible danger. He manages to head off Xavier&#x27;s attackers, defeating them in short order before he is joined by Xavier himself. They determine who the Assassins were supposed to kill next from a list Gambit pulls from one of the goons, which includes Juggernaut, Sebastian Shaw, and Carter Ryking (Hazard). Xavier makes the connection between himself, Ryking, and Juggernaut, but is at a loss with Shaw. They go to see Ryking, who is being held in a mental institution, only to find out that he had just died of a brain hemorrhage the night before.

Gambit and Xavier then drive out to the Nuclear Research Facility at Alamogordo, the place where the fathers of Xavier, Juggernaut, and Ryking all worked at some point in their lives and is most likely where Mister Sinister was running his genetic operations on the X-gene. However, Xavier begins to suffer terrible headaches, and he and Gambit decide to wait it out in the desert for a few hours, where they are once again attacked by the Assassins Guild.

Charles Xavier is abducted and taken to the Almagordo facility, where it is revealed that the employer of the assassins was Amanda Mueller, the head of the Black Womb Project, a former lover and protégée of Mister Sinister (as well as direct ancestress of the Summers&#x27; line), who plans to use Charles to activate Sinister&#x27;s Cronus machine, so as to be able to revive herself with Essex&#x27;s own superpowered essence. Meanwhile, Gambit manages to defeat the rest of the assassins with the assistance of Sebastian Shaw, and they form a temporary alliance of convenience to destroy the Cronus machine, which threatens Shaw as well, and rescue Xavier. They ultimately manage to succeed with a desperate last-minute life-or-death gamble when Gambit directly charges Shaw with biokinetic energy, giving him enough power to utterly shatter the otherwise indestructible machine.

He begins searching Australia for Rogue and is again in the company of Professor Xavier. Gambit, however, is unsure of this venture, mainly because of Rogue&#x27;s request that she be left alone. He and Xavier both agreed that if Rogue did not wish for their help or presence, they would do as she wished and leave her be.

When Gambit and Xavier make it over the plains, they find a completely mismatched landscape. Fearing it is Rogue&#x27;s doing, they go in and find various parts of Rogue&#x27;s past being projected around them, including her fight against Nimrod and being captured and beaten at Genosha. Gambit finds it hard to control his emotions seeing Rogue in so much pain, but Xavier reminds him that none of it is real. While in the Genosha prison cells, Gambit and Xavier find the Shi&#x27;ar parts hunters and they are told what is happening. They discover that Danger is the one causing the projections and is using Rogue&#x27;s input from Danger Room sessions. Xavier decides it is better to find Danger first, concluding that Danger is trying to push Rogue to some sort of realization.

Eventually, Xavier, Gambit, and a group of Shi&#x27;ar pirates managed to shut down Danger. However, the Professor reactivates her and she defeats the pirates in turn when they attack Gambit and Xavier. After this, it is revealed that Rogue&#x27;s powers never truly developed past their initial &quot;nascent&quot; stage, which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly. The Professor, now aware of this fact, uses his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue&#x27;s powers from developing as well as removing the mental echo of Mystique. Finally Rogue kisses Gambit, with no ill side effects, revealing that she is in control of her absorption power.

===Utopia===
Gambit along with Rogue and Danger decides to go to San Francisco in order to regroup with the other X-Men. On their way there they are intercepted by Pixie who teleports them into the city which is in a state of chaos due to the anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements. Cyclops sends all three out in order to locate several missing students and bring them home. Gambit locates Trance, Dragoness, and Toad who is being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Ariel and Onyxx appear and take Trance away for safety.

Later on he encounters Erg and Avalanche who attack Ares. Gambit intervenes only to end up being swatted aside by Ares. Danger and Rogue come to his aid which eventually leads to Rogue absorbing Ares&#x27;s powers. Gambit then blasts him unconscious. Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares&#x27;s power, Rogue easily dispatches a small group of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents and proceeds to steal their tank, along with Gambit and Danger, in order to find the rest of the students and Trance who did not make it back to base. Trance appears to be lost in the city and under the attack of Ms. Marvel from the Dark Avengers team. Gambit, Rogue and Danger team-up to defeat the powerful female warrior, and Rogue eventually manages to calm Trance down. Remy, Rogue, and Danger then depart back to the X-Men&#x27;s base.

After the battle between the X-Men and the Dark Avengers is over, Cyclops orders Gambit to destroy the Omega Machine chair that Osborn had built to neutralize mutant powers. Gambit makes his way into the H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters. There, he fights H.A.M.M.E.R.&#x27;s mutate guards Hijack and Input. Hijack is easily defeated, however, Input is another story. The input uses his telepathic abilities to enter Gambit&#x27;s head and discovers there are still leftovers from Remy&#x27;s &quot;Death&quot; persona. Death re-emerges and defeats Input, and absorbs him into a playing card, which turns black upon doing so. Afterward, Remy somehow returns to normal, with a smile on his face. Gambit then completes his mission, destroys the chair, and returns to the X-Men. When he made it back to Utopia, Gambit got angry at Cyclops for letting Rogue go up against the villain Emplate all alone. Remy tried to argue with Cyclops, but suddenly got trouble with mood swings and left the group. He changed back into his Death persona and remembered how Apocalypse told him he would never be the same after undergoing the changing process. Gambit manages to calm himself down and transform back to his normal self, but he is worried about his condition.

===2010s===
In the 2010 &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot; storyline, Gambit, along with Dazzler, Anole, Northstar, Cannonball, Pixie and Trance travel to Limbo to rescue Magik. Things go wrong when the ground starts to tremble and an army of monstrous demons attack the team. Dazzler calls upon Gambit for help during the attack, but Gambit sinks into the darkness, claiming &quot;Remy&#x27;s not home right now&quot; leading the X-Men to be overwhelmed by the demons and Gambit transforming into his Death persona. As Death, Gambit was able to transform two of his teammates, Dazzler and Northstar, into beings like himself by hitting them with his charged cards. After battling Cannonball, Death-Gambit was stabbed by Magik and Pixie with their magical swords enabling Gambit to reassert control over his form once more.

In the 2010–2011 &quot;Curse of the Mutants&quot; storyline in the &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 3, Gambit and Storm were called upon to help steal the decapitated body of Dracula for the X-Men to resurrect Dracula in their fight against his son, Xarus. He continues to appear as a member of the team as a regular of the series, and also co-stars with X-23 in her self-titled series. He saves her from a burning building after she has been sent away following the events of Second Coming. She decides to pursue a quest to further discover her past when Gambit decides to follow along to keep an eye on her. After 17 issues of traveling the world together Gambit and X-23 part ways, as Gambit decides to stay at the newly built Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, while X-23 travels to the Avengers Academy.

In 2012, writer James Asmus had intended to reimagine the character as bisexual, but &quot;word came down we would not be redefining the character as such&quot;.

After the events of the Age of X, Gambit chooses not to wipe his memory. He admits the extent of his feelings to Rogue and tells her that he cannot tolerate her indecisiveness. He decides that they should be apart until she is willing to be with him for good. Gambit later joins the team of Legion, Rogue, Magneto, Frenzy, and Xavier, in search of Legion&#x27;s lost personalities that would not cooperate with him after his troubles in the Age of X. Later on in the series, Gambit, Frenzy and Rogue travel to the Jean Grey High School of Higher Learning to become teachers and mentors of the school. Gambit&#x27;s role at the school is as a senior staff member.

In &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #48, Gambit becomes one of the principal members of a new team of X-Men, composed of Wolverine, Iceman, Northstar, Karma, Cecilia Reyes, and Warbird.

Gambit joins the newest incarnation of X-Factor. This version is a corporate superhero team sponsored by Serval Industries, which partners him with Polaris and Quicksilver.

Kitty Pryde sends Gambit and Rogue on an undercover mission to the island Paraiso. Their mission, as an estranged couple requiring relationship therapy, was to investigate the disappearance of mutants. This results not only in them confronting their past, emotions, and relationship challenges but also in finding that their memories and powers (as well as those of the missing mutants) are drained into their clones by a mutant called Lavish. Although they are severely weak, they fight against Lavish and the clones, restoring their memories and powers. The couple later decides to learn from their past mistakes and reunite. A conversation with Storm and Nightcrawler spurs him into proposing to Rogue at Kitty&#x27;s and Colossus&#x27; cancelled wedding and to take advantage of all their friends being present. They are married by the rabbi who was present for officiating Kitty&#x27;s wedding, with Nightcrawler and Iceman as Rogue&#x27;s bridal party and with Storm and X-23 as Gambit&#x27;s best women.

While in space, their honeymoon is interrupted when they receive a message from Kitty Pryde about a secret package that they must find, however, the unknown package involves the Shi&#x27;ar Empire and several others are after it as well. They soon discover that the package is actually Xandra, who is the bio-engineered daughter of Xavier and Lilandra who can take any form at will. The newlyweds are soon caught by the Shi&#x27;ar but are able to free themselves, with the help of Cerise and the Starjammers they escape. Having read Rogue&#x27;s mind, Xandra offers to fix her abilities so she can touch anyone, however, Rogue refuses, when Gambit questions her, she explains that the last time it happens, she never learned to control it herself. The ground is interrupted by the Imperial Guard and by Deathbird and a fight ensues. Realizing they are losing the fight, Xandra uses her abilities to make everything think she and Rogue were killed after the Imperial Guard and Deathbird leave, they return, only to have Rogue&#x27;s ability become uncontrollable as she can now absorb memories without touching anyone. Xandra explains that her powers have evolved, Rogue will have to learn to control them on her own, Gambit and Rogue return to Earth.

Gambit and Rogue receive a mysterious gift, when they open it they are teleported into the Mojoverse. Mojo resets their lives by putting them in a Noir setting, however, due to Rogue&#x27;s abilities she becomes self-aware, her abilities become unstable and ends up killing Remy in the process. This forces Mojo to constantly reset their lives to Fantasy, Western, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, and Comedy. During a reality talk show, Gambit walks off and into a bar where he meets a mysterious woman who turns out to be Spiral. She restores his memory and makes Gambit an offer that if he steals something for her she will help Rogue with her powers and help them escape. Spiral meets Rogue in her mind where she explains to her that until she becomes self-aware of what her abilities should be doing, Rogue is subconsciously controlling her powers.

== Characterization ==
Gambit first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #266 in 1990 and quickly became a fan favorite during the X-Men&#x27;s rise in the 1990s. He was characterized as an edgy, ladies&#x27; man with a mysterious past, drawing comparisons to Wolverine, a factor that was noted to have contributed to his appeal. His flirtatious, enigmatic nature, along with his smoking habit, reinforced his rebellious image, aligning him with the &quot;bad boy&quot; archetype that was prevalent during the era. Like many characters from the 90s, Gambit was brash and often broke the rules, reminiscent of Wolverine, who was a mouthy loner that resonated with readers. While Wolverine was serious and tough, Gambit was presented as charming and unpredictable, adding a dynamic flair to the team. His cocky, self-assured attitude often led him to drift away from the X-Men, returning to his life as a thief and con man. However, he would inevitably come back to the team.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that Gambit is a symbolized &quot;90s cool,&quot; with his trench coat, Cajun slang, and &quot;goofy powers&quot; like &quot;hypnotic charm.&quot; However, they argue that Gambit stands out because he’s not dark or gritty—he&#x27;s fun and playful. His explosive playing cards fit his &quot;Sly Wink&quot; personality, and &quot;EW&quot; suggests a Gambit movie should be like &quot;Rounders&quot; with explosions. In the early 2000s, Marvel&#x27;s new editor-in-chief, Joe Quesada, mandated that all characters quit smoking. This affected Gambit, as smoking was part of his rebellious image. His character then evolved from a reckless to a more responsible team player.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Gambit is a mutant with the ability to convert the potential energy stored in an inanimate object into pure light kinetic energy, thus &quot;charging&quot; that item with highly explosive results. He prefers to charge smaller objects, such as his ever-present playing cards, as the time required to charge them is greatly reduced and they are much easier for him to throw. The only real limitation to this ability is time: the larger it is, the longer it takes to charge. Most charging takes place through direct skin contact. The power of his explosions is dependent on the mass of the object he is charging: for example, a charged playing card explodes with the force of a grenade. Gambit can also use his mutant abilities to accelerate an object&#x27;s kinetic energy instead of converting its potential energy; if charged, his Bo staff has been depicted with enough power to level a house.

Gambit&#x27;s ability to tap into kinetic energy also grants him incredible superhuman physical attributes (speed, reflexes and reactions, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance, as well as enhanced, but not superhuman strength), as his body constantly generates bio-kinetic energy and so is perfectly constructed for constant motion. This gives him an added edge that he has used to his advantage by developing a unique acrobatic fighting style.

The charged potential energy always in his body grants him a build up of static electricity, which shields his mind from detection and intrusion from the strongest telepaths such as Emma Frost, Jean Grey, and even Charles Xavier. The shield has the added effect of destabilizing touch-based abilities.

Gambit also possesses an unusually strong and irresistible hypnotic charm that allows him to exert a subtle influence over sentient beings, leading them to believe what he says and agree with his suggestions. This characteristic is so powerful that when given the chance, Gambit has even convinced the Shadow King himself. The hypnotic charm does not work on those who are aware and prepared for it.

During combat, Gambit customarily wears a suit of highly articulated light body armor and uses an extendable metal staff. He is extensively trained in martial arts, particularly Savate and the staff style art Bōjutsu. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, applying street-fighting techniques and acrobatics. Gambit is a skilled card-thrower, so he throws his charged playing cards at opponents with great accuracy. He also excels in all aspects of thievery, as he was adopted by the patriarch of a Thieves Guild.

Gambit was temporarily given the full strength and potential of his mutant abilities to battle his counterpart, New Son. At his full strength and power, Gambit can control all aspects of kinetic energy down even to the molecular level, allowing him to manipulate the potency of his bio-kinetic energy to burn, cause molecular discomfort, incinerate, create timed detonations (and manipulate the potency of the energy release), fire energy blasts, defy gravity, heal wounds, charge objects within his line of sight without contact, manipulate the flow of time &amp; space and effectively exist as an energy being. Under such conditions, he holds sufficient power to cause another being to be unable to move—or unable to stop if in motion, by arresting the flow of their kinetic energy. He has been able to cause or simulate various energies by manipulating the kinetic energy present, such as infrared and microwaves, by increasing molecular agitation, or cold by reducing it. He was also able to use his powers to travel through space-time, cross dimensions, and remake realities outside of space-time by transforming himself into living energy which joined with the kinetic flow. Finally, Gambit was able to heal himself by stimulating his cellular activity. These enhanced powers were burnt out after fighting New Son, and Gambit has since returned to his original, somewhat lower power levels.

However, after Sage jump-started his powers again, he was able to heal his blinded eyes. —thus implying he is again able to heal himself—and is also able again to charge living things with energy, as when he teamed up with Sebastian Shaw to destroy Mr. Sinister&#x27;s machines. He was also given another boost when he was killed in an altercation with a drug lord and Faiza Hussain managed to restore him before it set in, enabling him to charge a bullet with twice as much explosive force than usual. He has later proven able to delay his explosions again, although this is difficult for him to accomplish.

After Apocalypse used the Celestial Technology to transform Gambit into the Horseman Death, Gambit demonstrates the ability to convert inert materials into toxic substances (such as transforming breathable air into poisonous gases) and has the potential to ingest diseases and plagues. It is apparent that the Celestial Technology never left his system, as seen during a telepathic attack against him that temporarily brought out the Death persona, which eventually killed the attacker. He also showcased new abilities he had not used before in this form – such as his Death Charge, which fueled his projectiles with dark energies that had the effect of either disintegrating or entrapping beings within his cards. His new transformation also affords him the ability to control the trajectory in which the thrown cards fly in, giving him more control over their vector path while in motion. He could also convert people to his mindset as he did with Northstar, Dazzler and several demons while in limbo. Gambit&#x27;s body did subsequently return to normal.

==Reception==
Gambit has long been recognized as one of the most beloved and unique characters in the Marvel Universe. In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked him 65th in their &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot; list, they noted that while some might see him as alongside Wolverine, many fans fell in love with Gambit’s &quot;swagger, charm, and dark past,&quot; with his continued appearances in TV and movie spinoffs solidifying his place as one of the greats. In 2013, &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; ranked Gambit 4th in their &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot; list, highlighting his charm and fan-favorite status. Similarly, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed him 8th in their 2015 list, &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever,&quot; praising his appeal as a complex and enduring character.

In 2017, Chris Killian of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called Gambit one of the &quot;best X-Men mutants,&quot; writing, &quot;It&#x27;s really hard to have a &#x27;10 Best&#x27; X-Men mutants list and not include the Ragin&#x27; Cajun.&quot; He admired Gambit&#x27;s suave personality, cool trench coat, and his flirtatious relationship with Rogue, despite the dangers of her powers. Killian also commented on Gambit&#x27;s struggles with solo projects, noting the troubled development of his solo movie starring Channing Tatum, but humorously pointed out, &quot;Is anyone trying to make a solo Strong Guy movie? Didn’t think so&quot;. That same year, &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; also ranked Gambit 10th in their &quot;10 Best X-Men&quot; list, reinforcing his lasting importance.

In 2018, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Gambit 27th in their &quot;Age of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters in Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list. Scoot Allan of &quot;CBR&quot; further praised Gambit’s appeal, remarking that despite debates among collectors about whether his first appearance was in &quot;Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #14 or &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #266, Gambit quickly became one of the team’s most popular members. Allan pointed out how, despite Gambit&#x27;s ongoing popularity, he hasn&#x27;t appeared in as many adaptations outside of comics as some of his fellow X-Men.

In 2022, Gambit continued to receive recognition. &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Gambit and Rogue 7th in their &quot;10 Best Marvel Couples&quot; list, acknowledging their complex and enduring relationship. Kayla Brown of &quot;ScreenRant&quot; also described Gambit as a fan-favorite character, due to his background as a master thief and his cool, mysterious charm. Brown highlighted how Gambit’s ability to turn inanimate objects into explosives, along with his complex personality, made him relatable to fans. His mix of protectiveness, sarcasm, and occasional frustration gave depth to his character. Additionally, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked him 1st in their &quot;10 Best X-Men Characters Created by Chris Claremont&quot; list, emphasizing his importance within the X-Men universe.

==Literary reception==
===Volumes===
==== &quot;Gambit&quot; Vol. 3 (&quot;X-Men: Gambit&quot;) – 1999 ====
====&quot;X-Men: Curse of the Mutants – Storm &amp; Gambit&quot; – 2010====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-Men: Curse of the Mutants – Storm &amp; Gambit&quot; #1 was the 55th best selling comic book in August 2010.

James Hunt of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called &quot;X-Men: Curse of the Mutants – Storm &amp; Gambit&quot; #1 &quot;remarkably good&quot;, asserting, &quot;The issue sees Storm and Gambit – characters with similar skill sets (if not powers) and a history of working together – teaming up to steal Dracula&#x27;s body from the heart of Vampire Island. It makes perfect sense to team this pair up, and strangely, this could have made for a reasonably satisfying issue of the main series, if only editorial were willing to break out of the fairly narrow idea of what an X-Men story has to be these days. [...] The big thing this book has going for it is that it is, far and away, the best thing to come out with the &quot;Curse of the Mutants&quot; name attached. In fact, it almost works well enough as a stand-alone piece to recommend buying even if you&#x27;re not following the ongoing story. Give it a chance, and you might be surprised.&quot;

==== &quot;Gambit&quot; Vol. 5 (&quot;King of Thieves&quot;) – 2012 ====
==== &quot;Gambit&quot; Vol. 6 (&quot;Thick as Thieves&quot;) – 2022 ====
==== Other comic books ====
Gambit has starred in various team-up comics, collaborating with characters like Deadpool in &quot;Deadpool vs. Gambit&quot;, Wolverine in &quot;Wolverine/Gambit: Victims&quot;, The Night Man in &quot;The Night Man/Gambit&quot; and the X-Ternals in &quot;Gambit &amp; The X-Ternals,&quot; before later partnering with Rogue in the &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; and &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; comic series, both centered on the X-Men couple. The reception for &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; was mixed, with some praising its reintroduction of the couple&#x27;s dynamic, while others felt it struggled to balance action with relationship development. In contrast, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; received generally favorable reviews, highlighting its celebration of the couple&#x27;s romance and entertaining storytelling.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Gambit was a member of the X-Men and one of Magneto&#x27;s closest friends. Like his Earth-616 counterpart, Gambit too fell in love with Rogue, which prompted him to leave the X-Men when Rogue chose Magneto, whom she could touch due to the two possessing magnetism-based powers (she had permanently absorbed the powers and memories of Polaris just as she had done to Ms. Marvel on Earth-616). Gambit, as a member of the Thieves Guild, maintained a certain connection with Candra, who was also one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, until she was killed. Despite having left the X-Men, Gambit still fought for &quot;the Dream&quot; in his own way. He assembled a group of thieves which he named &quot;X-Ternals&quot;, who stole from Apocalypse&#x27;s regime and the mutant aristocracy to provide food and medicines to the humans still living in New York. He also had an affair with Lila Cheney, despite the fact that he had not gotten over Rogue.

When Magneto put into action his plan to save Charles Xavier, Gambit agreed to steal a shard of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal with the aid of his X-Ternals. Gambit and the X-Ternals were chased by Mudir Rictor and later faced the Shi&#x27;ar. However, Gambit obtained the shard of the Crystal, giving up in exchange for it his undying love for Rogue. Gambit thought that he had now lost his ability to love. The group returned to Earth; however, Gambit lost both the Crystal shard and Magneto and Rogue&#x27;s son, Charles, to the traitor Guido when he threatened to kill Lila.

Despite this, Gambit was accepted back into the X-Men when they launched a mission to get into Apocalypse&#x27;s citadel to rescue Magneto and put his plan into action. Gambit killed the crazed Colossus when his desire to save his sister Illyana threatened the mission.

Following the death of Apocalypse and the fall of his regime, Gambit once again became a member of the X-Men.

During the AoA&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Gambit was part of the X-Men and helped Magneto eliminate the remaining forces still loyal to Apocalypse. This included helping the X-Men get rid of the Hellions. Magneto later became injured while telling the Morlocks that they were free, and when he was recuperating, Quicksilver detected mutant signatures of Apocalypse&#x27;s former soldiers in Mexico. Magneto then left with Quicksilver, Gambit, and Sunfire.

The Guthrie siblings later attacked the X-Men&#x27;s base, taking Rogue and Charles Lensherr captive. Magneto, Sunfire, Gambit, and Quicksilver returned to the base and defeated the Guthries. Magneto then revealed his secret regarding Sinister, leading the X-Men to Sinister&#x27;s lab in New York. The X-Men then fought the Sinister Six, and during the fight, Gambit, Nightcrawler, and Dazzler were sucked into Cloak. Nightcrawler managed to save Dazzler, but not Gambit, resulting in Gambit&#x27;s presumed death, though it was not confirmed. The X-Men later buried their dead and created a tombstone for Gambit whose full text is not seen, but ending in &quot;... luck always be on his side.&quot;

However, it appears that luck was indeed at Gambit&#x27;s side after all, as he was rescued in time from the Darkforce Dimension at some point and was greeted by the X-Men team later. When the X-Force team of Earth-616 came to the Age of Apocalypse to retrieve a Celestial life seed to prevent Warren to ascend as the new Apocalypse, Gambit was part of the Fantomex team to retrieve the seed from the deceased Celestial and he gives his life so the team could retrieve the object from the cosmic being.

===Bishop&#x27;s future===
In the future timeline that is the home of the X-Man Bishop (Earth-1191), the X-Men were wiped out in 1996 by someone recorded only as &#x27;The X-Traitor&#x27;. However, there was apparently one survivor of the attack, a man called &quot;The Witness&quot;. He had a Cajun accent and long hair. He and Bishop had an antagonistic relationship at that time. When Bishop came to the past, he recognized Gambit&#x27;s face as that of the Witness.

Later, the Witness was revealed to have been living happily in New Orleans, unchanged from how Bishop will know him in 80 years&#x27; time. He met the young Remy Lebeau, and had a set of trophies from countless battles across time (fans noticed Captain America&#x27;s shattered shield, the red power suit from The Greatest American Hero, and Hellboy&#x27;s Right Hand of Doom). He claimed to be pantemporal, capable of seeing all things in all realities at all times. The fact that he was even capable of conversing with Bishop or anyone else in a linear fashion is apparently due to his sense of humor.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
In &quot;Exiles&quot;, Gambit of Earth-371 was the team leader of Weapon X (the ruthless counterpart to the heroic Exiles), having replaced Sabretooth. With Weapon X they had to work with Iron Man, the fascist monarch of Earth, to kill all of the Inhumans. They succeeded and went to the next reality.

It appeared that he and Storm on his team had been in a relationship and that back in his alternative reality he and Storm (another one from his alternative reality) were married. Storm was now dead and replaced by Hyperion. In this mission, Weapon X was supposed to kill the ten remaining mutants in this reality, but this evil version of Hyperion wanted to be the ruler of this Earth. The heroes did not want to murder anyone, but a battle with Hyperion soon followed. Hyperion shot off Gambit&#x27;s arm, forcing Gambit to retreat into the Morlock tunnels. Hyperion murdered most of the Weapon X team.

Finally, the Exiles appeared and determined the true nature of the mission although they initially refused to go through with it. They were to kill six members of Weapon X and the Exiles. Hyperion and an evil version of Ms. Marvel (who had already taken care of most of the killing) forced them to fight. In the end, Hyperion was &quot;seemingly&quot; killed by Gambit after Blink had injured him sufficiently to make him vulnerable. Gambit was disintegrated in the blast. It was revealed later that Hyperion resurrected himself and took control of the Panoptichron. It was also revealed that every Weapon X and Exiles team member who died or was sent home were frozen into a crystal wall in that palace. When the Exiles found the place, there were many fallen heroes—-Gambit among them. Gambit&#x27;s body is returned to his home dimension for burial in.

====&quot;New Exiles&quot;====
In &quot;New Exiles&quot; #2–4, a very different version of Gambit was shown. Still called Remy, attracted to Rogue and sometimes speaking approximate Cajun, this version was the son of Namor and Sue Storm. He has four siblings and the power to breathe underwater as well as the force field projection capabilities of his mother. He saved Rogue when she was injured and drowned to her death. He was then flown by her to his family, which they saved together. He then went on to join the Exiles team.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
Gambit makes a brief appearance in &quot;House of M&quot; as a thief being caught by Carol Danvers.

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombie Gambit is seen as one of the dozens of super-powered zombies attacking Doctor Doom&#x27;s castle trying to reach the uninfected humans inside. This is after being seen on S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s helicarrier between Colossus and Magneto. This takes place in &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness&quot;. In &quot;Marvel Zombies #3&quot;, Gambit is one of the many zombies trying to slay and eat the Silver Surfer. Next, Gambit&#x27;s chest is blasted through, then his head, from the jaw up, is knocked off, by the cosmically powered zombies.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; universe, Gambit was in a fatal accident when he was attempting to save his foster daughter.

He was accompanied by Bloodstorm at the time and begged her to turn him into a vampire so that he didn&#x27;t have to die. She reluctantly accepted his request and became Gambit&#x27;s sire. He was very unhappy with the creature he had become, blaming Bloodstorm for what she had done to him, and ran away.

Since his eyes were naturally red, no one in the Thieves&#x27; Guild noticed any difference in Gambit, only making it easier for him to continue to feed. For a time, Gambit worked to prevent Bloodstorm from feeding on sentient beings, such as the thieving Marauders and otherwise innocent vampire-wannabes. Later, Gambit was forced to join Havok&#x27;s team The Six, and while there, received a partial cure for his vampirism from the Brute. With the serum he devised, it granted both Gambit and Bloodstorm a reprieve from their blood lust and gave them the ability to walk in the sunlight. However, Gambit&#x27;s appreciation did not run deep. When the team was in crisis-fighting the combined might of the Goblyn Force, Count Dracula, and the Beyonder, Gambit stole the team&#x27;s jet and flew away with his adopted daughter Raven, never to be seen again.

===New Son (Sun)===

Appearing in the 1999 &quot;Gambit&quot; solo run, Gambit is called New Son (Sun) (X-Cutioner II) in Earth-9923 reality. In his own reality, the New Sun&#x27;s kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. New Sun is not limited to inorganic matter and can convert matter into energy at a sub-molecular level so it vaporizes or explodes. He also can time travel, can propel himself by a wave-like aura, and can transplant matter through time and space, as well as being able to biokinetically augment all his physical abilities to superhuman levels.

In this reality, New Sun was never adopted by the Thieves Guild, so his real name is not &quot;Remy LeBeau&quot;. The New Sun was raised with his full power and intended to become the fulfillment of an ancient Guild prophecy to create Heaven on Earth. However, things went wrong when he charged up his power in a special ritual—a chain reaction was started that caused everyone on Earth beside himself to burn up. Failing to remake time, the New Sun traveled to other universes, hoping to prevent the same thing from happening there. However, he found many worlds in ruins, often because of that world&#x27;s version of Gambit. Coming to the main Marvel Universe (616), he first attempted to create a new world where everyone would eventually be transported to, using the main reality&#x27;s Gambit to help (without revealing to him who he truly was). When he learned that his plan wasn&#x27;t possible, he tried to kill Gambit, transporting both of them to his destroyed homeworld before Gambit became a threat to the main universe&#x27;s Earth world as well.

During their final conflict, Gambit finally blasted the New Sun, burning out his recently increased powers, just as the New Sun died. Due to New Sun&#x27;s immense power, it is speculated that New Sun was an omega-level mutant in his home dimension, and likely mutant alpha on Earth-9923; this, however, cannot be confirmed.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The Ultimate Universe&#x27;s version of Gambit, as introduced in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #13 by Chuck Austen, Esad Ribic, and John Livesay, is portrayed as a streetwise hustler from New York City. His initial solo arc involves encountering a young girl whose parents were murdered by mobster Hammerhead while she panhandles on the subway. Determined to protect her from the Maggia, Gambit confronts Hammerhead and Silvermane, where he saves the girl, securing her a safer home before continuing on his own path. Gambit faces the X-Men in a three-issue arc in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #50–53, where he works for the Fenris Twins, who provide him with a suit to control his explosive powers. Tasked with kidnapping Rogue as a potential recruit for Fenris Corporation, he develops a bond with her and after Wolverine brutally beats him, prompting him to turn against Fenris. Their romance takes a turn in &quot;Ultimate X-Men Annual&quot; #1 when they attempt to raid a Fenris facility in Las Vegas. Their heist is interrupted by Juggernaut, who has tracked them down due to his infatuation with Rogue. To protect her, Gambit tricks Juggernaut into collapsing a building on them, defeating him but mortally wounding himself. In his final moments, he shares a kiss with Rogue, allowing her to absorb his life force and powers, temporarily enhancing her abilities as she rejoins the X-Men.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
In this version, he is married to Rogue, and they have two children, a son (Olivier) and a daughter (Rebecca &quot;Becca&quot;).

In the miniseries &quot;X-Men: The End: Heroes and Martyrs&quot;, Gambit was revealed to be the clone of Mister Sinister, created from Sinister&#x27;s own pre-mutated DNA. Sinister wished to destroy his master, Apocalypse, and to do so he needed a body that had not been subject to Apocalypse&#x27;s altering. He then engineered mutant powers for the clone, using the DNA of Cyclops. This technically makes him the third Summers brother; in that alternative reality. However, Apocalypse learned of Sinister&#x27;s plan and had the child stolen and left it in the care of the Thieves Guild.

It was originally believed that Gambit died in the series &quot;The End&quot; disguised as Sinister and trying to defeat the Shi&#x27;ar. However, in GeNEXT, a series about the children of the X-Men, Olivier talks about how he and his father (Gambit) have not really made contact since his mother (Rogue) died and that Gambit didn&#x27;t have the heart to continue on as an X-Man. They only communicate through Rebecca.

===Age of X===
In the Age of X timeline, Gambit feels, for reasons unknown, compelled to rescue Rogue, who was being hunted by Moonstar and her team. They are seemingly killed by Magneto, but are later commissioned by him to break into a secret chamber.

===&quot;X-Men: Noir&quot;===
In &quot;X-Men: Noir&quot;, Remy LeBeau is depicted as the owner of the Creole Club, a nightclub and casino, also acting as an information source for his friend Thomas Calloway, a costumed detective and reporter for the Daily Bugle calling himself The Angel. He is, however, shown as an unscrupulous person, as he is not above collecting on debts with force.

===&quot;X-Men: Forever&quot;===
In &quot;X-Men: Forever&quot; he is referred to as Remy Picard.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies: Resurrection&quot;===
Although Gambit is dead in this reality, Valerie Richards uses a hand taken from his corpse to destroy the source of the current zombie plague in the form of the Brood-infested Galactus.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the Amalgam Comics universe, Gambit is fused with Obsidian and is going under the codename Wraith (real name Todd LeBeau), and on a team called JLX (a fusion of Marvel&#x27;s X-Men and DC&#x27;s Justice League International). He is in a relationship with Runaway, a fusion of Marvel&#x27;s Rogue and DC&#x27;s Gypsy.

==In other media==

Gambit made numerous animated appearances in cartoons such as &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;. The character was portrayed by Taylor Kitsch in the live-action film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009). A &quot;Gambit&quot; spin-off film was in development since at least May 2014, with Channing Tatum signed on to play the lead role. The film was cancelled in May 2019, after five years of development hell and the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. Tatum eventually appeared as Gambit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024).

<doc id="232583" wikidata="Q387981" url="?curid=232583" title="Allele frequency">
<text>Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the relative frequency of an allele (variant of a gene) at a particular locus in a population, expressed as a fraction or percentage. Specifically, it is the fraction of all chromosomes in the population that carry that allele over the total population or sample size. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population.

Given the following:

# A particular locus on a chromosome and a given allele at that locus
# A population of &quot;N&quot; individuals with ploidy &quot;n&quot;, i.e. an individual carries &quot;n&quot; copies of each chromosome in their somatic cells (e.g. two chromosomes in the cells of diploid species)
# The allele exists in &quot;i&quot; chromosomes in the population

then the allele frequency is the fraction of all the occurrences &quot;i&quot; of that allele and the total number of chromosome copies across the population, &quot;i&quot;/(&quot;nN&quot;).

The allele frequency is distinct from the genotype frequency, although they are related, and allele frequencies can be calculated from genotype frequencies.

In population genetics, allele frequencies are used to describe the amount of variation at a particular locus or across multiple loci. When considering the ensemble of allele frequencies for many distinct loci, their distribution is called the allele frequency spectrum.

== Calculation of allele frequencies from genotype frequencies==
The actual frequency calculations depend on the ploidy of the species for autosomal genes.

===Monoploids===
The frequency (&quot;p&quot;) of an allele A is the fraction of the number of copies (&quot;i&quot;) of the A allele and the population or sample size (&quot;N&quot;), so

:formula_1

===Diploids===
If formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 are the frequencies of the three genotypes at a locus with two alleles, then the frequency &quot;p&quot; of the A-allele and the frequency &quot;q&quot; of the B-allele in the population are obtained by counting alleles.

:formula_5

:formula_6

Because &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are the frequencies of the only two alleles present at that locus, they must sum to 1. To check this:

:formula_7

:formula_8 and formula_9

If there are more than two different allelic forms, the frequency for each allele is simply the frequency of its homozygote plus half the sum of the frequencies for all the heterozygotes in which it appears.

(For 3 alleles see ) 

Allele frequency can always be calculated from genotype frequency, whereas the reverse requires that the Hardy–Weinberg conditions of random mating apply.

====Example====
Consider a locus that carries two alleles, A and B. In a diploid population there are three possible genotypes, two homozygous genotypes (AA and BB), and one heterozygous genotype (AB). If we sample 10 individuals from the population, and we observe the genotype frequencies
# freq (AA) = 6
# freq (AB) = 3
# freq (BB) = 1
then there are formula_10 observed copies of the A allele and formula_11 of the B allele, out of 20 total chromosome copies. The frequency &quot;p&quot; of the A allele is &quot;p&quot; = 15/20 = 0.75, and the frequency &quot;q&quot; of the B allele is &quot;q&quot; = 5/20 = 0.25.

==Dynamics==
Population genetics describes the genetic composition of a population, including allele frequencies, and how allele frequencies are expected to change over time. The Hardy–Weinberg law describes the expected equilibrium genotype frequencies in a diploid population after random mating. Random mating alone does not change allele frequencies, and the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assumes an infinite population size and a selectively neutral locus.

In natural populations natural selection (adaptation mechanism), gene flow, and mutation combine to change allele frequencies across generations. Genetic drift causes changes in allele frequency from random sampling due to offspring number variance in a finite population size, with small populations experiencing larger per generation fluctuations in frequency than large populations. There is also a theory that second adaptation mechanism exists – niche construction According to extended evolutionary synthesis adaptation occur due to natural selection, environmental induction, non-genetic inheritance, learning and cultural transmission. An allele at a particular locus may also confer some fitness effect for an individual carrying that allele, on which natural selection acts. Beneficial alleles tend to increase in frequency, while deleterious alleles tend to decrease in frequency. Even when an allele is selectively neutral, selection acting on nearby genes may also change its allele frequency through hitchhiking or background selection.

While heterozygosity at a given locus decreases over time as alleles become fixed or lost in the population, variation is maintained in the population through new mutations and gene flow due to migration between populations. For details, see population genetics.

<text>Lucas Bishop is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer John Byrne and artist Whilce Portacio, the character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #282 (November 1991). Bishop debuted as a member of a mutant police force from a dystopian future of the Marvel Universe Xavier&#x27;s Security Enforcers (XSE). He traveled to the 20th century and joined the X-Men. The character possesses the ability to absorb energy.

Omar Sy portrayed Bishop in the 2014 live-action feature film, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;.

==Creation==
During an interview Whilce Portacio discussed the creation of the character:

Visually Bishop was my John Ford days, the blue and yellow that&#x27;s why the scarf, that&#x27;s why the blue and the yellow and the high officer riding boots, it was all Cavalry... and this was the last element the Jheri curls and you got to remember Prince was big back then.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Bishop was born about 80 years in the future of the Marvel Universe. He was raised in a mutant concentration camp in the aftermath of the Summers Rebellion, an uprising in which mutants and humans joined forces to destroy the Sentinels. Bishop has a distinctive M brand over his right eye, used to identify mutants in his era. After his parents were killed, Bishop was taken in by a man named LeBeau, also called Witness, who was reportedly the last man to see the legendary X-Men alive. According to LeBeau, Bishop&#x27;s adoptive grandmother took Bishop away from him. Bishop and his younger sister, Shard, were then subsequently raised by his grandmother within the same mutant concentration camp in Brooklyn.

Bishop&#x27;s grandmother taught him many legends of the X-Men, who were old allies of hers. Depowered by unknown means, she had entered the camps in secret to raise her grandchildren. Upon her deathbed, she made Bishop swear to protect Shard. After the Rebellion, the mutants were &quot;emancipated&quot; and sent out of the camps to fend for themselves. Bishop and Shard, who were only children, were left alone. They lived on the streets, stealing to survive until coming under the care of a family friend, a war veteran named Hancock. Slightly blind, Hancock nevertheless took on the task of raising the two.

One day, Bishop encountered an anti-human group of mutants called the Exhumes, who took Shard hostage just before the XSE arrived. Until that time, Bishop had admired the Exhumes, attributing to them his proud, idealized notion of the legendary X-Men. It wasn&#x27;t until the XSE defeated the Exhume and saved his sister that Bishop knew he wanted to join the XSE. When Bishop was 15, Hancock was murdered by criminals who were promptly arrested by the XSE, and he and Shard enlisted in their ranks. Shard soon surpassed Bishop to become the youngest XSE officer.

During a training class, Bishop&#x27;s instructors and some of his fellow students were attacked and killed. Bishop rallied the survivors and led the struggle against the assailants until reinforcements arrived. Bishop gradually climbs the ranks of the XSE until finally becoming their commander.

While on a mission to wipe out a nest of Emplates, mutant vampires that feed on bone marrow, Shard was critically injured. Bishop went to Witness for help. Witness, then imprisoned at the New York Stark Fujikawa building, agreed to transfer Shard&#x27;s essence into a holographic matrix if Bishop would work for him for one year. Bishop agreed, leaving the XSE for a time. The details of Bishop&#x27;s work during this period are unknown; Bishop appears reticent on the subject, later refusing to tell Shard of his actions.

Immediately upon his re-installment as a commander in the XSE, Bishop and his XSE group the &quot;Omega Squad&quot; captured Trevor Fitzroy, a murderous ex-XSE trainee in the ruins of the Xavier Institute War Room. While there, Bishop discovered a damaged recording of Jean Grey, in which she spoke of a traitor destroying the X-Men from inside. Haunted by his discovery, Bishop confronts Witness for details, but receives only a vague, ambiguous response, leaving him to suspect his former master of being more than simply a witness to the downfall of the X-Men.

===Joining the X-Men===
Fitzroy escaped from prison and used a large amount of mutant life-force to open a time portal and break out 93 mutant criminal &quot;Lifers&quot; in the process. Bishop found himself in the past in the time of his heroes, the X-Men. Bishop and the Omega Squad eventually &quot;sanctioned&quot; the Lifers, but did not get Fitzroy. Bishop encountered the X-Men for the first time but did not believe that they were really the X-Men. He then battled them but later allied with the X-Men in trying to stop Fitzroy. Malcolm and Randall, the two members of his Omega Squad, died in the process. Professor Charles Xavier offered him a place in the X-Men, and he was placed under Storm&#x27;s tutelage. He fought and defeated Styglut. When he met Gambit, Bishop recognized him as possibly a younger version of the Witness and fought him.

He soon met Mystique for the first time, and alongside the X-Men he battled the Morlocks and the Death Sponsors. Bishop assigned himself the role of Xavier&#x27;s personal bodyguard, which he failed at when Stryfe, the evil double of Cable, critically wounded Xavier. Initially, the X-Men believed that Cable was the would-be assassin, so Wolverine and Bishop tracked down Cable, but then travelled to Cable&#x27;s &quot;Graymalkin&quot; space station and joined with him in finding Stryfe. Citing his failure to protect Professor X, Bishop offered to resign from the X-Men. His resignation was rejected by Xavier, and then alongside the X-Men he battled the Acolytes.

===Age of Apocalypse===
When Professor Xavier&#x27;s insane son, the mutant Legion, went back in time to assassinate Magneto, Bishop was one of the X-Men sent to stop him. When they failed and Legion accidentally killed Professor Xavier, Bishop was the only time-traveler to remain when history was altered and became the Age of Apocalypse. He eventually convinced the Magneto of that era that the existence of this reality was wrong, and with a great amount of sacrifice, managed to correct the error and stop Legion. After the timeline reset itself, Bishop received some of his counterpart&#x27;s unsettling memories of the Age of Apocalypse.

The traitor in the X-Men was eventually revealed to be Professor X in the form of Onslaught. Bishop&#x27;s knowledge of the future was the only thing that stopped Onslaught from killing the X-Men. As Onslaught fired a massive blast of psionic energy at the distracted X-Men, Bishop threw himself in front of them and absorbed the blast that would have killed them. Onslaught, winded from such a massive attack, said that his blast was enough to kill a thousand mutants and &quot;Another time, another place, I would have been proud&quot;. Bishop lost consciousness after absorbing the blast but soon recovered, although it was not enough to prevent Onslaught from nearly destroying all of humanity. He made peace with Gambit, who was not the traitor after all.

Following this, Bishop was captured by Trevor Fitzroy&#x27;s henchmen and taken to a distant possible future, detailed in the &quot;Bishop: The Last X-Man&quot; series. He again faced Fitzroy, with Bishop eventually killing him. He was temporarily returned to the present by Apocalypse who needed him as one of The Twelve, before finally returning permanently during the Maximum Security crossover.

===X-Treme X-Men===
Bishop was a founding member of Storm&#x27;s splinter team of X-Men, whose mission was to search for the Books of Truth, the diaries of the precognitive mutant Destiny. They left against the will and knowledge of the main team, as the splinter group did not trust in Xavier or the others to use the diaries for the benefit of humanity.

===District X===
Bishop joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation. District X, or &#x27;Mutant Town&#x27;, had a high-population density. It was also a poverty-stricken area with high crime rates. Bishop was assigned to the area to resolve mutant-related crimes.

===Civil War===
In the &quot;Civil War: X-Men&quot; miniseries, Bishop sides with the O*N*E* to bring in the X-Men and the 198. He argues with Cyclops over allowing their escape and states his fear of what the future might hold. Val Cooper and Tony Stark let Bishop lead Micromax and Sabra into action against Domino, Shatterstar, and the rest of the 198. Bishop led them to the base where the 198 was hiding and told the X-Men to stand down upon their arrival. General Demetrius Lazer betrayed him by ensuring that Cyclops attacked Bishop. Though at first he simply absorbed it, the power was too much for him to control and he was overwhelmed. Bishop was forced to direct the energy he had absorbed upwards in a powerful blast that destroyed an O*N*E* Sentinel. He later teamed up with the X-Men to save the 198 from a bomb explosion and then went his own way, leaving the X-Men. Bishop was among Iron Man&#x27;s pro-registration forces that guarded the Negative Zone prison. When Captain America&#x27;s team breaks in, a fight ensues, putting Bishop at odds with his former teammates Storm and Cable.

===Messiah Complex===

In &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, an event revitalized Bishop&#x27;s timeline as a viable future: the birth of the first mutant child since M-Day. As the Marauders, on Mister Sinister&#x27;s orders, try to gather anyone and anything with knowledge of the future, Bishop is the only target they were unable to locate and terminate. It is revealed that he had betrayed the X-Men and he attempted to kill the baby. Before he could succeed, he was thwarted by the Marauders, who escaped with the baby. As X-Men arrive on the scene, Bishop pretends to have attempted to retrieve the baby. As Multiple Man&#x27;s duplicate and Layla Miller find out in their mission to one of the planet&#x27;s possible futures (80 years in the future) that the birth of the child created, the child apparently kills a million people in an event dubbed the Six-Minute War, and the U.S. government incarcerates all the mutants into concentration camps, where Bishop is born, grows up, and sees his parents killed. As Multiple Man&#x27;s dupe and Layla find out, Bishop wishes at a young age to have had the opportunity to kill the baby, so that while he would not be born, he would also not have to see his parents die, and to endure the horrors of life in the concentration camps. Layla kills the dupe so that the information conveyed to them by young Bishop can return to the present, to the Multiple Man prime, who conveys Bishop&#x27;s treachery to the X-Men. The X-Men then attempted to alert X-Force of Bishop&#x27;s betrayal, but he managed to block all of their communication channels. After arriving on Muir Island and fighting past the Marauders, Bishop found Cable attempting to escape with the baby and the two fight. Both mutants are then attacked by Predator X, who viciously rips off Bishop&#x27;s right arm. Bishop cauterizes his torn shoulder on an unconscious Sunfire and in an attempt to shoot down a teleporting Cable, he misses and hits Professor X instead.
====Chasing the Mutant Messiah====
Bishop managed to escape the X-Men after he seemingly killed their mentor, and stole a nuclear powered bionic arm from Forge equipped with a timeslide device, which he uses to track down Cable and the newborn mutant. Upon finding them, he shoots Cable twice before being hindered by a local gang. With Cable severely weakened by blood loss, he makes a risky attack before the gang can find heavier weapons. He later manages to track down Cable, slaying several mutated beasts in the process, and shoot the Mutant Messiah. He also finds that in the future generated by his choice, Cable will be always revered as a messianic figure who tried his best to protect the child and saved humanity from the very beasts that Bishop unwillingly saved Cable from. It has been revealed that the Messiah child is still alive and Bishop has been captured by the X-Men. In his efforts to kill the child, Bishop has left several traps for Cable throughout the timestream, killing millions in the process, though he doesn&#x27;t see them as people who actually exist but as people who wouldn&#x27;t exist or come back to life if he kills Hope.

====Messiah War====
After multiple failings at killing Hope, Bishop locates and enlists the aid of Stryfe, promising him that he would aid him in killing Apocalypse and Cable. Stryfe and Bishop travel to a point in the future where Apocalypse is at his weakest and manage to defeat him. Stryfe builds an empire using Celestial technology and Bishop becomes his right-hand man, waiting for Cable and Hope to re-emerge. When they do appear along with X-Force, Hope is kidnapped. Bishop betrays Stryfe and his plot to kill Hope is foiled by Stryfe, who wants to make her his heir. Both attempts are foiled by Apocalypse, X-Force, and Cable. Cable manages to rescue Hope and escape yet again. Bishop escapes into the &quot;near future&quot; of the 21st century, reconstructing his arm, vowing to find Hope once again.

====Homecoming====
After several years of running from Bishop, Hope finally decides that it is time to return to the present. During a battle, Bishop manages to knock out Cable. In a fit of rage, Hope&#x27;s powers awaken and render Bishop unconscious. Hope then attempts to kill Bishop, but is stopped by Cable. They take Bishop&#x27;s time machine and leave him stranded. Bishop is somehow transported with them and begins chasing them through time, in an attempt to kill Hope before they reach the present. In &quot;Cable&quot; vol. 2 #24, Hope and Cable return to the present time but Bishop follows them. He attacks them, running Cable through with a sword. As Cable is incapacitated, Hope rushes to his aid but is ultimately overpowered by Bishop. Cable takes out Bishop&#x27;s time-traveling device from his techno-organic arm, performs some alterations on it, and places it in Bishop&#x27;s robotic arm. Cable recovers enough to toss Bishop into the subway. As Bishop attempts to kill Hope one last time, he is transported to a barren and dead Earth (as a result of his efforts to limit Cable and Hope&#x27;s attempts to find allies and shelter through different time periods) with a red sun in the sky (cause unknown). Bishop, being overconfident, attempts to travel back to the present time to continue his quest to kill Cable and Hope Summers, but due to Cable sabotaging Bishop&#x27;s time-traveling device, this attempt causes his robotic arm to explode. This leaves him stranded in the year 6700 A.D. Bishop is last shown thinking to himself concerning Cable and Hope, &quot;I was as much a father to that girl as you were. Whatever she becomes, it&#x27;s because of me. I was doing the right thing. Wasn&#x27;t I?&quot;

===Return to the Present===
In &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; vol. 2 #1, Bishop makes his first appearance since being stranded in the future. He is shown arriving in 2013 Los Angeles and announcing &quot;I&#x27;m baaack!&quot; He battles the members of the new X-Force before it is revealed that his mind is apparently being possessed by the Demon Bear that once terrorized Danielle Moonstar. After a lengthy conflict, Psylocke manages to pull the Bear out of Bishop&#x27;s mind. Storm also uses the opportunity to disrupt the part of Bishop&#x27;s mind holding his memories of his hunt for Hope, in the hopes that she will thus restore her old friend. Bishop is later shown comatose as a result of his ordeal.

He eventually regains his memories of Hope. The self-control he has learned during his time in the future helps him move past his former vendetta, even helping to save Hope&#x27;s life when Stryfe attempted to manipulate them into attacking each other in revenge for their actions against him during their time-traveling search.

Bishop is shown carrying out research in a library in London, preparing himself for the next &#x27;scheduled&#x27; threat he recalls from his future history, when he becomes caught up in the latest attack by the Shadow King, which results in Charles Xavier being reborn in Fantomex&#x27;s body. After the reborn Proteus and Shadow King are defeated, Xavier—now calling himself &#x27;X&#x27;—erases the memories of his resurrection from most of the X-Men who worked with him, but he grants each of them a gift, stating that his gift to Bishop is the ability to put his quest to protect the future to the side at times and allow himself to enjoy his life in the present.

Bishop later receives a warning (apparently by Kid Cable) about an unspecified, imminent event that would have catastrophic consequences on the X-Men&#x27;s timeline. This leads him to Sugar Man&#x27;s lab where the X-Man has a quick confrontation with the frightened villain before getting knocked unconscious. By the time Bishop wakes up, Sugar Man is dead with his body split in two. The event was soon afterward revealed to be the return of Nate Grey, who had found and used the Life Seed on himself. This not only made him recover his powers, but also increased them to the point of overriding the black X-shaped tattoo which was protecting him, and in the process twisted his mind. Nate then uses all his powers, though Jean tries to reason with him, to reshape the world in his image, a world where the X-Men no longer exist.

Under the illusionary world, every type of human intimate interaction is forbidden, although this does not stop Bishop and Jean Grey from starting a relationship. This leads to the events of mini-series &quot;Prisoner X&quot;, where Bishop is taken to be &quot;reconditioned&quot;.

===Dawn of X and Krakoa===
In the new status quo for the X-Men (Dawn of X), helmed by writer Jonathan Hickman, Bishop is part of the crew of the Marauders, led by Kitty Pryde, and becomes Red Bishop of the Hellfire Club (comics). He is also one of the Krakoa&#x27;s Great Captains—alongside Cyclops, Magik, and Gorgon—before becoming Captain Commander when Cyclops steps aside to lead the X-Men. During &quot;King in Black&quot;, Beast was able to convince Bishop to ignore his orders from Pryde and shoot to kill the symbiote-infected Cyclops and Storm, hinting that he&#x27;s okay being used by different organizations against one another. He&#x27;s also suggested the idea of fusing mutant DNA into new forms—inadvertently arguing for chimeras, which became a major part of Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s previous failed timelines.

==Powers and abilities==
Lucas Bishop possesses energy absorption mutant powers. He can absorb all forms of radiant or conductive energy that are directed towards him and to release that energy from his body. This power is mostly passive, allowing Bishop to absorb energy at all times.

He can release this energy in many different forms, usually as concussive blasts of biokinetic energy, even amplified compared to the absorbed amount. Bishop can also store absorbed energy within his personal reserves, whereupon the energy increases his strength and recuperative abilities as well as affording him a measure of invulnerability. He is also able to absorb magic energy (as seen when fighting &quot;growing men&quot; in Limbo) and the psychic energies of psionics as easily as all the other kinds. This does not prevent him from being read or manipulated by a telepath but only sustains him and helps him to slow them down and potentially exhaust them. It has been clearly stated that Bishop is also able to absorb and process kinetic energy similarly to Sebastian Shaw, but in a much less effective way.

His powers make it difficult to harm him with energy-based attacks; however, he can become overloaded from absorbing too much energy, though his upper limits are unknown, even to himself; when Rogue was suffering a power overload after absorbing Skrull telepath Z&#x27;Cann, Bishop was pushed to his limit simply by grabbing Rogue as he tried to help her drain off her excess power. While he can achieve a sort of invulnerability, even against conventional attacks and depending on his energy reserves, some parts of at least the transformation process are also participatory, as for example after falling from a great height he transformed the kinetic energy into pure light and sound, but only could do so because he was conscious. Bishop is also resistant to most poisons.

He can &quot;let his spirit go&quot; as seen in &quot;X-Treme X-Men Annual&quot; #1. However, it was never clearly explained what this actually means and if this is also part of his powers or if it was taught to him.

He has also demonstrated the ability to instinctively know where he is and the present hour and date even if asleep, first mentioned in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #1. Although being the great-grandson of Gateway, a mutant possessing extensive dealings with time travel, this aspect is not one of Bishop&#x27;s mutant powers. Bishop&#x27;s explanation is that due to training; he knows where he is at all times.

Bishop is a highly athletic man, an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with many years of armed and unarmed combat training, and a superb marksman with firearms. When he first came to the modern era, Bishop carried XSE guns from his time that fired laser beams and plasma charges. He also wore his XSE uniform, modeled after X-Men uniforms, which contained body armor.

For a significant period of time, his right arm was a prosthetic, stolen from Forge. A nuclear-powered battle-ready arm, it incorporates in its design a time-travel device, the ability to channel his energy blasts through, and enhanced strength and resilience. It has since been destroyed after Bishop tried to use it to time travel from 6700 A.D. to 2010 to kill Cable and Hope Summers due to Cable tampering with the time traveling device within it. His real arm has apparently been re-grown after he was healed in the future by the remnants of humanity.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; described Lucas Bishop as one of the greatest X-Men of all time, saying, &quot;Despite his flaws, there are many reasons to love Bishop.&quot; Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; expressed interest on seeing a television series on Lucas Bishop.

=== Impact ===
In 2020, American rapper Method Man cosplayed Lucas Bishop. In 2021, he expressed interest in portraying the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===

In Ultimate Marvel, a time-traveling Bishop appears in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #76. Moments after the battle with Cable concludes, he appears asking if he is too late to stop Cable.

Wolverine knocks him unconscious and the X-Men interrogate him. He is wearing the same uniform as the members of Cable&#x27;s squad and appears to be much older than the mainstream Bishop. He then leads the team into battle with Cable&#x27;s squad. He fails to stop Cable from kidnapping Charles Xavier (everyone believes Xavier is dead) and is trapped in the present day, due to Cable&#x27;s destruction of the device that allowed him to time travel.

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #80, Bishop has a conversation with his younger self, who is incarcerated, in which he tells him not to use his powers to escape. By &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #84, Bishop has formed a new team of X-Men (consisting of Wolverine, Storm, Pyro, Dazzler, Angel, Psylocke, and himself). He is using the new team to stop a new wave of Sentinel attacks on mutants, caused by an unknown enemy, revealed in that issue to be the Fenris twins and Bolivar Trask. Wolverine appears to distrust Bishop, promising to gut him if he tries anything suspicious. Bishop was unconscious during the fight with the Fenris twins and the Sentinels, but when Psylocke&#x27;s life was at risk, he woke up to defend her and revealed that she was his future wife.

He killed both the Fenris twins with his abilities and went on to lead the New X-Men against the Sentinels. At the end of the battle, it was revealed to the reader that he was in fact working with Cable and that the entire &quot;Cable&quot; affair had been a ruse to make the X-Men a stronger team. The team remains unaware of the deception and Wolverine stabbed Bishop at the end of issue #90 when Bishop stopped Storm and Dazzler from being able to save Angel from being killed by Sinister before Bishop could reveal this. Bishop believes that it couldn&#x27;t have happened any other way. Cable later reveals the ruse, but Wolverine shows no regret for killing Bishop. After the battle with Apocalypse is undone by the Phoenix, there is no evidence that Bishop has been returned to life, even though Angel was.

His powers have been revealed as density control. For example, he destroyed a Sentinel robot by causing its shell to increase in density and crush its inner parts; Bishop then reduced his own density (or increased that of the air around him) and floated to the ground. He also has access to teleportation technology.

Robert Kirkman later admitted that the Bishop mentioned earlier in the series is the same as the one he introduced; faced with the fact that this Bishop was already introduced into continuity when he would have preferred the character to work with Cable, Kirkman simply introduced him as an older version of the previously-mentioned Bishop.

===X-Men Noir===
In &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, Bishop is depicted as the muscle for Remy LeBeau, the owner of a nightclub and casino called The Creole Club.

===X-Men: The End===
In &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, the non-canon trilogy of miniseries by Chris Claremont, Bishop learns he has a teenage daughter, Aliyah, by Deathbird. She becomes Majestrix of the Shi&#x27;ar with her father as her Imperial Chancellor.

<text>Sage, real name Teresia Karisik, is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She has most often been associated with the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, whom she spied upon under the alias Tessa for Professor Charles Xavier.

A mutant, Sage possesses a number of mental abilities and was presented as the personal assistant to the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Sebastian Shaw, but an extended retcon revealed that she was one of the first mutants discovered by Professor Xavier. She has been a member of the original X-Men teams, Excalibur, the Exiles, X-Force, and a cross-dimensional X-Men team similar to the Exiles known as the X-Treme X-Men. Sage appears in the television series &quot;The Gifted&quot; played by Hayley Lovitt.

==Publication history==
Tessa first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #132 (April 1980), and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Initially an agent of the Hellfire Club, decades later, she would join the X-Men and adopt the code-name &quot;Sage&quot; in &quot;X-Men&quot; #109 (February 2001). An extended retcon carried out by Claremont in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; between 2002 and 2004 revealed she had always been working for Professor X, serving as a spy for him within the Hellfire Club.

The character is carried over to Uncanny X-Men during the &quot;Reload&quot; phase (2004), beginning with issue #444, but leaves the team in issue #455. She reappears in New Excalibur (2005-2007) #1-24, the mini-series &quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot; (2007-2008) #1-5, &quot;Exiles&quot; (vol. 2) #100, &quot;New Exiles&quot; (2008-2009) #1-18 and a cameo in &quot;Exiles&quot; (vol. 3) #6.

She returns to the fray in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) (2012-2013) #6-13, and years later in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (vol. 5) (2018) #10, then as part of the Krakoan Age titles &quot;House of X&quot; (mini-series) (2019) #1 and &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 6) #1-50. As part of the 2024 relaunch, she is part of the cast of &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 7) #1-present.

==Fictional character biography==
Sage&#x27;s exact country of origin remains unrevealed, but she claims to have come from a war-torn region. By the time she reaches young adulthood, she is living by herself in Afghanistan. Although she tries to keep out of the conflicts between the rebels and the government, she is willing to use her guns and other weapons on anything that poses a threat. One day, she hears a call from a cave which is considered haunted by the locals. The voice (in her head) guides her deeper into the cavern, where she finds Charles Xavier, who is trapped underneath a pile of debris. His legs have been crushed during his battle with the alien Lucifer. Xavier senses that Sage is a mutant, and explains the meaning of her abilities. Although Sage says that this was about the same time he located Beast; in other accounts he found Sage first.

Sage helps Xavier and tries to get him to a hospital, but during their journey down the mountain, they come across a United Nations relief convoy under attack by robbers, who have raped and killed the UN workers. Sage exacts revenge on their behalf and kills the robbers, though she later despises herself for being so brutal.

===Hellfire Club===
Years later, Sage meets up again with Xavier, who at the time is recruiting the original X-Men. Instead of being chosen for the first X-Men class, she is sent to spy on the Hellfire Club as Tessa, and to keep watch on Sebastian Shaw, something which returns to haunt her in the following years.

While working at the Hellfire Club she encounters Psylocke, Jean Grey, and Emma Frost, who at this point is the White Queen. While she is able to successfully warn Psylocke away from the Hellfire Club, Tessa is later remorseful that she is unable to similarly prevent the corruption of Phoenix into the Black Queen. This transformation is a key factor in the creation of Dark Phoenix.

Sometime during Tessa&#x27;s time with the Hellfire Club, Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost dare the man known as Elias Bogan to wager in a game of poker. Though he holds no official rank in the Inner Circle, the telepathic Bogan is one of the club&#x27;s most important and powerful members; his patronage guarantees success in the organization. By the terms of the wager, if Shaw lost, Frost would &quot;belong&quot; to Bogan, but if Bogan&#x27;s agent lost, then his fortune would be turned over to Shaw. Thanks to Tessa&#x27;s advice and analytical skills, Bogan loses the game and is forced to honor the wager. Having never lost before, Bogan harbors a grudge against Tessa.

During the X-Men&#x27;s initial conflicts with the Hellfire Club, Tessa primarily maintains a background role and is seen as only Shaw&#x27;s unusually intelligent assistant. Hints of her more complex role are indicated when she and Xavier are kidnapped by Donald Pierce, a renegade member of the club, with grudges against both organizations. Based on the interactions between Xavier and Tessa, it is unclear whether he is helping to maintain her cover or whether he feels as if he has lost his agent, since the interaction between the two is kept impersonal. The two are rescued by the nascent team of New Mutants, and Tessa takes Pierce into custody on behalf of the Hellfire Club.

Tessa&#x27;s next notable interaction with Xavier&#x27;s students happens months later when the X-Men and Hellfire Club are hunting down Rachel Summers after her attempted murder of Selene, the newly installed Black Queen. In the middle of their fight, both teams are taken by surprise by Nimrod, a mutant-hunting robot from the future. Recognizing the more immediate threat, the two groups join forces and are able to severely damage Nimrod. The X-Men and Hellfire Club each sustain heavy losses and are forced to flee the scene quickly. Tessa offers Storm and the X-Men temporary sanctuary with the club, which later results in Magneto and Storm jointly accepting the role of White King in the Inner Circle.

===After the Hellfire Club===
Magneto becomes more actively involved with the Hellfire Club after the X-Men&#x27;s supposed death in Dallas at the climax of the Fall of the Mutants. Tensions between Magneto and Sebastian Shaw grow until, finally, Magneto ousts Shaw from the group. Although Tessa remains with the Hellfire Club after his departure, her role diminishes. Shortly thereafter, the Upstarts begin to hunt down mutant leaders, starting with former and current leaders of the Inner Circle. Shinobi Shaw seemingly murders his father, Sebastian; Emma Frost is put into a coma. Tessa continues to serve as Shinobi&#x27;s assistant, much as she had his father, and she also begins to use her telepathic skills more openly. After Tessa prevents Shinobi from solidifying his hold on the Hellfire Club, however, the younger Shaw ceases to work with her.

Sebastian Shaw returns after a period of recuperation with the extradimensional Holocaust at his side. Seeking assistance in controlling this powerful mutant, Shaw calls Tessa back into his service. Her minor telepathic abilities are able to keep him in check since most telepaths in his native reality had been killed and he had not developed psychic defenses. The two lose Holocaust, though, when Onslaught decides he needs that mutant for his own purposes. Selene and her new amnesiac thrall Madelyne Pryor join with Shaw to regain their roles in the Hellfire Club. Suspicious of Pryor, Tessa attempts to telepathically probe her while she is sleeping, unwittingly reawakening Madelyne&#x27;s memories of her tragic life and first death with the X-Men. Tessa is quickly overwhelmed and nearly killed. The only thing that stays Madelyne&#x27;s hand is that Tessa&#x27;s murder would have caused unnecessary complications. Instead, Pryor merely removes all memory of the conflict.

===Six-month gap===
Although it had been years since Tessa had outwitted him, Bogan kidnaps Sage and mentally dominates her. This possession permanently scars her mind. Bogan offers Tessa back to Shaw for everything he has. Shaw refuses and cuts his ties with Tessa. However, the X-Men become aware of Tessa&#x27;s predicament, and Storm is able to rescue her.

Out of gratitude, she stays with the X-Men, primarily in a support capacity, and resumes use of the name Sage. Fearful of mental domination by Bogan or another powerful telepath, Sage relinquished the use of her telepathic power and focused her force of will to maintain her mental shields. With the X-Men, Sage acts as a living computer, able to remember everything she sees and hears, and provide analysis.

===X-Treme X-Men===
After the X-Men learn of Destiny&#x27;s prophetic diaries, the &quot;Books of Truth&quot;, Storm forms a splinter group that leaves the X-Mansion to hunt down the missing volumes. Sage is one of her first recruits. While the X-Treme team primarily makes use of her analytical skills, her mutant power to &quot;jump-start&quot; other mutants&#x27; abilities is used in a few critical junctures: saving the Beast&#x27;s life by mutating him into a more animalistic, feline form; allowing Rogue temporary access and control of all powers she had ever absorbed; restoring Gambit&#x27;s powers after injuries had overloaded them, and unlocking Slipstream&#x27;s latent teleportation powers. During this period she forms a strong working relationship with Bishop in solving cases, most notably when the two briefly return to the X-Mansion to help investigate the attempted murder of Emma Frost.

After the prophecies of the diaries are determined to be (apparently) invalid, the group still remains separate from the main team of X-Men due to differences in philosophy with Xavier. Storm petitions various world governments for official recognition as a mutant unit for policing mutant activity. Granted this authority, her unit is dubbed the X-Treme Sanctions Executive (X.S.E), and Sage becomes an officer of this unit. Although initially more mobile, the X.S.E. eventually returns to the X-Mansion as its base of operations. Sage&#x27;s tenure with the team is abruptly ended when she rejoins the Hellfire Club to keep an eye on Sunspot (who has become the new Lord Imperial) to make sure he is not corrupted by power as Sebastian was.

===New Excalibur===

For reasons yet unknown, Sage leaves Sunspot&#x27;s side and travels to England to join forces with the newly reformed New Excalibur. She helps them on various missions such as battling the Shadow King, and returning to ancient Camelot to prevent it from being prematurely destroyed. In a more subtle use of her observation abilities, Sage is instrumental in her teammate Nocturne&#x27;s recovery from a debilitating stroke.

To learn more about a mysterious new foe, Albion, and thwart his attempt to conquer Britain, Sage creates the new cover identity and persona of Diana Fox. This persona appears to be fully devoted to Albion and his goals. However, this bothers her teammate Wisdom as he fears she might fail the mission, similar to her time with the Hellfire Club. Her Diana Fox persona climbs up the rank of Albion&#x27;s Shadow Captains as Britannia, and develops a rivalry with Lionheart. Like the rest of Albion&#x27;s army, Sage is given a suit that emphasizes loyalty to him, as well as equipping her with flight and superhuman physical strength. Although she has the opportunity to kill Albion, one purpose of her infiltration, she is struck by an errant pulse from an ancient item used by Albion to extinguish power in England. Though Lionheart suspects her betrayal, Albion believes she was only trying to protect him.

Wisdom&#x27;s fears are realized after this when the Diana Fox persona takes complete control and Sage becomes fully committed to Albion&#x27;s side. During this time, she slays two of New Excalibur&#x27;s former allies in Shadow-X, Dark Cyclops and Dark Beast. A direct confrontation with her teammates in New Excalibur helps reassert Sage&#x27;s original personality. Together with New Excalibur, Shadow-X, and now Lionheart, Sage defeats Albion and his Shadow Captains.

===X-Men: Die by the Sword and New Exiles===
Immediately after the defeat of the Shadow Captains, a party is held in honor of Excalibur. While the team enjoys the party, Sage feels guilt for her actions. The party is suddenly crashed by members of the Exiles; Psylocke and a Thunderbird from an alternate universe. They are then attacked by Rouge-Mort and drawn into a battle for the safety of the Multiverse from a psychotic Merlin and The Fury. They join forces with the rest of the Exiles, Roma and the Captain Britain Corps. The team defeats Merlin, but not before he manages to kill Roma.

Prior to her death, Roma manages to transfer all of her knowledge about the Multiverse into Sage&#x27;s mind, causing her to become overwhelmed; she fears for her sanity. Fearful of what would happen if someone on Earth ever gained the knowledge in her mind, Sage joins the Exiles. She suffers from hallucinations mixing her own memories with the information passed to her by Roma; furthermore, the Diana Fox persona re-emerges and attempts to take control once again.

While the other Exiles go on missions, Sage largely remains at their base of operation, fighting the effects of Roma&#x27;s memories and Diana Fox tenaciously every day until she drops from exhaustion. She refuses to lose possession of her mind, body, and soul. For a while she manages to calm down the phantoms, however, Diana Fox remains an aggressive presence in Sage&#x27;s mind, fighting her for control.

While diverting her focus to analyze Cat&#x27;s uncontrolled ability to &quot;cascade&quot; through different alternate versions of herself, and Cat&#x27;s empathic connection to the Crystal Palace, the phantoms in Sage&#x27;s mind break free from their mental prison. Sage decides to confront them and Diana once and for all. During her struggle, she bonds with Cat, who had been trying to find a way to heal the dying Multiverse. Sage tells Cat that she is probably too close to the situation and that it is time for a fresh mind and a new perspective. She sends Cat away to join the rest of the team and prepares to find answers, just as Diana Fox shows up, wanting to fight.

Sage and Diana fight each other but neither is yielding; they are too evenly matched and equally stubborn. As long as they fight each other, they cannot defeat the phantoms. The women decide to team up against a greater threat: the return of Merlin. During battles, Sage and Diana get a better understanding of each other and their motives.

Merlin almost kills Sage. Knowing that she could never find answers to the collapsing of the Multiverse like Sage could, Diana decides to sacrifice herself to revive Sage for the greater good. Sage reabsorbs Diana and destroys the evil version of Merlin. Sage then follows her instincts and merges with the Crystal Palace, an act which stabilizes the Multiverse. This fate was intended for Cat, but being too young and too scared, she was unable to handle it. From then on, when the New Exiles communicate with the Crystal Palace, they do not address a computer, they speak to a living being: Sage. Sage was seen once more in the Crystal Palace. However she seems to have been permanently absorbed and rendered comatose along with her Exiles team.

===Return to X-Treme X-Men===
Like Sabretooth, she was apparently rescued, revived, or separated, as she was later seen helping Dazzler and an alternative reality Wolverine rescue a kid version of Nightcrawler from the robots of yet another alternative reality. As of the conclusion of the &quot;X-Termination&quot; storyline Sage returned to Earth-616.

===Return to the X-Men and Krakoa===
In 2018, Sage cameos in the 10-part storyline &quot;X-Men Disassembled&quot; when Jean Grey contacts several telepaths to defeat an empowered X-Man (Nate Grey). In mid- to late-2019, she guest stars in the dual mini-series &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, written by Jonathan Hickman. In the new status quo for the X-titles, &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, the character is part of the cast of the &quot;X-Force&quot; relaunch (2019), and has cameos in other contemporary titles. In Krakoa, she works with Doug Ramsey to establish the Krakoa transit system to allow mutants to arrive at the island.

===X-Men: From the Ashes===
After the Krakoan Age, Sage interns herself to a psychiatric clinic in the Swiss Alps, when she is found by Forge and recruited to be part of his new X-Force.

==Powers and abilities==
Sage is a mutant whose mind works in the same way as a supercomputer. Her mind has unlimited storage capacity, and she is able to immediately recall any information which she has stored with perfect clarity. The speed of her thoughts allows her to analyze her surroundings for information in an instant, and track the probability of an event by piecing together stored and acquired data. She is able to perform multiple functions at once by allocating a portion of her brain to each task: Sage can replay a film which she has seen in her mind, play a game of internet chess, and focus on battling an opponent simultaneously without any one task distracting her from another. Sage&#x27;s control of her mind gives her total control of her own body. She is able to perfectly recreate physical actions that she has seen once (so long as they are within her physical parameters), and she can control her bodily functions to a degree, like stopping her heart or breathing for as long as is safe.

Sage is also able to &#x27;see&#x27; a person&#x27;s genetic code, reading their DNA sequences for latent and manifested mutations. This allows her to identify mutants, and understand how their powers work more thoroughly than they themselves do. Sage is able to selectively evolve existing genetic traits, as well as catalyze the untapped genetic potential of latent mutants. Once begun, the procedure is irreversible and can often result in unpredictable side effects.

Sage possesses a degree of telepathic ability, allowing her to communicate with others over short distances, project psionic energy blasts, create illusions, and release an astral form within a limited range. By shutting down her telepathy, she is able to create a psychic firewall that blocks all manner of mental intrusion. The firewall can be used to deflect a psychic attack back at its source.

Sage is skilled in the martial arts, and is formidable hand-to-hand combatant thanks to her having complete conscious control over her own body. Her analytical skills and facility with probability also extend to combat situations, allowing her to predict an opponent&#x27;s attacks and initiate the optimal counter-attack. Sage is also self-taught in a wide range of firearms, which she can use with considerable skill and accuracy. Her computer-like mind makes it easy for her to learn new skills and languages.

During her merge with the Exiles&#x27; home, the ancient Panoptichron (also known as the &quot;Crystal Palace&quot;) Sage gained access to all of its functions. She could project her image as a hologram, as well as a solid body. She possessed awareness to the Palace&#x27;s environment, and could teleport objects and living beings from any Earth in the Multiverse.

===Equipment===
* Sage uses a pair of cybernetic sunglasses that allow her to access and interface with computers and data networks.
* She frequently carries and uses firearms and edged weapons, and is highly skilled in their use. Her firearms are sometimes loaded with stun ammunition.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Sage 60th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Mangaverse===
In &quot;X-Men Ronin&quot;, Tessa is part of the Hellfire Club, the daughter of Professor X, and Emma Frost&#x27;s sister.

===What If?===
In the What If special, &quot;What if.. Magneto and Professor X had formed the X-Men together?&quot; an alternate version of Sage was depicted.

In an alternative world where Professor Xavier and Magneto&#x27;s ways did not part, Sage was found by both men and was never sent to spy on Sebastian Shaw in the Hellfire Club. As a result, Sage never helped that world&#x27;s Shaw win his bet with Bogan, and Shaw lost Emma Frost to Bogan. Since Xavier had Sage around to find other mutants for him, he never developed his mutant-tracking computer, Cerebro.

When Xavier finally began developing Cerebro, he used Sage to beta test it, comparing the readings of the device to the readings achieved with Sage&#x27;s own mutant power. In this timeline, Sage served as Professor Xavier&#x27;s Executive Assistant.

===New X-Men===
In the second volume of &quot;New X-Men&quot;, an alternate future is shown where Prodigy retains the knowledge he telepathically absorbs; Sage is shown to be Prodigy&#x27;s secretary. She is responsible for convincing Jeffrey Garrett to destroy China and the death of Jay Guthrie in this alternate timeline.

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future presented in the &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; series of books. X-23, M, and Iceman are sent to Hong Kong to locate and capture the renegade X.S.E. member, Sage. However, Sage uses her considerable espionage skills to ambush X-23, attaching Malice&#x27;s choker to her neck that temporarily overwhelms X-23. Sage has been using the choker to gather as much information from as many people as she can in hopes that she will eventually have access to all of the knowledge/information in the world. Sage removes the choker and attempts to flee just as Iceman arrives and freezes her, allowing the group to safely take her into custody.

==In other media==
* Sage appears in the novelization for &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; as a student of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters.
* Sage appears in &quot;The Gifted&quot;, portrayed by Hayley Lovitt. This version was homeless before joining the Mutant Underground. After losing faith in them, she defects to the Hellfire Club to combat Trask Industries&#x27; Hound program, but is killed by Reeva Payge.

<text>Capital and Interest () is a three-volume work on finance published by Austrian economist Eugen Böhm von Bawerk (1851–1914).

The first two volumes were published in the 1880s when he was teaching at the University of Innsbruck.

The first volume of Capital and Interest, titled &quot;History and Critique of Interest Theories&quot; (1884), is an exhaustive survey of the alternative treatments of the phenomenon of interest: use theories, productivity theories, abstinence theories, and many more.

In this work Böhm-Bawerk built upon the time preference ideas of Carl Menger, insisting that there is always a difference in value between present goods and future goods of equal quality, quantity, and form. Furthermore, the value of future goods diminishes as the length of time necessary for their completion increases.

Böhm-Bawerk cited three reasons for this difference in value. First of all, in a growing economy, the supply of goods will always be larger in the future than it is in the present. Secondly, people have a tendency to underestimate their future needs due to carelessness and shortsightedness. Finally, entrepreneurs would rather initiate production with goods presently available, instead of waiting for future goods and delaying production.

Also included was a critique of Marx&#x27;s exploitation theory. Böhm-Bawerk argued that capitalists do not exploit workers; they accommodate workers – by providing them with income well in advance of the revenue from the output they helped to produce.

Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s &quot;Positive Theory of Capital&quot; (1889), offered as the second volume of Capital and Interest, elaborated on the economy&#x27;s time-consuming production processes and of the interest payments they entail. Book III, Value and Price, built on Menger&#x27;s Principles to present a distinctly Austrian version of marginalism. To illustrate marginalism, he gave the following example:

&quot;Further Essays on Capital and Interest&quot; (1921) was started as appendices to the second volume, but appeared as a third volume.

All three volumes were recently published together as a bound set by Libertarian Press. Libertarian Press&#x27;s edition was translated by Hans Sennholz and first published in 1959.

The Ludwig von Mises Institute made available in 2007 the William Smart translations as &quot;Capital and Interest&quot;, &quot;Positive Theory of Capital&quot;, and &quot;Recent Literature on Interest&quot;.
