<text>Emulate, Inc. (Emulate) is a biotechnology company that commercialized Organs-on-Chips technology—a human cell-based technology that recreates organ-level function to model organs in healthy and diseased states. The technology has applications in pharmaceutical research, product development, testing how different medicines, chemicals, and foods affect human health. Emulate has also worked with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on a precision medicine initiative that uses Organs-on-Chips technology in the clinical setting. This initiative is designed to provide clinicians with better data about how an individual patient may respond to treatment. The company also signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to advance and qualify its Human Emulation System to meet regulatory evaluation for product testing.

== Technology ==

Emulate&#x27;s Organs-on-Chips technology has been used to recreate the function of a variety of different organs, including the liver, intestine, brain, kidney, and lung. The company&#x27;s Organ-Chips are about the size of a AA battery and feature two fluidic channels that create the flow of blood and other fluids. The chips are made of a flexible polymer and can be stretched to recreate similar motions to those of breathing or peristalsis. The company has developed a Human Emulation System that combines its Organ-Chips along with hardware and software apps. The system is designed to reduce some of the complexities of working with Organs-on-Chips technology and is built around the Organ-Chip, which recreates the microenvironment of an organ that is found within the body. An instrument called Zoë Culture Module provides pressure driven flow and recreates perfusion pressure and shear forces like those experienced in the human body.

== History ==
Emulate was spun out from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, where the technology was initially invented and then extensively developed. Scientific Founder Donald Ingber founded the company around 2013. James Coon was co-founder and the first CEO. Jim Corbett is the current CEO.

=== Funding ===
In July 2014, the founders raised $12 million in a first round of financing. In March 2016, the company raised a Series B round of investment of $28 million from repeat and new investors, including NanoDimension, ALS Finding a Cure, Atel Ventures and Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings. In February 2018, Emulate formed strategic partnerships with Roche, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical company, and Takeda, a pharmaceutical company based in Japan. The company raised its most recent round of funding in June 2018 when they announced that they had raised a Series C round of funding led by Silicon Valley–based capital firm Founders Fund. In September 2021, the company raised a Series E round of $82 million.

<doc id="232741" wikidata="Q749342" url="?curid=232741" title="Noble rot">
<text>Noble rot (; ; ; ) is the beneficial form of a grey fungus, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, affecting wine grapes. Infestation by &quot;Botrytis&quot; requires warm and humid conditions, typically around 20 degrees Celsius and above 80% humidity. If the weather stays wet, the undesirable form, &quot;bunch rot&quot; or &quot;grey rot&quot;, adversely affects winemaking by disrupting fermentation and changing the taste, aroma, and appearance of the final wine Grapes typically become infected with &quot;Botrytis&quot; when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined, this form of infection is known as noble rot. Grapes picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Wines produced by this method are known as botrytized wines, and are considered a distinct category of dessert wines.

The primary distinction between botrytized wines and other naturally sweet, non-fortified sweet wines, such as late-harvest wines, ice wines, or straw / raisin wines, lies in the range and richness of aroma compounds generated by the Botrytis cinerea fungal infection of the grapes. Significant differences are also evident in other components, like sugar alcohol and acid composition, due to microbial activity. Descriptors frequently used for these wines highlight flavours of peach, apricot, pear, quince, raisin, and honey, along with unique &quot;botrytis&quot; or roti characteristics. Additionally, a notable feature of botrytized wines is their high acid content, which prevents them from tasting cloying, even with sugar levels often exceeding 200 g/l

== Effect on grapes ==
When Botrytis cinerea infects grapes, it initiates several physiological changes that are crucial for the development of noble rot wines. The fungus penetrates the grape skins while feeding on the grapes, causing microscopic wounds that lead to the evaporation of water from the berries. This dehydration process concentrates the remaining sugars, acids, and flavour compounds within the grapes, resulting in a higher density of these essential components. The weight of the grapes can decrease by up to 60%, leaving behind a shrivelled, sugar-rich berry.

The infection also significantly alters the chemical composition of the grapes with the concentration of sugars in the grape increasing dramatically. This high sugar content is essential for the production of the sweet wines associated with noble rot. The fungus primarily consumes tartaric acid, which is more prevalent than malic or citric acid in healthy grapes, with remaining tartaric acid transformed into gluconic acid and glycerol. During the infection process, the ratio of tartaric to malic acid changes, as observed in Furmint grapes used for Tokaji Aszú, where the ratio shifts from 2:1 in healthy berries to 1:3 in botrytised berries. The increased levels of citric acid and the formation of higher levels of sugar alcohols (such as glycerol, arabitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and inositol) by the fungus contribute to the complexity and mouthfeel of botrytized wines. The grapes metabolic stress response also leads to the production and concentration of various aromatic compounds. The berries concentrate precursors for citrus aromas like lemon and grapefruit, and also generate compounds for stone fruit aromas such as apricot and peach in a direct metabolic response to the fungal attack. Some of these aromatic characteristics, including the distinct honey aroma, are directly attributable to the botrytis fungus itself.

The stress response of grapes to botrytis infection is similar to their response to drought. The breakdown of grape skin cells by the fungus facilitates water evaporation, intensifying the dehydration process. This stress response allows the grapes to adapt metabolically, slowing down the infection rate compared to grey rot, which spreads too quickly for the plant to respond effectively.

==Origins==
According to Hungarian legend, the first aszú (a wine using botrytised grapes) was made by Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes appears before this in the &quot;Nomenklatura&quot; of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various &quot;terroirs&quot; centered on their potential to develop &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;.

There is a popular story that the practice originated independently in Germany in 1775, where the Riesling producers at Schloss Johannisberg (Geisenheim, in the Rheingau region) traditionally awaited the say-so of the estate owner, Heinrich von Bibra, Bishop of Fulda, before cutting their grapes. In this year (so the legend goes), the abbey messenger was robbed en route to delivering the order to harvest and the cutting was delayed for three weeks, time enough for the &quot;botrytis&quot; to take hold. The grapes were presumed worthless and given to local peasants, who produced a surprisingly good, sweet wine which subsequently became known as &quot;Spätlese&quot;, or late harvest wine. In the following few years, several different classes of increasing must weight were introduced, and the original &quot;Spätlese&quot; was further elaborated, first into Auslese in 1787 and later Eiswein in 1858 (although Eiswein is usually made from grapes not affected by &quot;Botrytis&quot;).

==Viticulture and uses==

In some cases, inoculation occurs when spores of the fungus are sprayed over the grapes, while some vineyards depend on natural inoculation from spores present in the environment.

The fungus perforates the grapes&#x27; skin, allowing water in the grape to evaporate during dry conditions, and thereby raising the sugar concentration in the remaining juice.

Some of the finest botrytized wines are picked berry by berry in successive (French for &quot;selections&quot;).

Internationally renowned botrytized wines include the aszú of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary (commonly called Tokaji or Tokay), Sauternes from France – where the process is known as or , and Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese wines from Germany and Austria. Other wines of this type include the Romanian Grasă de Cotnari, French Coteaux du Layon, French Monbazillac, Austrian Ausbruch, South African Noble Late Harvest (NLH) and Croatian Wine maker Vinarija Mihalj from Kutjevo (producing Mačevo brdo-Graševina). Depending on conditions, the grapes may be only minimally botrytized. Botrytized wines are also produced by Californian, and Australian winemakers.

<text>Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic fungus that affects many plant species, although its most notable hosts may be wine grapes. In viticulture, it is commonly known as &quot;botrytis bunch rot&quot;; in horticulture, it is usually called &quot;grey mould&quot; or &quot;gray mold&quot;.

The fungus gives rise to two different kinds of infections on grapes. The first, grey rot, is the result of consistently wet or humid conditions, and typically results in the loss of the affected bunches. The second, noble rot, occurs when drier conditions follow wetter, and can result in distinctive sweet dessert wines, such as Sauternes, the Aszú of Tokaji, or Grasă de Cotnari. The species name &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is derived from the Latin for &quot;grapes like ashes&quot;; although poetic, the &quot;grapes&quot; refers to the bunching of the fungal spores on their conidiophores, and &quot;ashes&quot; just refers to the greyish colour of the spores &quot;en masse&quot;. The fungus is usually referred to by its anamorph (asexual form) name, because the sexual phase is rarely observed. The teleomorph (sexual form) is an ascomycete, Botryotinia fuckeliana, also known as &quot;Botryotinia cinerea&quot; (see taxonomy box).

==Etymology==

&quot;&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;botrys &quot;(βότρυς) meaning &quot;grapes&quot;, combined with the Neo-Latin suffix &quot;-itis&quot; for disease. Botryotinia fuckeliana was named by mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary in honor of another mycologist, Karl Wilhelm Gottlieb Leopold Fuckel. Synonyms for the sexual stage are:

* &quot;Botrytis fuckeliana&quot; 
* &quot;Botrytis gemella&quot; 
* &quot;Botrytis grisea&quot; 
* &quot;Botrytis vulgaris&quot; 
* &quot;Haplaria grisea&quot; 
* &quot;fuckeliana&quot; 
* &quot;Phymatotrichum gemellum&quot; 
* &quot;Polyactis vulgaris&quot; 
* &quot;Sclerotinia fuckeliana&quot; 
==Hosts and symptoms==
===Hosts===

The disease, gray mold, affects more than 200 dicotyledonous plant species and a few monocotyledonous plants found in temperate and subtropical regions, and potentially over a thousand species. Serious economic losses can be a result of this disease to both field and greenhouse grown crops. The causal agent, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; can infect mature or senescent tissues, plants prior to harvest, or seedlings. There is a wide variety of hosts infected by this pathogen including protein crops, fiber crops, oil crops, and horticultural crops. Horticultural crops include vegetables (examples are chickpeas, lettuce, broccoli, and beans) and small fruit crops (examples are grape, strawberry, raspberry, and blackberry), these are most severely affected and devastated by gray mold. Plant organs affected include fruits, flowers, leaves, storage organs, and shoots.

===Symptoms and signs===

Symptoms vary across plant organs and tissues. &quot;B. cinerea&quot; is a soft rot that will have a collapsed and water soaked appearance on soft fruit and leaves. Brown lesions may develop slowly on undeveloped fruit. Twigs infected with gray mold will die back. Blossoms will cause fruit drop and injury, such as ridging on developing and mature fruit. Symptoms are visible at wound sites where the fungus begins to rot the plant. Gray masses with a velvety appearance are conidia on the plant tissues are a sign of plant pathogen. These conidia are asexual spores that will continue to infect the plant and surrounding hosts throughout the growing season making this a polycyclic disease.

Plants can produce localized lesions when a pathogen attacks. An oxidative burst causes hypersensitive cell death called a hypersensitive response (HR). This soft rot can trigger HR to assist in colonization. &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, as a necrotrophic pathogen, exploits the dead tissue for its pathogenicity or its ability to cause disease. Susceptible plants cannot use the HR to protect against &quot;B. cinerea&quot;.

==Biology==
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is characterized by abundant hyaline conidia (asexual spores) borne on grey, branching tree-like conidiophores. The fungus also produces highly resistant sclerotia as survival structures in older cultures. It overwinters as sclerotia or intact mycelia, both of which germinate in spring to produce conidiophores. The conidia, dispersed by wind and by rain-water, cause new infections. &quot;B. cinerea&quot; performs an asexual cycle over the summer season.

Different strains show considerable genetic variability.

&quot;Gliocladium roseum&quot; is a fungal parasite of &quot;B. cinerea&quot;.

The hypothetical protein BcKMO was shown to positively regulate growth and development. It showed a great similarity to the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase encoding gene in eukaryotes.

Overexpression of the gene &quot;&quot; produces altered versions of the transcription factor &quot;mrr1&quot;, which in turn confer a multiple fungicide resistance phenotype known as . An even higher overexpression yields &quot;mrr1&quot; composed partly of , yielding MDR1h phenotypes with even more anilinopyrimidine- and phenylpyrrole- resistance.

==Environment==
Gray mold favors moist, humid, and warm environmental conditions between . Temperature, relative humidity, and wetness duration produce a conducive environment that is favorable for inoculation of mycelium or conidia. Controlled environments, such as crop production greenhouses, provide the moisture and high temperatures that favor the spreading and development of the pathogen &quot;B. cinerea.&quot;

Standing water on plant leaf surfaces provides a place for spores to germinate. Humid conditions can result from improper irrigation practice, plants placed too close together, or the structure of the greenhouse not allowing for efficient ventilation and air flow. Ventilation at night significantly reduces the incidence of gray mold.

Melanized sclerotium allows &quot;B. cinerea&quot; to survive for years in the soil. Sclerotia and the asexual conidia spores contribute to the widespread infection of the pathogen.

A low pH is preferred by the gray mold to perform well. &quot;B. cinerea&quot; can acidify its environment by secreting organic acids, like oxalic acid. By acidifying its surroundings, cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) are enhanced, plant-protection enzymes are inhibited, stomatal closure is deregulated, and pH signaling is mediated to facilitate its pathogenesis.

==Viticulture==
In the &quot;Botrytis&quot; infection known as &quot;noble rot&quot; (&quot;pourriture noble&quot; in French, or &quot;Edelfäule&quot; in German), the fungus removes water from the grapes, leaving behind a higher percent of solids, such as sugars, fruit acids and minerals. This results in a more intense, concentrated final product. The wine is often said to have an aroma of honeysuckle and a bitter finish on the palate.

A distinct fermentation process initially caused by nature, the combination of geology, climate and specific weather led to the particular balance of beneficial fungus while leaving enough of the grape intact for harvesting. The Chateau d&#x27;Yquem is the only Premier Cru Supérieur Sauternes, largely due to the vineyard&#x27;s susceptibility to noble rot.

&quot;Botrytis&quot; complicates the fermentation process during winemaking. &quot;Botrytis&quot; produces an anti-fungal compound that kills yeast and often results in the fermentation stopping before the wine has accumulated sufficient levels of alcohol.

Botrytis bunch rot is another condition of grapes caused by &quot;B. cinerea&quot; that causes great losses for the wine industry. It is always present on the fruitset, however, it requires a wound to start a bunch rot infection. Wounds can come from insects, wind, accidental damage, etc. To control botrytis bunch rot there are a number of fungicides available on the market. Generally, these should be applied at bloom, bunch closure and veraison (the most important being the bloom application). Some winemakers are known to use the German method of fermentation and prefer having a 5% bunch rot rate in their grapes and will usually hold the grapes on the vine a week longer than normal.

==Horticulture==
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; affects many other plants.

===Strawberries===
It is economically important on soft fruits such as strawberries and bulb crops. Unlike wine grapes, the affected strawberries are not edible and are discarded. To minimize infection in strawberry fields, good ventilation around the berries is important to prevent moisture being trapped among leaves and berries. A number of bacteria have been proven to act as natural antagonists to &quot;B. cinerea&quot; in controlled studies.

===Other plants===

In greenhouse horticulture, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is well known as a cause of considerable damage in tomatoes.

The infection also affects rhubarb, snowdrops, white meadowfoam, western hemlock, Douglas-fir, cannabis, and &quot;Lactuca sativa&quot;. UV-C treatment against &quot;B. cinerea&quot; was investigated by Vàsquez &quot;et al.&quot;, 2017. They find it increases phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and production of phenolics. This in turn decreases &quot;L. sativa&quot;″s susceptibility. Potassium bicarbonate-based fungicide may be used.

==Human disease==
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; mold on grapes may cause &quot;winegrower&#x27;s lung&quot;, a rare form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (a respiratory allergic reaction in predisposed individuals).

==Mycoviruses of &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;==
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; not only infects plants, it also hosts several mycoviruses itself (see the table/image).

A range of phenotypic alterations due to the mycoviral infection have been observed from symptomless to mild impact, or more severe phenotypic changes including reduction in pathogenicity, growth/suppression of mycelia, sporulation and sclerotia production, formation of abnormal colony sectors (Wu et al., 2010) and virulence.

==Management==
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; can be managed through cultural, chemical, and biological practices.

There are no resistant species to the gray mold rot. Gray mold can be culturally controlled by monitoring the amount and timing of fertilizer applications to reduce the amount of fruit rot. Excessive application of nitrogen will increase the incidence of disease while not improving yields.

Not planting cultivars that have an upright or dense growth habit can reduce disease as these limit airflow and are favorable for the pathogen. Spacing of plants so they are not touching will increase airflow allowing the area to dry out and reduce the spread of disease. Pruning or purposeful removal of diseased, dead, or overgrown limbs on a regular schedule can also help to improve air movement.

Sanitation by removing dead or dying plant tissue in the fall will decrease inoculum levels as there is no debris for the sclerotium or mycelia to overwinter. Removing debris in the spring will remove inoculum from the site. Disposal of berries during harvest that have signs and symptoms of gray mold will reduce inoculum for the following year.

Biochar, a form of charcoal, can be applied as a soil amendment to strawberry plants to reduce the severity of the fungal disease by stimulating defense pathways within the plant.

Gray mold can be chemically controlled with well-timed fungicide applications starting during the first bloom. Timing can reduce the chance of resistance and will save on costs.

Biological controls or microbial antagonists used for disease suppression, have been successfully used in Europe and Brazil in the form of fungi-like &quot;Trichoderma harzianum&quot; Rifai and &quot;Clonostachys rosea&quot; f. &quot;rosea&quot; Bainier (syn. &quot;Gliocladium roseum&quot;). &quot;Trichoderma&quot; species especially, have been shown to control gray mold.

Multiple fungicide resistance is a problem in many production areas.

<text>Zephaniah Williams (1795 – 8 May 1874) was a Welsh coal miner and Chartist campaigner, who was one of the leaders of the Newport Rising of 1839. Found guilty of high treason, he was condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in Tasmania. Eventually he was pardoned, and his discovery of coal on that island earned him a fortune.

== Early life ==

Williams was born near Argoed, Sirhowy Valley, Monmouthshire, Wales, with much of his childhood spent near the then village of Blackwood, also living for some periods in Caerphilly and Nantyglo. He was fortunate enough not only to have a fair amount of schooling, and becoming literate in both English and Welsh, but also having the character to be self-educated, particularly studying geology.

At the age of 25 he married Joan, then living for some time in Machen and had a son Llewellyn. Daughters Jane and Rhoda were born in 1825 and 1827 respectively.

At the age of 33 he came to Sirhowy, as a free thinking rationalist, with strong radical views, rather than one of religious conviction. Williams believed that Christ was nothing more than a good man; but a sufficiently good man that had he been living at Coalbrookvale in 1839 his house would have been pulled down over his head by the mine-owners. Apparently, stories said that Williams spat every time the name of Christ was mentioned. In 1830 Williams launched a Political Union in Tredegar and the following year, in 1831, is thought to have been instrumental in forming the Humanists/Dynolwyr of Nantyglo.

He became a coal miner or collier and later a Master Collier at Blaina and innkeeper, keeping the Royal Oak at Nantyglo, from where he used to pay his colliers.

== Chartist ==

He was a free thinking man in religious matters and the local Working Men&#x27;s Association met at his home. 
On the wall in The Royal Oak was &#x27;a picture of the Crucifixion with the enigmatic caption: &#x27;This is the man who stole the ass&#x27;. At the Coach and Horses in Blackwood, Zephaniah Williams met John Frost - a magistrate and supporter of the cause.

It was at this time only natural that such a man would emerge as a natural leader during the Chartist movement in south east Wales.

He was subsequently prosecuted for his part in the Chartist Newport Rising at Newport, Monmouthshire on 4 November 1839.

== The Newport Rising ==
Along with John Frost and William Jones, he led a large column of men from the Nantyglo area to march south reaching the outskirts of the town [Newport] at about 9am; halting at St. Woolos Church, then moving as a mass to Stow Hill, continuing to the square, and on to the Westgate Hotel, Newport. Thirty soldiers (red-coats) were at the Westgate Hotel.

This site is sometimes regarded as the greatest armed rebellion in 19th century Britain.

The men assembled at the Royal Oak before marching as one into Newport. Known as the &quot;Blackwood Infidel&quot;, he had a reputation as a political Radical, and as an individual prepared to settle disputes in less conventional ways. Some histories refer to his having been prosecuted at Usk in 1833 for blowing up a coal mine in a dispute with the mineowner. Other histories refer to him having been an atheist who vigorously promoted his views - very controversial at the time.

== Transportation to Australia for life ==

For his part in the Chartist Rising on Newport he was sentenced by The Special Commission held at Shire Hall, Monmouth on 16 January 1840 with the verdict of &#x27;guilty of high treason&#x27; - sentencing to death by hanging, drawing, and quartering.

But his sentence was commuted and he was transported for life to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania, Australia), arriving at the colony on the last day of June 1840. In 1848 he described the terrible treatment handed out in the colony, &#x27;Many have I known, though guilty of the offence for which they suffered, commit murder in order to expire on the gallows rather than endure the punishment&#x27;. Once there he made plans to escape, but remained.

He was given a conditional pardon in 1854 allowing him to live anywhere outside of the UK; this was amended to a full pardon in 1856. He decided to remain in Tasmania, and brought his wife and family out from Wales to Australia. He discovered coal on the island and made a considerable fortune from it, so founding the Tasmanian coal trade.

He died a prosperous man at Launceston, Tasmania on 8 May 1874.

==Letter to Benjamin Williams by Zephaniah Williams==

This letter (printed by John Partridge of Newport) to Rev. Benjamin Williams, who was a nonconformist minister, written in Sirhowy in 1831, expresses his [Z. Williams] view on a number of subjects. The extracts are as follows :

On Rationalism

I would advise all men to take nothing upon trust but all on trial, whether in politics, religion, ethics, or anything else : to sit down with a determined resolution: to examine closely: and to be directed by that which reason most approves.

On Prejudice

When prejudice has shut the eye of the mind the brightest rays of truth shine in vain. When men are thus incapacitated for the reception of truth they become liable to become guilty of injustice, ill-nature, and ill manners to others; and insensible of what is properly owing to themselves.

On Friendship

We know that man is a social being and that consequently he has a capacity for friendship. Friendship is as old as the first formation of society and in its own nature so necessary that I know not how a social being could exist without it.

On The Doctrine of Pre-destination

Your conduct and your doctrine are at variance; for you are holding to your flock that God will have the number which he has decreed, and afterwards go into my neighbours to persuade them that an impotent mortal like myself may be the means of leading an infinite number of those who are already decreed for happiness (for you could not mean that such as are reprobate could be endangered by my heresy) into eternal misery. According to your tenets I could not be but fulfilling what I was ordained to fulfil, and the act, in itself, is right.

On Inconsistency in the Use of Reason

Those who distrust reason in matters of faith deem its free and unshackled exercise, not withstanding all their concessions in their pious moods as of essential importance in worldly matters, in which they forget not to use the wisdom of serpents, however wanting in the innocence of doves.

<text>George Keith (1638/1639 – 27 March 1716) was a Scottish religious leader, a Presbyterian turned Quaker turned Anglican. He was born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, to a Presbyterian family and received an M.A. from the University of Aberdeen. Keith joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the 1660s, accompanying George Fox, William Penn, and Robert Barclay on a mission to the Netherlands and Germany in 1677. 

In 1685, three years after Barclay had been made the nonresident governor of the Province of East Jersey (part of the present-day American state of New Jersey), Keith traveled there to take the post of Surveyor-General. In 1686 he ran the first survey to mark out the border between West Jersey and East Jersey, which is today still known as the Keith line. Around 1691 Keith decided that Quakers had strayed too far from orthodox Christianity and began to have sharp disagreements with his fellow believers. He first broke with Philadelphia Yearly Meeting to form a short-lived group called the Christian Quakers in the colonies. In 1693, he and his fellow Keithians published An &quot;Exhortation &amp; Caution to Friends Concerning Buying or Keeping of Negroes&quot;, one of the earliest printed antislavery tracts in British North America. 

After returning to England, he was disowned by London Yearly Meeting in 1694. In 1699, he attacked William Penn and other Quakers as &quot;Deists&quot;. He was ordained to the Church of England ministry in May 1700. Sponsored by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Keith returned to the American colonies as a missionary from 1702 to 1704, trying to win over Quakers and others. Keith invigorated Anglican congregations in Perth Amboy. Upon returning to England, Keith served as rector at the parish of Edburton, Sussex until his death on 27 March 1716.

==Early life and education ==
Born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, to a Presbyterian family. He was the son of Sir John Alexander and Jeanne Watsonne Keith. He married Elizabeth Johnston. He received an M.A. from the University of Aberdeen. Keith joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the 1660s, accompanying George Fox, William Penn, and Robert Barclay on a mission to the Netherlands and Germany in 1677. In the meanwhile, he produced in 1674 the first English translation of Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; based on Edward Pococke&#x27;s Latin version. He also participated in the 1676 Aberdeen disputes over Barclay&#x27;s &quot;Theses Theologicae&quot;, authoring with Barclay a defense of the &quot;Theses&quot; titled &quot;Quakerism Confirmed&quot;.

==Career==
In 1685, three years after Barclay had been made the nonresident governor of the Province of East Jersey (part of the present-day American state of New Jersey), Keith traveled there to take the post of Surveyor-General. In 1686 he ran the first survey to mark out the border between West Jersey and East Jersey, which is today still known as the Keith line. He moved to Philadelphia in 1688 to serve as headmaster at the Friends School there.

For his survey work, the Proprietors gave him large grants of land including seven hundred acres in Monmouth County where he founded the town of Freehold (which broke off and became Marlboro). He established his home in a Quaker settlement near Topanemus where he helped to build a meeting house in which he preached to the people on the Quaker faith.

Around 1691 Keith decided that Quakers had strayed too far from orthodox Christianity and began to have sharp disagreements with his fellow believers. He first broke with Philadelphia Yearly Meeting to form a short-lived group called the Christian Quakers in the colonies. Also the Quakers, who came from Krefeld and were already involved in the Quaker anti-slavery petition in Germantown in 1688, were also involved in the controversy. The Krefeld Quaker advocates were the brothers Abraham and Hermann op den Graeff. Their opponent was their brother Derick op den Graeff. The latter was also a co-signer of the judgment against Kaith, which excluded him from the Quaker community. He was fined five pounds by a secular court. The printer of a brochure went to prison. No other German family was as deeply involved in the conflict as the Op den Graeffs. In 1693, he and his fellow Keithians published An &quot;Exhortation &amp; Caution to Friends Concerning Buying or Keeping of Negroes&quot;, one of the earliest printed antislavery tracts in British North America. David Brion Davis, a leading scholar of abolition and slavery, argues that Keith&#x27;s &quot;Exhortation&quot; foreshadowed &quot;the major religious themes of nineteenth-century abolitionism.&quot; After returning to England, he was disowned by London Yearly Meeting in 1694. In 1699 he attacked William Penn and other Quakers as &quot;Deists&quot;. He was ordained to the Church of England ministry in May 1700.

Sponsored by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Keith returned to the American colonies as a missionary from 1702 to 1704, trying to win over Quakers and others. Keith invigorated Anglican congregations in Perth Amboy,
Burlington and Concord Township, Pennsylvania. He preached in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1703, and left behind his daughter, Anne, who had likewise returned to the Anglican fold, unlike her husband, Quaker George Walker of Old Point Comfort. 

Upon returning to England, Keith served as rector at the parish of Edburton, Sussex until his death on 27 March 1716. He is buried in the churchyard and his grave has an inscribed stone installed in 1932.

<doc id="232762" wikidata="Q777743" url="?curid=232762" title="Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom">
<text>The order of precedence in the United Kingdom is the sequential hierarchy for Peers of the Realm, officers of state, senior members of the clergy, holders of the various Orders of Chivalry, and is mostly determined, but not limited to, birth order, place in the line of succession, or distance from the reigning monarch. The order of precedence can also be applied to other persons in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom:
* England and Wales
* Scotland
* Northern Ireland

Separate orders exist for males and females.

==Determination of precedence==
The order of precedence is determined by various methods. The House of Lords Precedence Act 1539 (which technically applies only to determine seating in the House of Lords Chamber) and the Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland generally set precedence for members of the nobility. The statutes of the various Orders of Chivalry set precedence for their members. In other cases, precedence may be decided by the sovereign&#x27;s order, by a Royal Warrant of Precedence, by letters patent, by Acts of Parliament, or by custom.

==Source of precedence==
One may acquire precedence for various reasons. Firstly, one may be an office-holder. Secondly, one may be of a particular degree such as duke. Thirdly, in the case of women, one may be the wife of a title-holder (note that wives acquire precedence due to their husbands, but husbands do not gain any special precedence due to their wives). Finally, one may be the son or daughter of a title-holder.

One does not gain precedence as a child of a lady, unless that lady is a peeress in her own right. Furthermore, if a daughter of a peer marries a commoner, then she retains her precedence as a daughter of a peer. However, if she marries a peer, then her precedence is based on her husband&#x27;s status, and not on her father&#x27;s.

==Royal family==
The King or Queen of the United Kingdom, as the sovereign, is always first in the order of precedence. A king is followed by his queen consort, the first in the order of precedence for women. The reverse, however, is not always true for queens regnant. There is no established law of precedence for a prince consort, so he is usually specially granted precedence above all other males by letters patent or, on the other hand, may rank lower than the heir apparent or the heir presumptive, even if the heir is his own son, such as with Prince Albert and Edward VII, who outranked their father as Prince of Wales.

===Current practice===
* Letters patent dated 31 December 2012 declared all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title, and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour. Before Charles III&#x27;s accession to the throne, all of Prince William&#x27;s, then Duke of Cambridge, children were known as prince or princess. However, as Prince George, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, currently has no children, no person presently qualifies for HRH status under these letters patent.
* There is no specific place in the order for a great-grandchild of the sovereign (no matter how senior in the order of succession). The sons of a &quot;duke of the blood royal&quot; are entitled to precedence after all non-royal dukes, pursuant to the unrevoked Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Order of 1520 as amended in 1595. The daughters have the equivalent position in the women&#x27;s order.

==Officers of State==
In England and Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury is the highest in precedence following the royal family. Then come, assuming the post of Lord High Steward is vacant (as it usually has been since 1421), the Lord Chancellor, and the Archbishop of York. Next come the Prime Minister (since 1905), the Lord President of the Privy Council, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords (since July 2006), the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (since October 2009), the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales (since November 2007) and the Lord Privy Seal.

The precedence of the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Earl Marshal, the Lord Steward and the Lord Chamberlain are determined by the rank and class of the peerage of the holders of such offices.

In Scotland, the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and the Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, if Peers, rank after the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords. If not so, then they rank after the younger sons of dukes. The Hereditary High Constable of Scotland and the Master of the Household of Scotland rank above dukes. If the Keepers of the Seals are Peers, then the Keepers precede the High Constable and Master.

==Peers of the Realm==
The ranks of Peers are as follows: Duke (and Duchess), Marquess (and Marchioness), Earl (and Countess), Viscount (and Viscountess), and Baron (and Baroness) together with Scottish Lord (and Lady) of Parliament.

Within their own respective ranks, the rank of Peers correspond to the age (&quot;venerability&quot;) of the creation of their peerages; that is, the older the title, the more senior the title&#x27;s holder is. However, seniority rules also depend on the country within the current UK where the title originated, so that English peers hold the highest ranks, followed by Scottish peers. After English and Scottish peers, peers created in Great Britain as whole in (1707–1801) follow. Together over the Pre-Union Peerage of Ireland (pre-1801), and together they all take precedence over either the senior Peerage of the United Kingdom (post-1801), or the junior Post-Union Peerage of Ireland (1801–1922).

Subject to the same governing rules as detailed in the paragraphs above, the rank of the wives of Peers is also governed by the venerability (age) of the peerage. A dowager Peeress (widow of a deceased Peer) would however always precede the wife of the present Peer.

Barons and Baronesses of the life peerage rank immediately below Barons and Baronesses of the hereditary peerage and Scottish Lords and Ladies in Parliament.

==Primates, archbishops, bishops, Scottish Lord High Commissioners and moderators==
In England and Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England, is the most senior person outside of Royalty, and after the Lord Chancellor, immediately followed by the Archbishop of York, Primate of England. Primates (i.e. archbishops) and bishops of the Church of England rank immediately above Peers. First come the Bishops of London and Durham, followed by the Bishop of Winchester, followed by the other diocesan bishops in order of seniority, and then the suffragan bishops in order of seniority.

The Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Anglican Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe, whose &quot;Sees&quot; are full and integral parts of the Ecclesiastical Provinces of York and Canterbury, respectively, are also usually included as suffragan bishops of the Church of England for the purpose of precedence.

See the list of Lords Spiritual for the most senior 21 diocesan bishops ordered by seniority.

In Scotland, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ranks immediately below the sovereign or consort (depending on their respective sex), but only when the General Assembly is in session, and immediately followed by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

According to the &quot;unofficial&quot; order of precedence for Northern Ireland published by the publishers of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, 106th Edition, , the precedence of &quot;all&quot; of the primates and archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland and the Church of Ireland, together with the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, are to be determined solely by seniority, according to the dates of consecration or translation, or the date of election, in the case of the Presbyterian Moderator, without any presumption of automatic Roman Catholic or Protestant seniority, Anglican or Presbyterian.

==Baronets, knights and holders of state honours==
The two highest orders of chivalry in England and Wales, and in Scotland, are the Order of the Garter, and the Order of the Thistle, respectively. Knights/Ladies Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG/LG) and Knights/Ladies of the Order of the Thistle (KT/LT) precede baronets (Bt./Btss.). After the baronets then come the remaining members of all the other British orders of chivalry, starting with Knights/Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), in the following order of their ranks: Knight or Dame Grand Cross, Knight or Dame Commander, Commander or Companion, Lieutenant or Officer, and Member.

For individual members with equivalent ranks but of different orders, precedence is accorded based on the seniority of the British orders of chivalry: the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order, and the Order of the British Empire. For equivalent ranks and orders, those appointed earlier precede those appointed later. Knights Bachelor come after Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

Wives of Knights Companion of the Order of the Garter, Knights of the Order of the Thistle, and Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commanders, and Commanders or Companions of the other orders receive precedence based on their husbands&#x27; positions. Wives of individuals of a certain rank follow in precedence after female holders of the same rank. Thus, wives of Knights Grand Cross follow Dames Grand Cross.

Wives of baronets go immediately above all Dames Grand Cross of the British chivalric orders, and therefore are below Ladies Companion and wives of Knights Companion of the Order of the Garter, Ladies and wives of Knights of the Order of the Thistle, and wives of Knights of the Order of St Patrick. Baronets&#x27; widows follow rules similar to dowager peeresses: a widow of a previous baronet comes immediately before the wife of the present baronet.

<doc id="232763" wikidata="Q69596" url="?curid=232763" title="Thumri">
<text>Thumri () is a vocal genre or style of Indian music. The term &quot;thumri&quot; is derived from the Hindi verb &quot;thumuknaa&quot;, which means &quot;to walk with a dancing gait in such a way that the ankle-bells tinkle.&quot; The form is, thus, connected with dance, dramatic gestures, mild eroticism, evocative love poetry and folk songs, especially from Uttar Pradesh, though there are regional variations.

The text is romantic or devotional in nature, the lyrics are usually in Bhojpuri, Awadhi and Brij Bhasha. Thumree is characterized by its sensuality, and by a greater flexibility with the &quot;raga&quot;.

&quot;Thumri&quot; is also used as a generic name for some other, even lighter, forms such as Dadra, Hori, Kajari, Sawani, Jhoola, and Chaiti, even though each of them has their own structure and content — either lyrical or musical or both—and so the exposition of these forms vary. Like Indian classical music itself, some of these forms have their origin in folk literature and music.

==Structure==
As in khayal, thumri has two parts, the &quot;sthayi&quot; and the &quot;antara.&quot; It favours &quot;tala-s&quot; such as &quot;Deepchandi&quot;, &quot;Roopak&quot;, &quot;Addha,&quot; and &quot;Punjabi.&quot; These &quot;tala-s&quot; are characterized by a special lilt, nearly absent in the &quot;tala-s&quot; used in &quot;khayal&quot;. &quot;Thumri&quot; compositions are mostly in &quot;raga-s&quot; such as &quot;Kafi&quot;, &quot;Khamaj&quot;, &quot;Jogiya&quot;, &quot;Bhairavi&quot;, &quot;Pilu&quot; and &quot;Pahadi.&quot; A common feature of these and other such &quot;raga-s&quot; is the free movement they allow the artist, since they do not depend for their identity on rigidly formulated tonal sequences, irrespective of the compositions involved. In fact, one may say that they have a built-in provision for mixing &quot;raga-s&quot; or for moving out of the &quot;raga&quot; actually presented in order to add colour to the proceedings.

==Origins==
The origins of Thumri can be traced back to the time of Jayadeva, Ramanuja, and Ramanand. It reached its peak popularity during the era of Shri Chaitanya (circa 16th century AD), whose Nagar Kirtan (Hare Krishna Hare Rama) stirred the masses into emotional ecstasies. The evolution of Thumri was inspired by the Vaishnavism sect, especially the devotion to Krishna, which expressed divine love. Later, the philosophies of Vaishnavism and Sufism played a key role in shaping both Thumri and Kathak. The Thumri style of singing primarily developed from festival and seasonal folk songs such as Holi, Chaiti, Sawan, Kajri, and Dadra, originating from eastern Uttar Pradesh.

A mention of Thumri is found in the 19th century, with a link to the classical dance form Kathak. This was the &quot;bandish ki thumri&quot; or &quot;bol-baant&quot; and it found great patronage and evolved mostly in Lucknow in the court of nawab Wajid Ali Shah. At that time, it was a song sung by tawaifs or courtesans. According to historical records, a new version of thumri arose in the late 19th century, which was independent of dance, and much more slow-paced. This form was called &quot;bol-banav&quot; and it evolved in Varanasi.

==Thumri and khayal==
Unlike the khayal, which pays meticulous attention to unfolding a raga, thumri restricts itself to expressing the countless hues of shringar by combining melody and words. The contours of a khayal are most definitely broader and fluid. Thus, a khayal singer is capable of encompassing and expressing a wide range of complex emotions. A thumri singer goes straight to the emotional core of a composition and evokes each yarn of amorous feeling, each strand of sensuous sentiment, with great discretion. Khayal aims at achieving poise and splendour; thumri is quicksilver in tone and ardently romantic in spirit. It needs a delicate heart, and a supple and soulful voice capable of expressing several shadings and colours of tones to bring out its beauty. 

==Noted thumri artists==

===Purab ang===
Well-known artists of the &#x27;purab ang&#x27; thumri&#x27; of the Benaras gharana or Banaras gayaki include Rasoolan Bai (1902–1974), Siddheshwari Devi (1908–1977), Girija Devi (1929–2017), Mahadev Prasad Mishra (1906–1995) and Chhannulal Mishra (b. 1936).

Some other singers of thumri are Gauhar Jan (1873–1930), Begum Akhtar (1914–1974), Shobha Gurtu (1925–2004), Noor Jehan (1926–2000) and Nirmala Devi (1927-1996). The &quot;bol banao&quot; style has a slow tempo and is concluded by a &quot;laggi&quot;, a faster phase where the tabla player has some freedom of improvisation.

Another stalwart in the genre of thumri was Naina Devi (1917–1993), who was married to a royal family but later devoted her life to the singing of the song of Tawaifs. For a member of the royal family to take such a step in those days meant fighting countless social stigmas that had enough power to totally alienate someone from the society, but she had the support of her husband.

===Classical thumri===

Some khyal singers took an interest in thumrī and sang it their own way, as in the case of Abdul Karim Khan, Faiyaz Khan, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Bhimsen Joshi, Madhav Gudi, Rajan and Sajan Mishra, Barkat Ali Khan, Jagdish Prasad and Prabha Atre.

Today thumrī is sometimes sung at the end of khyal concerts as a concluding item.
Besides the tabla and the tanpura, other typical instruments in thumri are sarangi, harmonium and swarmandal. The reason as to why Thumri concludes an occasion is because it has a lasting emotional impact on the audience.
==Lyrics==

Thumrī singers pay considerable attention to the lyrics, though they may be difficult to follow in the ornamented enunciation. This is especially where the focus is on love, and many lyrics deal with separation or &quot;viraha&quot;. Krishna&#x27;s &quot;ras leela&quot; or love play with Radha and other gopis of Vrindavan appear frequently. As an example, here are the lyrics of a thumrī composed by the medieval poet Lalan, celebrating Krishna&#x27;s flute – how its tunes are driving Radha mad. Braj or Vrindavan is where Krishna is indulging in this love play; Radha is the &quot;Girl of Braj&quot;.

<text>Enter the Matrix is a 2003 action-adventure video game developed by Shiny Entertainment and published by Infogrames under the Atari brand name. The first game based on &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series, its story is concurrent with that of the film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and features over an hour of original footage, written and directed by the Wachowskis and starring the cast of the films, produced for the game.

Released in May 2003, the same month as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; was simultaneously produced with &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. While it received mixed reviews from critics, the game sold 5 million copies as of May 2004.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; gives players control of two of the supporting characters from &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot;, Ghost (Anthony Wong) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), members of the same group of rebels as Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo, the protagonists of the series. Niobe is the Captain of the &quot;Logos&quot;, the fastest ship in the rebel fleet. Ghost is the ship&#x27;s first mate, weapons guru, and a deep-thinking, philosophical assassin. The game takes place at roughly the same time as the events in &quot;Reloaded&quot;.

Players play as either Niobe or Ghost, each of whom have slight variations during their story. Most levels involve controlling players in a third-person perspective, using guns and fighting skills to defeat opponents and complete level objectives. At any time, players can activate bullet time (called &quot;Focus&quot; in the game) which slows down time, giving players the ability to perform actions such as shooting in midair and dodging bullets. Some levels involve one-on-one martial arts fighting against single opponents. In levels involving vehicles, such as driving a car or piloting the &quot;Logos&quot;, the style of game play depends on the selected player, commonly with Niobe maneuvering the vehicles to avoid obstacles, whilst Ghost takes control of a gun to fight off incoming enemies. A hacking system allows players to enter codes, which can unlock special skills, weapons and secrets, such as a 2-player versus mode.

==Plot==
The story begins with Niobe, captain of the &quot;Logos&quot;, and Ghost, her first mate, retrieving a package left in the Matrix by the crew of the recently destroyed rebel ship &quot;Osiris&quot;. After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package, which turns out to be a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are approaching with an army of at least 250,000 Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense.

With this in mind, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in, although Niobe and Ghost are able to help their allies escape. They then encounter the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, who leads them to safety through a door he created. The Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now operates an illegal smuggling ring within the program. Ultimately, the Merovingian destroys the key, but Niobe and Ghost are able to escape, when the Keymaker realizes that it is too early for the key to be given to Neo.

Niobe later volunteers to go find the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, the ship captained by Morpheus, upon which Neo serves, and the only ship yet to return to Zion. Upon finding the ship and its crew, and helping them escape from the Matrix, Niobe and Ghost agree to help in Neo&#x27;s mission against the machines, agreeing to destroy a power plant. After this mission is completed, the Oracle, a program that often gives the humans advice, requests that the player character come and speak to her. After their conversation, the player is confronted by Smith, a rogue Agent that seeks to destroy both the human and machine worlds. The player character barely escapes from the hundreds of Smith copies and the Matrix. Once out, the &quot;Logos&quot; is attacked by the machines. They defeat the machines by setting off an EMP, which disables their own ship in the process. As the game ends, Niobe and Ghost wait in the &quot;Logos&quot;, hoping that they will be rescued. The two wonder what&#x27;s coming but believe that it will be &quot;a hell of a ride.&quot;

Aside from Ghost and Niobe, there are numerous secondary characters in &quot;Enter The Matrix&quot;.

==Connections to the films==
&quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; was designed, like the 2003 animated film &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, to be an integral part of the &quot;Matrix&quot; &quot;milieu&quot;. The game includes one hour of live action 35 mm film footage written and directed specifically for the game by The Wachowskis. The martial arts moves and game engine cutscenes feature actions motion captured directly from the films&#x27; actors and stunt doubles to recreate their unique fighting style, and were created under the supervision of the series&#x27; fight scene choreographer Yuen Woo-ping.

The player learns that Neo is not the only target of Persephone&#x27;s predilection for trading kisses for esoteric information; Niobe and Ghost are both put into positions where they must submit to her whims in order to gain critical information. Significant also to the continuity of the &quot;Matrix&quot; universe is the first appearance of actress Mary Alice in the role of the Oracle. Gloria Foster, the original actress, had died of complications related to diabetes early in the production of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. She had filmed her scenes for &quot;Reloaded&quot;, but was yet to complete her work on &quot;Revolutions&quot;. The game includes a sequence specifically explaining her change of appearance, as a result of an attack on her by the Merovingian. The Merovingian&#x27;s attack was facilitated by a sacrificial trade with the compassionate program Rama-Kandra. The Merovingian acquired the deletion codes for the Oracle&#x27;s external &quot;shell&quot;, and in exchange, he gave Rama-Kandra&#x27;s daughter, Sati, her freedom, despite her lack of purpose in the machine world. The Oracle foretells, however, that Sati will play an important role in both the Matrix and the real world.

==Development==
Plans for a &quot;Matrix&quot; video game began in November 1999, following the film&#x27;s release. The Wachowskis had talks with Shiny Entertainment and Konami to develop the title around this time. At E3 2000, the title was officially announced, with Shiny Entertainment as the developer and their then-owner Interplay Entertainment as the publisher. The game would be based on the then-untitled second movie and would be released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002, the same year the sequel was due to release. 

On May 1, 2001, Interplay announced that the game would also be released for the Xbox, with Microsoft paying $5 million to secure a six-month exclusivity deal to release the title on the Xbox before any other console, supply exclusive content for the version, and also securing exclusive online gaming rights to the franchise, however, Interplay would remain as publisher.

Due to financial difficulties, Interplay sold Shiny to Infogrames in April 2002 for $47 million, with the &quot;Matrix&quot; license transferring over. With the delay of the now-named &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, the game was now scheduled for a May 2003 release. At E3 2002, the title for the game was officially announced as &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, and would be released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Microsoft Windows simultaneously. In March 2003, the game was announced to be released on May 15, the same day as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. It was also shown off at E3 2003 at the now-named Atari&#x27;s booth, within the release of the title.

Overall, &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; took two and a half years to produce on a budget of $20 million, not including marketing expenses or the cost of the extra hour of movie footage. Keanu Reeves was said to have made $2.5 million for his voice work on the game.

In March 2004, with the success of the title, Atari announced that the game would be re-released in Europe under Sony&#x27;s Platinum, Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Classics ranges at a new lower price, while the PC version would be re-released as well under Atari&#x27;s own &quot;Best of Atari&quot; label. The budget PS2 and PC versions were newer versions, which include bonus minigames not found on the original releases.

==Soundtrack==
A promotional CD release of the soundtrack accompanied the video game, with compositions by Erik Lundborg in the style of Don Davis, who composed the music for the films.

==Sales==
Within a week of release, Atari announced that the game had sold 1 million units for all four platforms in North America and Europe combined. By June, the game sold 2.5 million units and became the company&#x27;s fastest-selling title in history. Within March 2004, the title sold 5 million units, and was reissued under the console&#x27;s budget labels around this time. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; had sold 1.2 million copies and earned $58 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 39th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; console releases reached 1.9 million units in the United States by July 2006. Worldwide, the game sold 5million units.

==Reception==

&quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Two critics from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it &quot;bad&quot; scores; another later admitted that his &quot;average&quot; score for the game was more positive than the game actually deserved. Mark MacDonald was especially scathing, writing &quot;In more than 20 years of playing games, I have never seen a console game as obviously unfinished and rushed to market as &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;... This game is a complete mess, and that&#x27;s the only thing complete about it.&quot;

GameSpot listed &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; in several of their &quot;Dubious Honors&quot; lists at the end of 2003, including their five most disappointing titles of the year. One common complaint was that players wanted to play as trilogy protagonist Neo rather than secondary characters Ghost and Niobe, an issue Shiny Entertainment addressed with their later Matrix game &quot;Path of Neo&quot;.

Steven Poole, in his column in &quot;Edge&quot;, described the PS2 version of &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; as &quot;&quot;Max Payne&quot; with celebrity scriptwriters&quot;, and said that the films&#x27; fluid fight choreography could not be matched by the game&#x27;s control system, and that the game&#x27;s centred view, while practical, was not as interesting as the &quot;kinetic montage&quot; of camera angles used in the movies&#x27; action scenes. He also expressed other concerns:

The most worrying new precedent that &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; sets, though, with its massively hyped synergy and narrative overlap with &quot;Reloaded&quot;, is that it seems the film itself has been deliberately made to suffer, to donate some of its lifeblood so that its vampiric brood can feed on it. In &quot;Reloaded&quot;, Niobe and her crew go to blow up the nuclear power plant, a feat of security bypassing which would presumably require something like a lobby scene squared. Instead, we see nothing until they are already in the control room. Why? Because that&#x27;s what you get to do in the game instead. The film&#x27;s sense of rhythm and victory over threat is compromised just so we can bash buttons on our consoles at home. It&#x27;s as though James Cameron had cut footage out of &quot;Aliens&quot; so that it could be rendered in blocky 2D graphics in the 1987 Spectrum/C64 tie-in game released by Electric Dreams — which remains, actually, a superior film-to-game conversion.

Positive comments came from IGN, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, with NP stating, &quot;its game play suffers from repetition, but this two-disc technomelange has tons of great stuff for &quot;Matrix&quot; fans.&quot; IGN&#x27;s review, while mixed, praised its presentation and sound, stating that &quot;you can&#x27;t get much better than having the Wachowskis filming your cutscenes,&quot; and &quot;Kudos to the sound team for bringing the movie audio to life in the game. Excellent sound design, and a great score.&quot; The IGN review also said, &quot;Things could have been much better with a few more months in development. That said, the story elements and the way the [Wachowskis] tie together the &quot;Matrix&quot; movies, the &quot;Animatrix&quot; shorts, and the game is exceptional. Not being able to slip into the black robes of the movie&#x27;s principal characters is a bummer, but there&#x27;s no denying that playing through &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; will actually increase your appreciation of the &quot;Matrix&quot; universe as a whole.&quot; They also praised the GameCube version, specifically: &quot;A big &#x27;thank you&#x27; to Atari and Shiny for making sure that Nintendo&#x27;s little cube didn&#x27;t get shafted. The GameCube version actually ships on two disks to accommodate all the video and audio content. DPLII, progressive scan, DIVX compression — it&#x27;s all used to full effect to make sure the GameCube version is as good as it can be.&quot;

Even non-video game publications gave the game some positive acclaim. &quot;Maxim&quot; gave it a score of eight out of ten and said it was &quot;by no means a weak attempt to cash in on a franchise...Gamers not only get tons of extra movie action but also get to run, kick, and shoot in a fully realized &quot;Matrix&quot; universe.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B and said that it &quot;wants to be so many different games that it doesn&#x27;t excel at any one of them.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the game &quot;isn&#x27;t a perfect slice of interactive entertainment, but it does provide at least a dozen hours of action-packed fun and serves as a clever vehicle to expand on the events in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, however, gave it six out of ten and stated: &quot;Nerds may activate two-player mode using the DOS-throwback &#x27;hacking gameplay element.&#x27; If any of you figure out how to boff Trinity during a rave, please e-mail me.&quot;

By July 2005, the game sold nearly 6 million copies.

==Awards==

At the AIAS&#x27; 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, Jada Pinkett Smith&#x27;s performance as Niobe won the award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance - Female&quot;, tying with Tara Strong&#x27;s vocal performance as Rikku in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;.
It won for Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show at the 2003 VGX Awards.

There are analogous orderings for local officials at events in Metropolitan France outside Paris, for Overseas France, and on naval bases. There are also provisions to allow subordinate to take the place of certain head officers, if absent. For events organised by a public body other than the national government, the body&#x27;s head ranks second after the representative of the State (President, prefect, or sub-prefect).

<doc id="232769" wikidata="Q312596" url="?curid=232769" title="William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville">
<text>William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville (25 October 175912 January 1834) was a British Pittite Tory politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1806 to 1807, but was a supporter of the Whigs for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars. As prime minister, his most significant achievement was the abolition of the slave trade in 1807. However, his government failed to either make peace with France or to accomplish Catholic emancipation and it was dismissed in the same year.

== Background ==
Grenville was the son of the Whig Prime Minister George Grenville. His mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of the Tory statesman Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet. He had two elder brothers: Thomas and George. He was thus uncle to the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos.

He was also related to the Pitt family by marriage since William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, had married his father&#x27;s sister Hester. The younger Grenville was thus the first cousin of William Pitt the Younger.

Grenville was educated at Eton College; Christ Church, Oxford; and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

Grenville was the maternal great-grandson of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset and therefore a descendant of Lady Katherine Grey, a great-granddaughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.

==Political career==
Grenville entered the House of Commons in February 1782 as member for the borough of Buckingham. He soon became a close ally of the prime minister, his cousin William Pitt the Younger. In September, he became secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who was his brother George. He left the House the following year and served in the government as Paymaster of the Forces from 1784 to 1789. In September 1784 his cousin, William Pitt the Younger, informed Grenville that the King had asked him pointedly when he would he return from his Continental tour? Pitt replied in six weeks, and therefore six weeks later George III asked Pitt, once more to become First Minister. This time he agreed. When in office Pitt drew Grenville closer giving him a position and experience at debating for the administration in the Commons. After a number of years learning his craft, and being used by Pitt in diplomatic missions abroad, Pitt planned for Grenville to replace Lord Spencer as Home Secretary but the King&#x27;s illness halted any movement. Now Pitt was concerned about his tenure as Minister, but the unexpected death of the House of Commons Speaker, Charles Wolfran Cornwall, meant that Grenville could be elected as Cornwall&#x27;s replacement. In the Speaker&#x27;s chair Grenville would be a support to Pitt, who was attempting to stall legal proceedings for a Regency as long as he could. This was in the hope that the King would recover. Grenville therefore served briefly as Speaker of the House of Commons before he entered the cabinet as Home Secretary, in place of Lord Spencer and resigned his other posts. He became Leader of the House of Lords when he was raised to the peerage the next year as Baron Grenville, of Wotton under Bernewood in the County of Buckingham.
In 1791, Grenville was again moved by Pitt into another office. This time he succeeded Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds as Foreign Secretary. Grenville was manoeuvred into position by Pitt when Leeds resigned over Pitt&#x27;s change in policy regarding Russia. Although not happy with the change, as Grenville preferred to remain in the less demanding Home Office, he submitted to Pitt&#x27;s wishes and dutifully obeyed his cousin and exchanged the Home office seals for the Foreign Department. Grenville&#x27;s decade as Foreign Secretary was dramatic with the Wars of the French Revolution. During the war, Grenville was the leader of the party that focused on the fighting on Continental Europe as the key to victory and opposed the faction of Henry Dundas, which favoured war at sea and in the colonies. Grenville&#x27;s focus led him to dispatch agents such as William Wickham to the Continent to collect information and engage with Royalists to counter the Revolution.

Whilst acting as Foreign Secretary Grenville grew close to George III. The Secretary supported a vigorous war against the French and was not in favour of making peace on terms which he considered beneath Britain&#x27;s honour. Siding with the King, who wanted war to continue unless the Bourbons were restored in France, Grenville became an obstacle to Pitt&#x27;s desire to make peace with France in 1797. As Foreign Secretary negotiations with foreign powers went through Grenville, including peace negotiations. Pitt was not happy with this arrangement when he saw that Grenville&#x27;s despatches to the British diplomat in France, James Harris Earl Malmesbury were unnecessarily harsh and uncompromising. Pitt therefore sent secret despatches of his own to Malmesbury hoping that in this way the negotiations for peace would be successful. George Canning, who was devoted to Pitt, had been made an under-secretary in the Foreign Department with the task to intercept despatches to Malmesbury for Pitt and send Pitt&#x27;s messages, secretly to the diplomat. This disagreement in views continued whenever peace with France was discussed.

Grenville left office with Pitt in 1801 over the issue of George III&#x27;s refusal to assent to Catholic emancipation.

Grenville did part-time military service at home as Major in the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry cavalry in 1794 and as lieutenant-colonel in the South Buckinghamshire volunteer regiment in 1806.

In his years out of office, Grenville became close to the opposition Whig leader Charles James Fox, and when Pitt returned to office in 1804, Grenville sided with Fox and did not take part.

===Prime minister===
After Pitt&#x27;s death in 1806, Grenville became the head of the &quot;Ministry of All the Talents&quot;, a coalition between Grenville&#x27;s supporters, the Foxite Whigs, and the supporters of former Prime Minister Lord Sidmouth, with Grenville as First Lord of the Treasury and Fox as Foreign Secretary as joint leaders. Grenville&#x27;s cousin William Windham served as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and his younger brother, Thomas Grenville, served briefly as First Lord of the Admiralty.

The Ministry ultimately accomplished little and failed either to make peace with France or to accomplish Catholic emancipation, the later attempt resulting in the ministry&#x27;s dismissal in March 1807. It had one significant achievement, however, in the abolition of the slave trade in 1807.

===Post-premiership===

In the years after the fall of the ministry, Grenville continued in opposition by maintaining his alliance with Lord Grey and the Whigs, criticising the Peninsular War and, with Grey, refusing to join Lord Liverpool&#x27;s government in 1812.

In the postwar years, Grenville gradually moved back closer to the Tories but never again returned to the cabinet. In 1815, he separated from his friend Charles Grey and supported the war policy of Lord Liverpool. In 1819, when the Marquess of Lansdowne brought forward his motion for an inquiry into the causes of the distress and discontent in the manufacturing districts, Grenville delivered a speech advocating repressive measures. His political career was ended by a stroke in 1823.

Grenville also served as Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1810 until his death in 1834.

==Legacy==
Historians find it hard to tell exactly which separate roles Pitt, Grenville and Dundas played in setting war policy toward France but agree that Grenville played a major role at all times until 1801. The consensus of scholars is that war with France presented an unexpected complex of problems. There was a conflict between secular ideologies, the conscription of huge armies, the new role of the Russian Empire as a continental power, and especially the sheer length and cost of the multiple coalitions.

Grenville energetically worked to build and hold together the Allied coalitions and paid suitable attention to smaller members such as Denmark and the Kingdom of Sardinia. He negotiated the complex alliance with Russia and the Austrian Empire. He hoped that with British financing, they would bear the brunt of the ground campaigns against the French.

Grenville&#x27;s influence was at the maximum during the formation of the Second Coalition. His projections of easy success were greatly exaggerated, and the result was another round of disappointment. His resignation in 1801 was caused primarily by George III&#x27;s refusal to allow Catholics to sit in Parliament.

==Dropmore House==

Dropmore House was built in the 1790s for Lord Grenville. The architects were Samuel Wyatt and Charles Tatham. Grenville knew the spot from rambles during his time at Eton College and prized its distant views of his old school and of Windsor Castle. On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time he died, his pinetum contained the biggest collection of conifer species in Britain. Part of the post-millennium restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.

==Personal life==

Lord Grenville married Anne, daughter of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, in 1792. The marriage was childless and he produced no legitimate offspring during his lifetime. He died in January 1834, aged 74, when the barony became extinct.

<doc id="232775" wikidata="Q2269913" url="?curid=232775" title="President of the Senate">
<text>President of the Senate is a title often given to the presiding officer of a senate. It corresponds to the speaker in some other assemblies.

The senate president often ranks high in a jurisdiction&#x27;s succession for its top executive office: for example, the president of the Senate of Nigeria is second in line for series to the presidency, after only the vice president of the Federal Republic, while in France, which has no vice president, the Senate president is first in line to succeed to the presidential powers and duties.

In the absence of the president of the senate, the senate is presided over by a president pro tempore, who is considered the highest-ranking among senators.

==Africa==

===Burundi===
The president of the Senate of Burundi, since 17 August 2005, is Molly Beamer of the CNDD-FDD. The president is assisted in his work by two vice presidents.

===Liberia===
While the vice president of Liberia serves as president of the Senate, the senators also elect from among their number a president pro tempore to lead the chamber&#x27;s day-to-day business.

===Nigeria===

The president of the Senate is the presiding officer of the Senate of Nigeria, elected by its membership.

The president of the Senate since 13 June 2023 is Godswill Akpabio, who represents the Akwa Ibom.

===South Africa===

The Senate of South Africa was the upper house of parliament between 1910 and 1981, and between 1994 and 1997. During both periods, the Senate was led by a president.

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===

The president of the Australian Senate is a senator, traditionally a member of the governing party or coalition, elected by the Senate at the beginning of each parliament as the first item of business. They are assisted by a deputy president who is traditionally a member of the largest opposition party.

===Cambodia===
The Senate of Cambodia is led by a 12-person permanent commission &quot;(bureau)&quot;, which is in turn chaired by the president of the Senate, currently Hun Sen. He is assisted by a first and a second vice-president. The president and vice-presidents are elected as the first item of business at the start of every legislative session.

===Fiji===
The members of the former Senate of Fiji (abolished in 2012) used to elect from among their number both a president and vice-president, whose roles were similar to those of the speaker and deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively.

The last persons to hold those positions were President Kinijoji Maivalili and Vice-President Hafiz Khan. The military coup of 5 December 2006 brought their terms to a premature end.

===Malaysia===
The Senate of Malaysia elects a president from its members, who is comparable to the speaker of the House of Representatives. The position is partisan and has usually been held by a member of the Government party.

===Philippines===
===Sri Lanka===
The Senate of Ceylon was the upper house of Parliament between 1947 and 1971. During this period, the Senate was led by a president.

==Europe==

===Belgium===
The presiding officer of the Belgian Senate is elected by the senators at the beginning of each parliamentary term. The president of the Senate is customarily a member of a majority party with a great deal of political experience. The president presides over the plenary assembly of the Senate, guides and controls debates in the assembly, is responsible for ensuring the democratic functioning of the Senate, maintains order and security in the assembly for enforcing the rules of the Senate, and represents the Senate at both the national (to the other institutions) and the international level.

The president of the Senate, together with the president of the Chamber of Representatives, ranks immediately behind the king in the order of precedence. The elder of the two takes second place in the order of precedence. The presidents of the Senate and the Chamber rank above the prime minister.

===Danzig===
In the Free City of Danzig (1920–1939, 1945), the Senate (or &quot;Senat&quot; in German) was the executive branch, with senators (&quot;Senator&quot;) being the holders of ministerial portfolios. In Danzig, the president of the Senate (&quot;Präsident des Senats&quot;) was an office equivalent to that of prime minister in other countries.

===France===

The Senate of France elects a president from among its number. The president of the French Senate stands first in a line of succession in case of death or resignation of the president of the Republic, becoming acting president until a presidential election can be held. This most recently occurred with Alain Poher, who was senate president from 1968 to 1992 and who served as acting president on two occasions: following Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s resignation in 1969 and following Georges Pompidou&#x27;s death in office in 1974.

Since 2014, the position has been held by Gérard Larcher of The Republicans (LR), formerly known as the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).

===Germany===
In the German states of Berlin (Senate of Berlin), Bremen (Senate of Bremen) and Hamburg (Senate of Hamburg), the Senates (or &quot;Senat&quot; in German) are the executive branch, with senators (&quot;Senator&quot;) being the holders of ministerial portfolios. In these Länder, the president of the Senate (&quot;Präsident des Senats&quot;) is an office equivalent to that of minister-president in other German Länder.

===Italy===
The Senate of Italy holds its first sitting no later than 20 days after a general election. That session, presided by the oldest senator, proceeds to elect the president of the Senate for the following parliamentary period. On the first two attempts at voting, an absolute majority (a majority of all senators) is needed; if a third round is needed, a candidate can be elected by a majority of the senators present and voting. If this third round fails to produce a winner, a final ballot is held between the two senators with the highest votes in the previous ballot. In the case of a tie, the elder senator is deemed the winner.

In addition to overseeing the business of the chamber, chairing and regulating debates, deciding whether motions and bills are admissible, representing the Senate, etc., the president of the Senate stands in for the president of the Republic when he is unable to perform his duties.

The current president of the Senate is Ignazio La Russa. For a historical listing, see: List of presidents of the Senate of Italy.

===Poland===
===Romania===

The first session of the Senate is headed by the eldest senator. In that session, the senators-elect the Standing Bureau of the Romanian Senate. It consists of the president of the Senate, four vice-presidents, four secretaries, and four quaestors. The president of the Standing Bureau also serves as the president of the Senate. The president is elected, by secret ballot, for the duration of the legislative period. The Senate president succeeds temporarily the president of Romania if the latter resigns, is suspended, incapacitated or dies in office. (The Senate president continues to be president of the Senate during the ad-interim presidency of the country and acts as president until a new president is elected).

===Spain===
==North America==

===Barbados===

At the start of every parliamentary session, the Senate of Barbados elects a president and a vice president, neither of whom may be ministers or parliamentary secretaries. Before the January 2008 general election, the positions were held by Sir Fred Gollop and Dame Patricia Symmonds.

===Belize===
The senate of Belize elects both a president and a vice-president upon first convening after a general election. The person elected president may be a senator (provided the candidate does not concurrently hold a ministerial position) or a person external to the Senate. The vice-president must be a member of the Senate who does not hold a ministerial portfolio. (Constitution, section 66.)

The president is Carolyn Trench-Sandiford.

===Canada===
While the speaker of the Senate of Canada, who serves as the presiding officer of the Senate of Canada, is not described as a &quot;president&quot; in English, the position is called in French. They are appointed by the governor general on the prime minister&#x27;s advice.

===Mexico===
The Senate of Mexico, at the beginning of each annual legislative session, elects an executive board &quot;(Mesa Directiva)&quot; from among its 128 members. The executive board comprises a president, three vice presidents, and four secretaries, elected by an absolute majority of the senators. Members of the executive board may be re-elected for the following year without restriction. The president of the executive board also serves as the president of the Senate.

The president of the Senate for the current LXIV Legislature is Ana Lilia Rivera, a former National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) deputy for the Federal District, and former president of MORENA.

===Trinidad and Tobago===

The president of the Senate of Trinidad and Tobago, who is generally elected from the government benches, chairs debates in the chamber and stands in for the country&#x27;s president during periods of absence or illness (Constitution, section 27). A vice-president of the Senate is also elected from among the senators. The current president of the Senate is Nigel de Freitas.

===United States===
The vice president of the United States is assigned the responsibility of presiding over the Senate and designated as its president by the United States Constitution. The vice president, as president of the Senate, has the authority (&quot;ex officio&quot;, as they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Other than this, the rules of the Senate grant its president very little power (in contrast to the powerful office of speaker of the House of Representatives).

While vice presidents used to regularly preside over the Senate, modern vice presidents have done so only rarely, as the daily procedures are routine. Vice presidents usually personally preside over swearing in new senators, during joint sessions, announcing the result of a vote on a significant bill or confirmation, or when casting a tie-breaking vote. The Senate chooses a president pro tempore to preside in the vice president&#x27;s absence. Modern presidents pro tempore, too, rarely preside over the Senate. In practice, junior senators of the majority party typically preside over routine functions to learn Senate procedure.

Vice presidents have cast 302 tie-breaking votes since the U.S. federal government was established in 1789. The vice president with the most tie-breaking votes is Kamala Harris, in office from 2021 to 2025, with 33. JD Vance, the current vice president, was sworn in as the new vice president and subsequently the president of the Senate on January 20th, 2025.

====U.S. state senates====
In state governments of the United States, the presiding officer of the state senate (the upper house) is a matter decided by the state&#x27;s constitution. Some states designate the lieutenant governor as president of the senate, in the same way as the vice-president, while in other states, the Senate elects its president. The Tennessee Senate elects a senator speaker of the Senate, who is given the title of lieutenant governor.

Similarly, New Hampshire has no lieutenant governor, but the state senate elects a president who is the &quot;de facto&quot; lieutenant governor, given that in the event of the governor&#x27;s death, resignation, or inability to serve, the president of the senate acts as governor until the vacancy is filled. New Jersey previously used the same system, but with the important proviso that the Senate president continued to serve in that position while also serving as acting governor. After Christine Todd Whitman resigned as governor, Donald DiFrancesco spent nearly a year as acting governor. As a result of his tenure, questions were raised about the propriety of such a system, particularly about separation of powers–related issues. A constitutional amendment was enacted in 2005 to create the office of lieutenant governor effective at the 2009 election.

Many state legislatures act almost like miniature versions of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In the Senate, JD Vance is the president of the senate. In most state legislatures, the lieutenant governor acts almost like the vice president. An example of this is in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: Governor Josh Shapiro acts like a president, Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis acts like a vice president and is the president of the Pennsylvania Senate. Both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature also have minority and majority leaders, and a speaker of the House.

====Puerto Rico====
==South America==

===Argentina===
The Argentine Senate is presided over by the vice-president of the Republic, currently Victoria Villaruel. This was a recent expansion of the vice-president&#x27;s powers introduced as part of the 1994 constitutional amendments (Constitution, Art. 57). The vice-president may only cast a vote to break a tied Senate vote.

===Brazil===

The president of Brazil&#x27;s Federal Senate is Rodrigo Pacheco.

The president of the Federal Senate is the third order to succeed the president (only below the vice president and the president of the Chamber of Deputies). It is also the president of the National Congress, which includes the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.

===Chile===

The president of the Senate of Chile is elected from among the country&#x27;s senators. The holder of the position, since March 2020, is Adriana Muñoz.

===Colombia===

The president of the Senate of Colombia is elected from among the country&#x27;s senators. The current holder of the position, since July 2022, is Roy Barreras.

The president of the Senate is the second order to succeed the president (only below the vice president and the president of the Chamber of Representatives). It is also the president of Congress, which includes the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives.

===Peru===

Peru had a bicameral Congress from 1829 until 1992. The president of the Senate was elected by the Senate members to preside over the sessions for one year.

===Uruguay===
The vice president of Uruguay presides over the country&#x27;s 30-member Senate.

<text>Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus (VERA) was an early analog recording videotape format developed from 1952 by the BBC under project manager Dr Peter Axon.

==History==
In order to record high frequencies, a tape must move rapidly with respect to the recording or playback head. The frequencies used by video signals are so high that the tape/head speed is on the order of several meters per second (tens of feet per second), an order of magnitude faster than professional analog audio tape recording. The BBC solved the problem by using reels of magnetic tape that passed static heads at a speed of .

VERA was capable of recording about 15 minutes (e.g. 4,572 meters) of 405-line black-and-white video per reel, and the picture tended to wobble because of some jitter (uneven speed) of the tape transport. Later video recorders used a time base corrector to remove this jitter and make synchronization with the studio house possible.

In order to cope with 625-line PAL or SECAM colour transmissions VERA would likely have required an even faster, and possibly unfeasible, tape speed.

Development began in 1952, but VERA was not perfected until 1958. It was given a live demonstration on-air on &quot;Panorama&quot; on 14 April 1958; Richard Dimbleby, seated by a clock, talked for a couple of minutes about the new method of vision recording with instant playback, and then the tape was wound back and replayed. The picture was slightly watery, but reasonably watchable, and instant playback was something completely new.

However, by this time it had already been rendered obsolete by the Ampex quadruplex video recording system. This used wide tapes running at a speed of per second. The rapid tape-to-head speed of quadruplex videotape was achieved by spinning the &quot;heads&quot; rapidly on a drum: the system used, with variations, on all videotape systems ever since, as well as DAT.

The BBC scrapped VERA and quickly adopted the Ampex system. It has been suggested that the BBC only continued to develop VERA as a bargaining tool, so it would be offered some of the first Ampex machines produced in unstated exchange for abandoning further work on a potential rival, but the colossal disadvantages of VERA and its status as a technological dead-end make this seem highly unlikely.

<doc id="232782" wikidata="Q157208" url="?curid=232782" title="William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland">
<text>William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (14 April 173830 October 1809) was a British Whig and then a Tory politician during the late Georgian era. He served as chancellor of the University of Oxford (1792–1809) and as Prime Minister of Great Britain (1783) and then of the United Kingdom (1807–1809). The gap of 26 years between his two terms as prime minister is the longest of any British prime minister. He was also an ancestor of King Charles III through his great-granddaughter Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne.

Portland was known before 1762 by the courtesy title Marquess of Titchfield. He held a title for every degree of British nobility: duke, marquess, earl (Earl of Portland), viscount (Viscount Woodstock), and baron (Baron Cirencester). He was the leader of the Portland Whigs faction, which broke with the Whig leadership of Charles James Fox and joined with William Pitt the Younger in the wake of the French Revolution.

==Early life and education==

William Henry, Lord Titchfield, was born on 14 April 1738 at Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire. He was the eldest son of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and &quot;the richest woman in great Britain&quot;, Lady Margaret Cavendish-Harley, and inherited many lands from his mother and his maternal grandmother, who was the daughter of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated MA in 1757.

In December 1757, the nineteen-year-old Lord Titchfield was sent to study under Lord Stormont for a year in Warsaw, accompanied by Stormont&#x27;s secretary, Benjamin Langlois. Stormont was to superintend all expenditures on his equipage, while Langlois was to hire local masters and direct the studies of the teenaged Titchfield. The books he directed him to read were ancient history, modern history and general law.

In 1759, Titchfield travelled with Langlois through Germany to Italy, spent a year in Turin, and then went on to Florence. When Stormont was appointed ambassador to Vienna in 1763, Langlois went with him as Secretary of the embassy.

==Marriage and children==

On 8 November 1766, Portland married Lady Dorothy Cavendish, only daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Charlotte Boyle. They were parents of nine children, six of whom survived to adulthood:

*William Henry Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland (24 June 176827 March 1854)
*Lt Gen Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck (14 September 177417 June 1839)
*Lady Charlotte Cavendish-Bentinck (2 October 177528 July 1862), who married Charles Greville.
*Lady Mary Cavendish-Bentinck (13 March 17796 November 1843)
*Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish-Bentinck (20 May 178028 April 1826), an ancestor of the 6th Duke of Portland and Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother).
*Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck (2 November 178111 February 1828), an ancestor of the 8th and 9th Duke of Portland.

==Political career==
Portland was elected to sit in the Parliament of Great Britain for Weobley in 1761 before he entered the House of Lords after he succeeded his father as Duke of Portland the next year. He was associated with the aristocratic Whig Party of Lord Rockingham and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household in Rockingham&#x27;s first government (1765–1766).

===Lord Lieutenant of Ireland===
Portland served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in Rockingham&#x27;s second ministry (April–August 1782). He faced strong demands for conciliatory measures following years of coercion and taxation brought about by the British government&#x27;s engagement in the American Revolutionary War. Portland resolved to make concessions and, overcoming the resistance of Lord Shelburne, the Home Secretary to whom he reported, convinced Parliament to repeal the Declaratory Act and to modify Poynings&#x27; Law. Following Rockingham&#x27;s death, Portland resigned from Lord Shelburne&#x27;s ministry along with other supporters of Charles James Fox.

== Prime Minister: 1783 ==

In April 1783, Portland was selected as the titular head of a coalition government as Prime Minister, whose real leaders were Charles James Fox and Lord North. He served as First Lord of the Treasury in the ministry until its fall in December that same year. During his tenure, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which formally ended the American Revolutionary War. The government was brought down after it had lost a vote in the House of Lords on its proposed reform of the East India Company after George III had let it be known that any peer voting for the measure would be considered his personal enemy.

In 1789, Portland became one of several vice presidents of London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital. The charity had become one of the most fashionable of the time, with several notables serving on its board. At its creation, 50 years earlier, Portland&#x27;s father, William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland, had been one of the founding governors, as listed on the charity&#x27;s royal charter granted by George II. The hospital had a mission to care for the abandoned children in London, and it achieved rapid fame through its poignant mission, its art collection donated from supporting artists and the popular benefit concerts by George Frideric Handel. In 1793, Portland took over the presidency of the charity from Lord North.

=== Home Secretary ===
Along with many other conservative Whigs such as Edmund Burke, Portland was deeply uncomfortable with the French Revolution; he broke with Fox over that issue and joined Pitt&#x27;s government as Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1794. In that role he oversaw the administration of patronage and financial inducements, which were often secret, to secure the passage of the Act of Union 1800. He continued to serve in the cabinet until Pitt&#x27;s death in 1806, from 1801 to 1805 as Lord President of the Council and then as a Minister without Portfolio.

== Prime Minister: 1807–1809 ==

In March 1807, after the collapse of the Ministry of all the Talents, Pitt&#x27;s former supporters returned to power, and Portland was once again an acceptable figurehead for a fractious group of ministers that included George Canning, Lord Castlereagh, Lord Hawkesbury and Spencer Perceval.

Portland&#x27;s second government saw the United Kingdom&#x27;s complete isolation on the continent but also the beginning of its recovery with the start of the Peninsular War. In late 1809, with Portland&#x27;s health poor and the ministry rocked by the scandalous duel between Canning and Castlereagh, Portland resigned and died shortly thereafter.

He was Recorder of Nottingham until his death.

==Death and burial==

He died on 30 October 1809 at Burlington House, Piccadilly, after an operation for a kidney stone, and was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church, London.

He had lived expensively: with an income of £17,000 a year (worth £577,000 in 2005), he had debts at his death computed at £52,000 (£1.76 million in 2005), which were paid off by his succeeding son by selling off some property, including Bulstrode Park.

Along with Sir Robert Peel, Lord Aberdeen, Benjamin Disraeli, Marquess of Salisbury, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Bonar Law and Neville Chamberlain, he was the first of eight British prime ministers to die while his direct successor was in office.

==Legacy==

The Portland Vase of Roman glass was given its name because it was owned by Portland at his family residence at Bulstrode Park.

Portland Parish, in Jamaica, was named after him. The Titchfield School, founded in 1786, is in the parish and is also named in his honour. The school&#x27;s crest is derived from his personal crest.

Two major streets in Marylebone are named after him: Portland Place and Great Portland Street. Both were built on land that he once owned. Great Portland Street tube station, opened in 1863, takes its name from the latter.

North Bentinck Arm and South Bentinck Arm were named for the Bentinck family by George Vancouver in 1793, along with other names on the British Columbia Coast, such as Portland Canal and Portland Channel.

Portland Bay in Victoria, Australia was named in 1800 by the British navigator James Grant. The city of Portland is located on the bay.

The department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham holds a number of papers relating to him. His personal and political papers (Pw F) are part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection, and the Portland (London) Collection (Pl) contains his correspondence and official papers, especially in series Pl C.

The Portland Estate Papers held at Nottinghamshire Archives also contain items relating to the 3rd Duke&#x27;s properties.

The Portland Collection of fine and decorative art includes pieces owned and commissioned by him, including paintings by George Stubbs.

<text>The brachialis (brachialis anticus) is a muscle in the upper arm that flexes the elbow. It lies beneath the biceps brachii, and makes up part of the floor of the region known as the cubital fossa (elbow pit). It originates from the anterior aspect of the distal humerus; it inserts onto the tuberosity of the ulna. It is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, and commonly also receives additional innervation from the radial nerve. The brachialis is the prime mover of elbow flexion generating about 50% more power than the biceps.

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
The brachialis originates from the anterior surface of the distal half of the humerus, near the insertion of the deltoid muscle, which it embraces by two angular processes. Its origin extends below to within 2.5 cm of the margin of the articular surface of the humerus at the elbow joint.

=== Insertion ===
Its fibers converge to a thick tendon which is inserted into the tuberosity of the ulna, and the rough depression on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna.

===Innervation===
The brachialis muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, which runs on its superficial surface, between it and the biceps brachii. However, in 70-80% of people, the muscle has double innervation with the radial nerve (C5-T1). The divide between the two innervations is at the insertion of the deltoid.

===Blood supply===
The brachialis is supplied by muscular branches of the brachial artery and by the recurrent radial artery.

===Variation===
The muscle is occasionally doubled; additional muscle slips to the supinator, pronator teres, biceps brachii, lacertus fibrosus, or radius are more rarely found.

==Function==
The brachialis flexes the arm at the elbow joint. Unlike the biceps, the brachialis does not insert on the radius, and does not participate in pronation and supination of the forearm.

==History==

===Etymology===
The &quot;brachialis muscle&quot; In classical Latin &quot;bracchialis&quot; means &quot;of or belonging to the arm&quot;, and is derived from classical Latin &quot;bracchium&quot;, &quot;arm&quot;. The expression &quot;musculus brachialis&quot; is used in the current official anatomic nomenco Terminologia Anatomica&quot;.

<doc id="232786" wikidata="Q13419831" url="?curid=232786" title="Maximum life span">
<text>Maximum life span (or, for humans, maximum reported age at death) is a measure of the maximum amount of time one or more members of a population have been observed to survive between birth and death. The term can also denote an estimate of the maximum amount of time that a member of a given species could survive between birth and death, provided circumstances that are optimal to that member&#x27;s longevity.

Most living species have an upper limit on the number of times somatic cells not expressing telomerase can divide. This is called the Hayflick limit, although this number of cell divisions does not strictly control lifespan.

==Definition==
In animal studies, maximum span is often taken to be the mean life span of the most long-lived 10% of a given cohort. By another definition, however, maximum life span corresponds to the age at which the oldest known member of a species or experimental group has died. Calculation of the maximum life span in the latter sense depends upon the initial sample size.

&quot;Maximum life span&quot; contrasts with &quot;mean life span (average life span&quot;, &quot;life expectancy)&quot;, and &quot;longevity&quot;. Mean life span varies with susceptibility to disease, accident, suicide and homicide, whereas maximum life span is determined by &quot;rate of aging&quot;. Longevity refers only to the characteristics of the especially long lived members of a population, such as infirmities as they age or &quot;compression of morbidity&quot;, and not the specific life span of an individual.

==In humans==
=== Demographic evidence ===
The longest living person whose dates of birth and death were verified according to the modern norms of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; and the Gerontology Research Group was Jeanne Calment (1875–1997), a Frenchwoman who is verified to have lived to 122. The oldest male lifespan has only been verified as 116, by Japanese man Jiroemon Kimura. Reduction of infant mortality has accounted for most of the increased average life span longevity, but since the 1960s mortality rates among those over 80 years have decreased by about 1.5% per year. According to James Vaupel, &quot;The progress being made in lengthening lifespans and postponing senescence is entirely due to medical and public-health efforts, rising standards of living, better education, healthier nutrition and more salubrious lifestyles.&quot; Animal studies suggest that further lengthening of median human lifespan as well as maximum lifespan could be achieved through &quot;calorie restriction mimetic&quot; drugs or by directly reducing food consumption. Although calorie restriction has not been proven to extend the maximum human life span , results in ongoing primate studies have demonstrated that the assumptions derived from rodents are valid in primates.

It has been proposed that no fixed theoretical limit to human longevity is apparent today. Studies in the biodemography of human longevity indicate a &quot;late-life mortality deceleration law&quot;: that death rates level off at advanced ages to a late-life mortality plateau. That is, there is no fixed upper limit to human longevity, or fixed maximal human lifespan. This law was first quantified in 1939, when researchers found that the one-year probability of death at advanced age asymptotically approaches a limit of 44% for women and 54% for men.

However, this evidence depends on the existence of a late-life plateaus and deceleration that can be explained, in humans and other species, by the existence of very rare errors. Age-coding error rates below 1 in 10,000 are sufficient to make artificial late-life plateaus, and errors below 1 in 100,000 can generate late-life mortality deceleration. These error rates cannot be ruled out by examining documents (the standard) because of successful pension fraud, identity theft, forgeries and errors that leave no documentary evidence. This capacity for errors to explain late-life plateaus solves the &quot;fundamental question in aging research is whether humans and other species possess an immutable life-span limit&quot; and suggests that a limit to human life span exists.
A theoretical study suggested the maximum human lifespan to be around 125 years using a modified stretched exponential function for human survival curves.
In another study, researchers claimed that there exists a maximum lifespan for humans, and that the human maximal lifespan has been declining since the 1990s. A theoretical study also suggested that the maximum human life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.

In 2017, the United Nations conducted a Bayesian sensitivity analysis of global population burden based on life expectancy projection at birth in future decades. The 95% prediction interval of average life expectancy rises as high as 106 years old by 2090, with ongoing and layered effects on world population and demography should that happen. However, the prediction interval is extremely wide.

=== Non-demographic evidence ===

Evidence for maximum lifespan is also provided by the dynamics of physiological indices with age. For example, scientists have observed that a person&#x27;s VO2max value (a measure of the volume of oxygen flow to the cardiac muscle) decreases as a function of age. Therefore, the maximum lifespan of a person could be determined by calculating when the person&#x27;s VO2max value drops below the basal metabolic rate necessary to sustain life, which is approximately 3 ml per kg per minute. On the basis of this hypothesis, athletes with a VO2max value between 50 and 60 at age 20 would be expected &quot;to live for 100 to 125 years, provided they maintained their physical activity so that their rate of decline in VO2max remained constant&quot;.

==In animals==

Small animals such as birds and squirrels rarely live to their maximum life span, usually dying of accidents, disease or predation.

The maximum life span of most species is documented in the AnAge repository (The Animal Ageing and Longevity Database).

Maximum life span is usually longer for species that are larger, at least among endotherms, or have effective defenses against predation, such as bat or bird flight, arboreality, chemical defenses or living in social groups. Among mammals, the presence of a caecal appendix is also correlated with greater maximal longevity.

The differences in life span between species demonstrate the role of genetics in determining maximum life span (&quot;rate of aging&quot;). The records (in years) are these:
* for common house mouse, 4
* for Brown rat, 3.8
* for dogs, 29 (See List of longest-living dogs)
* for cats, 38 (See List of longest-living cats)
* for common cranes, 43
* for polar bears, 42 (Debby)
* for horses, 62
* for Asian elephants, 86
The longest-lived vertebrates have been variously described as
* Large parrots (macaws and cockatoos can live up to 80–100 years in captivity)
* Koi (a Japanese species of fish, allegedly living up to 200 years, though generally not exceeding 50 – a specimen named Hanako was reportedly 226 years old upon her death)
* Tortoises (Seychelles tortoise) (192 years)
* Tuatara (a New Zealand reptile species, 100–200+ years)
* Eels, the so-called Brantevik Eel (Swedish: Branteviksålen) is thought to have lived in a water well in southern Sweden since 1859, which makes it over 150 years old. It was reported that it had died in August 2014 at an age of 155.
* Whales (bowhead whale) (&quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; about 200 years)—Although this idea was unproven for a time, recent research has indicated that bowhead whales recently killed still had harpoons in their bodies from about 1890, which, along with analysis of amino acids, has indicated a maximum life span of &quot;177 to 245 years old&quot;.
* Greenland sharks are currently the vertebrate species with the longest known lifespan. An examination of 28 specimens in one study published in 2016 determined by radiocarbon dating that the oldest of the animals that they sampled had lived for about 392 ± 120 years (a minimum of 272 years and a maximum of 512 years). The authors further concluded that the species reaches sexual maturity at about 150 years of age.

Invertebrate species which continue to grow as long as they live (&quot;e.g.,&quot; certain clams, some coral species) can on occasion live hundreds of years:
* A bivalve mollusk (&quot;Arctica islandica&quot;) (aka &quot;Ming&quot;, lived 507±2 years.)

===Exceptions===
* Some jellyfish species, including &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, &quot;Laodicea undulata&quot;, and &quot;Aurelia&quot; sp.1, are able to revert to the polyp stage even after reproducing (so-called reversible life cycle), rather than dying as in other jellyfish. Consequently, these species are considered biologically immortal and have no maximum lifespan.
* There may be no natural limit to the &quot;Hydra&quot;&#x27;s life span, but it is not yet clear how to estimate the age of a specimen.
* Flatworms, or Platyhelminthes, are known to be &quot;almost immortal&quot; as they have a great regeneration capacity, continuous growth, and binary fission type cellular division.
* Lobsters are sometimes said to be biologically immortal because they do not seem to slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age. However, due to the energy needed for moulting, they cannot live indefinitely.

==In plants==

Plants are referred to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman, is alive and well in its third millennium. A Great Basin Bristlecone Pine called Methuselah is years old. Another Bristlecone Pine called Prometheus was a little older still, showing 4,862 years of growth rings. The exact age of Prometheus, however, remains unknown as it is likely that growth rings did not form every year due to the harsh environment in which it grew but it was estimated to be ~4,900 years old when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 16,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; can live upwards of 10,000 years.

==Increasing maximum life span==

&quot;Maximum life span&quot; here means the mean life span of the most long-lived 10% of a given cohort. Caloric restriction has not yet been shown to break mammalian world records for longevity. Rats, mice, and hamsters experience maximum life-span extension from a diet that contains all of the nutrients but only 40–60% of the calories that the animals consume when they can eat as much as they want. Mean life span is increased 65% and maximum life span is increased 50%, when caloric restriction is begun just before puberty. For fruit flies the life extending benefits of calorie restriction are gained immediately at any age upon beginning calorie restriction and ended immediately at any age upon resuming full feeding.

Most biomedical gerontologists believe that biomedical molecular engineering will eventually extend maximum lifespan and even bring about rejuvenation. Anti-aging drugs are a potential tool for extending life.

Aubrey de Grey, a theoretical gerontologist, has proposed that aging can be reversed by strategies for engineered negligible senescence. De Grey has established The Methuselah Mouse Prize to award money to researchers who can extend the maximum life span of mice. So far, three Mouse Prizes have been awarded: one for breaking longevity records to Dr. Andrzej Bartke of Southern Illinois University (using GhR knockout mice); one for late-onset rejuvenation strategies to Dr. Stephen Spindler of the University of California (using caloric restriction initiated late in life); and one to Dr. Z. Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin.

==Correlation with DNA repair capacity==

Accumulated DNA damage appears to be a limiting factor in the determination of maximum life span. The theory that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging, and thus a principal determinant of maximum life span, has attracted increased interest in recent years. This is based, in part, on evidence in humans and mice that inherited deficiencies in DNA repair genes often cause accelerated aging. There is also substantial evidence that DNA damage accumulates with age in mammalian tissues, such as those of the brain, muscle, liver, and kidney (reviewed by Bernstein et al. and see DNA damage theory of aging and DNA damage (naturally occurring)). One expectation of the theory (that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging) is that among species with differing maximum life spans, the capacity to repair DNA damage should correlate with lifespan. The first experimental test of this idea was by Hart and Setlow who measured the capacity of cells from seven different mammalian species to carry out DNA repair. They found that nucleotide excision repair capability increased systematically with species longevity. This correlation was striking and stimulated a series of 11 additional experiments in different laboratories over succeeding years on the relationship of nucleotide excision repair and life span in mammalian species (reviewed by Bernstein and Bernstein). In general, the findings of these studies indicated a good correlation between nucleotide excision repair capacity and life span. The association between nucleotide excision repair capability and longevity is strengthened by the evidence that defects in nucleotide excision repair proteins in humans and rodents cause features of premature aging, as reviewed by Diderich.

Further support for the theory that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging comes from study of Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARPs). PARPs are enzymes that are activated by DNA strand breaks and play a role in DNA base excision repair. Burkle et al. reviewed evidence that PARPs, and especially PARP-1, are involved in maintaining mammalian longevity. The life span of 13 mammalian species correlated with poly(ADP ribosyl)ation capability measured in mononuclear cells. Furthermore, lymphoblastoid cell lines from peripheral blood lymphocytes of humans over age 100 had a significantly higher poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capability than control cell lines from younger individuals.

==Research data==
* A comparison of the heart mitochondria in rats (7-year maximum life span) and pigeons (35-year maximum life span) showed that pigeon mitochondria leak fewer free-radicals than rat mitochondria, despite the fact that both animals have similar metabolic rate and cardiac output
* For mammals there is a direct relationship between mitochondrial membrane fatty acid saturation and maximum life span
* Studies of the liver lipids of mammals and a bird (pigeon) show an inverse relationship between maximum life span and number of double bonds
* Selected species of birds and mammals show an inverse relationship between telomere rate of change (shortening) and maximum life span
* Maximum life span correlates negatively with antioxidant enzyme levels and free-radicals production and positively with rate of DNA repair
* Female mammals express more Mn−SOD and glutathione peroxidase antioxidant enzymes than males. This has been hypothesized as the reason they live longer. However, mice entirely lacking in glutathione peroxidase 1 do not show a reduction in lifespan.
* The maximum life span of transgenic mice has been extended about 20% by overexpression of human catalase targeted to mitochondria
* A comparison of 7 non-primate mammals (mouse, hamster, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit, pig and cow) showed that the rate of mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in heart and kidney were inversely correlated with maximum life span
* A study of 8 non-primate mammals showed an inverse correlation between maximum life span and oxidative damage to mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) in heart &amp; brain
* A study of several species of mammals and a bird (pigeon) indicated a linear relationship between oxidative damage to protein and maximum life span
* There is a direct correlation between DNA repair and maximum life span for mammalian species
* Drosophila (fruit-flies) bred for 15 generations by only using eggs that were laid toward the end of reproductive life achieved maximum life spans 30% greater than that of controls
* Overexpression of the enzyme which synthesizes glutathione in long-lived transgenic &quot;Drosophila&quot; (fruit-flies) extended maximum lifespan by nearly 50%
* A mutation in the age−1 gene of the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; increased mean life span 65% and maximum life span 110%. However, the degree of lifespan extension in relative terms by both the age-1 and daf-2 mutations is strongly dependent on ambient temperature, with ≈10% extension at 16 °C and 65% extension at 27 °C.
* Fat-specific Insulin Receptor KnockOut (FIRKO) mice have reduced fat mass, normal calorie intake and an increased maximum life span of 18%.
* The capacity of mammalian species to detoxify the carcinogenic chemical benzo[a]pyrene to a water-soluble form also correlates well with maximum life span.
* Short-term induction of oxidative stress due to calorie restriction increases life span in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; by promoting stress defense, specifically by inducing an enzyme called catalase. As shown by Michael Ristow and co-workers nutritive antioxidants completely abolish this extension of life span by inhibiting a process called mitohormesis.

<text>A gimmick is a novel device or idea designed primarily to attract attention or increase appeal, often with little intrinsic value. When applied to retail marketing, it is a unique or quirky feature designed to make a product or service &quot;stand out&quot; from its competitors. Product gimmicks are sometimes considered mere novelties, and tangential to the product&#x27;s functioning. Gimmicks are occasionally viewed negatively, but some seemingly trivial gimmicks of the past have evolved into useful, permanent features. In video games, the term is also sometimes used to describe unusual features or playstyles, especially if they are unnecessary or obnoxious.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the term &quot;gimmick&quot; is uncertain. Etymologists suggest that the term emerged in the United States in the early 20th century. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot; suggests that it may have originally been a slang term for something that a con artist or magician manipulated to make appearances different from reality, and which gradually changed its meaning to refer to any ‘piece of magicians&#x27; apparatus’. The word itself may be an approximate anagram of the word &quot;magic&quot;.

The term &quot;gimmick&quot; may also have resulted from alteration to the word &quot;gimcrack&quot;, which refers to a showy object of little use or value. Another possible origin is that it may have come into use among gaming tables, where it came to refer to &quot;a device used for making a fair game crooked&quot;. The term first appeared in American newspapers in the 1910s and 1920s.

== Examples ==
In marketing, the use of gimmicks can be an important part of the sales promotions effort. However, finding a successful gimmick for an otherwise mundane product can be challenging, as it requires some effort to match the promotional objectives with the gimmick, and select items which will ideally contribute to enduring brand recall.

Many different types of gimmicks are used in sales promotion and product design. For example, toothbrushes are often given certain gimmicks, such as bright colors, easy-grip handles, or color-changing bristles, in order to appear more interesting to consumers. This is often done in an attempt to appeal to children, who are often more interested in the gimmick than the product.

Musicians often adopt visual gimmicks that do not affect their music. Slash&#x27;s top hat, Angus Young&#x27;s schoolboy uniform, makeup used by KISS, and deadmau5&#x27;s mouse helmet are examples of such gimmicks. Gimmicks within a musical context are also a central characteristic of the novelty song.

* Special design features, e.g. toothbrushes that change color when they are about to wear out (signaling that the consumer needs to repurchase);
* Novel packaging, e.g. packaging that has residual value once the original contents have been consumed, such as a jam or coffee jar that can be reused as a drinking vessel or storage container;
* Add-on gifts or giveaways, e.g. toys included in children&#x27;s fast food meal packs, covermounts on magazines, toys in cereal boxes;
* Any novel or unexpected sales promotion.

== Failed gimmicks ==

The McDonald&#x27;s 1984 Olympics promotion offered free McDonald&#x27;s food to U.S. customers if the United States won medals in specific events at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Due to the boycott by many nations that had won many medals in prior Olympiads, the U.S. teams won significantly more medals than McDonald&#x27;s had expected them to, causing shortages at some restaurants.

In 1992, the British division of The Hoover Company launched a disastrous promotional campaign which promised free airline tickets to purchasers of its appliances. The division lost £50 million as a result and was eventually sold.

In 1997, certain Polish tobacco companies were using young sales representatives, traveling around in flashy company branded vehicles, to work clubs and venues where they gave away free cigarettes to patrons as part of the promotional effort. The sales and marketing team at Phillip Morris decided to add another gimmick to the sampling by having the sales reps use trick matches which lit with a simple scratch on jeans. In one case, the stocks of matches carried in a vehicle caught fire killing two sales reps and seriously injuring another. The incident created public relations problems for the company.

<text>Thomas John Peterson (born May 9, 1950), better known as Tom Petersson, is an American musician who is best known as the bass guitar player for the rock band Cheap Trick.

==Career==
Before joining Cheap Trick, Petersson played in a number of bands, including the Bol Weevils, the Grim Reapers, Sick Man of Europe, and Fuse. He started his career playing electric guitar but soon switched to bass. His professional career remained closely entwined with Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen since the Grim Reapers in 1967, and the two co-founded Cheap Trick in 1974.

During Cheap Trick&#x27;s early years, Petersson started playing the 12-string bass guitar, an instrument he conceived and developed in collaboration with luthiers at Hamer Guitars. Petersson left Cheap Trick in August 1980, shortly before the release of the album &quot;All Shook Up&quot;. He worked with his then-wife Dagmar on material for a solo album, which was eventually released in 1984 as the six-song EP &quot;Tom Peterson and Another Language&quot;. Petersson also toured with Carmine Appice in 1982. From 1985 to 1987, he joined Pete Comita, who had briefly replaced him in Cheap Trick, in a reformed version of his early band, Sick Man of Europe, which also included songwriter Janna Allen. Petersson rejoined Cheap Trick in 1987 and has remained with the band ever since.

Outside of Cheap Trick, Petersson has worked with artists such as Donovan, Willie Nelson, Mick Jagger, Harry Nilsson (unused tracks for the &quot;Every Man Has a Woman&quot; album), Bill Lloyd, Frank Black, Concrete Blonde, Foster and Lloyd, Edan Everly, Coinship, and members of The Mavericks. Petersson also appeared in The Ramones&#x27; 1986 music video &quot;Something to Believe In&quot;.

==Personal life==

Petersson and his wife, Alison, have two children, a son named Liam, and a daughter named Lilah. In 2014, Tom and Alison founded &quot;Rock Your Speech&quot; to promote awareness and understanding of autism spectrum disorder and to use music to help children overcome speech difficulties associated with autism.

Petersson is an avid guitar collector, owning a wide variety of guitars and basses. He prominently used a vintage Gibson Thunderbird bass as his main stage instrument for many years, until a girlfriend threw it out of a hotel window during an argument. Professionally, he has endorsed a number of different bass brands during his career, including Hamer, Chandler, Waterstone, Electrical Guitar Company, Hofner, and Mike Lull. He currently plays Gretsch basses, including a pair of his distinctive Falcon signature 12-string basses (one in green, one in white), which Petersson endorses and have become a production model.

<doc id="232804" wikidata="Q840572" url="?curid=232804" title="Pronator quadratus muscle">
<text>Pronator quadratus is a square-shaped muscle on the distal forearm that acts to pronate (turn so the palm faces downwards) the hand.

==Structure==
Its fibres run perpendicular to the direction of the arm, running from the most distal quarter of the anterior ulna to the distal quarter of the radius. It has two heads: the superficial head originates from the anterior distal aspect of the diaphysis (shaft) of the ulna and inserts into the anterior distal diaphysis of the radius, as well as its anterior metaphysis. The deep head has the same origin, but inserts proximal to the ulnar notch. It is the only muscle that attaches only to the ulna at one end and the radius at the other end. Arterial blood comes via the anterior interosseous artery.

=== Innervation ===
Pronator quadratus muscle is innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the median nerve.

==Function==
When pronator quadratus contracts, it pulls the lateral side of the radius towards the ulna, thus pronating the hand. Its deep fibers serve to keep the two bones in the forearm bound together. Moreover, this muscle can be absent in some humans, however, that does not affect the action of pronation very notably, as the pronator teres does the major role in that action.

==Spinal tracts==
The lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for the motor pathway of the pronator quadratus. This tract begins in the precentral gyrus of the motor cortex where a signal is transmitted from the upper motor nerve through the progression tracts of the internal capsule and through the cerebral peduncles of the midbrain. It decussates in the medulla and travels down the lateral corticospinal tract in the lateral column of the spinal cord. It then decussates in the spinal cord and synapses at the anterior horn to the lower motor neurons of the skeletal muscles.
The cuneate fasciculus tract is responsible for the sensation of the pronator quadratus position and movement, deep touch, visceral pain, and vibration. This tract begins in the dorsal nerve root where the signal is transmitted through the dorsal horn and up the posterior column of the spinal cord. It synapses with an interneuron in the gracile nucleus. It then decussates in the medial lemniscus of the medulla, travels through the cuneate nucleus and through the medial lemniscus of the midbrain to synapse in the thalamus. It synapses with a third order neuron and transmits the signal to the postcentral gyrus of the somesthetic cortex.
This could apply to any muscle in the upper limb and not specific to this muscle.

<text>(, female form , plural ; from Old High German &#x27;, &quot;the first&quot;, a translation of the [[Latin]]&#x27;) is a German word for a ruler as well as a princely title. &#x27; were, starting in the [[Middle Ages]], members of the highest [[nobility]] who ruled over states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later its former territories, below the ruling&#x27; (emperor) or &quot;&quot; (king).

A prince of the Holy Roman Empire was the sovereign ruler of an imperial estate that held imperial immediacy in the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. The territory ruled is referred to in German as a &#x27; ([[principality]]), the family dynasty referred to as a&#x27; (princely house), and the (non-reigning) descendants of a &#x27; are titled and referred to in German as&#x27; (prince) or &quot;&quot; (princess).

The English language uses the term &quot;prince&quot; for both concepts. Latin-based languages (French, Italian, Romanian, Spanish, Portuguese) also employ a single term, whereas Dutch as well as the Scandinavian and some Slavic languages use separate terms similar to those used in German (see &quot;&quot; for the latter).

An East-Asian parallel to the concept of &quot;ruling prince&quot; would be the term (pronounced &quot;wáng&quot; in Mandarin, &quot;wong4&quot; in Cantonese, &quot;ō&quot; in Japanese, &quot;wang&quot; in Korean, and &quot;&quot; in Vietnamese), which commonly refers to Korean and non-East-Asian &quot;kings&quot;, but usually means non-imperial monarchs (who would go by (&quot;emperor&quot;) instead) in ancient China, and therefore is frequently translated to &quot;prince&quot;, especially for those who became rulers well after to the first adoption of the title 皇帝 by Qin Shi Huang. On the other hand, the son of a monarch would go by different titles, such as (&quot;imperial son&quot;) or (&quot;royal son&quot;).

From the Middle Ages on, the German designation and title of &quot;&quot; referred to:

* rulers of the states that made up the Holy Roman Empire, below the ruling &#x27; ([[emperor]]) or&#x27; (king);
* members of the nobility above the rank of &#x27; ([[count]]) but below&#x27; (duke);
* a ruler or monarch (in general).

==Use of the title in German==
The title &#x27; (female form &#x27;, female plural &#x27;) is used for the heads of princely houses of German origin (in German a &#x27;). From the Late Middle Ages, it referred to any vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor ruling over an immediate estate. Unless he also holds a higher title, such as grand duke or king, he will be known either by the formula &quot;&#x27; + [geographic origin of the dynasty]&quot;, or by the formula &quot;&#x27; + [name of the ruled territory]&quot;. These forms can be combined, as in &quot;&quot;.

The rank of the title-holder is not determined by the title itself, but by his degree of sovereignty, the rank of his suzerain, or the age of the princely family (note the terms &#x27;; and see German nobility). The &#x27; (Prince) ranked below the &#x27; (Duke) in the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s hierarchy, but princes did not necessarily rank below dukes in non-German parts of Europe. However, some German dukes who did not rule over an immediate duchy did not outrank reigning princes (e.g. Dukes of Gottschee, a title held by the Princes of Auersperg. Gottschee was not an Imperial state but a territory under the Dukes of Carniola. However, Princes of Auersperg held imperial immediacy for their state of Tengen). Likewise, the style usually associated with the title of &#x27; in post-medieval Europe, &#x27; (translated as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;), was considered inferior to &#x27; (&quot;Highness&quot;) in Germany, though not in France.

The present-day rulers of the sovereign principality of bear the title of &#x27;, and the title is also used in German when referring to the ruling princes of Monaco. The hereditary rulers of the one-time principalities of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania were also all referred to in German as &#x27; before they eventually assumed the title of &quot;king&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

==Other uses in German==
&#x27; is used more generally in German to refer to any ruler, such as a king, a reigning duke, or a prince in the broad sense (compare Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s &#x27;). Before the 12th century, counts were also included in this group, in accordance with its usage in the Holy Roman Empire, and in some historical or ceremonial contexts, the term &quot; can extend to any lord.

The descendants of a &#x27;, when that title has not been restricted by patent or custom to male primogeniture, are distinguished from the head of the family by use of the title &#x27; (prince, from ; female: &quot;).

A nobleman whose family is non-dynastic, i.e. has never reigned or been mediatised, may also be made a &#x27; by a sovereign, in which case the grantee and his heirs are deemed titular or nominal princes, enjoying only honorary princely title without commensurate rank. In families thus elevated to princely title (usually as a reward for military or political services) in or after the 18th century, the cadets often hold only the title of &#x27; (Count), such as in the families of the princes of , , and La Rochefoucauld-Montbel. However, in a few cases, the title of &quot; is available to all male-line descendants of the original grantee (mostly descendants of dukes, for example, the families of , , but also descendants of a simple Fürst, like ).

==Derived titles==
Several titles were derived from the term &quot;&quot;:

* (&quot;Prince of the Empire&quot;) was a ruling Prince whose territory was part of the Holy Roman Empire. He was entitled to a vote, either individually (&#x27;) or as a member of a voting unit (&#x27;), in the Imperial Diet (&#x27;). &#x27; was also used generically for any ruler who cast his vote in either of the &#x27;″s two upper chambers, the Electoral College (&#x27;) or the College of Princes (&#x27;): their specific title might be king, grand duke, duke, margrave, landgrave, count palatine (&#x27;), burgrave, Imperial prince (&#x27;) or Imperial count (&#x27;). Usually included in this group were the &#x27;, Imperial princes and counts whose small territories did not meet the &#x27;″s criteria for voting membership as an Imperial estate (&#x27;), but whose family&#x27;s right to vote therein was recognised by the Emperor. Officially, a Prince of the Church (&#x27;) who voted in the Electoral or Princely College, along with a handful of titular princes (nobles granted an honorary but hereditary title of prince by an Emperor who, however, were not &#x27;, lacking a vote in the &#x27;) might also be referred to as &quot;&quot;.
* (&quot;Prince of the Church&quot;) was a hierarch who held an ecclesiastic fief and Imperial princely rank, such as prince-bishops, prince-abbots, or Grand Masters of a Christian military order. All Cardinals are deemed to be Princes of the Church and considered to be equal to royal princes by the Church.
* (&quot;Prince of the Land&quot;) is a princely head of state, i.e. not just a titular prince. A &#x27; was a geopolitical entity with (feudal) statehood, whether fully independent or not. The term is sometimes translated, as in states bound together only in a personal union (e.g., the Electorate of Hanover and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) whose joint ruler reigned as a &#x27; in each of the realms under different titles and constitutions. Thus, for example, the Habsburg emperors held a different regnal style in each of their &quot;&quot; (&#x27;crown land&#x27;) realms.
* (&quot;Prince-Elector&quot;) was a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire with a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, as designated by the Golden Bull of 1356 or elevated to that status subsequently. Originally, only seven princes possessed that right, of whom four were secular and three ecclesiastic. This prerogative conferred on its holders rank inferior only to that of the Emperor, regardless of the specific title attached to each Elector&#x27;s principality. &#x27; (earlier spelled &#x27;) is derived from &#x27;, &quot;to choose&quot;. Properly an office of the Empire rather than a hereditary title, during the long &#x27; tenure of the Imperial throne held by the House of Habsburg, the Electorates were less distinguished from other Imperial princes by their right to choose an emperor than by the right to transmit the fief associated with the office to a single heir by primogeniture, originally unknown in Germany, rather than to divide lands among descendants in multiple appanages, allowing preservation of each Elector&#x27;s territorial integrity and power.
* (&quot;Grand Prince&quot;) was a rare title in German-speaking lands, and was used primarily to translate titles borne by rulers in and outside the Holy Roman Empire (e.g., Russia, Tuscany). In 1765, Empress Maria Theresa proclaimed the Hungarian province of Transylvania to be a &quot;Grand Principality&quot; (&quot;&quot;), whereafter it became one of the titles of the Emperor of Austria in 1804.
* (&quot;Prince primate&quot;) referred to the head of the member states of the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine established in 1806, then held by the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, . Today, it is a rarely used episcopal title: upon the elevation of the (&#x27;) archbishop, Christian August of Saxe-Zeitz, to a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1714, his successors have borne the title of Prince primate () up to today. The Archbishops of Salzburg still hold the title of &#x27;, though their diocese is located in Austria.

==Origins and cognates==
The word &quot;&quot; designates the head (the “first”) of a ruling house, or the head of a branch of such a house. The term “first” originates from ancient Germanic times, when the “first&quot;” was the leader in battle.

Various cognates of the word &#x27; exist in other European languages (see extensive list under Prince), sometimes only used for a princely ruler. A derivative of the Latin &#x27; (a Republican title in Roman law, which never formally recognized a monarchic style for the executive head of state but nominally maintained the Consuls as collegial Chief magistrates) is used for a genealogical prince in some languages (e.g., in Dutch and West Frisian, where a ruler is usually called &#x27; and &quot;foarst&quot;, respectively), but a &quot;prince of the blood&quot; is always styled &#x27;. In Icelandic, &#x27; is a ruler, and a &quot;prince of the blood&quot; is &#x27; (in these languages, no capital letters are used for writing titles, unless they occur as the first word of a sentence), while in other languages, only a &quot;&quot;-derived word is used for both (e.g., English uses &quot;prince&quot; for both). In all cases, the original (German or otherwise) term may also be used.

<text>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with an object, and generally also a message. An object consists of &quot;state data&quot; and &quot;behavior&quot;; these compose an &quot;interface&quot;, which specifies how the object may be used. A method is a behavior of an object parametrized by a user.

Data is represented as properties of the object, and behaviors are represented as methods. For example, a codice_1 object could have methods such as codice_2 and codice_3, while its state (whether it is open or closed at any given point in time) would be a property.

In class-based programming, methods are defined within a class, and objects are instances of a given class. One of the most important capabilities that a method provides is &quot;method overriding&quot; - the same name (e.g., codice_4) can be used for multiple different kinds of classes. This allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object. A method in Java programming sets the behavior of a class object. For example, an object can send an codice_4 message to another object and the appropriate formula is invoked whether the receiving object is a codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, etc.

Methods also provide the interface that other classes use to access and modify the properties of an object; this is known as &quot;encapsulation&quot;. Encapsulation and overriding are the two primary distinguishing features between methods and procedure calls.

==Overriding and overloading==
Method overriding and overloading are two of the most significant ways that a method differs from a conventional procedure or function call. Overriding refers to a subclass redefining the implementation of a method of its superclass. For example, codice_9 may be a method defined on a shape class, codice_8, etc. would each define the appropriate formula to calculate their area. The idea is to look at objects as &quot;black boxes&quot; so that changes to the internals of the object can be made with minimal impact on the other objects that use it. This is known as encapsulation and is meant to make code easier to maintain and re-use.

Method overloading, on the other hand, refers to differentiating the code used to handle a message based on the parameters of the method. If one views the receiving object as the first parameter in any method then overriding is just a special case of overloading where the selection is based only on the first argument. The following simple Java example illustrates the difference:

==Accessor, mutator and manager methods==
Accessor methods are used to read the data values of an object. Mutator methods are used to modify the data of an object. Manager methods are used to initialize and destroy objects of a class, e.g. constructors and destructors.

These methods provide an abstraction layer that facilitates encapsulation and modularity. For example, if a bank-account class provides a codice_11 accessor method to retrieve the current balance (rather than directly accessing the balance data fields), then later revisions of the same code can implement a more complex mechanism for balance retrieval (e.g., a database fetch), without the dependent code needing to be changed. The concepts of encapsulation and modularity are not unique to object-oriented programming. Indeed, in many ways the object-oriented approach is simply the logical extension of previous paradigms such as abstract data types and structured programming.

===Constructors===
A &quot;constructor&quot; is a method that is called at the beginning of an object&#x27;s lifetime to create and initialize the object, a process called construction (or &quot;instantiation&quot;). Initialization may include an acquisition of resources. Constructors may have parameters but usually do not return values in most languages. See the following example in Java:
public class Main {
 String _name;
 int _roll;

 Main(String name, int roll) { // constructor method
 this._name = name;
 this._roll = roll;
}
===Destructor===

A &quot;Destructor&quot; is a method that is called automatically at the end of an object&#x27;s lifetime, a process called Destruction. Destruction in most languages does not allow destructor method arguments nor return values. Destructors can be implemented so as to perform cleanup chores and other tasks at object destruction.

====Finalizers====
In garbage-collected languages, such as Java, C#, and Python, destructors are known as &quot;finalizers&quot;. They have a similar purpose and function to destructors, but because of the differences between languages that utilize garbage-collection and languages with manual memory management, the sequence in which they are called is different.

==Abstract methods==
An abstract method is one with only a signature and no implementation body. It is often used to specify that a subclass must provide an implementation of the method, as in an abstract class. Abstract methods are used to specify interfaces in some programming languages.

===Example===
The following Java code shows an abstract class that needs to be extended:
abstract class Shape {
 abstract int area(int h, int w); // abstract method signature

The following subclass extends the main class:
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
 @Override
 int area(int h, int w) {
 return h * w;
}
===Reabstraction===
If a subclass provides an implementation for an abstract method, another subclass can make it abstract again. This is called &quot;reabstraction&quot;.

In practice, this is rarely used.

====Example====
In C#, a virtual method can be overridden with an abstract method. (This also applies to Java, where all non-private methods are virtual.)

class IA
 public virtual void M() { }
abstract class IB : IA
 public override abstract void M(); // allowed


Interfaces&#x27; default methods can also be reabstracted, requiring subclasses to implement them. (This also applies to Java.)

interface IA
 void M() { }
interface IB : IA
 abstract void IA.M();
class C : IB { } // error: class &#x27;C&#x27; does not implement &#x27;IA.M&#x27;.
==Class methods==
Class methods are methods that are called on a class rather than an instance. They are typically used as part of an object meta-model. I.e, for each class, defined an instance of the class object in the meta-model is created. Meta-model protocols allow classes to be created and deleted. In this sense, they provide the same functionality as constructors and destructors described above. But in some languages such as the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) the meta-model allows the developer to dynamically alter the object model at run time: e.g., to create new classes, redefine the class hierarchy, modify properties, etc.

==Special methods==
Special methods are very language-specific and a language may support none, some, or all of the special methods defined here. A language&#x27;s compiler may automatically generate default special methods or a programmer may be allowed to optionally define special methods. Most special methods cannot be directly called, but rather the compiler generates code to call them at appropriate times.

===Static methods===

Static methods are meant to be relevant to all the instances of a class rather than to any specific instance. They are similar to static variables in that sense. An example would be a static method to sum the values of all the variables of every instance of a class. For example, if there were a codice_12 class it might have a static method to compute the average price of all products.

A static method can be invoked even if no instances of the class exist yet. Static methods are called &quot;static&quot; because they are resolved at compile time based on the class they are called on and not dynamically as in the case with instance methods, which are resolved polymorphically based on the runtime type of the object.

====Examples====
=====In Java=====
In Java, a commonly used static method is:
 Math.max(double a, double b)
This static method has no owning object and does not run on an instance. It receives all information from its arguments.

===Copy-assignment operators===
Copy-assignment operators define actions to be performed by the compiler when a class object is assigned to a class object of the same type.

===Operator methods===
Operator methods define or redefine operator symbols and define the operations to be performed with the symbol and the associated method parameters. C++ example:

#include &lt;string&gt;

class Data {
 public:
 bool operator&lt;(const Data&amp; data) const { return roll_ &lt; data.roll_; }
 bool operator==(const Data&amp; data) const {
 return name_ == data.name_ &amp;&amp; roll_ == data.roll_;

 private:
 std::string name_;
 int roll_;


==Member functions in C++==
Some procedural languages were extended with object-oriented capabilities to leverage the large skill sets and legacy code for those languages but still provide the benefits of object-oriented development. Perhaps the most well-known example is C++, an object-oriented extension of the C programming language. Due to the design requirements to add the object-oriented paradigm on to an existing procedural language, message passing in C++ has some unique capabilities and terminologies. For example, in C++ a method is known as a &quot;member function&quot;. C++ also has the concept of virtual functions which are member functions that can be overridden in derived classes and allow for dynamic dispatch.

===Virtual functions===
&quot;Virtual functions&quot; are the means by which a C++ class can achieve polymorphic behavior. &quot;Non-virtual member functions&quot;, or &quot;regular methods&quot;, are those that do not participate in polymorphism.

C++ Example:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class Super {
 public:
 virtual ~Super() = default;

 virtual void IAm() { std::cout « &quot;I&#x27;m the super class!\n&quot;; }

class Sub : public Super {
 public:
 void IAm() override { std::cout « &quot;I&#x27;m the subclass!\n&quot;; }

int main() {
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Super&gt; inst1 = std::make_unique&lt;Super&gt;();
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Super&gt; inst2 = std::make_unique&lt;Sub&gt;();

 inst1-&gt;IAm(); // Calls |Super::IAm|.
 inst2-&gt;IAm(); // Calls |Sub::IAm|.

<text>Grover is a blue Muppet character on the PBS/HBO children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Self-described as lovable, cute, and furry, he is a blue monster who rarely uses contractions when he speaks or sings. Grover was originally performed by Frank Oz from his earliest appearances. Eric Jacobson has performed the character regularly from the year 1998 onwards.

==Origins==
A prototype version of Grover appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on Christmas Eve in 1967. This puppet had greenish-brown fur and a red nose. He also had a raspier voice – somewhat like Cookie Monster&#x27;s – and was played a bit more unkempt than Grover would later behave. The monster was referred to as &quot;Gleep&quot;, a monster in Santa&#x27;s workshop. He later made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Muppets on Puppets&quot; in 1968 with the Rock and Roll Monster. In 1969, clad in a necktie, he appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street Pitch Reel&quot; in the board-room sequences. During the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the character was nicknamed &quot;Fuzzyface&quot; or &quot;The Hairy One&quot;, though neither would be used for his actual name. The muppet was not yet the &quot;cute&quot; character he would become, and he was not all that different in personality from the other monsters with whom he interacted.

In his book &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, author Malcolm Gladwell notes that the character &quot;was used in promotional films for IBM&quot;. The puppet first received the name &quot;Grover&quot; on May 1, 1970.

In an appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on May 31, 1970, the character acquired his present appearance with blue fur and a pink nose. In this appearance, Kermit the Frog tried to sing &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot; (accompanying himself on piano), but Grover repeatedly interrupted him. The updated puppet was later used beginning in the second season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, by this point fully formed into his current identity.

==Appearances==
===Charlie&#x27;s Restaurant===
One of the more frequent sketch segments featuring Grover involves him taking a series of customer service jobs. One of his customers is always Mr. Johnson, a balding, mustachioed customer who invariably becomes frustrated at Grover&#x27;s bumbling service and/or his (Grover&#x27;s) insistence that he is serving him properly.

The first Grover-Mr. Johnson series of sketches, set at &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, aired in the early 1970s; here, Grover is employed as a waiter and Mr. Johnson is his customer.

The sketches followed the same basic premise: Mr. Johnson would order a menu item, Grover would serve the customer, a disagreement results (usually) as a result of Grover&#x27;s mistakes, and Grover attempting (often, more than once) to correct the mistake with varied degrees of success. Under this backdrop, the sketches served to teach the childhood audience basic concepts such as same and different, big and little, hot and cold, the alphabet, following directions and patience, among other things. This was even parodied in an episode of &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot;, where Grover had to keep rushing out of the kitchen to tell Johnson that they had run out of parts of his order. Naturally, Alistair Cookie introduced this performance as &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

Repeats of the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; series of sketches aired for many years on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In the years since, new Grover-Mr. Johnson sketches have been produced, with Grover taking other customer service jobs and Mr. Johnson as his hapless customer. Every time, Mr. Johnson recognizes Grover as &quot;that waiter from Charlie&#x27;s&quot;.

Grover&#x27;s jobs have ranged from a taxi driver and a photographer to a flight attendant and singing telegram artist. One sketch parodied the ABC television series &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; in a segment where Grover began remodeling Mr. Johnson&#x27;s home despite his express wishes. In another one, Mr. Johnson is the only patron, and Grover is the only actor, for a production of &quot;Spider-Monster: The Musical&quot;, a parody of the musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;. The play is, of course, a complete calamity and finally comes crashing down on both of them.

===Other segments===
Grover also has an instructional persona who wears a cap and gown to provide educational context for simple, everyday things. His lessons are often wrong, leaving himself open to correction by a group of Muppets. Combined with the failings of the Super Grover character, this means that Grover can be very self-conscious and timid. He is often a source of slapstick humor and often accidentally injures himself.

Early in the series, Grover would often greet Kermit the Frog by running up to him and shouting, &quot;Hey, froggy babeee!&quot; and then giving him a hard slap on the back, which knocked him over.

&quot;Global Grover&quot; is a more recent series of segments, in which Grover hosts a trip to a foreign country to learn about their culture and customs.

In 2010, Grover starred in a parody of an Old Spice Commercial called &quot;Smell Like a Monster&quot; based on &quot;The Man Your Man Could Smell Like&quot;, albeit a clam with &quot;two tickets to the thing you love&quot; bit his nose and he rode a cow rather than a horse.

===Super Grover===
Grover has a semi-secret superhero identity as the well-meaning but inept &quot;Super Grover&quot;, sometimes presented as the alter ego of Grover Kent, &quot;ace doorknob salesman for Acme, Inc&quot;. Originally his superhero costume consisted of a pink cape and medieval knight&#x27;s helmet, with a Superman-style crest on both the cape and his T-shirt, bearing a letter &quot;G&quot; on his chest instead of &quot;S&quot;. During the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; ran a series of Super Grover sketches spoofing the classic &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; series (in the opening of these, his name was hyphenated &quot;Super-Grover&quot;). An announcer (Jerry Nelson) introduced each episode with the lines:
With that, a fanfare sounds, Super Grover bursts through a paper wall bearing his crest, fruitlessly tries to move his helmet up off his eyes, and adds, &quot;And I am cute, too!&quot;

From there, episodes followed a simple formula: Super Grover is flying somewhere over Metro City when he hears the cries of a Muppet child in some small trouble and immediately sails in to assist. The excited child is quickly disillusioned as Super Grover crash-lands nearby. From there, Grover continues to be enthusiastic but no help whatsoever, his &quot;dramatic&quot; feats of strength or speed serving only to kill time while the child solves the problem on their own and wanders off. By then, Grover&#x27;s efforts have usually landed him in a comical predicament of his own.

Super Grover has appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; theatrical films &quot;Follow That Bird&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot; (1999), where it is revealed he stretches his arms out and spins into his costume in homage to &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;), as well as the PBS special &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Pictures&quot; (1983), where he first appears as regular Grover, but quickly changes into his costume in an attempt to make friends with a suit of armor (having no idea that there&#x27;s no one inside it).

For &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s 41st season in 2010, the character was revamped as &quot;Super Grover 2.0&quot;, who debuted on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, flying in and crash-landing behind the chair where he was meant to sit. His new costume consists of a Roman Centurion-style helmet with a spiked crest, a red cape, metal gauntlets and boots, a utility belt, and a black rubber vest, most of which resembles bike racing gear. Both the cape and the vest are adorned with his crest, now with a lightning bolt added behind the &quot;G&quot;. The helmet has a hinged visor which still tends to fall over Grover&#x27;s eyes, and his tagline is: &quot;Super Grover 2.0 – He Shows Up!&quot;

===Grover&#x27;s Mother (&quot;Mommy&quot;)===
&quot;Grover&#x27;s Mommy&quot; plays an integral but often unrecognized role on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. She has been seen almost exclusively in print, including the many illustrated books starring Grover. She was also occasionally seen in photographs, as a photo puppet, such as on the cover of Volume 4 of &quot;The Sesame Street Treasury&quot;. Over the course of time, her appearance has fluctuated greatly.

Her earliest known appearance as a Muppet is a 1970s sketch in which Grover speaks to the audience about being afraid of the dark. At the end of the sketch, his mom (Frank Oz) enters his room to kiss him goodnight. In this appearance, the puppet used for her is recycled from the early Grover puppet from the first season. Another early appearance (circa 1981) involves his mother (Kathryn Mullen) coming into the bathroom while Grover is telling the audience about how to take a bath.

She has more recently appeared (performed by Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo) in a brief &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; sequence (from the &quot;Families&quot; episode), with her son as his alter-ego Super Grover, as her own alter-ego, &quot;Super-Mommy&quot;. Grover crashlands, screaming &quot;Moooommy!&quot; and his mom follows shouting &quot;Soooonny!&quot; crashing on top of him. They recover, acknowledge each other, and almost hug, but they both fall down before they are able to.

==Books==
In the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Monster at the End of This Book&quot; (1971), Grover goes to great effort to keep the reader from turning the pages of the book, because there is a monster on the final page. Grover ties pages down, nails pages to the next one and builds a brick wall to block access; at the end it is discovered that the monster at the end of the book is Grover himself, who is mortified (&quot;Oh, I am so embarrassed...&quot;). The late 1990s saw a sequel to the book where Grover desperately tries to stop Elmo from reaching the end of the book, eventually directing him to leave the book and enter from the back. Therefore, when both of them reach the end, they wind up scaring each other.

Another popular children&#x27;s book, &quot;Would You like to Play Hide &amp; Seek in This Book with Lovable, Furry Old Grover?&quot;, had Grover trying different ways to hide from the reader, eventually getting upset and begging the reader to just say &quot;no&quot; they do not see him, even though he was just crouching down in a corner.

In 1974, Grover went on a learning expedition in &quot;Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum&quot;, written by Norman Stiles and Daniel Wilcox, and illustrated by Joe Mathieu. He tours rooms such as &quot;The Long Thin Things You Can Write with Room&quot;, as well as &quot;The Things That Make So Much Noise You Can&#x27;t Think Room&quot;. Grover wanders through &quot;The Things That Are Light Room&quot;, returns a rock to &quot;The Things That Are Heavy Room&quot;, and just when he wonders whether it is possible to have a museum that holds everything in the whole wide world, he comes upon a door labeled &quot;Everything Else&quot;, which opens to take him out into the world. As of 1996, Publishers Weekly ranked the book at 79 on their list of best-selling children&#x27;s paperbacks, and Lou Harry of Indianapolis Business Journal included the book on his list of 12 examples of how Muppets have qualified as quality entertainment. 

&quot;The Adventures of Grover in Outer Space&quot; is a Sesame Street storybook featuring Grover that was published in 1984. &quot;When Grover Moved to Sesame Street&quot; was published in 1985. He was also featured in &quot;I Want a Hat Like That&quot; (1987, reprinted 1999).

<text>Philip Chapman Lesh (March 15, 1940 – October 25, 2024) was an American musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he developed a unique style of playing improvised six-string bass guitar. He was their bassist throughout their 30-year career.

After the group disbanded in 1995, Lesh continued the tradition of Grateful Dead family music with a side project, Phil Lesh and Friends, which paid homage to the Dead&#x27;s music by playing their repertoire, as well as songs by members of his own group. Lesh operated a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads. From 2009 to 2014, he performed in Furthur alongside former Grateful Dead bandmate Bob Weir. He scaled back touring in 2014 but continued to perform concerts.

== Background ==
Lesh was born in Berkeley, California, on March 15, 1940, the only child of Frank Lesh, an amateur piano player, and Barbra Chapman. His father encouraged him to take up the violin at the age of eight. At El Cerrito High School in East Bay he became a member of the school&#x27;s marching band.

While enrolled at Berkeley High School he switched to trumpet and participated in the school&#x27;s music-related extracurricular activities. He studied the instrument under Bob Hansen, conductor of the symphonic Golden Gate Park Band and became interested in avant-garde classical music and free jazz. By his mid-teens, inspired by Beethoven and Charles Ives, he had decided that he wanted to be a composer.

Lesh enrolled at the College of San Mateo, where he wrote arrangements for the community college&#x27;s big band and played trumpet. After transferring with sophomore standing to the University of California, Berkeley in 1961, he befriended future Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten. At Constanten&#x27;s suggestion, he studied under the Italian modernist Luciano Berio in a graduate-level course at Mills College in the spring of 1962, where their classmates included Steve Reich and Stanford University cross-registrant John Chowning.

While volunteering for radio station KPFA as a recording engineer, Lesh met bluegrass banjo player Jerry Garcia and invited him to perform on the station&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Special&quot; show, and despite their different musical interests they became friends. Lesh briefly worked in the Post Office Department, where he drove a service truck. In spring 1965 he saw Garcia&#x27;s new band, the Warlocks, in concert, and was impressed. A few weeks later Garcia invited him to become the group&#x27;s bassist. This was unexpected, as Lesh had never played bass guitar. According to Lesh, the first song he rehearsed with the band was &quot;I Know You Rider&quot;. He joined them for their third or fourth gig (memories vary) and stayed until the end.

The group changed its name to the Grateful Dead and began playing at Ken Kesey&#x27;s Acid Tests parties (LSD then being legal in California). In late 1966 Lesh moved with the group to San Francisco, where they were signed to a recording deal with Warner Brothers, and found himself playing at venues such as the Filmore and the Avalon. As Lesh had never before played bass he learned &quot;on the job&quot;, which meant he had no preconceived ideas about the instrument&#x27;s traditional role in the rhythm section and was free to develop his own style. In his autobiography, he credited Jack Casady (the bassist in San Francisco band Jefferson Airplane) as an influence on the direction in which his instincts were taking him. He said that his playing style was influenced more by Bach&#x27;s counterpoint than by contemporaneous rock and soul bass players. He also cited Jack Bruce of Cream as an influence.

== Music ==
Lesh became an innovator in the new role that the electric bass was developing during the mid-1960s. Contemporary bass players such as Casady, Bruce, James Jamerson, and Paul McCartney had adopted a more melodic, contrapuntal approach to the instrument. Before this, bass players in rock had generally played a conventional timekeeping role within the beat of the song, within (or underpinning) the song&#x27;s harmonic or chord structure. While not abandoning these elements, Lesh went on his own improvised excursions during a song or instrumental, and in the group&#x27;s long improvised jams in their live performances Lesh&#x27;s six-string bass complemented Garcia&#x27;s guitar solos with cascades of notes and unusual time signatures. This became a characteristic part of the so-called San Francisco Sound in the new rock music. 

Early on, Lesh grasped the sonic possibilities presented by recording in the studio, and his style of playing often led to complaints by the band&#x27;s record label. Joe Smith of Warner Bros. wrote a letter about cost overruns that had accumulated during studio sessions for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot; (1968). According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Smith singled him out as &quot;the catalyst for chaos within the band&quot;, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s apparent that nobody in your organization has enough influence over Phil Lesh to evoke anything resembling normal behavior.&quot; Lesh was not a prolific composer or singer with the Grateful Dead, though he did occasionally make contributions such as the opening track on &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Box of Rain&quot;. He co-wrote several of the band&#x27;s best-known compositions, including &quot;St Stephen&quot;, &quot;The Eleven&quot; and &quot;Dark Star&quot;. His high tenor voice contributed to the Grateful Dead&#x27;s three-part harmony sections in their group vocals in the early days of the band, until he largely relinquished singing high parts to Donna Godchaux (and subsequently Brent Mydland and Vince Welnick) in 1974 because of vocal cord damage from improper singing technique. In the early 80s, he resumed singing lead vocals on songs closer to his natural vocal range.

Lesh introduced his bandmates to the aural explorations of the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. All of the band&#x27;s shows were recorded by Deadhead tapers, and it became possible to listen to any given performance from 1972 or 1974 and hear the Grateful Dead interpreting the musical innovations that Lesh stimulated through Coltrane&#x27;s influence. Throughout the Dead&#x27;s career, his interest in jazz avant-garde music remained a crucial influence on the group. He later introduced the band to composer Charles Ives, which created their ability to go spontaneously from a discordant jam into a blues or country song. In the 30 years between 1965 and 1995 Lesh played almost 2,500 concerts with the Grateful Dead, many of them lasting for up to six hours. 

Lesh collaborated with Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley, the Dead&#x27;s onetime sound engineer (and former source of LSD) in designing the Wall of Sound, an enormous sound reinforcement system they used for forty-odd shows in the 1974 tour. After two years of problem-solving and planning, the forty-foot high Wall of Sound was first used publicly at the Cow Palace in San Francisco on March 23, 1974. With nine independent channels, the powerful system contained 604 speakers driven by 26,400 watts of power. Lesh compared playing through the system to &quot;piloting a flying saucer. Or riding your own sound wave&quot;. According to Lesh, Owsley persuaded the Dead to record every one of their shows, emphasizing the necessity of listening to the tapes. 

In 1994, Lesh was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.
==Post-Grateful Dead==
After the Grateful Dead disbanded, Lesh continued to play the band&#x27;s music in concert with its offshoots The Other Ones and The Dead and to promote San Francisco hippy philosophy, as well as performing with his own band, Phil Lesh and Friends. In 1999 and 2000, he co-headlined two tours with Bob Dylan.

Lesh published his autobiography, &quot;Searching for the Sound: My Life with the Grateful Dead&quot; in 2005. In 2009, he went on tour with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead. After the 2009 summer tour, Lesh formed a new band with Bob Weir named Furthur which debuted in September 2009.

In 2012, Lesh founded a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads, in San Rafael, California. The venue officially opened on March 8, 2012, with a first of a run of twelve concerts by Phil Lesh and Friends. When not on tour, Lesh&#x27;s sons, Grahame and Brian, served as the house band at Terrapin Crossroads. In addition to songs from the Dead catalog, Lesh played material by Mumford &amp; Sons, Zac Brown Band and other contemporary acts with his sons. Terrapin Crossroads closed in November 2021 when their lease on the property expired.

Lesh began performing again with Phil Lesh and Friends in 2012. Furthur disbanded in early 2014 and, at age 74, Lesh ceased touring full time. Thereafter he performed regularly at Terrapin Crossroads with various Phil Lesh and Friends lineups as well as with the Terrapin Family Band. In the early 2010s he performed select shows at venues throughout the United States, notably the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, as well as at festivals. He took part in the 2015 Fare Thee Well concerts, and a short North American tour with Bob Weir in the spring of 2018. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him as the 11th greatest bass player. In March 2023, he celebrated his 83rd birthday and hundredth show at the Capitol Theatre.

==Personal life, health and death==

Lesh married Jill Johnstone, a waitress from the cafe next door to the Grateful Dead&#x27;s office in San Francisco. They had two sons, Grahame and Brian, both of whom became musicians and played with their father in the Terrapin Family Band. They frequently played together, both publicly and in private. They performed in an annual benefit concert group known as Philharmonia, dating from 1997, including on December 18, 2011 at a Christmas gig which included Bob Weir and Jackie Greene at the Tenderloin Middle School cafeteria attended by 250 people.

Lesh and his wife administered their charitable organization, the Unbroken Chain Foundation.

Lesh had a lifelong interest in the occult and was a member of the Research Into Lost Knowledge organisation.

In 1998, Lesh underwent a liver transplant as a result of a chronic hepatitis C infection. He became an outspoken advocate for organ donation on live recordings of his performances. 
On October 26, 2006, Lesh stated on his official website that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the disease that killed his father, and would be undergoing an operation in December 2006. On December 7, 2006, he reported that he had undergone prostate surgery and the cancer had been removed. In October 2015, Lesh announced that he had had bladder cancer surgery. He stated that his prognosis was good and that he expected to make a full recovery.

In August 2019, Lesh announced that he was to undergo back surgery and he and his band canceled engagements at the Outlaw Music Festival, Telluride Blues &amp; Brews Festival, and Dirt Farmers Festival. He was expected to make a full recovery.

Lesh died on October 25, 2024, at the age of 84.

<text>Lubaantun (pronounced /lubaːnˈtun/; also Lubaantún in Spanish orthography) is a pre-Columbian ruined city of the Maya civilization in southern Belize, Central America. Lubaantun is in Belize&#x27;s Toledo District, about 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Punta Gorda, and approximately 3.2 kilometres (2 mi) from the village of San Pedro Columbia, at an elevation of 61 metres (200 ft) feet above mean sea level. One of the most distinguishing features of Lubaantun is the large collection of miniature ceramic objects found on site; these detailed constructs are thought to have been charmstones or ritual-accompanying accoutrements.

The city dates from the Maya Classic era, flourishing from the AD 730s to the 890s, and seems to have been completely abandoned soon after. The architecture is somewhat unusual from typical Classical central lowlands Maya sites. Lubaantun&#x27;s structures are mostly built of large stone blocks laid with no mortar, primarily black slate rather than the limestone typical of the region. Several structures have distinctive &quot;in-and-out masonry&quot;; each tier is built with a batter, every second course projecting slightly beyond the course below it. Corners of the step-pyramids are usually rounded, and lack stone structures atop the pyramids; presumably some had structures of perishable materials in ancient times.

The centre of the site is on a large artificially raised platform between two small rivers; it has often been noted that the situation is well-suited to military defence. The ancient name of the site is currently unknown; &quot;Lubaantun&quot; is a modern Maya name meaning &quot;place of fallen stones&quot;.

== Archaeological investigations ==
At the start of the 20th century inhabitants of various Kekchi and Mopan Maya villages in the area mentioned the large ruins to inhabitants of Punta Gorda. Dr. Thomas Gann came to investigate the site in 1903, and published two reports about the ruins in 1905.

The next expedition was led by R. E. Merwin of Harvard University&#x27;s Peabody Museum in 1915 who cleared the site of vegetation, made a more detailed map, took measurements and photographs, and made minor excavations. Of note Merwin discovered one of the site&#x27;s three courts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, which had stone markers with hieroglyphic texts and depictions of the ballgame.

In 1924 Gann revisited the ruins, and then led adventurer F.A. Mitchell-Hedges to the site. In his typically sensationalistic fashion, Mitchell-Hedges published an article in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; claiming to have &quot;discovered&quot; the site. Gann made a new map of the site. The following year Mitchell-Hedges returned to Lubaantun as a reporter for the Illustrated London News, accompanied by his companion Lady Richmond Brown. Anna Mitchell-Hedges, the adoptive daughter of F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, would later claim that she not only accompanied her father on the expedition, but also that it was she who found the (in)famous crystal skull there. But there is no evidence that Anna was ever in Belize, and if the skull actually had been excavated at Lubaantun it would be hard to explain why none of the official reports mention it, why other expedition members deny that it was found there, and why the publicity-loving Mitchell-Hedges did not publish even a single mention of the skull before the 1950s. According to Nickell, there is a plethora of mystery surrounding
the crystal skull allegedly found at Lubaantun. New Age believers assert that
there are thirteen crystal skulls that when brought together will unite humanity and heal the world. There is little evidence to suggest that the skulls have any mystical or psychic properties other than anecdotal evidence presented by Anna Mitchell-Hedges. She claimed that the skull was the secret to her longevity, and that it has the ability to kill whoever dares mock its power. Moreover, some scholars believe that the skulls may be Aztec but assert that they certainly are not Pre-Columbian or the 3,000 years old as postulated by F.A. Mitchell-Hedges. Additionally, many archaeologists postulate that most, if not all, of the skulls are European forgeries.

More importantly, it is clear from investigations by Joe Nickell and Norman Hammond that the skull was not found at Lubaantun at all, but was actually purchased by Mitchell-Hedges at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 1943. The skull had previously belonged to the collector Sydney Burney, and photographs of it had been published in the journal &quot;Man&quot; as early as 1936.

Geoffrey Laws, along with T.A. Joyce and Mitchell-Hedges surveyed the site of Lubaantun. He noted that the site lies upon the line dividing these two geographical units, situated near the village of San Pedro Colombia, at the head of canoe navigation on the Colombia River. The ruins are located in the area formed by the convergence of two small tributaries of this river. His reports, along with other scholars, are consistent in their prostrations that the Lubaantun Maya rigorously utilized water transport. Moreover, Laws commented on the climate as being warm and humid. His report also notes an absence of any “indigenous populations” in his 1928 survey; consistent with other fieldwork at the time.
The British Museum sponsored investigations and excavations at Lubaantun under T.A. Joyce in 1926 and 1927, establishing the mid to late Classic period chronology of the site. According to Joyce, the complex at Lubaantun was 900 feet long and 600 feet wide toward the north. During his excavation the archaeologist found pottery fragments which were both shaped and painted along with stone items and shell ornaments. He believed that most of the material culture at the site indicated
that it was an Early Classic site but this assertion has since been dismissed by the archaeological community. Notably, he thought that the site must have been under strict centralized control since the architectural styles found would have required large amounts of physical labor. He also identifies four “classes” of masonry: megalithic cut blocks, smaller perpendicular blocks, “in and out” structures that lacked stucco, and also poorly constructed blocks that suggest that the Maya failed to build another “in and out” building style. In addition, he details the two great pyramids that he excavated are in the “in and out” style which stand approximately 40 feet tall. Furthermore, Joyce documented the presence of large, megalithic terracing which he thought were reminiscent of Peruvian styles. He noted the absence of “ornamental” stone carvings which other scholars have recorded as well. This leads to greater difficulties in defining precise dates at Lubaantun.

Moreover, despite the lack of hieroglyphs and stelae Joyce discovered an abundance of pottery-whistle figurines which feature two finger holes, allowing for three notes to be produced. He mentioned how he found some painted pottery but it appears to be similarly fashioned to painted pieces found in Pusilha, indicating that the latter was responsible for painted works and Lubaantun produced molded figurines. The whistles often depict important cosmological figures, and officials in ceremonial garb. He identified two physical types of figurines, those he calls “chubby” and the other as “classical.” The classical features include people, depicting cranial modification, ear flares, and nose ornaments. The chubby figures include a large forehead and cheeks, and there is an absence of facial ornaments. Many of the molded figures feature masks. Joyce also made distinctions between the male and female figurines that he observed. Men often were shown wearing girdles, capes, and long skirts while women became associated with the sombrero. Joyce notes that girdles may be indicative of a warrior class distinction. Men carry “provision” bags, spears, and rattles highlighting their association with field work/hunting while women are depicted carrying water jars or baskets of agricultural products. The production of metate is additionally featured on many of these
figurines. He also discovered fans at Lubaantun and a “special” series of figurines that depict crests, close-fitting helmets, a glove worn in the right hand, and highly dramatized thigh flaps. He believed that these could indicate that the figurines displayed the dress of ball players.

Many of the artefacts from this expedition can be found in the British Museum&#x27;s collection. After this Lubaantun was neglected by archeologists (although it suffered some looting by treasure hunters) until 1970, when a joint British Museum, Harvard, and Cambridge University project was begun led by archaeologist Norman Hammond. Norman Hammond, Kate Pretty, and Frank P. Saul excavated the site in the 1970s. Their research team, in congruence with Sharer and Traxler, believed that the site was founded in the Late Classic period as opposed to the Early Classic, suggested by Joyce. In addition, they postulated that the site saw no Postclassic reoccupation and considered it to be abandoned until the site’s later discovery. They also discuss how Lubaantun has been subject to various looting activities. Their excavations primarily dealt with one Maya family tomb. Various problems were associated with their excavation, including water damage and collapsed masonry walls. Unlike prior surveys, their team found pottery vessels which may have been painted at one point but time has since faded their decorative coating. Hammond&#x27;s team also found skeletal remains that were also badly damaged by water, but tooth preservation remained relatively good. The disposition of the skulls and bones are consistent with the Maya’s tendency to repurpose tombs, and bury multiple remains in one area. Saul reported that the tomb contained 15 adults, both male and female of various young and middle adult ages. All of the individuals had cavities except for one individual and virtually all of the remains indicate malnutrition occurred in early childhood.

Furthermore, the pottery vessels are primarily appear in Tepeu 2 style with some indication of Tepeu 3 in the Uaxactun chronology. The ceramic data suggest that the tomb was not utilized for a very long; no more than a century. They also found ground, and polished stone obsidian blade flakes, ear/nose plugs and a stylized flower. They claim that the site is unique because it is 1 of 26 sites (out of 115) which indicate that there were
multiple burials.

Sharer and Traxler also believe that the site is a Late Classic center. They note that Normand Hammond provided a new map for the site in 1970. Their work suggests that Lubaantun was occupied “briefly” from AD 700 to 870. There is also evidence that the site was a main production center for cacao and that Lubaantuun was the local capital in that particular area. Ceramic and stone effigies with cacao pods have been found at the site. Additionally discovered is an acropolis, one ball court, and Quirigua-style architecture in the form of large masonry terraces. However, the site lacks two major components which would indicate that Lubaantuun was a Late Classic
site; there are no vaulted buildings or carved sculptured monuments. Also discussed is the space and place of buildings at the site. Lubaantun, being a smaller Maya site, has discernible open public and closed private spaces.

Little is still known regarding how the Lubaantun Maya traded with other polities and their relationship with neighboring communities. While Sharer and Traxler’s work largely pertains to the cacao trade, Heather McKillop’s work at Stingray Lagoon reveals the importance of salt production and trade in the Precolumbian Maya realm. The presence of molded Lubaantun-style whistle figurines, inland goods at the Stingray Lagoon site, and unit-stamped pottery provide supporting evidence for
salt production and for inland transport.

Current archaeology imbues that Lubaantun is still a widely interpreted site. Nonetheless, excavations demonstrate that the site is renowned for its mass of mould-made ceramic whistle figurines, manos, and metates, as well as its stair-like architecture. New research reveals that the site has three ball courts, to the east, west, and south of the major E group buildings. Scholars also estimate that the population at Lubaantun may have consisted of 600 people per square kilometer. Additionally, it is postulated that Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit was politically created from the earlier centers of Pusilha or Uxbenka. Archaeological evidence suggests that Lubaantun was built at a strategic spatial location in order to maintain access the natural ecological resources and take advantage of the pre-existing trade networks. Other research suggests that language spoken at Lubaantun was most likely a dialect of Cholan, one of the many dialects spoken in the Classic Maya heartland. Furthermore, current projects are still underway at Lubaantun. In 1998, the Maya Archaeological Sites Development Program, in tandem with the European Union, and the Belize Government’s
Department of Archaeology, made successful attempts at restoration, and building of an interpretive Visitor Center at the site.

Lubaantun is now accessible to visitors by automobile and has a small visitors&#x27; centre. As of 2001 an admission fee of 10 BZD dollars was charged to visitors.

<text>Brussels is a community within the Municipality of Huron East in Huron County, Ontario, Canada. It held village status prior to 2001. The most recent population estimate was 993 residents in 2021.

== History ==

Brussels was settled in 1854, when William Ainley purchased 200 acres of land alongside the Maitland River. Originally, Ainley named the settlement after himself, and it was known as Ainleyville until it was incorporated as Brussels in 1872.

The Ronald Streamer, a piece of firefight equipment, was made in Brussels.

On January 1, 2001, it was amalgamated with Grey Township, McKillop Township, Tuckersmith Township and the village of Seaforth into the Municipality of Huron East.

== Geography ==
Brussels is located in the Municipality of Huron East; however, the town lies on the municipal border to the Municipality of Morris-Turnberry. Both of these municipalities are located in Huron County, Ontario.

The town is split by two Huron County roads; 12 and 16. Huron County Road 12, called &quot;Turnberry Street&quot; &quot;(in-town)&quot; and &quot;Brussels Line&quot; &quot;(out-of-town)&quot; runs north–south through the town while Huron County Road 16 runs west–east through the town with a distinct name depending on the direction. The road is named &quot;Morris Road (out-of-town)&quot; or &quot;Orchard Line (in-town)&quot; when traveling west from the town; the road is named &quot;Newry Road (out-of-town)&quot; or &quot;Queen Street (in-town)&quot; when travelling east from the town.

The Maitland River runs through the town in a south to north direction which has resulted in the construction of a dam in the community. The river and low-land areas of the dam typically floods every spring from increased rainfall and snow melt.

Brussels is north of London and west of Kitchener. It is also east of the closest coastal community, Goderich on the shorelines of Lake Huron.

As Brussels is a rural community, farmland surrounds the town on all sides with scattered bushes amongst the fields.

===Climate===
Brussels consists of humid continental climate with four distinct seasons. The climate generally falls into the &quot;Dfb&quot; climate subtype.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Brussels had a population of 993 living in 422 of its 444 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,158. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Media ==
=== Newspapers ===
&quot;The Brussels Post&quot; was a newspaper organization formed in 1884 in the town of Brussels. The newspaper organization was operation from 1884 through to 1929 before ceasing operations. The operations started back up in 1937 through to 1983 when &quot;The&quot; &quot;Brussels Post&quot; was discontinued. Four years after &quot;The Brussels Post&quot; ceased operations, the North Huron Citizen formed.

In the early days of &quot;The Brussels Post&quot;, the operations were weekly.

While sources claim that &quot;The Brussels Post&quot; was formed in 1885, the earliest known digitalized paper from January 2, 1885, states that it is the 26th paper or 26th week, indicating that the first paper would have been issued around July 4, 1884.

After the discontinuing of &quot;The Brussels Post&quot; in 1981, &quot;The Citizen&quot;, provided by North Huron Citizen was formed. &quot;The Citizen&quot; is the newspaper still distributed around the community as of 2022. Similar to &quot;The Brussels Post&quot;, the newspaper is issued weekly.

While the head-office for the North Huron Citizen is located in the nearby community of Blyth, Ontario, there was a small office located in the Brussels downtown core. The sub-office was closed in 2022.

<text>San Pedro Columbia is a village in Toledo District, Belize, located about two miles from the ancient Maya ruins of Lubaantun. In 2000 San Pedro Columbia had a population of about 700 people. The population is mostly Q&#x27;eqchi Maya with some Mopan Maya. San Pedro Columbia has Belize&#x27;s largest settlement of Kekchi. Most of the population came to Belize from the Petén region of Guatemala in the late 19th century. The village is known for the hand woven embroidery produced there.

==Ancient history==
Lubaantun is one of the area&#x27;s pre-Columbian Maya sites, inhabited at least as early as the Maya Classic Period. Lubaantun has unusual features of construction including drystone work and rounded corners that set it apart from other Maya sites.

<doc id="232840" wikidata="Q3299105" url="?curid=232840" title="Mathematics of paper folding">
<text>The discipline of origami or paper folding has received a considerable amount of mathematical study. Fields of interest include a given paper model&#x27;s flat-foldability (whether the model can be flattened without damaging it), and the use of paper folds to solve mathematical equations up to the third order.

Computational origami is a recent branch of computer science that is concerned with studying algorithms that solve paper-folding problems. The field of computational origami has also grown significantly since its inception in the 1990s with Robert Lang&#x27;s TreeMaker algorithm to assist in the precise folding of bases. Computational origami results either address origami design or origami foldability. In origami design problems, the goal is to design an object that can be folded out of paper given a specific target configuration. In origami foldability problems, the goal is to fold something using the creases of an initial configuration. Results in origami design problems have been more accessible than in origami foldability problems.

==History==

In 1893, Indian civil servant T. Sundara Row published &quot;Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding&quot; which used paper folding to demonstrate proofs of geometrical constructions. This work was inspired by the use of origami in the kindergarten system. Row demonstrated an approximate trisection of angles and implied construction of a cube root was impossible.

In 1922, Harry Houdini published &quot;Houdini&#x27;s Paper Magic,&quot; which described origami techniques that drew informally from mathematical approaches that were later formalized.
In 1936 Margharita P. Beloch showed that use of the &#x27;Beloch fold&#x27;, later used in the sixth of the Huzita–Hatori axioms, allowed the general cubic equation to be solved using origami.

In 1949, R C Yeates&#x27; book &quot;Geometric Methods&quot; described three allowed constructions corresponding to the first, second, and fifth of the Huzita–Hatori axioms.

The Yoshizawa–Randlett system of instruction by diagram was introduced in 1961.
In 1980 a construction was reported which enabled an angle to be trisected. Trisections are impossible under Euclidean rules.

Also in 1980, Kōryō Miura and Masamori Sakamaki demonstrated a novel map-folding technique whereby the folds are made in a prescribed parallelogram pattern, which allows the map to be expandable without any right-angle folds in the conventional manner. Their pattern allows the fold lines to be interdependent, and hence the map can be unpacked in one motion by pulling on its opposite ends, and likewise folded by pushing the two ends together. No unduly complicated series of movements are required, and folded &quot;Miura-ori&quot; can be packed into a very compact shape. In 1985 Miura reported a method of packaging and deployment of large membranes in outer space, and as early as 2012 this technique had been applied to solar panels on spacecraft.
In 1986, Messer reported a construction by which one could double the cube, which is impossible with Euclidean constructions.

The first complete statement of the seven axioms of origami by French folder and mathematician Jacques Justin was written in 1986, but were overlooked until the first six were rediscovered by Humiaki Huzita in 1989. The first International Meeting of Origami Science and Technology (now known as the International Conference on Origami in Science, Math, and Education) was held in 1989 in Ferrara, Italy. At this meeting, a construction was given by Scimemi for the regular heptagon.

Around 1990, Robert J. Lang and others first attempted to write computer code that would solve origami problems.
In 1996, Marshall Bern and Barry Hayes showed that the problem of assigning a crease pattern of mountain and valley folds in order to produce a flat origami structure starting from a flat sheet of paper is NP-complete.

In 1999, a theorem due to Haga provided constructions used to divide the side of a square into rational fractions.

In late 2001 and early 2002, Britney Gallivan proved the minimum length of paper necessary to fold it in half a certain number of times and folded a piece of toilet paper twelve times.

In 2002, Sarah-Marie Belcastro and Tom Hull brought to the theoretical origami the language of affine transformations, with an extension from formula_12 to formula_13 in only the case of single-vertex construction.
In 2002, Alperin solved Alhazen&#x27;s problem of spherical optics. In the same paper, Alperin showed a construction for a regular heptagon. In 2004, was proven algorithmically the fold pattern for a regular heptagon. Bisections and trisections were used by Alperin in 2005 for the same construction.

In 2003, Jeremy Gibbons, a researcher from the University of Oxford, described a style of functional programming in terms of origami. He coined this paradigm as &quot;origami programming.&quot; He characterizes fold and unfolds as natural patterns of computation over recursive datatypes that can be framed in the context of origami.

In 2005, principles and concepts from mathematical and computational origami were applied to solve &quot;Countdown&quot;, a game popularized in British television in which competitors used a list of source numbers to build an arithmetic expression as close to the target number as possible.

In 2009, Alperin and Lang extended the theoretical origami to rational equations of arbitrary degree, with the concept of manifold creases. This work was a formal extension of Lang&#x27;s unpublished 2004 demonstration of angle quintisection.

==Pure origami==

===Flat folding===

The construction of origami models is sometimes shown as crease patterns. The major question about such crease patterns is whether a given crease pattern can be folded to a flat model, and if so, how to fold them; this is an NP-complete problem. Related problems when the creases are orthogonal are called map folding problems. There are three mathematical rules for producing flat-foldable origami crease patterns:

# Maekawa&#x27;s theorem: at any vertex the number of valley and mountain folds always differ by two.
#: It follows from this that every vertex has an even number of creases, and therefore also the regions between the creases can be colored with two colors.
# Kawasaki&#x27;s theorem or Kawasaki-Justin theorem: at any vertex, the sum of all the odd angles (see image) adds up to 180 degrees, as do the even.
# A sheet can never penetrate a fold.

Paper exhibits zero Gaussian curvature at all points on its surface, and only folds naturally along lines of zero curvature. Curved surfaces that can&#x27;t be flattened can be produced using a non-folded crease in the paper, as is easily done with wet paper or a fingernail.

Assigning a crease pattern mountain and valley folds in order to produce a flat model has been proven by Marshall Bern and Barry Hayes to be NP-complete. Further references and technical results are discussed in Part II of &quot;Geometric Folding Algorithms&quot;.

===Huzita–Justin axioms===
Some classical construction problems of geometry — namely trisecting an arbitrary angle or doubling the cube — are proven to be unsolvable using compass and straightedge, but can be solved using only a few paper folds. Paper fold strips can be constructed to solve equations up to degree 4. The Huzita–Justin axioms or Huzita–Hatori axioms are an important contribution to this field of study. These describe what can be constructed using a sequence of creases with at most two point or line alignments at once. Complete methods for solving all equations up to degree 4 by applying methods satisfying these axioms are discussed in detail in &quot;Geometric Origami&quot;.

==Constructions==

As a result of origami study through the application of geometric principles, methods such as Haga&#x27;s theorem have allowed paperfolders to accurately fold the side of a square into thirds, fifths, sevenths, and ninths. Other theorems and methods have allowed paperfolders to get other shapes from a square, such as equilateral triangles, pentagons, hexagons, and special rectangles such as the golden rectangle and the silver rectangle. Methods for folding most regular polygons up to and including the regular 19-gon have been developed. A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon can be constructed by paper folding if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a product of distinct Pierpont primes, powers of two, and powers of three.

===Haga&#x27;s theorems===

The side of a square can be divided at an arbitrary rational fraction in a variety of ways. Haga&#x27;s theorems say that a particular set of constructions can be used for such divisions. Surprisingly few folds are necessary to generate large odd fractions. For instance can be generated with three folds; first halve a side, then use Haga&#x27;s theorem twice to produce first and then .

The accompanying diagram shows Haga&#x27;s first theorem:

:formula_3

The function changing the length &quot;AP&quot; to &quot;QC&quot; is self inverse. Let &quot;x&quot; be &quot;AP&quot; then a number of other lengths are also rational functions of &quot;x&quot;. For example:

===A generalization of Haga&#x27;s theorems===
Haga&#x27;s theorems are generalized as follows: 
:formula_4
Therefore, BQ:CQ=k:1 implies AP:BP=k:2 for a positive real number k.

===Doubling the cube===

The classical problem of doubling the cube can be solved using origami. This construction is due to Peter Messer: A square of paper is first creased into three equal strips as shown in the diagram. Then the bottom edge is positioned so the corner point P is on the top edge and the crease mark on the edge meets the other crease mark Q. The length PB will then be the cube root of 2 times the length of AP.

The edge with the crease mark is considered a marked straightedge, something which is not allowed in compass and straightedge constructions. Using a marked straightedge in this way is called a neusis construction in geometry.
===Trisecting an angle===

Angle trisection is another of the classical problems that cannot be solved using a compass and unmarked ruler but can be solved using origami. This construction, which was reported in 1980, is due to Hisashi Abe. The angle CAB is trisected by making two folds: PP&#x27;, parallel to the base, and QQ&#x27;, halfway in between. Then point P is folded over to lie on line AC and at the same time point A is made to lie on line QQ&#x27; at A&#x27;. The angle A&#x27;AB is one third of the original angle CAB. This is because PAQ, A&#x27;AQ and A&#x27;AR are three congruent triangles. Aligning the two points on the two lines is another neusis construction as in the solution to doubling the cube.
==Related problems==

The problem of rigid origami, treating the folds as hinges joining two flat, rigid surfaces, such as sheet metal, has great practical importance. For example, the Miura map fold is a rigid fold that has been used to deploy large solar panel arrays for space satellites.

The napkin folding problem is the problem of whether a square or rectangle of paper can be folded so the perimeter of the flat figure is greater than that of the original square.

The placement of a point on a curved fold in the pattern may require the solution of elliptic integrals. Curved origami allows the paper to form developable surfaces that are not flat. Wet-folding origami is a technique evolved by Yoshizawa that allows curved folds to create an even greater range of shapes of higher order complexity.
The maximum number of times an incompressible material can be folded has been derived. With each fold a certain amount of paper is lost to potential folding. The loss function for folding paper in half in a single direction was given to be formula_5, where &quot;L&quot; is the minimum length of the paper (or other material), &quot;t&quot; is the material&#x27;s thickness, and &quot;n&quot; is the number of folds possible. The distances &quot;L&quot; and &quot;t&quot; must be expressed in the same units, such as inches. This result was derived by Britney Gallivan, a high schooler from California, in December 2001. In January 2002, she folded a piece of toilet paper twelve times in the same direction, debunking a long-standing myth that paper cannot be folded in half more than eight times.

The fold-and-cut problem asks what shapes can be obtained by folding a piece of paper flat, and making a single straight complete cut. The solution, known as the fold-and-cut theorem, states that any shape with straight sides can be obtained.

A practical problem is how to fold a map so that it may be manipulated with minimal effort or movements. The Miura fold is a solution to the problem, and several others have been proposed.

== Computational origami ==
Computational origami is a branch of computer science that is concerned with studying algorithms for solving paper-folding problems. In the early 1990s, origamists participated in a series of origami contests called the Bug Wars in which artists attempted to out-compete their peers by adding complexity to their origami bugs. Most competitors in the contest belonged to the Origami Detectives, a group of acclaimed Japanese artists. Robert Lang, a research-scientist from Stanford University and the California Institute of Technology, also participated in the contest. The contest helped initialize a collective interest in developing universal models and tools to aid in origami design and foldability.

=== Research ===
Paper-folding problems are classified as either origami design or origami foldability problems. There are predominantly three current categories of computational origami research: universality results, efficient decision algorithms, and computational intractability results. A universality result defines the bounds of possibility given a particular model of folding. For example, a large enough piece of paper can be folded into any tree-shaped origami base, polygonal silhouette, and polyhedral surface. When universality results are not attainable, efficient decision algorithms can be used to test whether an object is foldable in polynomial time. Certain paper-folding problems do not have efficient algorithms. Computational intractability results show that there are no such polynomial-time algorithms that currently exist to solve certain folding problems. For example, it is NP-hard to evaluate whether a given crease pattern folds into any flat origami.

In 2017, Erik Demaine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tomohiro Tachi of the University of Tokyo published a new universal algorithm that generates practical paper-folding patterns to produce any 3-D structure. The new algorithm built upon work that they presented in their paper in 1999 that first introduced a universal algorithm for folding origami shapes that guarantees a minimum number of seams. The algorithm will be included in Origamizer, a free software for generating origami crease patterns that was first released by Tachi in 2008.

=== Software &amp; tools ===

There are several software design tools that are used for origami design. Users specify the desired shape or functionality and the software tool constructs the fold pattern and/or 2D or 3D model of the result. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgia Tech, University of California Irvine, University of Tsukuba, and University of Tokyo have developed and posted publicly available tools in computational origami. TreeMaker, ReferenceFinder, OrigamiDraw, and Origamizer are among the tools that have been used in origami design.

There are other software solutions associated with building computational origami models using non-paper materials such as Cadnano in DNA origami.

=== Applications ===
Computational origami has contributed to applications in robotics, engineering, biotechnology &amp; medicine, industrial design. Applications for origami have also been developed in the study of programming languages and programming paradigms, particular in the setting of functional programming.

Robert Lang participated in a project with researchers at EASi Engineering in Germany to develop automotive airbag folding designs. In the mid-2000s, Lang worked with researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to develop a solution for the James Webb Space Telescope, particularly its large mirrors, to fit into a rocket using principles and algorithms from computational origami.

In 2014, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering published a method for building self-folding machines and credited advances in computational origami for the project&#x27;s success. Their origami-inspired robot was reported to fold itself in 4 minutes and walk away without human intervention, which demonstrated the potential for autonomous self-controlled assembly in robotics.

Other applications include DNA origami and RNA origami, folding of manufacturing instruments, and surgery by tiny origami robots.

Applications of computational origami have been featured by various production companies and commercials. Lang famously worked with Toyota Avalon to feature an animated origami sequence, Mitsubishi Endeavor to create a world entirely out of origami figures, and McDonald&#x27;s to form numerous origami figures from cheeseburger wrappers.

<text>Hyde Park, Sydney, is an urban park, of , located in the central business district of Sydney, in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It is the oldest public parkland in Australia. Hyde Park is on the eastern fringe of the Sydney city centre and is approximately rectangular in shape, being squared at the southern end and rounded at the northern end. It is bordered on the west by Elizabeth Street, on the east by College Street, on the north by St James Road and Prince Albert Road and on the south by Liverpool Street.

The park was designed by Norman Weekes, Sir John Sulman (1927 design resolution), Alfred Hook, W. G. Layton and I. Berzins and was built from 1810 to 1927. Historically, it has also been known as Sydney Common, Government Domain, The Common, The Exercising Ground, Cricket Ground and Racecourse. Hyde Park is owned by the City of Sydney and the Land and Property Management Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 December 2011.

It is the southernmost of a chain of parkland that extends north to the shore of Sydney Harbour via The Domain and Royal Botanic Garden. Around the park&#x27;s boundaries lie various buildings housing the Supreme Court of New South Wales, St James Church, Hyde Park Barracks and Sydney Hospital to the north, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, the Australian Museum and Sydney Grammar School to the east, the Downing Centre to the south, the David Jones flagship store and the CBD to the west. It is divided in two by the east–west running Park Street.

Hyde Park contains well-kept gardens and approximately 580 trees: a mixture of figs, conifers, palms, and other varieties. It is famed for its magnificent fig tree lined avenues. Sandringham Gardens sit on the eastern side of the park, close to the intersection of Park Street and College Street.

== History ==
At the time of European settlement in 1788, the local Aboriginal people hunted ducks in the swampy marshes that were to become Hyde Park.

Hyde Park is also understood to be the site of an important Aboriginal contest ground which is a part of the greater Aboriginal history of Sydney. Until the mid-1820s, Aboriginal people travelled from all over Sydney and as far away as the Hunter and the Illawarra, to gather at a ceremonial contest ground to the south of the city. The exact location of this site of ritualized conflict settlement and resistance is unclear. Described as lying between the road to Botany Bay and the Brickfields, it was probably near Hyde Park South. Bloody fist fights involving up to 100 people, spearings and beatings were used to resolve conflicts at the Brickfields contest ground. These were observed and recorded by visiting Russian sailors in 1814, and again 10 years later by the French explorers Dumont d&#x27;Urville and René Lesson on their voyage of &quot;Coquille&quot;.

The valley of the Tank Stream was cradled between two slightly elevated sandstone and shale ridges which ran down to the harbour to form Dawes Point and Bennelong Point on each side of Sydney Cove. The Tank Stream itself was only a tiny rivulet which rose in marshy ground skirting the western slopes of the ground which later became Hyde Park. The seepage from the bed-joints of the underlying sandstone around the upper portion of its catchment, which headed about the centre of the park, filtered through the soil to form a definite channel near King and Pitt Streets. The area now occupied by Hyde Park was relatively flat, rising slightly along the centre and elevated.

We know it was timbered, as was the rest of the topography, from the early drawings of the settlement, and Director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney J. H. Maiden has suggested that the dominant species were probably white or brittle gum (&quot;Eucalyptus micrantha&quot;), blackbutt (&quot;E.pilularis&quot;), bloodwood (&quot;Corymbia gummifera&quot;), Port Jackson figs (&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot;), Bangalow palms (&quot;Archontophoenix cunninghamiana&quot;), cabbage tree palms (&quot;Livistona australis&quot;) and smooth-barked white apple (&quot;Angophora costata&quot;), with an understorey of tea tree (Leptospermum sp.), wattle (&quot;Acacia sp.&quot;) and NSW Christmas bush (&quot;Ceratopetalum gummiferum&quot;).

From 1788 this was a place where soldiers could be quickly assembled in case of a convict rebellion. It was probably the site of a bloody battle between Aboriginal people and Europeans for control of land around Sydney. It was also the site of an important Aboriginal contest ground.

Before Governor Phillip departed from the settlement in December 1792, he had drawn a line from the head of Woolloomooloo Bay to the head of Cockle Bay (now Darling Harbour) and noted in writing on the map that no land within the line was to be leased or granted and should remain the property of the Crown. In subsequent years this directive was whittled away. King granted leases in the town, Foveaux had begun to issue grants, Macquarie was to extend the grants.

The area of Hyde Park however, fell largely within this line, and became regarded as a sort of &quot;Common&quot; on the edge of the town. It had quite a different status to the Governor&#x27;s Domain, which became the Botanic Gardens. It was land that belonged to the people, rather than to the Governor or his officials. The settlers grazed their animals on it and used its brush and trees as firewood. It was gradually denuded of vegetation. By 1810 it would have been a relatively open, elevated space and by then it would have had views out to the north east across Woolloomooloo to the harbour. Early on there were shingling parties and saw pits operating in the vicinity. It was known as &quot;the Common&quot; even before Governor Macquarie defined its size and use by his proclamation of 5 October 1810. His 83rd regiment had established a camp there while waiting for more permanent accommodation, on the southern end near the brickfields.

Later it became the colony&#x27;s first sports centre and racecourse. Prize fights and cricket matches were held here. In 1803 cricket was introduced on The Common by British officers. This game became an obsession and the area served the game from 1827 to 1856.

===Developments from 1810 to 1830===
Before 1810 the area was known as &quot;The Common,&quot; the &quot;Exercising Ground&quot;, &quot;Cricket Ground&quot; or &quot;Racecourse&quot;. Macquarie, on 11 February 1810, formally reserved it as open space, the first public park set aside in Australia. He formally defined the park as bounded in the north by the NSW Government Domain, on the west by the town of Sydney, on the east by the grant to John Palmer at Woolloomooloo and on the south by the brickfields.

Macquarie named it &quot;Hyde Park&quot; after the great Hyde Park in London, north-west of Westminster, near Buckingham Palace (which had once belonged to the Manor of Hyde and which was seized from the Abbey of Westminster by Henry VIII for a forest hunting reserve in 1536). Macquarie&#x27;s naming and formal definition of the park was part of his town planning policy. He named the streets and regularised their courses, erected a wharf in Cockle Bay, relocated the Market Place and planned other improvements in the town, as well as defining Sydney&#x27;s first major park and formalising its use &quot;for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants&quot;. He also added another use for the park, &quot;as a field of exercise for the troops&quot;. His proclamation acknowledged the previous uses of the area.

Ten days after Macquarie named it Hyde Park it was the venue for Australia&#x27;s first organised horse race and it was used for races through the 1820s. At that time it was much larger, marking the outskirts of Sydney&#x27;s southern settlement. The park was used as Sydney&#x27;s racecourse from 1820 to 1821.&lt; Whittaker adds that as well as being a popular cricket venue in the 1820s it was also popular for informal children&#x27;s games.

It was delineated only as a space at the end of Macquarie Street, where the military held parades, and townspeople cut firewood and carted off soil. It became a favourite place for cricket, a playground for local school boys, a racecourse and – with its slightly elevated position – a promenade cites Hyde Park as being Sydney&#x27;s cricket ground from 1827 to 1856.

In 1811 Macquarie framed further regulations to secure the space for public recreation. He closed access across the park to the Brickfields beyond, forbade carts to cross it, or cows, sheep, goats and pigs&#x27; to graze upon it, and ordered that no cattle headed for markets near Darling Harbour were to be driven across it. He caused a fence to be made between the park and the brickfields and directed that carts carrying bricks or pottery should go through the turn-pike gate in George Street. He directed that all traffic crossing the park was to use the new line of road along the route of Liverpool Street to South Head Road (or Oxford Street). This roadway then defined the southern boundary of Hyde Park.

The northern boundary was at first defined by the edge of the Governor&#x27;s Demesne (Domain), which the Macquaries came to regard as their personal pleasure grounds. Macquarie himself directed the building of Hyde Park Barracks (1817–19), St James&#x27; Church (1820) and the Law Courts (1819–28) at the northern end of Hyde Park, using Francis Greenway as his architect, with these buildings as fine embellishments to the colonial town, facing each other across a plaza which terminated Macquarie Street. Macquarie blocked the street named after himself at what was later known as Queens&#x27;s Square and excluded all roadways from the park.

The western boundary was defined as Camden Street, later Elizabeth Street, renamed by Macquarie for his wife, Elizabeth Campbell). It was marked out in Meehan&#x27;s plan of 1807 almost as far as present day Park Street. This was first a street of scattered small wattle and daub thatched houses, brush and grass trees. These were gradually replaced by more substantial houses in the next four decades. It became a fashionable residential street, with elegant terrace houses overlooking the maturing Hyde Park.
The eastern boundary was not sharply defined when the Macquaries departed Sydney in 1821. A map of that year shows a vegetable garden of 11 acres allocated to the Barracks and a site marked out for the Roman Catholic Chapel... &quot;near the rubbish dump&quot;. The foundation stone for what would become St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was laid in 1821 on a site adjoining Hyde Park&#x27;s north-eastern side, the first site granted to the Roman Catholic Church in Australia.

Macquarie made no move to have the space planted. He probably had enough difficulty getting the Government Domain in order. However the formal nature of the Queens Square end of Hyde Park made it an appropriate place for Governor Brisbane&#x27;s Commission to be read to the assembled populace on 1 December 1821.&lt;

Francis Greenway, architect to Governor Macquarie, wrote in a letter to &quot;The Australian&quot; in April 1825 that Hyde Park was to be &quot;given to the inhabitants of Sydney for ever, and to be laid down in the most elegant style of landscape gardening&quot;. It would be planted out &quot;in the modern way of landscape gardening, as many of the squares are now in London, the garden enclosed with an elegant rail fence&quot;. Lack of cooperation from the Colonial Office in London meant that Greenway&#x27;s elaborate and optimistic plans for beautifying Sydney were put aside for the time being.

Wrestling and boxing in the park continued, with quoits, rugby union, hurling, military drills, a zoo in 1849. In public holidays the park resembled a &quot;side show alley&quot;.

From the first attempts at structuring it the site has lent itself to a formal design. Emphasis on a central avenue was given by the 1832 extension of Macquarie Street south through the park and by its flatness. When this street extension was closed for a second time in 1851, its north–south line became a rudimentary public walk (known as &quot;Lovers&quot; Walk&#x27;); a derivation from the planted walks in English 18th century urban pleasure gardens (such as Vauxhall Gardens).

===Developments from the 1830s to 1900===
In the 1830s Governor Darling proposed to sell off the park for houses, but his successor Governor Bourke rebuffed the claims of those who desired the park for residential allotments and reaffirmed its status as a park. In 1830 Park Street was extended through the park.

In 1832 William and Macquarie Street (southern extension) were constructed severing Hyde Park and establishing its central axis. Also in 1832 College Street was built which divided off part of the park, in the area which became Cook and Phillip Parks. Also in 1832 Sydney College was built (later Sydney Grammar School). With the nearby Lyons Terrace (1851) and the Australian Museum (1849–51) the southern end of Hyde Park attracted significant and imposing buildings which increased its importance as a planned open space envisaged by Francis Greenway.

In 1837 the first major planting in the park was undertaken by Superintendent of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, Alan Cunningham. Also in 1837 Sydney&#x27;s second main water supply (after the first one – the Tank Stream – had become polluted) was Busby&#x27;s Bore in Lachlan Swamps (later part of Centennial Park). An outlet for water brought to the city from the bore through a tunnel was an elevated pipe in Hyde Park where water carts queued and filled their barrels to sell in the town at 3 pennies per bucket.

In 1846 work commenced on the Australian Museum on the south-east corner of William and Park Streets, probably to the design of architect Mortimer Lewis. This was probably Australia&#x27;s first prominent museum building, and faced the park.

In the 1850s Hyde Park was a barren expanse of grass criss-crossed with paths and dirt tracks around its perimeter. This is clear in a c.1854 photograph taken from the Mint by mint-worker and amateur photographer William Stanley Jevons in the very early days of photography.

In 1854 the Public Parks Act was passed and a Hyde Park Improvement Committee was formed. Trustees were appointed to determine policy and after 1854 the space gradually became tailored towards a more bourgeois, middle-class ideal of a passive, decorative open space for strolling. It attracted public speakers for a time, until they, like the cricketers, were banished to the Domain to the park&#x27;s north. Gradually Hyde Park became more a place for passive recreation and more like an &quot;English&quot; garden.

There was increasing public pressure to &quot;improve&quot; the park and plant it. By this time the influence of Scottish/English writer John Claudius Loudon and architect/gardener (later Sir) Joseph Paxton had reached the antipodes – the garden invaded the pleasure ground to form a &quot;gardenesque&quot; (Loudon&#x27;s term) composition with each of Hyde Park&#x27;s four quarters divided by a central walk and the whole park by Park Street. Incidents or features such as statues, fountains, ponds and a bandstand were introduced. This broadly reflected the rise of the Public Parks Movement in England, and elsewhere in Sydney – with Parramatta Park being declared a public park in the mid-1850s after much lobbying.

In the 1850s civic monuments began to be erected in the park. The first in 1857 was the Thornton Obelisk. It is also irreverently known as &#x27;Thornton&#x27;s Scent Bottle&#x27; constructed on the park&#x27;s western side entrance facing Bathurst Street (intersection with Elizabeth St.). This is actually a sewerage ventilator, made to appear like Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle, an Egyptian Obelisk now displayed in London.

In the 1850s with the coming of responsible government, Hyde Park became a venue for Sunday oratory on political and civic topics, and later election meetings. It was also used for processions and official gatherings such as the ball to welcome Queen Victoria&#x27;s son Prince Alfred in 1868. Its 19th-century layout featured straight paths rather than curved ones, with the central avenue of Moreton Bay fig trees continuing the line of Macquarie Street southward. Elsewhere lawns were interspersed with clumps of trees and shrubs, water features and a bandstand.

In 1861 planting was undertaken, predominantly along pathways. Moreton Bay (Ficus macrophylla) and Port Jackson (F.rubiginosa) figs were planted in Hyde Park in 1862(1860 say Mackaness &amp; Butler-Bowden, 2007, 72) on the advice of Director of the Botanic Gardens, Charles Moore. Despite removal of an earlier central avenue of Moreton Bay figs, other specimens of both of these species survive from this era.

In 1866 the parkland was enclosed with a two-railed hardwood fence. A bronze statue of Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband, Prince Albert, was erected in 1866 five years after his death. This was moved to the Botanic Gardens in 1922 and relocated in front of Hyde Park Barracks in 1987.

After the 1851 Great Exhibition in Joseph Paxton&#x27;s Crystal Palace, held in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, and the first Australian Colonial Exhibition in Melbourne in 1854, Sydney also held a more modest exhibition in the Museum to display exhibits destined for Paris (the 1855 International Exhibition) or Melbourne (1861). Victoria also hosted Australia&#x27;s earliest intercolonial exhibition, in Melbourne (1866–7), again preceding a major international exhibition in Paris (1867). Even if a railway station was not erected on Hyde Park (as had been suggested) or even used at all for an exhibition, the proximity of the railway station and exhibition hall was seen as a necessity for practical and symbolic reasons. Ease of transport was vital for a successful show but so was the powerful symbolism of the &quot;iron horse&quot;, with its prefabricated iron railway tracks symptomatic of an age that had produced the Crystal Palace. Encouraged by the success of the first Sydney exhibition of the Agricultural Society of NSW in 1869, Prince Alfred Park was chosen as the site of the grand Intercolonial Exhibition of 1870.

To Sydney&#x27;s chagrin, the Melbourne exhibition was a great success and the &quot;mother colony&quot; looked anxiously to the day when she could respond with a confident rejoinder. The centenary of Cook&#x27;s voyage along the east coast of Australia of 1770 was seen as a suitable commemorative event and Hyde Park, Sydney considered an appropriate site. A proposal to erect a new central railway station and use the hall for the exhibition, was considered

A painting by Thomas H. Lewis showed Merry Cricket Club Matches in Hyde Park&#x27;s north – the park was apparently only planted from Park Street south if the painting was accurate.

In 1871 additional planting was undertaken. In 1876 the parkland was redefined and enclosed with a dwarf stone wall and iron palisade fence. In 1878 Hyde Park was formally delineated, its corners demarcated with gates and sandstone piers surmounted by gas lamps.

In 1878 the Great Synagogue was built on Elizabeth Street facing Hyde Park. Beyond (i.e. south of) the Synagogue the character of Elizabeth Street became somewhat less exclusive. By 1900, pubs and the odd private club – including Tattersall&#x27;s bookmakers club – were a feature of the street. In 1879 (on the centenary of Cook&#x27;s death) the Captain Cook statue was erected, on a stone base that had been erected in 1869. It stands on the highest point in the park. Its sculptor was Thomas Woolmer who was prominent in the English pre-Raphaelite movement and who spent several years in Australia. From 1878 to 1896 Sydney Botanic Gardens Director Charles Moore was appointed a trustee of Hyde Park. A Cook&#x27;s pine tree (&quot;Araucaria columnaris&quot;) flanks the statue.

In 1881 the Frazer Memorial Fountain, one of two donated to the city by merchant and MLC John Frazer (the second fountain is in the middle of Prince Albert Road at the intersection with Art Gallery Road and St Mary&#x27;s Road). The fountain was designed by John F. Hennessy as assistant to the City Architect, Charles Sapford) was sited at Hyde Park on the corner of Oxford and College Street. This was one of the first sources of clean water for Sydney and a population meeting point in the park. The original design featured cups dangling from the large water basin for people to take a drink. The taps were bronze and in the shape of a dolphin.

Also in 1888 the Fort Macquarie Cannon (s) was placed in the park.

In 1888 the John Baptist Memorial Fountain was sited at Hyde Park, in a different location to its current one near the corner of Park &amp; Elizabeth Streets. Early photographs (pre c.1910) show it on an &quot;x&quot; intersection of two paths, and surrounded by a metal picket fence. Baptist was an early and influential nursery proprietor in Sydney whose nursery &quot;The Garden&quot; in Surry Hills was successful. He was a generous benefactor, donating a fountain to Redfern Park.

This fountain was commissioned for &quot;The Garden&quot; nursery. It was donated by his family to the City for Hyde Park on the centenary of the European settlement of Australia – at this time Australia&#x27;s premier park had no fountain. While its origin is uncertain – it seems to be a locally made copy (in sandstone) after an 1842 English design – since the 1830s catalogues of the English firm Austin and Seeley had carried descriptions of fountains made of artificial stone and J.C. Loudon had advocated installing jetting fountains. A popular theme was three dolphins or carp on rockwork, their tails holding up the shell-shaped basin... It also appears to be the earliest surviving ornamental (c.f. drinking) fountain in Sydney. Elizabeth Bay House&#x27;s fountain is believed an earlier import. Government House&#x27;s and Vaucluse House&#x27;s – almost identical – were installed in the 1860s. In c. 2007 the City of Sydney removed the sandstone pedestal (with three triton fish forming a tapering spout) for conservation and safekeeping. The base remains in situ. The current management plan proposes its reinstallation and repair.

In 1897 a bronze statue was erected by public subscription to commemorate the populist politician William Bede Dalley (1831–88) near the north-east corner of the park near Prince Albert Road.

===Developments from 1900 to 1930===
Director of the Botanic Gardens, Joseph Henry Maiden compiled a 42-page paper on &quot;The Parks of Sydney&quot; which he delivered to the Royal Society on 4 June 1902. Providing a schedule of Sydney&#x27;s 207 &quot;Public Parks and Recreation Reserves&quot; set aside between January 1855 and April 1902, Maiden dealt with their administration, and how they were (or should be) planted, fenced and provided with paths, roads, seats, lights and other facilities, such as latrines, which were now provided &quot;for women and children&quot; in the Botanic Gardens, but not yet &quot;in our parks, so far as I am aware&quot;. Maiden stressed that above all, &#x27;in this democratic country, parks &quot;should be inviolable&quot;. Their inalienability had to be rigorously guarded. He noted that fortunately &quot;the battle of Hyde Park has been fought and won. Hyde Park will be immune from the builder and the railway constructor for a century, and if for so long, then it is safe for all time. For each generation is wiser than the preceding one...&quot;. He may, in retrospect, have been over-optimistic on these last two points.

After addressing the Royal Society, Maiden was asked by Sydney Council to report on the state of the reserves within the city. He furnished an interim report in July 1903, before he had inspected Prince Alfred and Moore Parks, but many of his suggestions were of a general nature. The council should appoint a superintendent of parks: &quot;trained professional gardeners, not labourers or handy men&quot; should comprise the core of the staff; a nursery and depot were required; etc. With improvements, Elizabeth Street could become &quot;the noblest street in Sydney&quot;...More latrines were generally needed, and if &quot;a convenience for females&quot; were provided in Hyde Park, say near Park Street, it would, I feel sure be a boon&#x27;. His report went to Council in August 1903.

Control of Hyde Park was vested by the Department of Lands in the then Sydney Municipal Council in 1904. A programme of upgrading began. By 1905 illumination of the whole of Hyde Park had been completed.

In 1908 Hyde Park was redefined following the widening of Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets by and . In 1910 a bus shelter was constructed.

In 1910 Sydney&#x27;s first women&#x27;s public lavatory was built in the park near the corner of Park and Elizabeth Streets. It was considered a &quot;failure&quot; by Council due to low usage and was replaced in 1955. In 1912 the park was redefined following the widening of College Street. Mark Foys Emporium (south-west corner of Liverpool &amp; Elizabeth Streets) was built in 1909 opposite the park. This was one of the largest and grandest department stores in the city, growing over time to six stories. When trains (i.e. after 1926) were the most popular method of goring to town the store thrived because of its proximity to the underground railway station.

In 1914 the sundial was repaired (its date of erection is not known).

In 1916 Hyde Park was redefined following the widening of Park Street. In 1917 the Frazer Memorial Fountain was relocated to the north-east corner of the Pool of Remembrance. The Emden gun, a four-inch gun salvaged from the German raider ship sunk off the Cocos Islands by HMAS Sydney in 1914, the first Australian naval ship to ship victory and one of the nation&#x27;s earliest war trophies, was gifted from the Commonwealth Government and sited at Hyde Park on the corner of Oxford and College Streets. In 1919 the bronze statue of scholar, patriot and politician William Bede Dalley was erected by public subscription in the park&#x27;s north-east near Hyde Park Barracks.

An underground railway for the city was planned in 1916 but did not proceed until 1922. The idea of building an underground rail network for Sydney was first mooted by engineer and Harbour Bridge designer Dr John Bradfield in 1913. Government approved it and in 1916 work began on the first leg from Central to Museum and St James. Part of the park was fenced in 1916, however from 1922 onwards major excavation began and much of the western side and part of the centre of Hyde Park North was refashioned after construction commenced. Excavation began with the felling of the main avenue&#x27;s Moreton Bay fig trees.

World War I brought a halt but in 1922 the project resumed in earnest. Most of the construction of Liverpool Street Station (now Museum) station was done by horsepower and hand. According to the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, 21 May 1929 the southern end of the park (Anzac Memorial) was a mountain of excavated soil and the south-west corner had been a railway construction site for more than 12 years! This necessitated massive excavations and vast disturbance over five years (1924–1929) involving a huge army of workmen and the moving of an enormous amount of soil, shale and sandstone. This was one of the major urban projects of the Depression years.

The rail system was officially opened in December 1926. The first electric trains ran between Central, Museum and St James.

Following concern about the park&#x27;s future development during and after the railway construction disruption, Sydney City Council in 1927 held a design competition &quot;for a comprehensive layout and beautification scheme&quot; for a restored and refurbished Hyde Park (along with &#x27;up-to-date lines&#x27;). The competition was run probably to allay fears that the park would be closed to the public for years more, as well as to put pressure on the Railway Commissioners.

It was won by architect, planner, landscape designer and engineer Norman Weekes (1888–1972) with a finely delineated design drawn by young architect Raymond McGrath (1903–77) and influenced by the &quot;City Beautiful&quot; movement. This design evolved with the active criticism of the assessors, architect and town planner John (later Sir) Sulman, architect Alfred Hook (Associate Professor of Construction, Architecture Faculty, Sydney University) and Town Clerk (and closely involved in the park&#x27;s management) W. G. Layton, who wrote a masterly report assessing the design, pointing out its shortcomings and enunciating the design philosophy followed. Landscape historian Georgina Whitehead describes Weekes&#x27; design as an accomplished melange of modern City Beautiful, Beaux Artes and Art Deco inspiration.

Their report stated (inter alia) that a &quot;park laid out on the above lines (a hierarchy of traffic ways, lined with and shaded by trees, expanses of lawn, restrained fountains and monuments) and ...would be dignified, useful, a pleasure to the citizens and an object of admiration to visitors, as they are in the principal cities of Europe. Hyde Park properly treated may thus take its place among those of the leading cities of the world&quot;. Weekes&#x27; design was simplified. Importing fertile soil was the first priority.

Part of the vision was to place major monuments at each end of the main vista aligned with Macquarie Street, which ultimately saw the Anzac Memorial and Archibald Fountain installed.

In the 1920s the Oddfellows Memorial, an elaborate drinking fountain commemorating members of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows who served and died in World War I, was built near the northern corner of Park and Elizabeth Streets.

The year 1927 also saw the opening of David Jones Department store on the corner of Market and Elizabeth Streets, directly opposite the park and St James Station entry.

The year 1929 saw the Wall Street crash, with reverberations around the world&#x27;s financial markets, triggering widespread unemployment.

===Developments since the 1930s===

In 1930 an Anzac Memorial competition to commemorate Australian military personnel who served in World War I was won by architect C. Bruce Dellit. Its construction would take four years.

In 1932 Hyde Park&#x27;s perimeter walls were built to a new design and the British Lawn on the north part of the park&#x27;s eastern boundary facing St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sandringham Gardens and Memorial Gates (on the corner of college and Park Streets (north).

A climax at the park&#x27;s northern end is the Archibald Fountain, a flamboyant 1932 erection set in a large pond depicting a bronze Apollo and other gods and mythological creatures such as Poseidon (God of the sea), Diana (the huntress), Theseus and the Minotaur and Jason and the Golden Fleece. This was bequeathed in 1919 to Sydney by J.F.Archibald, to commemorate the association of Australia and France during World War I and was designed by (and regarded as the master work of) French sculptor François Sicard. Archibald was editor of The Bulletin, a newspaper that encouraged writers in the 1890s onward to write about Australia: he himself was a committed Francophile, supporting a near-French styled beard and changing his name twice: from John Felham to Jules Francois (Archibald). He dreamed of a Sydney developed along Parisian lines, with outdoor cafes and music in the streets. Henry Lawson wanted red flags: Archibald red umbrellas.

There was a move to include native plants and E.H.Ward, curator of Sydney Botanic Gardens, became the chief adviser – he was responsible for the planting of the great, dense avenue of Hill&#x27;s figs (Ficus microcarpa var. &#x27;Hillii&#x27;). This ran along the central walkway aligned with Macquarie Street, and was established as its major axis. Desirable attributes were listed: the need for shade, restriction of plant species, open grassed areas rather than shrubberies. Specimen trees were considered &#x27;out of place&#x27;; flower beds were tolerated in restraint.

The desired quality was &quot;quietude&quot; – the park would be a haven from the bustle and noise of the city. Trams and buses, routed through the park by Weekes, were eliminated.

Civic monuments were thought appropriate and two of the most successful of the period were attracted – the Archibald Fountain at the northern end and the Anzac Memorial (1930–34) at the southern end: an inspired Art Deco monument of blocky, buttressed forms. With fine sculptures under English migrant sculptor Raynor Hoff&#x27;s direction, its symbolism departed from neo-classical forms used in many war memorials and incorporated symbols special to Australia – such as the rising sun and figures of brooding servicemen- which gave the monumental strength to the large granite sculpture. Its modernity and the emphasis (sculpture and friezes) on women, made it controversial. Photographer Harold Cazneaux depicted its new setting, &quot;Pool of Reflection&quot; and lines of then Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra &#x27;Italica&#x27;) in 1934.

A 1930 photograph shows mostly only small trees in the park with the Hills fig avenue newly planted. Bandstands were scattered throughout the city and were popular for lunchtime concerts, particularly in the depression when unemployed people abounded. One was located near the corner of Park and College Streets (north) – which was demolished to create (in 1951) the Sandringham Gardens and memorial gates to Kings George V and VI.

Much of the construction of the park was assisted (through the 1930s) with labour employed as part of the Depression Relief Fund Programme, which was also responsible for the 1934 construction of the Anzac Memorial&#x27;s Pool of Remembrance. Also in 1934 the Frazer Memorial Fountain was relocated to its current location, close to the entry steps facing College and Francis Streets, near Sydney Grammar School. In this same year St James Station and Museum Station were constructed, both with entries/exits in Hyde Park south and north.

In 1934 entry and exits to St James and Museum Stations in Hyde Park South and North were built, as the southern portion of Hyde Park was only handed back to Sydney City Council in 1932.

In the 1960s an outdoor cafe was constructed behind (north-east) of Museum Station entry building, by Sydney City Council. The design of the cafe and landscaping were the work of Ilmars Berzins, SCC landscape architect.

In the 1950s Hyde Park saw the introduction on Park Street (in the north-western corner of the park&#x27;s southern half) of the Long Day Childcare and the Women&#x27;s Rest Centre toilets for women and their children visiting the city. This replaced the earlier Women&#x27;s Public Toilets. In 1954 Queen Elizabeth II dedicated Sandringham Memorial Gardens, designed by Ilmars Berzins, commemorating King George VI (her father, the former King) and Sandringham House, the Royal Family&#x27;s Scottish rural retreat.

In 1983 the Nagoya gardens were constructed in Hyde Park North, commemorating a sister city friendship with Nagoya in Japan. Busby&#x27;s Bore fountain was erected in the same year and slightly to the north-west near the Supreme Court part of the park.

In the late 1980s the city council saw a need to reassess the park and improve the condition of a number of its elements: plantings, walls, paths and monuments. A draft plan of management and master plan were produced in 1989. Through the early 1990s a works programme was implemented to upgrade paths, conserve monuments and stone walls and built new stone walls along College Street in Hyde Park South. The works depot was removed from the eastern side of the main avenue of Hyde Park north in this period.

In 1999 the men&#x27;s toilets at St James Station were converted into a cafe facing the park&#x27;s north-western corner (off Market Street/Elizabeth Street intersection). Nagoya Gardens were upgrade.

In 2004–2005 an arboriculture survey of the park was undertaken, after an outbreak of fungal attack meant the need to remove some of the park&#x27;s central avenue of Hill&#x27;s figs (Ficus microcarpa &#x27;Hillii&#x27;). In 2006 a plan of management and Tree management report were adopted by Council and the Crown.

In 2012 ongoing tree management works were undertaken. On 15 September 2012, a protest by Salafi Muslims against an anti-Islam film &quot;Innocence of Muslims&quot; was held at Hyde Park, among other places in Sydney CBD, where around 300 people had gathered. As the crowd started to leave Hyde Park near St James, Public Order and Riot Squad officers equipped with batons and riot shields had already been stationed at the park exit.

On 31 March 2015 a War Memorial to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander soldiers was unveiled in Hyde Park South, close to Bathurst and Elizabeth Streets. Designed by indigenous artist Tony Albert it features four tall, bullets and three fallen shells, representing diggers who returned and those who did not. The work was inspired by Albert&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s story of survival and experiences escaping a German concentration camp in World War II.

In February 2016 Sydney City Council proposed restoring the Frazer Memorial Fountain (1881) with a new base, plinth and steps and its impressive filigree works restored. Restoration was expected to take place later in 2016.

==Sporting activities==

Many sports were played at Hyde Park, including cricket, rugby, horse racing, quoits and hurling. Sports people using the park grounds had to share it with the military, who trained on it and practised drill work, the general public, who cut paths across the playing fields, stray dogs, cattle, goats, sheep and other animals. Their activities sometimes clashed. The quoit players, in particular, used an area close to the cricket pitch and often damaged it.

===Horse racing===

Seven Arabian horse taken on board the First Fleet at the Cape Colony (now South Africa) were the first horses to be brought to Australia. The first thoroughbred to be brought to Australia was Rockingham in 1799. By 1800 there were 200 horses in the colony which grew to 1100 by 1810. A race ground on the Hawkesbury River near Richmond was probably Australia&#x27;s first racecourse being used as early as 1806. Match races were run there as part of a holiday at Parramatta in April 1810. Only two days after Governor Macquarie dedicated Hyde Park for &#x27;recreation and amusement&#x27; it became the site of Australia&#x27;s first official horse race meeting organised on 15, 17 and 19 October 1810 by the officers of the 73rd Regiment (Macquarie&#x27;s regiment). The meetings to devise the rules and organise the event were held in the officers&#x27; mess and many of the horses were owned by the officers. The race meeting consisted of a series of heats with weights set depending on the sex and age of a horse. There were also a number of match races between two horses and sweepstake prizes offered. Governor Macquarie himself attended each day of the meeting. This format for race meetings was followed in the colony for the next 50 years. Owners mostly rode their own horses and the courses were marked by flags and posts. Novelty events were often included.

Meetings continued to be held at Hyde Park up until the formation of the Sydney Turf Club in 1825 when they were moved to the &#x27;Bellevue&#x27; course. Meetings were also run at Parramatta and Camperdown. The Australian Racing and Jockey Club was formed in 1828 with the encouragement of Governor Darling but the colony could not support two race clubs and both folded in 1831.

===Cricket===
Although some research indicates that cricket was played before 1803 at the southern end of the Common near where the War Memorial is today, the first confirmed match took place on the Common in 1803. The players were the civilians and officers from the supply ship &quot;Calcutta&quot;. The cricket ground was laid out in the north-western section of the park (just behind the current entrance to St James railway station) and all major games were played there until 1856.

The first fully recorded match took place in Hyde Park between the 17th and 39th Regiments on 7 May 1832. However, by the 1850s running problems with other users of the Park, the public, the military and players of other sports, ultimately caused cricket matches to be moved to the Domain where unfortunately, similar problems were also encountered.

===Boxing===
Organised bareknuckle fights were probably common in the early colony and officers of the NSW Corps were known to have arranged fights between convicts. The first recorded fight took place on the road to Botany about half a mile from the Racecourse in 1814. This would put it near the current location of the War Memorial. As if the boxing bout was not enough, the combatants, John Berringer (also known as John Parton) and Charles Sefton, were first required to run a mile. Both Berrenger and Sefton has been sentenced to death in Britain but had their sentences commuted to transportation to NSW. The fight lasted 56 rounds and was won by Berringer.

===Rugby===
On 17 June 1865 the first known rugby match to be played in Australia took place in Hyde Park between members of Australia&#x27;s first rugby club, the Sydney Football Club, which had been established that month. In the July that year, the Sydney Club played the Australian Club in Hyde Park, in the first inter-club game.

In 1856, Hyde Park was turned into public gardens and sporting activity all but ceased. Cricket and football clubs had to find other places to play. Cricket was played at the Domain and both sports were also played at Moore Park and the Garrison Ground (now the Sydney Cricket Ground).

&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Hyde Park, Sydney.map&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
Hyde Park is in the City of Sydney&#x27;s south-centre, lying broadly on the ridge that runs south–north to Bennelong Point and forming the city&#x27;s eastern &quot;edge&quot;. The park is broadly flat, though sloping slightly east and west to the adjacent streets (College &amp; Elizabeth Streets). The park is pock marked with drain lids, many of which lead down to Busby&#x27;s Bore, the first large-scale attempt at a water source system after backing-up the Tank Stream, the Sydney colony&#x27;s primary water source. Busby&#x27;s Bore was built between 1827 and 1837 using convict labour and fresh water from Lachlan Swamp (later known as Centennial Park) to the city.

Hyde Park is broadly rectangular with a rounded northern end. It is bisected east–west by Park Street and ringed by other major city streets (Liverpool and College Streets, Prince Albert Road, St.James&#x27; Road, Elizabeth Street) and stands in strong contrast to the closely built-up and intense environment of the city beside it. Its landscape design offers shady avenues, green sward areas and colourful vistas. Its layout and monuments offer a sense of the city&#x27;s and nation&#x27;s history and its design reflects certain aspirations which have found expressions in its vistas, layout and monuments. The park is centred on its great shaded promenade under magnificent mature Hill&#x27;s figs (Ficus microcarpa var. Hillii). Dense and lacy, these trees have grown tall and now dominate the planting and design, despite some having to be removed due to fungus attack in recent years. A climax at each end of the park is provided by the two major monuments of the Archibald Fountain at the northern and most populous end and by the solid bulk of the Anzac Memorial at the southern end. These two monuments are of essential importance to the park&#x27;s design and character.

The Park is an accomplished melange of modern City Beautiful, Beaux Artes and Art Deco inspiration. A series of cross paths, perpendicular and angled to the central promenade, connect city streets to its north, west and south with key streets leading to the suburbs of Woolloomooloo, East Sydney and Darlinghurst to the east.
The two major east–west perpendicular paths in the park&#x27;s north lead from Market Street to the Archibald Fountain, and from this to St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. Major perpendicular east–west paths in the park&#x27;s south run east from Bathurst Street past the obelisk and crossing the northern end of the paved plaza north of the Anzac Memorial and reflective pool (to Sydney Grammar School); and another bisecting the Anzac Memorial and connecting directly with Francis Street to the park&#x27;s east.

Flights of steps lead down from the central promenade to Park Street which bisects the two halves of the park. Other flights of steps lead diagonally off both north and south-eastern corners off Park Street, the entry opposite Francis Street, as both Park and College Streets are at a lower level than much of the adjacent park (or its ridge). Broadly both halves (running north–south) of the park are grassed areas, with scattered trees mostly framing and following cross paths.
Wide paved areas surround both the Archibald Fountain and the Anzac Memorial. A rectangular Pool of Remembrance is set among a wide paved area north of (and on all sides of) the Anzac Memorial, the pool&#x27;s edges being lined with fastigiate poplar trees (Populus alba &quot;Fastigiata&quot; which replaced earlier Lombardy poplars (P.nigra &#x27;Italica&#x27;).

A series of monuments throughout the park form features of different compartments, as follows: (NB: this may not be complete list):

;North-west (St.James&#x27; Road to Park Street):
*St.James Station entry (northern, to St.James&#x27; Road)

=== Condition ===

As at 9 June 2011, much of the park was dug up in the 1920s to install the City Underground Railway including Museum Station in the park&#x27;s south-western quarter (with two exits to the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth Streets and to near Bathurst Street) and St James Station north of the Archibald Fountain with two exits, one to Market Street, the other under St James&#x27; Road to its northern side outside the park boundary.

As an open space area, Hyde Park has been subject to various attacks by contending uses: residential, active recreation, passive recreation, infrastructure, etc.). Various encroachments have appeared from time to time, buildings for particular purposes, outlets for Sydney water supply, road widening around and through it and, most dramatically, the huge upheaval of the City Underground Railway construction with massive excavation through its length and breadth (1916 fencing, 1922+ excavation).

Even though it evolved during a period when informal landscape planning dominated the English-speaking world, and even though some informal elements have been introduced to its design, it has remained Sydney&#x27;s major formal urban landscape. It is this formal quality which gives it its strength and memorability.

Much of the park reflects its 1926 competition design with some modifications between 1927-c.1930. Recent (1990–2010) changes have been relatively minor – one more noticeable one being removal of 13 Hill&#x27;s fig trees from the northern end (around the Archibold Fountain) due to fungal attack. Another change of note has been removal of the s day care/women&#x27;s rest centre building in the late 1990s and re-grassing of that north-western corner of the southern half of the park. Changes to Gallipoli Gardens plantings around the Anzac Memorial, minor pathway upgrades and recent works to install cycle lane along the park&#x27;s eastern side on College Street have meant minor incursions and changes there.

==Monuments==
The centrepiece of Hyde Park is the Archibald Fountain. The fountain was designed by François-Léon Sicard and bequeathed by J. F. Archibald in 1932 in honour of Australia&#x27;s contribution to World War I in France. The fountain features in the notable Australian B-grade horror film &quot;Howling III: The Marsupials&quot; (1987). Also at the northern end are the Nagoya Gardens featuring a giant outdoor chess set and the entrance to the underground St James railway station.

Adjacent to College Street and the Australian Museum lies the Sandringham Garden. This colonnaded, sunken garden was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as a memorial to Kings George V and George VI.

At the park&#x27;s southern end is the ANZAC War Memorial behind the Pool of Reflection and the entrances to the Museum railway station. A monument consisting of a gun from the German light cruiser stands at Whitlam Square, at the south-eastern, Oxford Street entry of the park. It was built as a memorial to the Australian Imperial Force of World War I. Fund raising for a memorial began on 25 April 1916, the first anniversary of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landing at Anzac Cove for the Battle of Gallipoli. It was opened on 24 November 1934 by His Royal Highness Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.
Close to the ANZAC Memorial in the southern end of the park is &quot;Yininmadyemi – Thou didst let fall,&quot; a public artwork that acknowledges the service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women in the Australian Defence Force. The artwork by Indigenous Australian artist Tony Albert was unveiled on 31 March 2015 and was commissioned by the City of Sydney as part of its Eora Journey public art initiative.

The western, or Elizabeth Street side, at the Bathurst Street entrance of the park sits beside the Obelisk decorated with Egyptian features. It was erected in 1857 and unveiled by the then Mayor, George Thornton. However, the monument is actually a sewer vent, and soon the joke around town was to call it Thornton&#x27;s Scent Bottle. Further south from here is another Middle Eastern inspired monument by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows dedicated to the fallen Sydneysiders of the Great War.

In the northeastern sector, of the southern half of the park, there is a monument to Captain James Cook, erected to commemorate Cook&#x27;s discovery of the east coast of Australia in 1770. The sculptor was Thomas Woolner (17 December 1825 – 7 October 1892) and the statue was cast by Cox &amp; Sons, at its Thames Ditton Foundry, Surrey, England.

==Vegetation==
An expansive avenue of Hill&#x27;s Weeping Figs (Ficus microcarpa), which are the predominant trees in the park planted from the 1930s, run from St James Road to Park Street (Hyde Park North) and continue on to the Pool of Reflection (Hyde Park South). There are a number of Moreton Bay Figs and Port Jackson Figs. Minority tree species found in the park include:
*Araucaria cunninghamii
*Araucaria columnaris
*Agathis robusta
*Pinus roxburghii
*Stenocarpus sinuatus
*Ficus religiosa
*Lophostemon confertus
*Platanus × hispanica
*Afrocarpus falcatus
*Quercus ilex
*Quercus robur
*Washingtonia robusta
*Phoenix canariensis
*Phoenix reclinata
*Phoenix dactylifera
*Phoenix rupicola
*Butia capitata 
*Livistona australis

Between 2004 and 2005 a number of disease-affected trees were discovered and felled. Following investigations a significant proportion of the trees were found to be infected with three different fungi. In 2006, a Tree Management Plan recommended the removal of about 230 diseased trees to be progressively replaced over time, and aimed to keep the majority of the park&#x27;s trees for as long as possible by increasing the ratio of examinations and mending.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 17 August 2011, Hyde Park has State significance as public land (the Australian colony&#x27;s first common) that has influenced the development of Sydney&#x27;s layout from as early as 1789, occupying approximately the same site since that time. Proclaimed by Governor Macquarie, it is Australia&#x27;s oldest designated public parkland (1810), and has been continuously used from 1788 for public open space, recreation, remembrance, celebration and leisure. Hyde Park has contributed to the cultural development of the city as a recreational space encapsulating the principles of a Victorian parkland through the use of a hierarchy of pathways and the strategic siting of monuments, statues and built items. It is of State significance as a demonstration of the international spread of the English public parks movement originating in the mid-19th century. It provides evidence of the influence of transport infrastructure on urbanisation by its upheaval and re-creation after construction of the city underground railway in the 1920s. It was site of some of Australia&#x27;s first sporting events, and remains the prime open space in Sydney for special events, protests and festivals as it has been since 1810. The Park contains a collection of monuments and sculptures which mark key events and personalities in the history of the State including war memorials and significant artistic works.

Hyde Park, Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 December 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Hyde Park has State historical significance as Australia&#x27;s oldest public park. It is a surviving part of the nation&#x27;s first public common on land consciously set aside as public open space in the urban context. It has been continuously used from 1788 for public recreation, remembrance, celebration and leisure. Its historical development provides evidence of the spread of the public parks movement which saw the emergence of deliberately designed public parks in the mid- to late 19th century, while the influence of transport infrastructure on urbanisation is demonstrated in its upheaval and recreation after construction of the city underground railway. The site of some of Australia&#x27;s first sporting events, Hyde Park remains the prime open space in Sydney for special events, protests and festivals as it has been since its gazettal in 1810. It also provides a record of some of Australia&#x27;s earliest involvement in war through monuments such as the Emden Gun.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

Hyde Park is associated with the Aboriginal people of the Sydney Region for its believed use as a contest ground. Hyde Park has State significance for it associations with a number of influential men responsible for the creation, design and development of Hyde Park. Governor Phillip, Governor Macquarie and Colonial Architect Francis Greenway all contributed to activities which contributed to the declaration of the Commonl and its eventual gazettal in 1810, as well as the earliest although unrealised design concepts for the park. Several key personalities in Sydney and NSW landscape design and architecture played key roles in both the design and implementation of the park throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Among these were the early Directors of the Sydney Botanic Gardens Alan Cunningham (1837) and Charles Moore who provided planting advice that would shape the early development of the park. In the twentieth century designer Norman Weekes, the 1926 design competition winner and competition assessors Sir John Sulman (architect), Alfred Hook (architect) and Town Clerk W.G. Layton were instrumental in the implementation of the redesign and beautification of Hyde Park following the massive excavations and disturbance of the park associated with the construction of part of what later became the City Circle Railway line from 1922.

The monuments and sculptures in Hyde Park not only create a visually interesting outdoor gallery, but bring with them important associations with artists and designers. Among them are French sculptor Francois Sicard and Bulletin magazine editor Frank Archibald (1932 installation of Archibald Fountain), architect C. Bruce Dellitt and sculptor Raynor Hoff (Anzac Memorial), and landscape architect Ilmar Berzins (Sandringham Gardens).

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Hyde Park has State significance as Australia&#x27;s premier example of a formal public park in a highly urban situation. It is an early example of a park whose design was based upon a public open space design competition with adjustments made by the judging panel. It contains a number of significant memorials, which make important contributions to the aesthetics of Hyde Park. Of these, the ANZAC Memorial and the Archibald Fountain also have independent heritage values. The memorial and the fountain have significant design influence on the layout and physical character of the Park and the City of Sydney, with the Anzac Memorial positioned on a major axis linked to the Archibald Fountain.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Hyde Park has State social significance as the setting of the Anzac Memorial which has special association with the families of servicemen and women killed in the Anzac Gallipoli campaigns of the First World War. Additional memorials have smaller scale significance of this nature, such as the Emden Gun

Hyde Park has State social significance to the people of Sydney and NSW as a site of ongoing public recreation and major events, parades and celebrations that have continue to be held there since the park&#x27;s inception. This significance is emphasised by the fact that these events take place in the state&#x27;s oldest public park which has been in continuous use since European settlement in 1788.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Hyde Park has State significance as one of only two public open spaces, the other being Macquarie Place, dating to 1810 under Governor Macquarie. It is rare as a formally structured Australian urban park, created in an age when informal park layouts were more common. It contains rare design work in a public space by architect and landscape architect Norman Weekes, while the work of landscape architect Ilmar Berzins is one of only four known surviving works by Berzins in NSW. The other three examples are Arthur MacElhone Reserve, Elizabeth Bay; Fitzroy Gardens, Kings Cross and Duntryleague Golf Course, Orange. Sculptural and monumental work in the park also have State rarity values. The John Baptist Fountain created and erected in Hyde Park in 1888 is the oldest surviving ornamental fountain in Sydney. The Archibald Fountain is possibly the only example of the master work of French sculptor Francois Sicard in Australia.

The Emden Gun has state significance as the first naval trophy of World War One from the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s first ship to ship battle and one of only four salvaged from the SMS Emden. It is also believed to be the first gun to be utilised for memorial purposes in NSW and the first naval war trophy of World War One. The Emden Gun has national significance as one of only a small number of war trophies captured by Australia prior to 1916 and the battles of the Western Front due to both the outcomes of those early battles and the inability of soldiers to take much with them when they withdrew from those campaigns.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Hyde Park is an influential public park and open space, much used, loved and copied in other urban spaces in Australian cities and towns.

<text>The Huzita–Justin axioms or Huzita–Hatori axioms are a set of rules related to the mathematical principles of origami, describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The axioms assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.

The first seven axioms were first discovered by French folder and mathematician Jacques Justin in 1986. Axioms 1 through 6 were rediscovered by Japanese-Italian mathematician Humiaki Huzita and reported at &quot;the First International Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy&quot; in 1991. Axioms 1 though 5 were rediscovered by Auckly and Cleveland in 1995. Axiom 7 was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2001; Robert J. Lang also found axiom 7.

==The seven axioms==
The first 6 axioms are known as Justin&#x27;s axioms or Huzita&#x27;s axioms. Axiom 7 was discovered by Jacques Justin. Koshiro Hatori and Robert J. Lang also found axiom 7. The axioms are as follows:

# Given two distinct points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.
# Given two distinct points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, there is a unique fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;p&quot;2.
# Given two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, there is a fold that places &quot;l&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;2.
# Given a point &quot;p&quot;1 and a line &quot;l&quot;1, there is a unique fold perpendicular to &quot;l&quot;1 that passes through point &quot;p&quot;1.
# Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 and a line &quot;l&quot;1, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;1 and passes through &quot;p&quot;2.
# Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 and two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 onto &quot;l&quot;2.
# Given one point &quot;p&quot; and two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot; onto &quot;l&quot;1 and is perpendicular to &quot;l&quot;2.

Axiom 5 may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, while Axiom 6 may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 solutions. In this way, the resulting geometries of origami are stronger than the geometries of compass and straightedge, where the maximum number of solutions an axiom has is 2. Thus compass and straightedge geometry solves second-degree equations, while origami geometry, or origametry, can solve third-degree equations, and solve problems such as angle trisection and doubling of the cube. The construction of the fold guaranteed by Axiom 6 requires &quot;sliding&quot; the paper, or neusis, which is not allowed in classical compass and straightedge constructions. Use of neusis together with a compass and straightedge does allow trisection of an arbitrary angle.

==Details==

===Axiom 1===
Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

In parametric form, the equation for the line that passes through the two points is :

:formula_1

===Axiom 2===
Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, there is a unique fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;p&quot;2.

This is equivalent to finding the perpendicular bisector of the line segment &quot;p&quot;1&quot;p&quot;2. This can be done in four steps:

* Use Axiom 1 to find the line through &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, given by formula_2
* Find the midpoint of &quot;p&quot;mid of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)
* Find the vector vperp perpendicular to &quot;P&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)
* The parametric equation of the fold is then:
:formula_3

===Axiom 3===
Given two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, there is a fold that places &quot;l&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;2.

This is equivalent to finding a bisector of the angle between &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2. Let &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 be any two points on &quot;l&quot;1, and let &quot;q&quot;1 and &quot;q&quot;2 be any two points on &quot;l&quot;2. Also, let u and v be the unit direction vectors of &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, respectively; that is:

:formula_4
:formula_5

If the two lines are not parallel, their point of intersection is:

:formula_6

where

:formula_7

The direction of one of the bisectors is then:

:formula_8

And the parametric equation of the fold is:

:formula_9

A second bisector also exists, perpendicular to the first and passing through &quot;p&quot;int. Folding along this second bisector will also achieve the desired result of placing &quot;l&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;2. It may not be possible to perform one or the other of these folds, depending on the location of the intersection point.

If the two lines are parallel, they have no point of intersection. The fold must be the line midway between &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2 and parallel to them.

===Axiom 4===
Given a point &quot;p&quot;1 and a line &quot;l&quot;1, there is a unique fold perpendicular to &quot;l&quot;1 that passes through point &quot;p&quot;1.

This is equivalent to finding a perpendicular to &quot;l&quot;1 that passes through &quot;p&quot;1. If we find some vector v that is perpendicular to the line &quot;l&quot;1, then the parametric equation of the fold is:

:formula_10

===Axiom 5===
Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 and a line &quot;l&quot;1, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;1 and passes through &quot;p&quot;2.

This axiom is equivalent to finding the intersection of a line with a circle, so it may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. The line is defined by &quot;l&quot;1, and the circle has its center at &quot;p&quot;2, and a radius equal to the distance from &quot;p&quot;2 to &quot;p&quot;1. If the line does not intersect the circle, there are no solutions. If the line is tangent to the circle, there is one solution, and if the line intersects the circle in two places, there are two solutions.

If we know two points on the line, (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1) and (&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2), then the line can be expressed parametrically as:

:formula_11
:formula_12

Let the circle be defined by its center at &quot;p&quot;2=(&quot;xc&quot;, &quot;yc&quot;), with radius formula_13. Then the circle can be expressed as:

:formula_14

In order to determine the points of intersection of the line with the circle, we substitute the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; components of the equations for the line into the equation for the circle, giving:

:formula_15

Or, simplified:

:formula_16

where:

:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19

Then we simply solve the quadratic equation:

:formula_20

If the discriminant &quot;b&quot;2 − 4&quot;ac&quot; &lt; 0, there are no solutions. The circle does not intersect or touch the line. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then there is a single solution, where the line is tangent to the circle. And if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two solutions, representing the two points of intersection. Let us call the solutions &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2, if they exist. We have 0, 1, or 2 line segments:

:formula_21
:formula_22

A fold &quot;F&quot;1(&quot;s&quot;) perpendicular to &quot;m&quot;1 through its midpoint will place &quot;p&quot;1 on the line at location &quot;d&quot;1. Similarly, a fold &quot;F&quot;2(&quot;s&quot;) perpendicular to &quot;m&quot;2 through its midpoint will place &quot;p&quot;1 on the line at location &quot;d&quot;2. The application of Axiom 2 easily accomplishes this. The parametric equations of the folds are thus:

:formula_23

===Axiom 6===
Given two points &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 and two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot;1 onto &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 onto &quot;l&quot;2.

This axiom is equivalent to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two parabolas, and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two parabolas have foci at &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2, respectively, with directrices defined by &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2, respectively.

This fold is called the Beloch fold after Margharita P. Beloch, who in 1936 showed using it that origami can be used to solve general cubic equations.

===Axiom 7===
Given one point &quot;p&quot; and two lines &quot;l&quot;1 and &quot;l&quot;2 that aren&#x27;t parallel, there is a fold that places &quot;p&quot; onto &quot;l&quot;1 and is perpendicular to &quot;l&quot;2.

This axiom was originally discovered by Jacques Justin in 1989 but was overlooked and was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2002. Robert J. Lang has proven that this list of axioms completes the axioms of origami.

==Constructibility==
Subsets of the axioms can be used to construct different sets of numbers. The first three can be used with three given points not on a line to do what Alperin calls Thalian constructions.

The first four axioms with two given points define a system weaker than compass and straightedge constructions: every shape that can be folded with those axioms can be constructed with compass and straightedge, but some things can be constructed by compass and straightedge that cannot be folded with those axioms. The numbers that can be constructed are called the origami or pythagorean numbers, if the distance between the two given points is 1 then the constructible points are all of the form formula_24 where formula_25 and formula_26 are Pythagorean numbers. The Pythagorean numbers are given by the smallest field containing the rational numbers and formula_27 whenever formula_25 is such a number.

Adding the fifth axiom gives the Euclidean numbers, that is the points constructible by compass and straightedge construction.

Adding the neusis axiom 6, all compass-straightedge constructions, and more, can be made. In particular, the constructible regular polygons with these axioms are those with formula_29 sides, where formula_30 is a product of distinct Pierpont primes. Compass-straightedge constructions allow only those with formula_31 sides, where formula_32 is a product of distinct Fermat primes. (Fermat primes are a subset of Pierpont primes.)

The seventh axiom does not allow construction of further axioms. The seven axioms give all the single-fold constructions that can be done rather than being a minimal set of axioms.

== An eighth axiom ==
The existence of an eighth axiom was claimed by Lucero in 2017, which may be stated as: there is a fold along a given line &quot;l&quot;1. The new axiom was found after enumerating all possible incidences between constructible points and lines on a plane. Although it does not create a new line, it is nevertheless needed in actual paper folding when it is required to fold a layer of paper along a line marked on the layer immediately below.

<text>James Richard Cross (29 September 1921 – 6 January 2021) was an Irish-born British diplomat who served in India, Malaysia and Canada. While posted in Canada, Cross was kidnapped by members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) during the October Crisis of October 1970. He was ultimately released almost two months later, and subsequently returned to the United Kingdom.

== Early life and career ==

Cross was born in Nenagh in County Tipperary, Ireland, on 29 September 1921. His mother died during her labour with him. His older sibling had intellectual disabilities and was consequently institutionalised. Cross was raised on the family farm, which was a hundred acres in size, before moving in with relatives. He was nicknamed &quot;Jasper&quot; by his family and friends. Cross studied economics and political science at Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated with a first class honours degree in 1944. It was there that he also met his wife, Barbara Dagg, who studied modern languages.

During World War II, Cross served with the British Army and fought for the liberation of France. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers Movement Control Section in 1944. After the war, Cross joined the diplomatic service and was assigned first to New Delhi in 1953. His first stint in Canada commenced in 1957, when he served in Halifax and Winnipeg for five years. He was consequently assigned to Kuala Lumpur for four years (in then Malaya and after 1963 Malaysia), before going back to London in 1966 to direct the Board of Trade branch in charge of exhibitions and fairs overseas. He returned to Canada in February 1968 as the senior Trade Commissioner in Montreal.

==Kidnapping==

On 5 October 1970, Cross was abducted at gunpoint from his British diplomatic residence at 1297 Redpath Crescent, in the Golden Square Mile district of Montreal, and held as a hostage for two months as the FLQ made a series of demands to the Quebec government. During captivity, due to stress and a shortage of food, Cross lost 10 kg (22 lb). He was released on 3 December after 60 days in captivity. In exchange for his release, his abductors would get safe passage to Cuba. The talks were held at the Canada Pavilion, located on Notre Dame Island, the site of Expo 67. This site was declared Cuban territory for the period of the talks.

Six members of the FLQ&#x27;s &quot;Liberation Cell&quot; were later convicted of Cross&#x27;s kidnapping when they returned to Canada during the late 1970s. They received custodial sentences ranging from 12 to 24 months.

Cross said of his kidnapping:

On the 40th anniversary of the day that sparked the October Crisis in 2010, Cross agreed to speak to CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Current&quot; about the events surrounding his kidnapping. There is also a transcript of a taped memoir online, uploaded by Churchill College.

== Later life ==

Cross returned to the United Kingdom after his release and continued working for the civil service. However, he was no longer assigned overseas postings. Although he received a number of offers to sell his story, he did not since he was prohibited by the government from doing so. Cross went on to serve as Under-Secretary in various divisions of Britain&#x27;s Department of Trade and Industry and Department of Energy. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in January 1971.

Cross retired to Seaford, East Sussex. He died at his home there on 6 January 2021. He was 99, and suffered from complications of COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in England in the time leading up to his death. Both his wife and their only child (Susan) predeceased him in 2018 and 2015, respectively.

==In fiction==

Cross is depicted as a character in the novel &quot;The Revolution Script&quot; by Brian Moore, together with Pierre Laporte. Their names are changed by Moore out of respect for their families. He is also featured in &quot;My October&quot; by Claire Holden Rothman, and as a character in the 2006 Canadian television series &quot;October 1970&quot;, played by R.H. Thomson.

<text>Aram Ilyich Khachaturian (; ; , ; 1 May 1978) was a Soviet Armenian composer and conductor. He is considered one of the leading Soviet composers.

Khachaturian was born and raised in Tbilisi (now the capital of Georgia). He moved to Moscow in 1921 following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. Without prior music training, he enrolled in the Gnessin Musical Institute, and subsequently studied at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Nikolai Myaskovsky, among others. His first major work, the Piano Concerto (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the Violin Concerto (1940) and the Cello Concerto (1946). His other significant compositions include the &quot;Masquerade Suite&quot; (1941), the Anthem of the Armenian SSR (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, 1947), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music: &quot;Gayane&quot; (1942) and &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1954). His most popular piece, the &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; from &quot;Gayane&quot;, has been used extensively in popular culture and has been performed by a number of musicians worldwide. His style is &quot;characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies&quot;.

During most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the Union of Soviet Composers from the late 1930s, although he joined the Communist Party only in 1943. Along with Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, he was officially denounced as a &quot;formalist&quot; and his music dubbed &quot;anti-people&quot; in 1948 but was restored later that year. After 1950 he taught at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory and turned to conducting. He traveled to Europe, Latin America and the United States with concerts of his own works. In 1957 Khachaturian became the Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, a position he held until his death.

Khachaturian composed the first Armenian ballet music, symphony, concerto, and film score. He is considered the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century. While following the established musical traditions of Russia, he broadly incorporated Armenian and, to lesser extent, Caucasian, Eastern and Central European, and Middle Eastern peoples&#x27; folk music into his works. He is highly regarded in Armenia, where he is considered a &quot;national treasure&quot;.

==Biography==

===Background and early life (1903–1921)===
Aram Khachaturian was born on 6 June (24 May in Old Style) 1903 in the city of Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia) into an Armenian family. Some sources indicate Kojori, a village near Tiflis, as his birthplace. Khachaturian himself said he was born in Kojori. His father, Yeghia (Ilya), was born in the village of Upper Aza near Ordubad in Nakhichevan (present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan) and moved to Tiflis at the age of 13; he owned a bookbinding shop by the age of 25. His mother, Kumash Sarkisovna, was from Lower Aza, also a village near Ordubad. Khachaturian&#x27;s parents were betrothed before knowing each other, when Kumash was 9 and Yeghia was 19. They had five children, one daughter and four sons, of whom Aram was the youngest. From 1906 to 1922 Khachaturian lived at 93 Uznadze Street in Tbilisi. Khachaturian received primary education at the commercial school of Tiflis, a school for merchants. He considered a career either in medicine or engineering.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries and throughout the early Soviet period, Tiflis (known as Tbilisi after 1936) was the largest city and the administrative center of the Caucasus. In Tiflis, which has historically been multicultural, Khachaturian was exposed to various cultures. The city had a large Armenian population and was a major Armenian cultural center until the Russian Revolution and the following years. In a 1952 article &quot;My Idea of the Folk Element in Music&quot;, Khachaturian described the city environment and its influence on his career: 
In 1917, the Bolsheviks rose to power in Russia in the October Revolution. After over two years of fragile independence, Armenia fell to Soviet rule in late 1920. Georgia was also Sovietized by the spring of 1921. Both countries formally became part of the Soviet Union in December 1922.

===Education (1922–1936)===
In 1921, the eighteen-year-old Khachaturian moved to Moscow to join his oldest brother, Suren, who had settled in Moscow earlier and was a stage director at the Moscow Art Theatre by the time of his arrival. He enrolled at the Gnessin Musical Institute in 1922, simultaneously studying biology at Moscow State University. He initially studied the cello under Sergei Bychkov and later under Andrey Borysyak. In 1925, Mikhail Gnessin started a composition class at the institute, which Khachaturian joined. In this period, he wrote his first works: the &quot;Dance Suite&quot; for violin and piano (1926) and the Poem in C Sharp Minor (1927). Beginning with his earliest works, Khachaturian extensively used Armenian folk music in his compositions.

In 1929, Khachaturian entered the Moscow Conservatory to study composition under Nikolai Myaskovsky and orchestration under Sergei Vasilenko. He finished the conservatory in 1934 and went on to complete his graduate work in 1936.

===Early career (1936–1948)===
His Armenian-influenced First Symphony, which Khachaturian composed as a graduation work from the Moscow Conservatory in 1935, &quot;drew the attention of prominent conductors and was soon performed by the best Soviet orchestras&quot; and was admired by Shostakovich. He began an active creative career upon completing his graduate studies at the conservatory in 1936. He wrote his first major work, the Piano Concerto, that year. It proved to be a success, establishing him as a respected composer in the Soviet Union. It was &quot;played and acclaimed far beyond the borders of the Soviet Union&quot;, and &quot;established his name abroad&quot;.

His Piano Concerto, along with the two later concertos—the Violin Concerto (1940), for which he won a Stalin Prize, second class and the Cello Concerto (1946)—are &quot;often considered a kind of a grand cycle&quot;. The Violin Concerto &quot;gained international recognition&quot; and became part of the international repertory. It was first performed by David Oistrakh.

Khachaturian held important posts at the Composers&#x27; Union, becoming deputy chairman of the Moscow branch in 1937. He subsequently served as the Deputy Chairman of the Organizing Committee (Orgkom) of the Union between 1939 and 1948. He joined the Communist Party in 1943. &quot;Throughout the early and mid-1940s, Khachaturian used that position to help shape Soviet music, always stressing but technically masterful composition. In fact, in his memoirs he reported pride about leading an institution that organized creative work in many musical genres and especially in all Soviet republics.&quot;

The years preceding and following World War II were very productive for Khachaturian. In 1939 he made a six-month trip to his native Armenia &quot;to make a thorough study of Armenian musical folklore and to collect folk-song and dance tunes&quot; for his first ballet, &quot;Happiness&quot; which he completed in the same year. &quot;His communion with Armenia&#x27;s national culture and musical practice proved for him as he put it himself, &#x27;a second conservatoire&#x27;. He learned a lot, saw and heard many things anew, and at the same time he had an insight into the tastes and artistic requirements of the Armenian people.&quot; In 1942, at the height of the Second World War, he reworked it into the ballet &quot;Gayane&quot;. It was first performed by the Kirov Ballet (today known as Mariinsky Ballet) in Perm, while Leningrad was under siege. It was a great success that earned Khachaturian his second Stalin Prize, this time first-class. Khachaturian returned the prize money to the state with a request to use it for building a tank for the Red Army.

He composed the Second Symphony (1943) on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the October Revolution and incidental music to &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1944), &quot;a symphonic suite in the tradition of lavish classical Russian music&quot;, on Mikhail Lermontov&#x27;s play of the same title. Both the ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; and the Second Symphony were &quot;successful and were warmly praised by Shostakovich&quot;. In 1944, Khachaturian composed the largely symbolic Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

===Denunciation and restoration (1948)===
In mid-December 1947, the Department for Agitation and Propaganda (better known as Agitprop) submitted to Andrei Zhdanov, the secretary of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee, a document on the &quot;shortcomings&quot; in the development of Soviet music. On 10–13 January 1948, a conference was held at the Kremlin in the presence of seventy musicians, composers, conductors and others who were confronted by Zhdanov:
During the course of the conference, the newly appointed head of the Union of Soviet Composers, Tikhon Khrennikov complained that Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Poem&quot; had its premier in a half empty hall and that &quot;everyone thought that Khachaturian&#x27;s Cello Concerto was rubbish&quot;. In response, Khachaturian who admitted that speaking at such an event made him nervous conceded that composers of more complex work might be guilty of ignoring popular taste, thinking that it would catch up with them in time. Zhdanov interrupted to say that such an attitude was &quot;extreme individualism&quot;. Khachaturian and other leading composers were denounced by the Communist Party as followers of the alleged formalism (i.e. &quot;[a type of] music that was considered too advanced or difficult for the masses to enjoy&quot;) and their music was dubbed &quot;anti-people&quot;. It was the Symphonic Poem (1947), later titled the Third Symphony, that officially earned Khachaturian the wrath of the Party. Ironically, he wrote the work as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. He stated: &quot;I wanted to write the kind of composition in which the public would feel my unwritten program without an announcement. I wanted this work to express the Soviet people&#x27;s joy and pride in their great and mighty country.&quot;

Musicologist Blair Johnston believes that his &quot;music contained few, if any, of the objectionable traits found in the music of some of his more adventuresome colleagues. In retrospect, it was most likely Khachaturian&#x27;s administrative role in the Union [of Soviet Composers], perceived by the government as a bastion of politically incorrect music, and not his music as such, which earned him a place on the black list of 1948.&quot; In March 1948, Khachaturian &quot;made a very full and humble apology for his artistic &#x27;errors&#x27; following the Zhdanov decree; his musical style, however, underwent no changes&quot;. He was sent to Armenia as a &quot;punishment&quot;, and continued to be censured. Edward Rothstein argued that Khachaturian suffered less than Shostakovich and Prokofiev, &quot;perhaps because of his folkloric and simple musical style.&quot;

By December 1948 (Zhdanov had died in August) he was restored to favor, receiving praise for his score for the film &quot;&quot;, a film biography of the Soviet leader.

===Later life (1950–1978)===
In 1950, Khachaturian began conducting and started teaching composition at his alma maters—the Gnessin Institute (since 1950), and later at the Moscow Conservatory (since 1951). During his career as a university professor, Khachaturian emphasized the role of folk music to his students and instilled the idea that composers should master their nations&#x27; folk music heritage.

In 1950, he began working on his third and last ballet, &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1950–54), which later proved to be his last internationally acclaimed work. He revised &quot;Spartacus&quot; in 1968. He was named People&#x27;s Artist of the Soviet Union in 1954. Under Georgy Malenkov&#x27;s brief rule, in 1954, Khachaturian became a mouthpiece, along with Ilya Ehrenburg, to &quot;assure Soviet intellectuals that the ideological controls imposed by the draconic Zhdanov decrees of 1946–48 would be at least temporarily lifted.&quot;

After completing &quot;Spartacus&quot;, since the late 1950s, Khachaturian focused less on composition, and more on conducting, teaching, bureaucracy and travel. He served as the President of the Soviet Association of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with Latin American States from 1958 and was a member of the Soviet Peace Committee (since 1962). &quot;He frequently appeared in world forums in the role of champion of an apologist for the Soviet idea of creative orthodoxy.&quot; Khachaturian toured with concerts of his own works in around 30 countries, including in all the Eastern Bloc states, Italy (1950), Britain (1955, 1977), Latin America (1957) and the United States (1960, 1968). His January 1968 visit to U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. was a significant one. He conducted the National Symphony Orchestra in a program of his own works. In a six-week tour he visited seven American cities.

Khachaturian went on to serve again as Secretary of the Composers Union, starting in 1957 until his death. He was also a deputy in the fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1958–62). In the last two decades of his life, Khachaturian wrote three concert rhapsodies—for violin (1961–62), cello (1963) and piano (1965)—and solo sonatas for unaccompanied cello, violin, and viola (1970s), which are considered to be his second and third instrumental trilogies.

==Music==
Khachaturian&#x27;s works span a broad range of musical types, including ballets, symphonies, concertos, and film scores. Music critic Edward Greenfield expresses the opinion that Khachaturian &quot;notably outshone other Soviet contemporaries in creating a sharply identifiable style, something which his successors have found impossible to emulate&quot;. He composed a great portion of his works in a ten-year span between 1936 and 1946, preceding and following the Second World War. Despite his formal restoration after the 1948 denunciation, Khachaturian only succeeded in composing one internationally acclaimed work in the last 30 years of his life, the ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

According to James Bakst, what made Khachaturian unique among Soviet composers is &quot;the blending of national Armenian vocal and instrumental intonations with contemporary orchestral techniques&quot;. Khachaturian&#x27;s music is characterized by an active rhythmic development, which reaches either a mere repetition of the basic formula (ostinato) or &quot;a game of emphasis within this formula&quot;.

===Works===
====Ballet====
Khachaturian is best known internationally for his ballet music. His second ballet, &quot;Gayane&quot;, was largely reworked from his first ballet, &quot;Happiness&quot;. Anna Kisselgoff called it &quot;one of the staples of the Soviet and Eastern European ballet repertory.&quot; &quot;Spartacus&quot; became his most acclaimed work in the post-Stalin period. These two compositions &quot;remain his most successful compositions&quot;. According to Jonathan McCollum and Andy Nercessian, his music for these two ballets &quot;can safely be included among the best known pieces of classical music throughout the world, a fact that is vitalized by perception that these are perhaps the only works through that the world really knows Armenian music&quot;.

&quot;Spartacus&quot; was popularized when the &quot;Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia&quot; was used as the theme for a popular BBC drama series &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; during the 1970s. The climax of &quot;Spartacus&quot; was also used in films such as &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979) and &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot; (2006). Joel Coen&#x27;s &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994) also prominently featured music from &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Gayane&quot; (the &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; included). &quot;Gayane&quot;″s &quot;Adagio&quot; was used, among other films, in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s futuristic film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

====Orchestral music====
Khachaturian wrote three symphonies: the First in 1934/5, the Second in 1943, and the Third in 1947. He also wrote three concertos: the Piano Concerto (1936), the Violin Concerto (1940), and the Cello Concerto (1946).

====Other compositions====
Khachaturian wrote incidental music for several plays, including &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1934, 1955), &quot;The Widow from Valencia&quot; (1940), &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1941), &quot;King Lear&quot; (1958).

Khachaturian was the first Soviet composer to write music for sound films. He produced around 25 film scores. Among them is &quot;Pepo&quot; (1935), the first Armenian sound film. In 1950 he was awarded the Stalin prize for the score of &quot;The Battle of Stalingrad&quot; (1949).

===Influences===
Musicologist Marina Frolova-Walker describes Khachaturian as the only internationally renowned Soviet composer &quot;who emerged from the nationalist project&quot;. James Bakst interpreted Khachaturian&#x27;s views as follows: &quot;Music is a language created by the people. The people create intonational music forms which reveal at once his national elements of an art work.&quot;

Composer Tigran Mansurian suggested that Khachaturian&#x27;s music incorporates American characteristics and called the United States his &quot;second homeland&quot; in terms of musical influences, especially due to the sense of optimism in his works and lifestyle. Soviet musicologist Boris Yarustovsky argued that the influence from American culture was heard in some of the words of Khachaturian.

====Armenian folk music====

Khachaturian is widely known for his use of folk songs of various ethnic groups in his compositions, most notably those of Armenians. Rosenberg argued that despite not having been born in Armenia, Khachaturian was &quot;essentially an Armenian composer whose music exhibits his Armenian roots&quot;. &quot;[M]any of his compositions evoke an Armenian melodic line. However, his works markedly differed from the conventional orchestrations of folk themes&quot;, writes Rouben Paul Adalian. He suggests that Khachaturian&#x27;s works carry &quot;the vibrant rhythms and stirring pace of Caucasian dance music&quot;, but at the same time are &quot;original compositions that reworked that cultural material through new instrumentation and according to European musical canons, resulting in a sound unique to the composer&quot;. Richard Taruskin argued that &quot;Khachaturian&#x27;s &#x27;Armenian&#x27; style was largely adapted from Gnesin&#x27;s all-purpose Orientalist idiom.&quot;

Khachaturian was particularly influenced by the folk-song collector, musicologist Komitas, and composers Alexander Spendiaryan and Romanos Melikian. Khachaturian acknowledged that Komitas &quot;singlehandedly laid the foundations for Armenia&#x27;s classical tradition&quot;. In a 1969 article about Komitas, Khachaturian called him his &quot;greatest teacher&quot;.

His plans to write an opera &quot;on the destiny of the Armenian people, the tragic fate of Armenians scattered all over the world, their suffering and the struggle&quot; never realized, and his &quot;Armenian Rhapsody for mouth-organ and orchestra, intended for his close friend Larry Adler and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&quot; remained uncompleted. &quot;Yet the intention, the spirit, was always there.&quot; Khachaturian emphasized his Armenian origin, stating:
====Other folk music====
During his university years, Khachaturian transcribed Armenian, Russian, Hungarian, Turkish and other folk songs. In his mature works, Khachaturian used elements from folk songs of Caucasian (including, but not limited to Georgians), Eastern European (Ukrainians, Poles) and Middle Eastern (Turks, Kurds) peoples. His first ballet, &quot;Happiness&quot;, incorporates a Ukrainian gopak, Georgian, Armenian and Russian dances and a Lezginka, an energetic dance of many Caucasian peoples. The &quot;Masquerade Suite&quot; includes a Mazurka, a Polish folk dance music. The ballet &quot;Gayane&quot;, like its predecessor, features a Lezginka. Act II of &quot;Gayane&quot; &quot;is filled with Kurdish dances&quot;.

====Russian classical music====
Khachaturian is cited by musicologists as a follower of Russian classical traditions. According to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he &quot;carried forward into the twentieth century the colorful, folk-inspired style of such nineteenth-century Russian composers as Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky&quot;. Like the members of The Five, especially Alexander Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov, whose works to some extent served him as a model, Khachaturian drew heavily upon &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Oriental&quot; material in creating compositions in various classical genres and styles of European origin. But Khachaturian&#x27;s cultural identity and rigorous musical training within the Soviet establishment allowed him to penetrate more deeply to the essence of Eastern and Caucasian music and to incorporate it more fully in his mature work, including the ballets. &quot;Never dissociating himself from the traditions of Russian music, he came to be regarded in Moscow as a mouthpiece of the entire Soviet Orient, gathering up all the diverse traditions into a grand generalization&quot;, concludes Marina Frolova-Walker.

==Khachaturian&#x27;s influence==
Khachaturian&#x27;s notable students at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory included foreign composers, such as Aziz El-Shawan from Egypt, Modesta Bor from Venezuela, Enrique Ubieta from Cuba, Stefan Remenkov from Bulgaria, and Anatol Vieru from Romania, and a number of Soviet composers: Tolib Shakhidi, Georgs Pelēcis, Mark Minkov, Alexey Rybnikov, Andrei Eshpai, Albert Markov, , Edgar Hovhannisyan, Mikael Tariverdiev, . Critic Levon Hakobian described Khachaturian as a &quot;conservative and self-absorbed teacher&quot;.

He inspired young Armenian composers and had a great influence on the development of Armenian music. Khachaturian&#x27;s influence can be traced on chamber and symphonic music traditions of Armenia, including on the works of Arno Babajanian, Edvard Mirzoyan, and Konstantin Orbelyan, among others. Early compositions of Loris Tjeknavorian evoke the work of Khachaturian.

Khachaturian also influenced composers of Azerbaijan (such as Kara Karayev) and Central Asia. Critic Louis Biancolli noted in 1947 that Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have &quot;borrowed&quot; Khachaturian &quot;on occasion for special research in national music.&quot;

Khachaturian was a close friend of the Bulgarian composer of Pancho Vladigerov and Khachaturian admired his music. Vladigerov&#x27;s third piano concerto (1937), his most popular work, shows the influence of Khachaturian and Rachmaninoff. Eckhardt van den Hoogen called Vladigerov a sort of missing link between George Gershwin and Khachaturian.

===East Asia===
Harold C. Schonberg argued that Soviet-trained Chinese composers, such as Li Delun, were part of a &quot;school of music strongly indebted&quot; to socialist-realist composers like Khachaturian. He suggested that they &quot;came back full of the approved Soviet ideology of Socialist Realism and, much worse, full of the technique of such composers as Khachaturian.&quot; Schonberg wrote that the Chinese ballet &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot; (1964) incorporates elements of Russian academism and Oriental exoticism, resulting in a sound that is reminiscent of socialist-realist ballets like Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Schonberg further suggested that &quot;Yellow River Piano Concerto&quot; (1970), created by Yin Chengzong and others under the guidance of Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing, is a &quot;rehash of Rachmaninoff, Khachaturian, late Romanticism, bastardized Chinese music and Warner Bros climaxes.&quot; Chunya Chang suggested that it &quot;carries many connections&quot; with the works of Khachaturian, including &quot;imitations of national instruments and applications of folk music.&quot; The most popular piano concerto in China, it &quot;helped introduce Western-style orchestral music to millions of Chinese&quot;.

The music of the Japanese composer Roh Ogura had the influence of Khachaturian in &quot;its rhythms and scoring.&quot; So did the works of Yasushi Akutagawa. Donald Richie and Joseph Anderson noted in 1982 that composers of scores of &quot;independently&quot; produced Japanese films are &quot;ordered to turn out music&quot; that &quot;strongly echo&quot; Khachaturian and other Soviet composers.

==Personal life and personality==
Khachaturian was described as a &quot;stocky bushy haired Armenian.&quot; In 1968 &quot;New York Post&quot; music critic Harriett Johnson characterized him as &quot;sturdy, stocky and youthful.&quot; Dmitri Shostakovich described his outlook as &quot;a basically optimistic, life-asserting view of our reality.&quot; In &quot;Testimony&quot;, attributed by Solomon Volkov to Shostakovich, the author wrote: &quot;Meeting Khachaturian means, first of all, eating a good, filling meal, drinking with pleasure, and chatting about this and that. That&#x27;s why, if I have the time, I never turn down a meeting with him.&quot; The German conductor Kurt Masur, who met him several times, said Khachaturian was &quot;sometimes an uncomfortable person.&quot;

===Family===
In 1933 Khachaturian married the composer Nina Makarova, a fellow student from Myaskovsky&#x27;s class at the Moscow Conservatory. Charlotte Curtis described her as &quot;a bulky Russian woman with naturally pink cheeks, black hair&quot; who is &quot;widely known as one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most popular women composers.&quot; Makarova said of their differences: &quot;He is Armenian — temperamental, strong and a bit Oriental. I am Russian and lyric.&quot; They had two children, a daughter, Nune, and a son, Karen. Nune became a pianist, while Karen—an art critic. His nephew, Karen Khachaturian, was also a composer.

===Health and death===
In early October 1965, Khachaturian was briefly admitted into a hospital in Geneva after a heart attack. He died in Moscow on 1 May 1978, after a long illness, just short of his 75th birthday. He was buried at the Komitas Pantheon in Yerevan on 6 May, next to other distinguished Armenians.

===Views===

Khachaturian was an atheist, and always remained enthusiastic about communism. Jeffrey Adams argues that he was a &quot;loyal Communist ideologue&quot; who was &quot;devoted to making art relevant to the common worker.&quot; Khachaturian wrote: &quot;the October Revolution fundamentally changed my whole life and, if I have really grown into a serious artist, then I am indebted only to the people and the Soviet Government.&quot;

Khachaturian denied any censorship of his music in the Soviet Union and when asked about 1948 purges, he said: &quot;Well, they thought my music was too loud, I did write for 15 trumpets and even Stokowski decided against our doing that music when he found out the instrumentation. But I wouldn&#x27;t change it. The composer must stick to his conception.&quot;

In January 1971, Khachaturian, along with Shostakovich, Igor Moiseyev, Maya Plisetskaya called on President Richard Nixon to free Angela Davis. In 1973 he joined eleven Soviet composers in condemning the nuclear physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov after he met with Western correspondents.

==Recognition and reputation==
Khachaturian is generally considered one of the leading composers of the Soviet Union. Alongside Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev, he has been generally cited as one of the three greatest composers of the Soviet era. Ronald Crichton wrote on his death that, in his lifetime, Khachaturian &quot;ranked as the third most celebrated Soviet composer after Shostakovich and Prokofiev.&quot;

According to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, &quot;his works do not enjoy the international reputation that those of&quot; Shostakovich and Prokofiev do. With these two and Dmitry Kabalevsky, Khachaturian &quot;was one of the few Soviet composers to have become known to the wider international public&quot;. According to music historian Harlow Robinson, &quot;his proletariat origins, non-Russian ethnic origins and Soviet training [made him] a powerful symbol within the Soviet musical establishment of the ideal of a multinational Soviet cultural identity, an identity which the composer enthusiastically embraced and exploited both at home and abroad&quot;. Unlike Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Khachaturian was &quot;entirely a creation of the Soviet musical and dance establishment&quot;.

=== Reputation ===
&quot;The Age&quot; wrote that he was the &quot;last survivor among such household names as Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov&quot; and his death marked the &quot;end of an era of the great Soviet composers.&quot; At the same time, his obituary argued that &quot;on the whole Khachaturian was a writer of popular classics rather than intellectual music.&quot; &quot;Gramophone&quot; critic Ivan March noted in 1985 that Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;reputation has sagged&quot;. He approved of the Violin Concerto and &quot;Gayane&quot;, but opined that &quot;much of his music is disappointing.&quot; Richard Taruskin argued in 1996 that Khachaturian has not been &quot;certified as [a] great artist by the promoters of classical music.&quot; Taruskin opined in 2003 that during his lifetime Khachaturian was &quot;more popular than Shostakovich and rivaled only by Prokofiev — but these days it’s different.&quot; He argued that musicians never &quot;thought much of Khachaturian&quot; as he was &quot;always a composer for the crowds.&quot;

Josef Woodard, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, suggests that Khachaturian has long been considered a &quot;lighter-weight participant among 20th-century composers&quot;, while classic music broadcaster Norman Gilliland describes him as a &quot;major&quot; composer of the 20th century. Tim Ashley wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009 that Khachaturian&#x27;s popularity fell in the West, because of his image as one of Soviet music&#x27;s &quot;yes-men&quot;. He argued, &quot;Such a view is simplistic, given that he had a major brush with the authorities in 1948.&quot; In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is &quot;very underperformed&quot; and &quot;somewhat underrated․&quot;

Anne Midgette opined that Khachaturian is &quot;remembered for Technicolor music, film-score-like in scale and sensibility.&quot; David Nice wrote in &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; that Khachaturian did best in dance and incidental music. Bernard Holland described &quot;Spartacus&quot; as &quot;Socialist-Realism schlock&quot;, but argued that &quot;Khachaturian writes inventive schlock—comfortably entertaining yet not without surprises.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg was often critical of Khachaturian. In 1968 he wrote that &quot;Even at his best he was a minor figure, and his music these days has little to offer. Not because it is conventional, but because its materials and ideas are second-rate.&quot; Although describing him as an important and highly popular composer and a &quot;man of pronounced gifts&quot;, Schonberg argued on his death in 1978 that Khachaturian &quot;frankly composed popular music&quot; and that after being exposed to his work it becomes evident that it is mostly &quot;formula writing&quot;. While praising his work as exotic and colorful, he described Khachaturian as a &quot;bureaucratic composer, turning out well-crafted pieces of no particular personality, and certainly nothing that would rock the boat&quot;. In 1968 &quot;New York Post&quot; music critic Harriett Johnson argued that while some may describe Khachaturian&#x27;s style as &quot;pop,&quot; she praised &quot;the individuality of his melodies, infiltrated as they are with Oriental flavor of his Armenian heritage&quot; and &quot;the elemental surge of his rhythm which easily grows wild.&quot; She described him as an &quot;immense musician who believes in the peasant heart and who has said so unabashedly in his music.&quot;

=== Recognition in Armenia ===
One of the &quot;modern icons of Armenian pride&quot;, Khachaturian is considered a national treasure, and is celebrated by the Armenian people &quot;as a famous son who earned world-wide recognition&quot;. Khachaturian was the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century, and the most famous representative of Soviet Armenian culture. He has been described as &quot;by far the most important Armenian composer&quot;, the &quot;Armenian Tchaikovsky&quot;, and deemed a key figure in 20th-century Armenian culture. He remains the only Armenian composer to rise to international significance. Khachaturian is credited for bringing Armenian music worldwide recognition. Şahan Arzruni has described him as &quot;the musical ambassador of Armenian culture&quot;.

==Posthumous honors and tribute==
The philharmonic hall of the Yerevan Opera Theater has been officially called the Aram Khachaturian Grand Concert Hall since 1978. The House-Museum of Aram Khachaturian in Yerevan was inaugurated in 1982.

Two younger Armenian composers dedicated pieces to Khachaturian&#x27;s memory. Arno Babajanyan composed an elegy inspired by Sayat-Nova upon his death, while Edvard Mirzoyan composed &quot;Poem Epitaph In Memory of Aram Khachaturian, for string orchestra&quot; in 1988, on the 10th anniversary of his death.

In 1998, the Central Bank of Armenia issued 50-dram banknotes depicting Khachaturian&#x27;s portrait and the Yerevan Opera Theater on the obverse and an episode from the ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; and Mount Ararat on the reverse. It remained in use until 2004 when it was replaced by a coin. He is one of the two composers depicted on the Armenian currency (the other is Komitas, who is depicted on the 10,000 dram banknote since 2018).

In 2013, the UNESCO inscribed a collection of Khachaturian&#x27;s handwritten notes and film music in the Memory of the World Register.

Music schools are named after Khachaturian in Tbilisi, Moscow (established in 1967, named after him in 1996), Yerevan, Martuni, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Watertown, Massachusetts, U.S. (run by the Hamazkayin). Streets in Yerevan, Tbilisi, and elsewhere are named after Khachaturian.

The Aram Khachaturian International Competition has been held annually in Yerevan since 2003.

===Statues===

On 31 July 1999 a three-and-a-half meter high statue of Khachaturian in 19th-century realist style by Yuri Petrosyan was unveiled before the Khachaturian Hall of the Yerevan Opera Theater in attendance of President Robert Kocharyan, Speaker Karen Demirchyan and leading poet Silva Kaputikyan. On 30 April 2013, a bust of Khachaturian erected by sculptor Gevorg Gevorgyan was opened in the street named after him in Yerevan&#x27;s Arabkir district by Yerevan Mayor Taron Margaryan on his 110th anniversary.

A statue of Khachaturian by Georgiy Frangulyan was unveiled in Moscow on 31 October 2006. Notable attendees included Armenian President Kocharyan, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov and Russia&#x27;s First Lady Lyudmila Putina. Busts of Khachaturian by the Armenian sculptor Mikael Soghoyan were erected at the Moscow Conservatory in 2017 and in front of an arts school named after him in Nizhny Novgorod in August 2021.

===Films===
In 1977, a year before his death, Studio Ekran made a documentary on Khachaturian.
In 1985, the Yerevan Studio produced another TV documentary on him.
In 2003, an 83-minute-long documentary about Khachaturian with unique footage was directed by Peter Rosen and narrated by Eric Bogosian. The film won the Best Documentary at the 2003 Hollywood Film Festival. In 2004, TV Kultura, Russia&#x27;s government-owned art channel, made a documentary on Khachaturian entitled &quot;Century of Aram Khachaturian&quot; (Век Арама Хачатуряна).

<doc id="232850" wikidata="Q4208342" url="?curid=232850" title="Child sex tourism">
<text>Child sex tourism (CST) is tourism for the purpose of engaging in the prostitution of children, which is commercially facilitated child sexual abuse. The definition of &quot;child&quot; in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is &quot;every human being below the age of 18 years&quot;. Child sex tourism results in both mental and physical consequences for the exploited children, which may include sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS), &quot;drug addiction, pregnancy, malnutrition, social ostracism, and death&quot;, according to the State Department of the United States. Child sex tourism, part of the multibillion-dollar global sex tourism industry, is a form of child prostitution within the wider issue of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Child sex tourism victimizes approximately 2 million children around the world. The children who perform as prostitutes in the child sex tourism trade often have been lured or abducted into sexual slavery.

Users of children for commercial and sexual purposes can be categorized by motive. Although pedophiles are popularly associated with child sex tourism, they are not the majority of users. There are two types of offenders: preferential abusers who specifically prefer children, because they seek to build a relationship with a child or because they perceive the risk of sexually transmitted infections to be lower; and situational users, which are abusers who do not actively seek out children but for whom the actual act is opportunistic. For situational users, there may be a lack of concern to check the age of a prostitute before engaging in sexual activity.

Travelling child sex offenders can use the Internet to plan their trips by seeking out and trading information about opportunities for child sex tourism and where the most vulnerable children can be found, generally in areas of low income. Multiple governments have enacted laws to allow prosecution of its citizens for child sexual abuse committed outside of their home country. However, while laws against child sex tourism may deter situational offenders who may act impulsively, pedophiles who travel specifically for the purpose of exploiting children are not easily deterred.

==Background==
Child sex tourism has been closely linked to poverty, armed conflicts, rapid industrialization, and exploding population growth. In Latin America and Southeast Asia, for instance, street children often turn to prostitution as a last resort. Additionally, vulnerable children are easy targets for exploitation by traffickers. South Africa, United States, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Dominican Republic, Kenya and Morocco have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation. Also, child victim ages have been found in Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand to range from 6 to 11 years old, followed by 12 to 15 years old, and 15 to 17.

In 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography reported: &quot;Countries of origin of international child sex tourists vary depending on the regions, but the demand is usually recognized as coming from the industrialized countries, including the richer countries of Europe, North America, the Russian Federation, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Australians, for instance, have been identified as the largest group of sex tourists prosecuted in Thailand (31 percent of the total). Of the 146 cases investigated by Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) in Cambodia between 2003 and April 2012, 32 were American, 24 French and 20 Vietnamese. In the coastal regions of Kenya, for example, 30 percent were residents and 70 percent of the abusers were foreign: Italians (18 percent), Germans (14 percent), Swiss (12 percent), with tourists coming from Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania fifth and sixth on the list. In Costa Rica, according to available information, between the 1999 and 2005, the Child Exploitation Unit had arrested a total of 74 persons on suspicion of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Of those arrested, 56 were Costa Rican nationals and 18 foreign nationals&quot;.

In Thailand, the exact number of child-prostitutes is not known, but Thailand&#x27;s Health System Research Institute reports that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand. In Cambodia, it has been estimated that about a third of all prostitutes are under 18. In India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution. Up until recently, Brazil has been considered to have the worst child sex trafficking record after Thailand. As per Chris Rogers report on BBC World &quot;Now Brazil is overtaking Thailand as the world&#x27;s most popular sex-tourist destination&quot;. DLN reports that &quot;Brazil at the moment is on a high trend of child sex tourism and is all geared to take up the first spot beating out Thailand.&quot;

Sex tourism targeting children creates huge monetary incentives for traffickers. Human trafficking impacts an estimated 1.2 million child victims. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) recently stated that 79% of all global trafficking is for sexual exploitation, which is one of the fastest growing criminal activities in the world.

UNICEF notes that sexual activity is often seen as a private matter, making communities reluctant to act and intervene in cases of sexual exploitation. These attitudes make children far more vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Most exploitation of children takes place as a result of their absorption into the adult sex trade where they are exploited by local people and sex tourists. The Internet provides an efficient global networking tool for individuals to share information on destinations and procurement.

In cases involving children, the U.S. has relatively strict domestic laws that hold accountable any American citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. who travels abroad for the purpose of engaging in illicit conduct with a minor. However, child pornography, sex tourism and human trafficking remain fast-growing industries. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. recently introduced H.R. 1623, the international Megan&#x27;s Law. Similar to the domestic Megan&#x27;s Law (named after Megan Kanka of New Jersey), which provides for community notification when a sex offender is living in the area, H.R. 1623 would alert officials abroad when U.S. sex offenders intend to travel, and likewise encourage other countries to keep sex offender lists and to notify the U.S. when a known sex offender may be coming to the United States for sex tourism. While there are serious problems with the sex offender registries in the United States, human rights organizations such as ECPAT and UNICEF believe this would be a step in the right direction.

==Webcam child sex tourism==
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimate, there are 750,000 predators online at any given time in 40,000 public chat rooms. Offers from 20,000 internet users to pay for webcam sex performances were found in a 10-week investigation conducted from a warehouse in Amsterdam, in the &quot;Terre des hommes&quot; Dutch action against WCST, using &quot;Sweetie&quot;, a 3D computer model. Out of 21,000 perpetrators, 1,000 were identified from Australia, Canada, Jamaica, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Mauritius, the Netherlands, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 110 of the alleged online abusers were based in the UK and another 254 were traced to computers in the US. Together with Avaaz.org, &quot;Terre des Hommes&quot; Netherlands has created an online petition to pressure governments to adopt proactive investigation policies in order to protect children against webcam child sex tourism.

==Global response==
In recent years there has been an increase in the prosecution of child sex tourism offenses. At least 38 countries have extraterritorial laws that allow their citizens to be prosecuted specifically for child sexual abuse crimes committed while abroad, and another 31 nations have more general extraterritorial laws that could be used to prosecute their citizens for crimes committed during child sex tourism trips. As of May 2016, 173 countries have signed and ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Children Pornography which is &quot;Deeply concerned at the widespread and continuing practice of sex tourism, to which children are especially vulnerable&quot;. It also obliges parties to pass laws within their own territories against these practices &quot;punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature&quot;. In response to CST, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the tourism industry, and governments have begun to address the issue. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) established a task force to combat CST. The WTO, ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) and Nordic tour operators created a global Code of Conduct for the Sexual Exploitation of Children in Travel and Tourism in Travel and Tourism in 1996. As of April 2013, over 1200 travel companies from 40 countries had signed the code.

==International law enforcement activities==
The United States&#x27; Homeland Security Investigations participates in investigating and capturing child sex tourists. In 2003 ICE launched &quot;Operation Predator&quot;, leading to the arrest of over 11,000 child sexual abusers, including more than 1,100 outside the United States. While ICE agents refuse to comment on their means and methods of operation, media reports have suggested the use of undercover agents, internet sting operations, and sophisticated technologies. ICE agents in Bangkok did say however that they often receive information from local NGOs about foreigners in Thailand whom they suspect of engaging in child sexual abuse. Sometimes U.S. based law enforcement, such as local sheriffs&#x27; departments and parole officers, inform them of known sex offenders who are traveling to the region. In both cases, local ICE agents work with their Royal Thai Police counterparts to monitor the suspects’ movements while in Thailand. The UK police and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) are actively involved in monitoring child sex tourists and do prosecute.
INTERPOL actively pursues offenders as well.

==Policing of child sex tourism==

===Asia===
* Cambodia: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that the sale of virgin girls continues to be a serious problem in Cambodia, and that a significant number of Asian and other foreign men travel to Cambodia to engage in child sex tourism. Cambodia&#x27;s 1996 Law on Suppression of the Kidnapping, Trafficking, and Exploitation of Human Persons contains legislation against the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and while the law focuses largely on trafficking, it also addresses prostitution. The age of consent in Cambodia is 15, and the law does not specifically define or prohibit the prostitution of children. It is estimated that 1/3 of prostitutes in Cambodia are children.
* China: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that the government of China did not take sufficient measures to reduce demand for forced labor, commercial sex acts, or child sex tourism.
* Indonesia: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that child sex tourism is prevalent in most urban areas and tourist destinations, such as Bali and Riau Island in Indonesia. Recently, islands of Indonesia like Bali and Batam have become known for child sex tourism. These islands have also been destinations for sex trafficking. Under a Criminal Code in Indonesia, any Indonesian citizen can be punished for violating the Child Protection Act or the Criminal Code, whether it is inside Indonesia or outside. The Child Protect Act 28 is a general act to protect the rights of children. A few specific sections provide laws specific to sexual mistreatment of children. One law states that it is illegal to use a child for personal or commercial monetary gain. If one does not follow this law, the punishment can be up to ten years in jail and/ or a monetary fine of 200 million rupiahs which is equivalent to 22,000 US dollars.
* South Korea: South Korean men have been major drivers of child sex tourism in Asia for some time. In 2005, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; reported that an international symposium was held to talk about strategies for curbing the high numbers of Korean child sex tourists to southeast Asia. The symposium, &quot;Conditions and Countermeasures to Overseas Child and Youth Sex Tourism by Korean Men&quot; discussed issues concerning Korean male soliciting of child prostitutes across Asia, but Cambodia and The Philippines were especially worrisome. &quot;[Panelists] said male Korean tourists are believed to abuse the unfortunate situation of poor Cambodian children,&quot; who are coerced into selling sexual favors in order to help their families. As for the Philippines, the report noted, &quot;An increasing number of Koreans bought sex in the Philippines, sometimes abusing prostitutes. The Philippine government has urged the Korean government to take firm action against soliciting prostitutes, in particular buying sex from children.&quot; The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2019 reports that the men of South Korea engage in child sex tourism in Cambodia, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Technology such as the internet has helped increase accessibility of child sex tourism in the Republic of Korea. Some South Korean men arrange for children from the Philippines, Thailand, and China as sources of sex. A Korean Institute of Criminology study published in January 2013 shows that South Korean men are the primary market for child sex tourism in Southeast Asia. &quot;Among foreigners visiting Southeast Asia, South Koreans are the majority group driving demand for child prostitution across the region.&quot; The article goes on to say, &quot;A 2008 report from the U.S. Department of State, &#x27;Trafficking in Persons Report,&#x27; described South Korea as a significant source of demand for child sex tourism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&quot; Yun Hee-jun, head of a Seoul-based group campaigning against sex trafficking, claims, &quot;If you visit any brothel in Vietnam or Cambodia, you can see fliers written in Korean.&quot; Although South Korea has legislation in place to prosecute Korean nationals who are child sex offenders abroad, a 2014 report stated &quot;The government has not prosecuted or convicted any Korean sex tourists during the past seven years&quot;.
* Laos: Lao &quot;Penal Law&quot;, Article 131 states: &quot;Human trafficking means the recruitment, moving, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of any person within or across national borders by means of deception, threats, use of force, debt bondage or any other means [and using such person in] forced labour, prostitution, pornography, or anything that is against the fine traditions of the nation, or removing various body organs [of such person], or for other unlawful purposes. Any of the above-mentioned acts committed against children under 18 years of age shall be considered as human trafficking even though there is no deception, threat, use of force, or debt bondage. Any person engaging in human trafficking shall be punished by five years to fifteen years of imprisonment and shall be fined from 10,000,000 Kip to 100,000,000 Kip&quot;. Lao &quot;Law on Development and Protection of Women&quot;, Article 24 states: &quot;If these acts are committed against children under 18 years old, then even though there is no deception, threat, force, or debt bondage, trafficking shall be regarded to have occurred. Any individual who co-operates with the offender [who commits] an offence mentioned above[,] whether by incitement, providing assets or vehicles to the offender, the provision of shelter, or the concealment or removal of traces of an infraction, shall be considered as an accomplice in trafficking in women and children&quot;. According to a 2008 US state department report: &quot;Police corruption, a weak judicial sector and the population’s general lack of understanding of the court system impeded anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts...Corruption remained a problem with government officials susceptible to involvement or collusion in trafficking in persons.&quot;
* Mongolia: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that South Korean and Japanese tourists engage in child sex tourism in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has implemented laws regarding child prostitution. The Criminal Code bans organized prostitution of anyone under the age of 16, the age of sexual consent in Mongolia. Not only is prostitution of anyone under the age of 16 illegal, sex with a person under the age of 16 is illegal as well. Not complying with this law could lead to three years in jail or eighteen months of community service. Rape is also illegal in Mongolia, with the punishment of two to six years in prison. If there are repeated violations or injury to victims these punishments are intensified.
* Philippines: Child sex tourism is known as a serious problem in the Philippines. The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports of tourists coming from Northeast Asia, Australia, Europe and North America to engage in sex with children. With new technology like the internet, some children form cyber relationships with men from other countries and get money by sending pornographic images over the internet.
* Thailand: Both governmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations have worked together to shut down brothels. They have also tried to increase awareness of child sex tourism and made attempts to stop it. In 2008, records of 27,000 woman and children were reported as seeking medical treatment from injuries relating to sexual abuse. Many children are not registered at birth in Thailand, allowing them more easily to be trafficked to other countries and forced into child labor, including sexual exploitation.

===North America===
* Barbados: There has been no noticeable action taken by the government of Barbados to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, though public commentary on the problem of sex tourism, including child sex tourism, has been increasing.
* Dominican Republic: Some reports say that child sex tourism is a current problem, particularly in coastal resort areas, with child sex tourists arriving year-round from various countries. It is also reported that the current legislation has inconsistencies and gaps which could obstruct the interpretation and application of the legislation. The Code for the Protection of the Rights of Children and Adolescents, Law 136-03 conceptualizes crime of using children and adolescents in paid sexual activity. Only certain modes of production and dissemination of pornographic material are seen as criminal activities, while possession of child pornography is sanctioned.
* Cuba: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that the government of Cuba has made no known efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex. Additionally, it is reported that the government does not acknowledge any child sex tourism problem but has recently banned children under 16 from nightclubs. According to Cuban government documents, training was provided to those in the tourism industry on how to identify and report potential sex tourists.
* El Salvador: One-third of the sexually exploited children between 14 and 17 years of age are boys. The median age for entering into prostitution among all children interviewed was 13 years. They worked an average of five days per week, although nearly 10% reported that they worked seven days a week. Recently, the problem has increased, especially due to migration. Many children are lied to with promises of jobs, and are abducted and sent to countries in North America by foreigners from Mexico or neighboring countries. Most victims are Salvadoran children from rural areas who are forced into commercial sexual exploitation in urban areas.

:The Government of El Salvador does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government sustained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and continued to provide services to children who were trafficked for sexual exploitation. The Salvadoran government sustained anti-trafficking prevention efforts during the reporting period. The government forged or continued partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments on anti-trafficking initiatives. In May 2009, the government collaborated with an NGO to launch a campaign aimed specifically at increasing awareness of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, reaching approximately 4,500 children and adults. The government included anti-trafficking information in the training it gives to military forces prior to their deployment for international peacekeeping missions.
* Jamaica: The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2010 reports that NGOs (Nongovernmental Organizations) and local observers state that there is a child sex tourism problem near Jamaica&#x27;s resort areas.
* Trinidad and Tobago: According to the governments of Trinidad and Tobago, there were no reports nor prosecutions related to child sex tourism.

===South America===
* Argentina: The US Department of State reported that child sex tourism is a problem in Argentina, especially on the border and in Buenos Aires. The Argentinean penal code does not specifically prohibit child sex tourism. and there were not any child sex related prosecutions in 2009–2010. Hoping to reduce child sex tourism, governmental authorities passed a law commanding law enforcement to seek the closure of all brothels NGOs reported. This is not effective because brothels are often tipped off by local police before the raids.
* Brazil: The US Department of State reported that child sex tourism remains a serious problem, particularly in tourist areas in Brazil&#x27;s northeast. Most child sex tourists come from Europe, and some come from the United States. Brazilian authorities are not directly involved with prosecuting sex tourists and instead allow NGOs to prosecute those participating in child sex tourism. A Brazilian law newly introduced in 2000, states, &quot;to submit a child or adolescent, as defined in the caput of article 2 (children: people younger than 12 years; adolescents: people between 12 and 18), prostitution or sexual exploitation is punishable by imprisonment for four to ten years and a fine.&quot;
* Colombia: Article 219 of the Colombian criminal code prohibits, &quot;organizing or facilitating sexual tourism and provides penalties of 3 to 8 years’ imprisonment&quot;, but there were no reported prosecutions or convictions of child sex tourists. In recent years, Colombia has strengthened legislation related to control trafficking of children, particularly to follow the criminal code. However, a law is still pending approval by the Code for Children and Adolescents, which includes the rights and guarantees of children and adolescent victims of commercial sexual exploitation.
* Ecuador: Child sex tourism occurs mostly in urban areas, and in tourist destinations, such as the city of Tena and the Galapagos Islands.
* Peru: Child sex tourism is present in Iquitos, Madre de Dios, and Cuzco. Traffickers reportedly operate illegally in certain regions where governmental authority lacks. Although some areas of the country are known child sex tourism destinations and Peruvian laws prohibit this practice, there were no reported convictions of child sex tourists. The government trained 710 government officials and tourism service providers about child sex tourism, conducted a public awareness campaign on the issue, and reached out to the tourism industry to raise awareness about child sex tourism; to date, 60 businesses have signed code of conduct agreements nationwide.
* Uruguay: Government officials maintained efforts to reach out to hotel workers and to others in the broader tourism sector to raise awareness about child sex tourism and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Uruguay&#x27;s educational system continues to include trafficking education to high schools.

==Extraterritorial jurisdiction==
A growing number of countries have specific extraterritorial legislation that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children. In 2008, ECPAT reported that 44 countries had extraterritorial child sex legislation. The following list includes specific citations:

===Australia===
Australia was one of the first countries to introduce laws that provide for jail terms for its citizens and residents who engage in sexual activity with children in foreign countries. The laws are contained in the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 that came into force on 5 July 1994. The law also makes it an offence to encourage, benefit or profit from any activity that promotes sexual activity with children.

It is a crime for Australian citizens, permanent residents or bodies corporate to engage in, facilitate or benefit from sexual activity with children (under 16 years of age) while overseas. These offences carry penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment for individuals and up to $500,000 in fines for companies 

===Canada===
Canada has included in its Criminal Code provisions that allow for the arrest and prosecution of Canadians in Canada for offences committed in foreign countries related to child sex tourism, such as child prostitution, as well as for child sexual exploitation offences, such as indecent acts, child pornography and incest (Bills C-27 and C-15A that came into force on May 26, 1997, and July 23, 2002, respectively). Convictions carry a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579) of December 2003 introduced offences in regard to child sex tourism, giving extraterritorial effect to 24 sexual offences listed in a new Schedule 2 to the Crime Ordinance (Cap. 200). This makes it illegal for acts committed against a child outside Hong Kong if the defendant or the child has connections with Hong Kong. It is also an offence to make any arrangement relating to the commission of such acts against children and to advertise any such arrangement.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 gives worldwide jurisdiction to prosecutors when pursuing Irish born offenders through the courts on criminal charges in relation to the sexual exploitation of children, with offences such as sexual acts with a child or producing child pornography being treated as if having been committed in Ireland itself no matter what country it actually occurred in.

===Israel===
Israeli Penal Code, Chapter 1, Section 15, states that Israeli penal law shall apply to foreign offenses, whether felony or misdemeanor, which are committed by an Israeli citizen or resident of Israel, without exception, in cases relating to Chapter VIII, Article X (Prostitution and Obscenity) regarding minors.

Section 203B under Article X are penal laws regarding the exploitation of minors for prostitution by way of pimping and trafficking.

Section 203C under the same article is a penal law specific to the client: &quot;A person served by an act of prostitution of a minor, shall be liable to three years imprisonment.&quot;

As of February 2016, section 203C is in the process of amendment to increase imprisonment from three years to five years.

===Japan===
The 1999 &quot;Law for Punishing Acts Related to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and for Protection of Children&quot; stipulates &quot;that a person who is involved in child prostitution, who sells child pornographic products or who transports foreign children to another country for the purpose of forcing them into prostitution shall be punished with imprisonment with labor or a fine. Japanese nationals who commit such crimes abroad shall be punished with the same penalty&quot;.

===New Zealand===
Under &quot;The Crimes Amendment Act 2005&quot; &quot;...it is an offence: For New Zealand citizens and residents to engage in sexual conduct or activities with a child in another country&quot;.

===Russia===
Criminal Code of Russia, Article 12 states &quot;The Operation of Criminal Law in Respect of Persons Who Have Committed Offences Outside the Boundaries of the Russian Federation[:] 1. Citizens of the Russian Federation and stateless persons permanently residing in the Russian Federation who have committed outside the Russian Federation a crime against the interests guarded by the present Code shall be subject to criminal liability in accordance with the present Code, unless a decision of a foreign state&#x27;s court exists concerning this crime in respect of these persons&quot;.

&quot;Federal Act No. 380-FZ of 28 December 2013&quot; amended the Criminal Code by also adding laws regarding the receiving of sexual services from a minor. Under the amended article 240.1 of the Criminal Code, &quot;The receipt of sexual services from a minor aged from 16 to 18 by a person who has reached the age of 18 is punishable by up to 240 hours of compulsory work, or restriction of freedom for up to 2 years, or forced labour for up to 4 years, or deprivation of liberty for the same period. In this article, sexual services are understood to mean sexual intercourse, sodomy, lesbianism or other acts of a sexual nature, a condition of the performance of which is monetary or any other remuneration of a minor or third party or the promise of remuneration of a minor or third party&quot;.

Article 240.3 (amended by &quot;Federal Act No. 14-FZ of February 29, 2012&quot;) states &quot;The deeds provided for by Parts One and Two of this Article which are committed with the involvement in prostitution of persons who are to be under 14 years old – Shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a term of three to 10 years with or without deprivation of the right to hold definite offices or to engage in definite activities for a term of up to fifteen years and with restriction of liberty for a term of from one year to two years or without such&quot;.

===Singapore===
Singapore Penal Code, Section 376C (Commercial sex with minor under 18 outside Singapore) states: &quot;(1) Any person, being a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore, who does, outside Singapore, any act that would, if done in Singapore, constitute an offence under section 376B, shall be guilty of an offence&quot;.

===Switzerland===
Swiss Federal Office of Police state &quot;Swiss federal authorities have stepped up their efforts in fighting child sex tourism in recent years. A special fedpol unit dealing with child pornography and pedocriminality offences co-operates closely with numerous partner services both at home and abroad. Since June 2008, an online form has been available to the general public to report cases of child sex tourism to the appropriate judicial authorities&quot;.

Swiss Criminal Code Article 5 3. (Territorial scope of application / Offences against minors abroad) states: &quot;1 This Code also applies to any person who is in Switzerland, is not being extradited and has committed any of the following offences abroad: abis.3 sexual acts with dependent persons (Art. 188) and sexual acts with minors against payment (Art. 196); b. sexual acts with children (Art. 187) if the victim was less than 14 years of age;&quot;.

Article 296 3. (Exploitation of sexual acts / Sexual acts with minors against payment) Amended 27 September 2013, states: &quot;Any person who carries out sexual acts with a minor or induces a minor to carry out such acts and who makes or promises payment in return is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty&quot;.

Article 187 1. (Endangering the development of minors / Sexual acts with children) states: &quot;1. Any person who engages in a sexual act with a child under 16 years of age, or, incites a child to commit such an activity, or involves a child in a sexual act, is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty. 2. The act is not an offence if the difference in age between the persons involved is not more than three years.&quot;

===South Korea===
Under &quot;The Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse&quot;, Article 33 (Punishment of Korean Citizens who Commit Offenses Overseas) states: &quot;Where criminally prosecuting a Korean citizen who commits a sex offense against a child or juvenile outside the territory of the Republic of Korea, pursuant to Article 3 of the Criminal Act, the State shall endeavor to obtain criminal information swiftly from the relevant foreign country and punish such offender&quot;. According to a 2012 ECPAT report &quot;progress is needed with regard to the enforcement of extraterritorial jurisdiction concerning nationals who have sex with children abroad... depending on which South Korean law is being applied, the definition of &quot;child&quot; varies...These varying definitions create uncertainty as to how the various laws will be applied and invite a lack of cooperation or lack of uniformity in enforcement by multiple agencies&quot; 

===United Kingdom===
The Sexual Offences Act 2003 enables British citizens and residents who commit sexual offences against children overseas to be prosecuted in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Similar provisions are in force in Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. Some of the offences carry penalties of up to life imprisonment and anyone found guilty will be placed on the Sex Offenders Register. As of 2013, two British citizens are in jail following trials based on this legislation: Barry McCloud and David Graham.

===United States===
Under the PROTECT Act of April 2003, it is a federal crime, prosecutable in the United States, for a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien, to engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with a person under the age of 18, whether or not the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident alien intended to engage in such illicit sexual conduct prior to going abroad. For purposes of the PROTECT Act, illicit sexual conduct includes any commercial sex act in a foreign country with a person under the age of 18. The law defines a commercial sex act as any sex act, on account of which anything of value is given to or received by a person under the age of 18. Before congressional passage of the Protect Act of 2003, prosecutors had to prove that sex tourists went abroad with the intent of molesting children—something almost impossible to demonstrate. The Protect Act shifted the burden, making predators liable for the act itself. Penalties were doubled from up to 15 years in prison to up to 30 years in prison.

===European Union===
Under the European Directive 2011/93/EU of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, Member States have to prosecute their citizens for child sex offences committed abroad. By 2015, most Member States have implemented this directive.

A proposed revision of the Directive is as of 9 November 2024 under consideration.

<text>is the third-sector semipublic company that runs Port Island Line (&quot;Port Liner&quot;) and Rokkō Island Line (&quot;Rokkō Liner&quot;) automated guideway transit (AGT) systems in Kobe, Japan. When opened in 1981, the Port Liner was the world&#x27;s first fully automated transport system.

In the &quot;Surutto KANSAI&quot; stored-fare system, the company is represented by the mark KS on the back of farecards.

==Lines==
Kōbe New Transit operates following two lines, which connect the artificial islands in the port of Kobe with the mainland:

*February 5, 1981: Port Island Line (Port Liner) began operation. The first practical AGT in Japan.
*February 21, 1990: Rokkō Island Line (Rokkō Liner) began operation.

<text>The Restless Years is an Australian soap opera which followed the lives of several Sydney school-leavers and the drama and relationships faced by young adults. It was created by Reg Watson and produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation for Network Ten, and ran from 6 December 1977 until 12 November 1981.

==Storylines==
The series made use of dramatic storylines involving murders, kidnapping, suicides, amnesia, serial killers, blackmail, divorce, and prostitution among the more standard elements such as teenage problems, unemployment, romance, jealousy, money-making schemes, and parental problems.

The show&#x27;s younger characters were seen living in various share households. Their storylines frequently involved romances, attempts to find a job, career problems. There were some family groups where the parents endured marital infidelity, divorce, problems with their children.

Dr Bruce Russell&#x27;s first wife, Alison (Julieanne Newbould), suffered a miscarriage and was soon afterwards killed by terrorists while on holiday in Asia. Bruce later married Olivia Baxter. She fell pregnant but there were complications. Bruce arranged for her to have an abortion as the pregnancy could harm her health. After this she became mentally deranged and divorced him. Olivia subsequently snatched a baby and went on the run.

&quot;The Restless Years&quot;, unlike previous series, did not focus on a physical locale, although presented a loose set of relationships where frequent phone calls defined the facilitated links, and frequently occur in the various foyers of the apartment building where the characters resided. Although various scenes were featured at a local bar called &quot;Thommo&#x27;s&quot;, a much frequented cafe, and subsequently a youth refuge and a cafe called the &quot;Beck and Call&quot;, the series although filmed in the in-house studios, including shopping centres, parks, gardens and the beach. The physical relationships from the various residences were not clearly defined, and the established logic was restricted to a subset of regulars.

==Cast==
There was a high turnover of attractive youngsters in the cast, who made up the students of school graduates, including Olivia Baxter, played by Zoe Bertram, and rebellious youth Peter Beckett, played by Nick Hedstrom, however the series&#x27; most enduring character would be Dr. Bruce Russell, played by 28 year-old English-born Number 96 star Malcolm Thompson who before settling in Australia had previously spent a 10-month stint featuring in British TV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

The series made use of established actors to provide the backbone, including former school teacher and dignified middle-aged spinster Miss Elizabeth McKenzie, played by veteran actress June Salter, who would emerge as the heart of the series.

Original cast members Salter and Hedstrom left the series in late 1980 and Bertram left in late 1981, leaving Thompson as the only remaining original cast member, and the only cast member to continue through the show&#x27;s entire run. Salter and Hedstrom returned for the final episode.

==Production==
The series was Grundy&#x27;s third foray into creating successful soap operas, and followed a similar theme to their previous school room drama &quot;Class of &#x27;74&quot;. &quot;The Restless Years&quot; also holds the distinction, with a handful of other Grundy serials, of having never been broadcast, or been remade, in the United Kingdom.

===Theme tune===
The opening and closing theme title sequence was played over a melancholy piano tune, over a shot of rolling clouds while an angelic chorus would intone, &quot;It&#x27;s only a journey, through our restless years, let our hearts run free...&quot;.

The rather maudlin tune and refrain set a pensive and sad tone.

In a promotional move, the network had singer Renee Geyer, record a funky rock ballad based on the theme tune, and it was used as the Ten Network&#x27;s identification mark.

==Broadcast==
The series debuted in a prime time slot on 6 December 1977 (during the end-of-year TV non-ratings period, in the vein of the Seven Network serial &quot;Cop Shop&quot;, which had premiered the previous week in the out of ratings period) and was creator Watson&#x27;s second successful soap opera in Australia, following &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. 

It had a successful run of four years, until December 1981, and ran 781 x 30 minute episodes. It was not renewed by the network due to declining ratings. The series had a predominantly young audience.

&quot;The Restless Years&quot; originally screened in most areas at 7.30 pm in one-hour instalments, twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. For all but the last three weeks of its 1981 season, the series screened in Melbourne as five thirty-minute episodes stripped across each weeknight at 7.00 pm. It was moved to 5.30 pm for the last three weeks, with final episode reached on Thursday, 12 November 1981. In Sydney in mid 1981 the series switched to running as a single one-hour episode on Wednesday nights at 7.30 pm.

==Famous alumni==
There was a high turnover of young performers in the series, it was a training ground for many stars including Peter Mochrie in his debut as Ric Moran. He would go on to appear in film &quot;Winter of Our Dreams&quot; starring Bryan Brown and Judy Davis.

Others included Lenore Smith, Penny Cook (&quot;A Country Practice&quot; and &quot;E Street&quot;), Anna Hruby, Martin Sacks (&quot;Blue Heelers&quot;), Warren Blondell, Joanne Stanley, Lisa Crittenden (&quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, &quot;Prisoner&quot;) and Jacqui Gordon, while Peter Phelps and Kim Lewis would also find fame on &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;.

==Remakes==
The show was remade in the Netherlands as &quot;Goede tijden, slechte tijden&quot; (first broadcast 1990) which in turn was remade in Germany as &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; (since 1992): both these titles mean &quot;Good times, bad times&quot;. As of 2021, the Dutch and German shows are still running – although they have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines – and are the highest rated soap operas in their respective countries. Apart from the similar title, the shows are currently also very different from each other with unique characters and very different plotlines.

<text>The Fairly OddParents is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. The series follows the adventures of Timmy Turner, a 10-year-old boy with two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda who grant him wishes to solve his everyday problems.

The series originated from shorts on Nickelodeon&#x27;s animation showcase &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; that aired from 1998 to 2002. Due to their popularity, the shorts were greenlit to become a half-hour series, which premiered on March 30, 2001. Originally, the series ended on November 25, 2006, totaling five seasons and 80 episodes, but it was revived in 2008. Production of the series ceased again after Hartman left Nickelodeon in February 2018. It was Nickelodeon&#x27;s second longest-running animated series, behind &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (1999–present).

On February 24, 2021, it was announced that a spin-off live-action series was in development for Paramount+. The series &quot;The Fairly OddParents: Fairly Odder&quot; premiered on March 31, 2022. A sequel series, titled &quot;The Fairly OddParents: A New Wish&quot;, premiered on May 20, 2024.

==Synopsis==
===Premise===
&quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; follows Timmy Turner, a 10-year old boy who is neglected by his parents and abused by his teenage babysitter, Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes usually backfire badly and cause a series of problems that Timmy must fix. Earlier episodes of the series tend to revolve around Timmy trying to navigate his everyday life at home, at school and elsewhere in town with his friends, Chester and A.J., and occasionally his parents, while also trying to fix a wish gone awry and ultimately, learning a lesson in the end. Later in the series, Timmy wishes that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof, and much later, Timmy gets a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Even later in the series, a new girl called Chloe Carmichael, who loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly, moves into the neighborhood, and Timmy has to share Cosmo and Wanda with her due to a shortage of available fairies.

At the beginning of the series, Vicky was the main antagonist, but as the series progressed, many more villains were introduced, including Denzel Crocker, Timmy&#x27;s crazed teacher who wishes to prove to the world that fairies exist; Francis, the school bully; Remy Buxaplenty, a young billionaire child, who is set on getting rid of Timmy&#x27;s fairy godparents due to his immense jealousy towards him for having two fairy godparents compared to his one, named Juandissimo Magnifico, Wanda&#x27;s ex; Dark Laser, a parody of Darth Vader, who wants to destroy Timmy and the Earth; the Pixies, who are known to wield as much power as fairies, but they treat their magical powers like a business. The Pixies&#x27; primary goal is to take control of Fairy World and the Earth; the Anti-fairies, who are similar to the actual fairies, but with polar opposite personalities and character traits. Anti-fairies are also known for causing bad luck; and Norm the Genie, who hatches a plan to gain freedom from his lamp and get revenge on Timmy.

===Setting===
&quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. Dimmsdale has a sign on some mountains near the city that is a parody of the Hollywood Sign. In the episode &quot;Vicky Loses Her Icky&quot;, the Mayor of Dimmsdale unveils the &quot;Welcome to Dimmsdale – Nicest Town on Earth!&quot; sign. However, at the end of the episode, the President of the United States changes the word &quot;Nicest&quot; to &quot;Meanest&quot;. Dimmsdale appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings, skyscrapers and a city hall, but also containing uptown areas with suburban residences (including the neighborhood where Timmy, his parents and his friends live) and businesses, such as Timmy&#x27;s school; a hospital; a jail; a sports complex called the Dimmadome, which is named after its founder and owner, Doug Dimmadome, a man who owns a local TV channel and various restaurants and stores, as well as a park in the center of the city. Dimmsdale also appears to have rural farmland located outside of the city. The adults who live in Dimmsdale are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still manage to form a working and functioning society. In the episode &quot;Which Witch is Which?&quot; it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1660s and named after a man called Dale Dimm.

When the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the home of the fairies, which is a floating world located on top of some clouds, colored with an abundance of pink and purple. Fairy World is depicted as a large metropolis with houses, streets, different kinds of buildings, and skyscrapers. Most buildings in Fairy World have crowns and stars above their roofs. The fairies have a civilization like that of humans, but with their primary source of power being magic, which also keeps their world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth, although the bridge seems to exist only for decoration since fairies teleport via magic to and from Earth. Fairy World is not actually a part of Earth but is depicted as a separate world in outer space located near Earth&#x27;s orbit that can only be accessed by magic. Among the most notable landmarks in Fairy World is the glowing entrance sign on the other side of the rainbow bridge and the giant wand located in the center of Fairy World that powers the fairies&#x27; magic. Jorgen Von Strangle, an enormous and tough fairy with an Austrian accent (similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger), acts as the leader of the fairies and Fairy World. Jorgen personally dislikes Timmy at the beginning of the series but warms up to him over time.

Another location seen in the show is the city of Chincinnati, the home town of Timmy&#x27;s favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the Anti-fairies reside; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the Pixies; and Yugopotamia, another planet where Timmy&#x27;s alien friend Mark Chang lived until the episode &quot;New Squid in Town!&quot; when Timmy invites Mark to live in the Dimmsdale junkyard in order to escape his evil fiancée, Princess Mandie.

==Production history==
===Development and &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; (1997–2001)===

Prior to the creation of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, Butch Hartman was working at Cartoon Network on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;. In 1997, Fred Seibert contacted Hartman about pitching ideas for Seibert&#x27;s new company, Frederator Incorporated, as a part of their &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; series which the studio was developing for Nickelodeon. Hartman initially declined the offer. Several months later, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; finished and Hartman decided to create his own series instead of going back to working for other studios.

Hartman started developing his own series by drawing a picture of a little boy who would become Timmy Turner. Hartman was originally going to name him Mike, after his brother Mike Hartman, but they had a fight that day, so Hartman named him after his other brother Timmy Hartman instead. Hartman wanted Timmy to be able to go anywhere because he never wanted to be stuck for a story transition. Hartman was originally going to give Timmy science powers, but decided against it due to &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; having recently come out. Instead, he decided to give Timmy a magic friend. He drew Venus (later renamed Wanda) first and then decided that, because he had never heard of a fairy godfather before, to draw Cosmo. After coming up with the entire premise for the cartoon in about fifteen minutes, Hartman first pitched the idea to Hanna-Barbera and then to Cartoon Network, both of whom turned it down. Hartman then went back to Seibert at Nickelodeon and successfully pitched it to them for &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;.

While in early development, the series was titled &quot;The Fairy GodParents&quot; and then it was briefly changed to &quot;Oh My GodParents&quot;. Bill Burnett came up with the title &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, which they ended up sticking with. Hartman originally created &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; as a seven-minute short film, which was one of the thirty-nine short cartoons created for &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;. Hartman made ten seven-minute short films of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; in total for &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;, which aired on Nickelodeon from September 4, 1998, to March 23, 2001. Due to the success of the shorts, Nickelodeon picked up &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; for a full-length series alongside fellow &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;: &quot;ChalkZone&quot; and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;. In 2000, Nickelodeon ordered seven 23-minute episodes for the series&#x27; first season, which premiered on March 30, 2001 (just one week after the final Oh Yeah! short) in the half-hour before fellow Nicktoon &quot;Invader Zim&quot; made its debut.

Unlike the later series, the animation in the original shorts is not as smooth and the designs are notably different (including Timmy&#x27;s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the pilot episodes and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky&#x27;s abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include Timmy Turner, who was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the Oh Yeah! shorts rather than Tara Strong in the series (Strong would dub over Bergman&#x27;s dialogue in the Oh Yeah! shorts to establish better continuity). Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series while Wanda is shown to be ditzy. Vicky is also much less evil than in the current series; she has a little brother in the pilot episode before it was changed to a little sister later on in the shorts &amp; she also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used &quot;twerp&quot;.

===Original run (2001–2006)===
Upon its premiere, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; was immediately popular and quickly became the second-highest-rated children&#x27;s program among kids ages 2–11 on both network and cable television, behind Nickelodeon&#x27;s own &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. The series managed to briefly steal &quot;SpongeBob&quot;&#x27;s spot as the number one highest rated children&#x27;s television program in mid-2003. &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; also attracted a wide audience, appealing to kids as well as to teenagers and adults, with 14.2 million kids 2-11 tuning in each week, 10.8 million adult viewers per week and was the number one series on television among tween audiences (9-14).

On January 24, 2006, Hartman announced on his forum that Nickelodeon had ceased production of the show. &quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators&quot; is the fifth-season finale in production order and was intended to be the series finale, airing on July 21, 2006. However, Nickelodeon broadcast the episode &quot;Timmy the Barbarian/No Substitute for Crazy&quot; after &quot;The Jerkinators&quot; as the fifth-season finale in airing order, on November 25 of that year.

===Revival (2007–2012)===
On February 2, 2007, Hartman announced on his forum that Nick granted &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; twenty more episode slots, making sure the show resumed production. Later on July 7, 2007, a special titled &quot;77 Secrets of the Fairly OddParents Revealed&quot; hinted that a new character would join the series.
After a one-year hiatus, Nickelodeon announced that they would begin the sixth season, which would consist of twelve episodes alongside the broadcast of a television film called &quot;Fairly OddBaby&quot;, which introduced a new character, a baby fairy named Poof, to the main cast of characters. A huge hit, &quot;Fairly OddBaby&quot; aired on February 18, 2008, and garnered 8.89 million viewers for its premiere; the rebroadcast of the film the following day garnered 4.82 million viewers, making it the number one and ninth most viewed cable broadcast respectively for the week of February 18–24, 2008.

===Live-action films and end of the series (2011–2017)===
To honor the tenth anniversary of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, a live-action television film titled &quot;A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!&quot; premiered on July 9, 2011. The film is set 13 years after the animated series and stars Drake Bell as a 23-year-old Timmy Turner, who is trying his hardest not to grow up in order to prevent losing his fairy godparents, and Daniella Monet as Tootie, who has grown into a mature and beautiful activist with whom Timmy falls in love. The premiere of the movie attracted 5.8 million viewers and it was the top-rated television broadcast on cable networks for the week of July 10–16, 2011, and ranked as &quot;2011&#x27;s Top Original TV Movie on Basic Cable with Kids and Total Viewers&quot;.

The success of &quot;A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!&quot; spawned two sequels: &quot;A Fairly Odd Christmas&quot; and &quot;A Fairly Odd Summer&quot;, which premiered on November 29, 2012, and August 2, 2014 respectively. Drake Bell and Daniella Monet reprised their respective roles in both of the sequels.

The ninth season of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; began with a television special titled &quot;Fairly OddPet&quot;, which premiered on March 23, 2013, and attracted 3.8 million viewers. The ninth season&#x27;s official run began on May 4, 2013. Season nine introduced a new character, Timmy&#x27;s pet fairy dog Sparky, to the show&#x27;s main cast. Season nine contained twenty-six episodes, making it the longest season in the series. It is also the first season to be formatted in both high definition and widescreen.
The tenth season of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; began with a special called &quot;The Big Fairy Share Scare!&quot;, which introduced another new main character named Chloe Carmichael, Timmy&#x27;s neighbor who he is forced to share Cosmo and Wanda with due to a fairy shortage. The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both Nickelodeon and Nicktoons. The visuals and lyrics for the theme song were changed for season ten in order to include Chloe; however, it still contained the same rhythm and melody as the original theme song. Also in season 10, the show&#x27;s animation made the transition from traditional animation to Flash animation. The animation for season ten was done by Elliott Animation Studios in Canada, whereas all of the prior seasons were animated by Yeson Animation Studios in South Korea.

==Episodes==

===&quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; crossover episodes===
There have also been three tie-ins with special episode crossovers involving the Nickelodeon computer-animated series &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; under the title &quot;The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour&quot; (the first alone, the second and third with the subtitles &quot;When Nerds Collide!&quot; and &quot;The Jerkinators!&quot;, respectively); the three main characters from Fairly OddParents meet with the main characters from &quot;Jimmy Neutron,&quot; Jimmy, Sheen, Carl, Cindy, and Libby, and often cross between each of their worlds of 2D and 3D animation.

==Spin-offs and revivals==
===Cancelled spin-off series and film===
In 2004, Hartman revealed his intentions to make a &quot;Crash Nebula&quot; spin-off series. The pilot episode &quot;Crash Nebula&quot; was aired as part of the show&#x27;s fifth season, with the pilot focusing on a young boy named Sprig Speevak (voiced by James Arnold Taylor), who meets various types of strange aliens as he attends a school in outer space, making a few friends and enemies. Nickelodeon decided not to pick up the series.

In 2006, Hartman stated that he was still confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlit in the future. He also wrote a script entitled &quot;Crash Nebula: The Movie&quot; for Paramount Pictures, but the film was canceled due to its similarities to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Sky High&quot;. However, no other news for the &quot;Crash Nebula&quot; IP has been announced since then, with it remaining as a fictitious television series in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; that Timmy Turner is a fan of. The episode in the fifth season adds an introduction where Timmy is excited for Sprig&#x27;s origin story, with Cosmo and Wanda making wild guesses.

===Live-action spin-off series===

On February 24, 2021, it was announced that a live-action sequel series was in development and debut on Paramount+. Hartman and Seibert return as producers, while Christopher J. Nowak serve as both executive producer and showrunner. The series started production in July 2021 and premiered on March 31, 2022, with one season.

=== Sequel series ===
In 2023, Nickelodeon &amp; Paramount Global applied to register &quot;The Fairly OddParents: A New Wish&quot; with the USPTO under several NICE classes. A screenwriter from Season 9 of the original series confirmed a new project was in development. On February 23, 2024, further details about the series were revealed, including an impending Netflix debut, the return of Daran Norris and Susanne Blakeslee as Cosmo and Wanda respectively, and the focus on a new main character, Hazel Wells. It premiered on May 20, 2024 on Nickelodeon.

<doc id="232867" wikidata="Q196002" url="?curid=232867" title="Hamstring">
<text>A hamstring () is any one of the three posterior thigh muscles in human anatomy between the hip and the knee: from medial to lateral, the semimembranosus, semitendinosus and biceps femoris.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ham&quot; is derived from the Old English “ham” or “hom” meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant &quot;crooked&quot;. It gained the meaning of the leg of an animal around the 15th century. &quot;String&quot; refers to tendons, and thus the hamstrings&#x27; string-like tendons felt on either side of the back of the knee.

==Criteria==
The common criteria of any hamstring muscles are: 
# Muscles should originate from ischial tuberosity.
# Muscles should be inserted over the knee joint, in the tibia or in the fibula.
# Muscles will be innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve.
# Muscle will participate in flexion of the knee joint and extension of the hip joint.

Those muscles which fulfill all of the four criteria are called true hamstrings.
 The adductor magnus reaches only up to the adductor tubercle of the femur, but it is included amongst the hamstrings because the tibial collateral ligament of the knee joint morphologically is the degenerated tendon of this muscle. The ligament is attached to the medial epicondyle, two millimeters from the adductor tubercle.

==Structure==
The three muscles of the posterior thigh (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris) flex (bend) the knee, while all but the biceps femoris extend (straighten) the hip. The three &#x27;true&#x27; hamstrings cross both the hip and the knee joint and are therefore involved in knee flexion and hip extension. The short head of the biceps femoris crosses only one joint (knee) and is therefore not involved in hip extension. With its divergent origin and innervation, it is sometimes excluded from the &#x27;hamstring&#x27; characterization.

A portion of the adductor magnus is sometimes considered a part of the hamstrings.
==Function==
The hamstrings cross and act upon two joints – the hip and the knee – and as such they are termed biarticular muscles.

Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent.

The long head of the biceps femoris extends the hip, as when beginning to walk; both short and long heads flex the knee and laterally (outwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent.

The hamstrings play a crucial role in many daily activities such as walking, running, jumping, and controlling some movement in the gluteus. In walking, they are most important as an antagonist to the quadriceps in the deceleration of knee extension.

==Clinical significance==
===Sports running injuries===
A common running injury in several sports, excessive stretch of a hamstring results from extensive hip flexion while the knee is extended. During sprinting, a hamstring injury may occur from excessive muscle strain during eccentric contraction late in the leg swing phase. The overall incidence of a hamstring injury in sports and professional dancers is about two per 1000 hours of performance. In some sports, a hamstring injury occurs at the incidence of 19% of all sports injuries, and results in an average time loss from competition of 24  days.

===Imaging===

Imaging the hamstring muscles is usually performed with an ultrasound and/or MRI.  The biceps femoris is most commonly injured, followed by semitendinosus. Semimembranosus injury is rare. Imaging is useful in differentiating the grade of strain, especially if the muscle is completely torn. In this setting, the level and degree of retraction can be determined, serving as a useful roadmap prior to any surgery. Those with a hamstring strain of greater than in length have a greater risk of recurrence.

===Use in surgery===
The distal semitendinosus tendon is one of the tendons that can be used in the surgical procedure ACL reconstruction. In this procedure, a piece of it is used to replace the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is one of the four major ligaments in the knee, which also include the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL).

<text>Pli selon pli (Fold by fold) is a piece of classical music by the French composer Pierre Boulez. It carries the subtitle &quot;Portrait de Mallarmé&quot; (Portrait of Mallarmé). It is scored for a solo soprano and orchestra and uses the texts of three sonnets of French symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé and single lines from two of his other poems. At over an hour, it is Boulez&#x27;s longest work.

==Movements and poems==
The composition is in five movements, the first and last using a line from a Mallarmé poem, the three middle movements using the entire text of a Mallarmé sonnet. The movements and their associated poems are:

The title is taken from yet another Mallarmé poem, &quot;Remémoration d&#x27;amis belges&quot;, in which the poet describes how a mist that covers the city of Bruges gradually disappears:

Boulez said: &quot;So, fold by fold, as the five movements develop, a portrait of Mallarmé is revealed.&quot;

Boulez uses the five Mallarmé poems in chronological order, beginning with the early &quot;Don du poème&quot; of 1865 in the first movement and continuing to the late &quot;Tombeau&quot; of 1897 in the last. The work thus represents a life of Mallarmé, and it concludes with the word &quot;mort&quot; (death), the only clearly intelligible word of the last movement. The first movement uses just the first line of &quot;Don du poème&quot; and the last movement just the last line of &quot;Tombeau&quot;. Describing the setting of these texts, a critic wrote that in the first and last movements &quot;the voice is hardly present – though significant when it is&quot; and that the voice &quot;function[s] as an instrumental timbre in its own right.&quot; Of the work as a whole wrote: &quot;The idea of &#x27;setting&#x27; a text, however, in the conventional sense, is not adopted here. Rather, the soprano is an integral part of the instrumental fabric and only rarely are specific words or phrases &#x27;illustrated&#x27; musically in the traditional manner.&quot;

==Conception and composition==
Boulez composed &quot;Improvisations I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, for soprano and percussion ensemble, in 1957. In 1959 he wrote &quot;Improvisation III&quot; for soprano, instrumental ensemble and a large group of percussion, as well as &quot;Tombeau&quot;, for soprano and large orchestra. In 1960, he completed &quot;Don&quot; in a version for soprano and piano. In 1962, he rescored this movement for soprano and orchestra, and also rescored &quot;Improvisation I&quot;, completing the work in its initial form.

As he did with so many of his compositions, Boulez returned to the work and revised it. In the 1980s, he rewrote &quot;Don&quot; and revised &quot;Improvisation III&quot;. In both cases, Boulez removed some of the flexibility he had previously allowed the performers in determining the order in which to play the sections of these movements.

&quot;Improvisation II&quot; contrasts &quot;three different kinds of sounds—fixed pitch, partially pitched, and unpitched (&#x27;noise&#x27;)&quot;.

The piece has a relatively simple large-scale dynamic shape: the outer movements are written for large ensembles, the second and fourth movements for smaller groups, and the central third movement uses just ten instrumentalists and the soprano. The general dynamic is loudest at the work&#x27;s opening and closing and most quiet in the middle. The first movement opens with a loud sound which immediately becomes quiet and the last closes with a rapid crescendo. In fact the last movement &quot;is consumed by a vast and monolithic crescendo that slowly and steadily gains in textural and contrapuntal complexity as its unfolds before breaking off after some fifteen minutes: it is the monolithic inexorability of its unfolding over so vast an expanse of time that makes the experience of &quot;Tombeau&quot; so gripping&quot;.
The symmetrical structure of the work is readily apparent not only in its dynamics, but in the use of fragments in the opening and closing sections and the disposition of instruments. The work opens and closes with the same chord.

The composition also includes instances of tone painting, as in the first movement where &quot;fog and the hovering characteristic of fog are suggested by the long soft roll on the suspended cymbals that underlies much of the movement, the sudden motion of denser thickets of fog in a gust of wind by adding other rolls to the suspended cymbal roll&quot;.

According to one critic, &quot;[Boulez&#x27;s] works inhabit their own special soundworld&quot;. In &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot; he groups instruments in atypical ways. For example, &quot;The customary string section is not used for lyrical, cantabile melodies, but rather for sounds such as tremolos &#x27;snapped&#x27; pizzicati and other quasi-percussive effects.&quot; At times, &quot;Three harps, mandolin and guitar are added to two pianos to form a plucked/struck string group.&quot; Bells are used so as to avoid any association with religious ceremony. Instead &quot;their combination with other metal percussion creates for a unique sonority – quite peculiar to itself.&quot; He described the orchestration as &quot;extraordinarily inventive, with sometimes a completely different timbre between one phrase – or even note – and the next.&quot; John Rockwell recognized both the work&#x27;s innovations and its sources: &quot;as evident as the novelty of these pieces are their debts to other composers and other cultures–the Expressionist tensions of Schoenberg, the exuberant racket of Chinese percussion, above all the piercing aviary of Messiaen. Which is not to deny Mr. Boulez his eagerly sought-after originality, merely to place it in context.&quot;

The published score of the original version was printed with some sections in black, green, blue, violet and red to illustrate, according to a Pierpont Morgan Library exhibition catalog, &quot;the different degrees of rigor with which its various parts are to be realized in performance&quot;. The colors did not appear in later versions.

==Performance history==
Boulez conducted the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra (Baden-Baden) in the world premiere of &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot; in 1960. According to Judith Crispin, the complex rhythms of &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot;, which are &quot;ostensibly&quot; required by compositional concerns, were designed to &quot;showcase the conducting skills of the composer&quot;, his &quot;virtuosic display&quot;.

Maurice Béjart choreographed a ballet using three movements: &quot;Don&quot;, &quot;Improvisation III&quot;, and &quot;Tombeau&quot;.

The first New York performance of all five movements occurred in 1978 in Carnegie Hall by the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble led by Arthur Weisberg.

Boulez sometimes conducted partial performances. For example, he led the New York Philharmonic in performances of the first two &quot;Improvisations&quot; in 1974 and of the three &quot;Improvisations&quot; in 1986.

==Reception==
In 1970 a critic reviewing the work&#x27;s first recording wrote that &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot; had for years been on &quot;a mission&quot; to serve as &quot;a showpiece of the &#x27;advanced&#x27; idiom&quot; and judged that &quot;The ground it covers and even breaks qualifies it well ... as such an emissary&quot;. He wrote:

In 1974, when Boulez conducted the New York Philharmonic in the first two &quot;Improvisations&quot; at one of a series of &quot;Rug Concerts&quot; that attracted in notably young audience, the audience &quot;stood and cheered&quot; and brought the conductor and soloist back for four additional bows.

In 1984, Paul Griffiths wrote that the work was &quot;now well established as a major monument to that strange movement known as the &#x27;avant garde&#x27;: composed between 1957 and 1962, it is indeed a testimony to that movement&#x27;s heyday&quot;. Andrew Porter said the work deserved to be presented annually in New York. Edward Rothstein called it &quot;a touchstone in postwar composition&quot;.

In 1986, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Rockwell withheld judgment: &quot;how posterity will value these scores, so colorful yet so insistently, self-contentedly enigmatic, remains to be seen&quot;, though he once wrote that the composition demonstrated Boulez&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully acute sense of aural color&quot;. In 1991, his colleague Donal Henahan, who had long been hostile to the work, used &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot; as an exemplar of the failure of contemporary music to engage the listener&#x27;s emotions:
A &quot;Gramophone&quot; review of the only recording of the final version, which it called &quot;the composer’s definitive conception of the work as enhanced chamber music&quot;, said that &quot;there can be no such thing as a sanitised‚ lushly comforting Pli selon Pli. The music remains Boulez&#x27;s most extended engagement with the modernist aesthetic‚ especially in the concluding &quot;Tombeau&quot;‚ which so determinedly resists that very continuity and coherent cumulation to which it seems to aspire&quot;. It described the composition as &quot;a work which sums up the composer&#x27;s vision of art and life in the years before he found his way to a viable electroacoustic technique and a more stable view of musical structure.&quot; Another assessment from early in the 21st century called &quot;Pli selon Pli&quot; Boulez&#x27;s &quot;perhaps greatest score&quot;, which &quot;carved out a particular sound, ethos, and way of measuring musical time that no work–by Boulez or anyone else–has since followed up, let alone equaled.&quot;

Discussing the work in 2013, composer and conductor Matthias Pintscher said:

Composer and pianist Anthony Cheung said that &quot;The use of percussion in &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;, the &quot;Improvisations sur Mallarmé&quot;, the exotic, heightened resonance of that world, has been particularly influential for me.&quot;

==Recordings==
The work has been recorded three times: in 1969 with soprano Halina Łukomska and the BBC Symphony Orchestra; in 1981 with soprano Phyllis Bryn-Julson and the same orchestra; and in 2000 with soprano Christine Schäfer and the Ensemble InterContemporain. Boulez conducted all three recordings. Only the third recording presents the work in its final form. In 1983, comparing the first two recordings, Paul Griffiths noted the latter&#x27;s markedly longer playing times and wrote: &quot;Boulez in 1969 appears to have been excited with a work that was still new; in 1981 he was looking back on it with affection, certainly, but perhaps too with a faint sense of regret.&quot;

<text>Family Affairs is a British soap opera that aired on Channel 5. It debuted on 30 March 1997, the day of the launch of said channel and was the first programme broadcast on the channel. It was screened as five thirty-minute episodes per week at 6:30pm on weekdays, followed by an omnibus edition on Sundays. The series never achieved high ratings, so it went through a number of dramatic revamps involving wholesale cast turnover. The premise of the series was also refocused from a family in a quiet suburb just outside London, to a range of different people living on a bustling outer London street.

The series was shot on video and given a film look. In 1999 and 2004, single episodes used standard video presentation for testing purposes. On 2 August 2005, Channel 5 announced they would not renew &quot;Family Affairs&quot;. Production ceased on 4 November, and the final episode was broadcast on 30 December 2005. Producer Sean O&#x27;Connor changed to standard video presentation from September 2005 until the final episode.

==History==
===Original format===
The serial originally focused on the Hart and Gates family and some of their friends and close associates living in the fictional outer London suburb of Charnham. The Hart family consisted of builder Chris (Ian Ashpitel), his wife Annie (Liz Crowther) and their four children: ladies&#x27; man Duncan (Rocky Marshall); his twin sister, trainee solicitor and confused virgin Holly (Sandra Huggett); feisty Melanie, who became a police officer (Cordelia Bugeja); and schoolboy Jamie (Michael Cole). Annie gave birth to a fifth child during the series, Sam.

Chris and Annie&#x27;s parents were also featured. After losing his wife Sally (Jean Heywood) in the opening episodes, Chris&#x27; father Angus (Ian Cullen) came to live with the family. Annie&#x27;s parents, staunchly conservative Elsa Gates (Delena Kidd) and philandering Jack (Kenneth Farrington), lived nearby.

Other original characters were Chris&#x27;s partner in their building business, Nick Trip (Barry McCormick); Melanie&#x27;s bubbly best friend Claire Toomey (Tina Hall); Annie&#x27;s baby-obsessed friend Maria Simons (Annie Miles); and Duncan&#x27;s loyal drinking partners Tim Webster (Idris Elba) and Roy Farmer (Miles Petit).

The action took place in a series of modern, middle-class houses and spacious apartments whose geographic relation to one another was not clearly defined by the series. The primary meeting place for characters was The Lock, a slick bar/restaurant located in Charnham&#x27;s riverside marina district. The expansive parklands and forested areas of Charnham Common were also frequently visited by characters.

Later in 1997, Maria&#x27;s ex-husband, the callous Pete Callan, appeared in town. Pete, played by ex-&quot;Brookside&quot; actor David Easter, provided the series with a much-needed villain, and he quickly became the show&#x27;s standout character. Pete soon married Claire Toomey, who had been deserted by Duncan after giving birth to his twin children.

Another early arrival was the sassy bisexual Susie Ross (Tina Landini), who took a job at The Lock and romanced both Duncan and his twin sister Holly. Nick&#x27;s troublesome teenage son Liam (Stephen Hoyle) arrived, and neighbourhood nosey parker Bill Cockerill (Roger Sloman) and his wife Samantha (Tessa Wyatt), along with their daughter Charlotte, made several appearances.

Liam became involved in a post office robbery. His lawyer was Pamela Hargreaves (Sandy Hendrickse), and she soon embarked on a romance with Liam&#x27;s father Nick. Pete Callan then bought The Lock, further cementing his importance to the series. Entrepreneur Peter Stringfellow even made a guest appearance in one episode.

===Revamp===
By mid-1998, the programme&#x27;s middling ratings prompted the show&#x27;s makers to drastically revamp the series. Brian Park, famous for his overhaul of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, was appointed as &quot;Family Affairs&quot;&#x27; new producer and was tasked with remodelling the series. It was decided that the majority of the regular characters would be written out – including all members of Hart and Gates families.

Throughout 1998, Tim, Susie and Liam departed, and the recurring Cockerill couple was phased out. Pamela&#x27;s romance with Nick developed and her mother, lovable but meddling gossip Sadie Hargreaves (Barbara Young), entered the storyline. Lovable rogue Dave Matthews (Richard Hawley), his brassy chain-smoking wife Cat (Nicola Duffett), and Dave&#x27;s son from an earlier marriage Josh (Terry Burns) moved in. Dave was an extramarital love interest for Annie Hart, before falling in love with her daughter Holly.

Also introduced was Dusty McHugh (Doreen Ingleton), the strident owner of the local mini supermarket, and her children, mouthy daughter Yasmin (Ebony Thomas) and conscientious son Benji (Junior Laniyan). The McHughs lived in a flat above their shop, and the adjacent flat was occupied by students Declan Byrne (Quentin Jones), Gabby Johnson (Emma Linley) and Clive Starr (Huw Bevan). Clive&#x27;s older brother Dudley (David Verrey), also known as Serge Pompidou, became the new chef at The Lock, and was soon joined there by vapid barmaid Siobhan Jones (Jemma Walker).

Yasmin, known for her ostentatious facial piercings, quickly started a relationship with Josh Matthews. Clive was revealed to be gay, and secretly in love with flatmate Declan. Dudley/Serge embarked on a romance with Maria, and the pair were soon married - with Serge wrongly believing Maria was pregnant.

===Gates and Hart families depart===
In late 1998, Jack Gates crashed his car on an isolated road while driving drunk. The incident knocked his wife Elsa unconscious; Jack placed her in the driver&#x27;s seat before anyone arrived at the scene and blamed her for the crash. Elsa suffered amnesia during her subsequent recuperation, and Jack kept her isolated from family for fear that their support or inquiries could trigger the return of her memory and uncover the truth. When Elsa&#x27;s memory did begin to return, Jack smothered her with a pillow, changed his will to make Pete Callan his chief beneficiary, and committed suicide by gassing himself in his car.

On 29 January 1999, the entire Hart family (except for Duncan, who had already left the series) was killed. After Roy and Melanie&#x27;s wedding, the Harts conducted a small reception on their river boat. After Roy left the boat to retrieve a hangover cure for Jamie, a fallen candle ignited leaking gas. The resultant explosion killed all on board, just as Chris learnt of Annie&#x27;s affair with Dave Matthews.

===New direction===
Immediately, the show&#x27;s theme tune and opening titles were revamped to reflect the serial&#x27;s new direction. They now deployed flashes of a tube journey to Charnham Station, linking Charnham with the city of London. Over this, shots of the new characters introduced over preceding weeks were shown.

Roy suffered emotional trauma after the loss of Melanie, kidnapping Claire Callan and threatening to kill her. After her rescue, she left Charnham and Roy recovered.

Maria Starr announced her pregnancy, while refusing to let Dudley/Serge anywhere near her or to even share the same bed for many months. She was actually faking the pregnancy and wearing a cushion under her dress. Disguised by a dark wig, Maria stole a baby from a maternity hospital and brought it home, attempting to pass it off as her own child. The truth quickly came out and the baby returned to its real parents, who chose to not press charges.

Pamela defended new client Simon Thornton (Valentine Pelka), who was accused of rape. She was convinced of his innocence so didn&#x27;t fully investigate his background, but later learned he had kept vital facts about previous convictions from her. Realising he was guilty, Pamela dropped the case and resigned from her job, but Simon started stalking her. Pamela accidentally killed Simon with an iron during a confrontation at his home. Fearing her claims of self-defence would not be believed, she enlisted Sadie&#x27;s help to bury Simon&#x27;s body on Charnham Common. Racked with guilt for several months, Pamela and Sadie exhibited strange behaviour which puzzled Nick, who had proposed to Pamela during this time.

Nick and Pamela were married at The Lock. The marriage was short-lived, as Simon&#x27;s body was found and Pamela was arrested and imprisoned for murder. Pamela took full blame and insisted Sadie had not assisted, ensuring Sadie&#x27;s freedom. Nick left town shortly afterwards.

Benjie McHugh began a love affair with his married teacher Maggie Roswell (Robyn Moore), and eventually went on the run together with Maggie&#x27;s two sons. Maggie was killed in a car accident while fleeing from her husband.

Clive Starr accepted that Declan was straight and there could be no romance between them, moving on to Adam Sheldrake (Vince Leigh). Adam was a policeman, who was in the closet for fear that being bisexual could affect his career. Adam soon found himself attracted to Clive&#x27;s flatmate Gabby Johnson. Adam&#x27;s ex-wife and daughter then arrived, further complicating Adam&#x27;s relationship with Clive and his affair with Gabby.

Siobhan Jones became closely associated with Pete Callan, then her sister Julie-Ann moved in. Julie-Ann started pursuing Pete, an endeavour which ended with the revelation that Pete was actually her father.

For several months after the revamp, the existing locations of Maria Starr&#x27;s flat, Pete Callan&#x27;s flat, the marina and The Lock continued to be featured. Dave and Cat moved into the former Gates residence. Despite the new tube station opening sequence, the exterior shots of the show&#x27;s locales the frequently visited Charnham Common suggested that Charnham was a modern, green, and spacious small town.

New characters continued to join. One arrival was the Derwin family - censorious Fern Derwin (Belinda Sinclair), easy-going taxi-driver Max (Nick Stringer) and their rebellious foster son Arlo Dean (Ash Newman). The Derwins soon fostered the troubled and sensitive Gemma Craig (Angela Hazeldine) who had recently lost her entire family. Meanwhile, Josh Matthews pursued a singing career, enlisting a manager (played by Jonathan Coleman) and recording a CD, which didn&#x27;t sell.

The departures of Claire Callan, Nick Trip and then Maria Starr left Roy Farmer as the show&#x27;s only remaining original character. Pamela Trip and Dudley Starr/Serge Pompidou had also departed. Dusty McHugh emigrated to Jamaica, leaving Yasmin and Benji – and the shop – in the care of her sister-in-law Pearl (Doña Croll). Dusty returned briefly for a Christmas visit. It was later reported she had been killed in a car accident in Jamaica.

Six months after his introduction, Max Derwin died of a heart attack during an argument with Arlo. Fern discovered that he Max left everything in his will to an illegitimate son, Maxwell, from a relationship with another woman. Claire Callan returned to the series in 2000, hardened by her disastrous marriage to Pete. She had left the twins with her sister.

===Stanley Street===
In 2000, coinciding with the introduction of the Warrington family, the geographic focus of the series was retconned to Stanley Street, in the fictitious West London W15 postal district. Previously, the specific location of Charnham had never been explicitly stated; it was known to be close to a river (actually the Grand Union Canal at Yeading), and characters sometimes travelled to Maidenhead. With the late-1998 infusion of new characters, it was established Dusty and her children lived over their minimarket and that in the next door flat were students Declan, Gabby and Clive. Now, we would see action regularly extend to the shop&#x27;s street exterior and the surrounding buildings, and this location was revealed to be the bustling Stanley Street with its row of narrow shopfronts and terraced houses. Just as Roy was establishing his new Internet café business, next door to Yasmin&#x27;s mini-supermarket, the Warringtons moved in across the street. Roy came to live in the street as well, and when Pete Callan sold The Lock to buy an old-style pub, The Black Swan, this too was revealed to be on the same short street.

In quick succession, any regular characters not already living there soon moved into Stanley Street, while Sadie&#x27;s home inexplicably shifted there without her having to move house. After this, various locations seen earlier in the series – such as The Lock and the marina – would not be seen again. Alongside Yasmin&#x27;s minimarket and the newly opened Internet café, The Black Swan would become one of the show&#x27;s primary meeting places, despite the fact that landlord Pete Callan was openly hated by most of his neighbours. From now on, most outdoor taping was on the Stanley Street set, reducing the number of time-consuming location shoots while confining much of the action to one place.

Many storylines now focussed around Pete Callan and his various nefarious activities. Meanwhile, the large group of younger characters in the series went through a series of romantic entanglements. The newly introduced Warrington family became key figures in the show&#x27;s on-going storylines; Nikki Warrington (Rebecca Blake) endured problems in her marriage and her large blended family, which consisted of her doctor husband Andrew (Simon Cook), his children Luke (Royce Cronin) and Sara (Beth Cordingly), and Nikki&#x27;s children Becky (Chandra Reugg) and Darren (Joe Fox, later Ike Hamilton) from her previous marriage to incarcerated Adrian Scott (Ariyon Bakare).

Nikki became embroiled in scandal when she embarked upon an affair with her stepson Luke. This played alongside Pete Callan&#x27;s latest misdemeanour – framing new wife Siobhan for the murder of Josh Matthews. Siobhan had struck a blow to a suspected burglar in the darkened kitchen upstairs at the pub, where she lived with Pete, before realising the &quot;burglar&quot; was merely barman Josh Matthews. Siobhan falsely believed that her blow to Josh had killed him, when it had actually just knocked him unconscious; Pete, who was on the scene in seconds and harboured a deep-seated entity with Josh&#x27;s father Dave, secretly delivered the deadly blow after Siobhan left in terror. Siobhan was quickly arrested and sent to prison.

===2001===
In 2001, the Warrington clan was extended to include their relatives, the Webb and Ellis families: Nikki&#x27;s brother Matt Ellis (Matthew Jay Lewis), his girlfriend Karen (Tanya Franks) and Karen&#x27;s brothers Jim (Joe Dow) and Paul Webb (Martin Delaney).

With their storylines gradually dwindling, Gabby Johnson and Clive Starr quietly departed. The places in their flat were taken by a succession of attractive young residents, including Polly Arnold (Juliet Cowan) and Dr Tanya Ayuba (Laila Rouass). Polly romanced Declan Byrne, but when her brother Gavin (Neil Roberts) arrived in town, she resumed her incestuous love affair with him, resulting in a disgusted Declan leaving Charnham. The establishment of a youth refuge on the street angered some residents, although Roy Farmer soon became a highly involved volunteer on the project. Jim Webb became Cat Matthews&#x27; reluctant second husband.

Paul Webb paired up with Gemma Craig, who continued to live with her well-meaning but increasingly meddlesome foster mother Fern. Fern had married Roy&#x27;s father Vince (Stephen Yardley).

Karen Ellis embarked upon a controversial lesbian affair with her child&#x27;s surrogate mother, Sadie&#x27;s Australian niece Kelly Hurst (Nicky Talacko). This storyline also featured the brief appearance of Kelly&#x27;s father and Sadie&#x27;s brother-in-law Barry (Antony Booth). At Christmas, Paul Webb discovered that Jim was not his brother, but his father.

===2002===
In 2002, Cat Webb&#x27;s niece Geri (Anna Acton) moved to Stanley Street, as did the troubled Davenport family, who moved into the flat originally occupied by Declan, Gabby and Clive. Mother Ginny (Joanna Foster) was recovering from a severe bout of depression, and husband Robert (Brian Cowan) worked to launch a catering business on Stanley Street. Their three teenage children Jessica (Sammy Glenn), Cameron (Rupert Hill) and Lewis (Sam Stockman) were soon joined by Robert&#x27;s much younger adoptive brother Jude Davenport. Jude was openly despised by Ginny, Cameron and Lewis after he romantically pursued Jessica. Cameron and Paul Webb became close friends, until Paul learned of Cameron&#x27;s brief affair with his fiancée Gemma. A furious Paul left Gemma at the altar and left Charnham.

Charlotte Day (Leanne Lakey) arrived and began working at the Black Swan, quickly becoming a love interest for Pete Callan. She was later joined by her younger sister Lucy (Julia Lee Smith) and their mother Eileen (Rosie Rowell). After Charlotte&#x27;s departure, Eileen and Lucy continued in the series, becoming involved in several highly dramatic events. Eileen soon became Pete Callan&#x27;s fourth wife after his divorce from Siobhan.

Peter England joined as Ben Galloway, who lived in the halfway house and worked in Roy Farmer&#x27;s Internet café. Ben&#x27;s storyline progressed to a point where Ben admitted he was gay and shared the first gay kiss on British daytime TV.

Meanwhile, Yasmin and Benji&#x27;s aunt Pearl moved away, and a guilt-racked Siobhan Callan endured prison and a lengthy court case after being framed for Josh&#x27;s murder. She was eventually released and returned to Charnham, where she and others slowly began to piece the truth together, although nothing could be proved and Pete got away with the murder. Siobhan departed in 2002, after Pete caused a car crash that injured her killed Kate Matherson (Mary Stockley).

Robert Davenport had a one-night stand with Geri, after which she accused him of rape. He went to trial but was acquitted. The stress led to the break-up of his marriage, resulting in Ginny moving to France with Jessica. Jude Davenport also moved away.

===2003 cast revamp===
In September 2003, another drastic cast revamp occurred as new series producer Alison Davis arrived, presented with the task of finally getting viewing figures up to an acceptable standard.

Paul Webb left after his portrayer, Martin Delaney, left the series to take a role in New Zealand serial &quot;Shortland Street&quot;. Following Paul&#x27;s departure all members of the related Webb, Warrington and Ellis families were gradually phased out.

Robert Davenport and co-worker Fern Farmer were killed when a runaway car ploughed into the shopfront of Robert&#x27;s catering business. The driver was Dave Matthews&#x27; recently arrived stepson Jake Walker (Seb Castang), who lost control of the stolen car during a police chase following a botched deal by Gabriel Drummond. The biggest casualty of Davis&#x27;s arrival was the show&#x27;s only remaining original character, Roy Farmer, who was killed in a fire at his Internet café business.

These departures left just a handful of old characters on board, with Pete, Sadie, Yasmin, Cat and the returning Dave as the only pre-2002 characters remaining in the show (Pete had joined in 1997, the others in late-1998). Pete was now the show&#x27;s longest-serving character. Pete and Eileen Day had married, although she had actually married him for strategic reasons in a long-term plan for revenge. In league with the sinister Mike Shaw (Tony O&#x27;Callaghan), Eileen had started the fire that killed Roy, in an attempt to frame Pete for arson. No one knew Roy was inside when the fire was set; when Pete was arrested, the charge was arson &quot;and&quot; murder. Pete was sent to prison on remand and was absent for many months, seen in isolated episodes where other characters visited him in prison. He eventually returned to the storyline with his trial, ending in his acquittal, return to Charnham and to running the pub with Eileen, who had become licensee while he was in custody.

On Pete&#x27;s first day back, one of his tasks was to dispose of Mike Shaw&#x27;s corpse; in an incident, somewhat similar to the death of Josh Matthews, Mike was accidentally killed by Pete&#x27;s stepdaughter Lucy after he had tried to rape Eileen. Sam Taylor (Leon Ockenden), Eileen&#x27;s son from a previous relationship with Mike, arrived. Pete secretly learned that Eileen and Mike had set the fire in an attempt to frame him for arson, and he plotted a slow and satisfying revenge against Eileen.

Another series of new characters were brought in to remould &quot;Family Affairs&quot; once again. Gary Costello (Gary Webster), a businessman who lost his fortune in a failed business deal, was forced to move from Chigwell to the comparatively modest Stanley Street, much to the shame and embarrassment of his snobbish, socialite wife Chrissie (Kazia Pelka). Their daughters Melanie (Rebecca Hunter) and Chloe (Leah Coombes), were more concerned about leaving behind their school friends. They were later joined by Gary&#x27;s dependable mother Myra (Kate Williams).

The fractious Boulter family opened a restaurant on the site of Roy&#x27;s destroyed café. Moody, judgemental Les and his nurturing wife Denise harboured a secret about a long-ago affair. Their son Brendan was a closeted bisexual; their teenage daughter was the bright Kelly. Also moving in was nurse Tanya Woods (Carol Starks) and her gay best friend Sean Steel (Sam Barriscale). Doug MacKenzie (Gareth Hale) became Cat Webb&#x27;s third husband, while his womanising son Marc (Michael Wildman; later Graham Bryan) married Yasmin. Doug&#x27;s younger son and Marc&#x27;s half-brother Justin (Ryan Davenport) provided comic relief as the local clown. He and Kelly Boulter had a romance that led to an unplanned pregnancy. Kelly went on to have the child, and the couple began living together.

===Later storylines===
With the new cast members in place, storylines in 2004 focused on the new characters through several major storylines. During one of many marital upsets in the Costello household, daughter Chloe retreated upstairs and rifled through older sister Melanie&#x27;s possessions, only to find a stash of MDMA; she subsequently took several of the pills and wound up in hospital. Tests revealed the source of the illness, but also suggested she might also have cancer, and further tests were ordered. In the public outpouring of sympathy and support for the family, Chrissie finally found acceptance in the neighbourhood. When tests showed Chloe did not have cancer, Chrissie kept it quiet and convinced Chloe to maintain a pretence of illness as a &quot;little game&quot;. Unfortunately, the lie took hold, leading to many months of Chrissie deceiving the community and her own family, convincing everyone that Chloe was undergoing chemotherapy. When Eileen Callan saw them out shopping when Chloe was purportedly in hospital, and after picking up on other hints, she voiced her suspicion that Chrissie was faking Chloe&#x27;s illness. The community was aghast and ostracized Eileen for several weeks. Chrissie&#x27;s pretence continued for a few more weeks, until a suspicious Tanya removed Chloe&#x27;s bandages to reveal that there were no injection wounds at all.

Tanya herself was pregnant to Sean; as platonic friends with little prospect of parenthood presenting itself, they planned to become parents together and Tanya underwent in vitro fertilisation. Brendan Boulter became engaged to Melanie Costello married her while conducting an affair with Sean. Denise Boulter had been largely ostracised by her outraged daughter and husband after the truth about her long-ago affair came to light. However, they eventually reconciled their differences, although Brendan would leave town to escape his own problems.

Gary and Chrissie&#x27;s marriage had faltered, leading to their separation, but the family endured its lowest ebb when Chloe Costello was sexually abused by family friend Bradley Foster (Harry Capehorn). The Boulter&#x27;s marriage was again tested when Denise was raped by an unseen assailant, accusing local taxi driver Graham Harker (Lee Warburton) of the crime despite a total lack of evidence, and the Boulter family began hounding him to seek revenge. Graham started a romance with Melanie, who became his sole supporter.

Gary and Chrissie Costello reconciled and Gary proposed on Christmas Eve 2004. Melanie had earlier refused to attend their remarriage ceremony due to clashes with her parents over her relationship with Graham; on the day of the ceremony, Melanie learned that their suspicions had been correct and that he was a dangerous rapist, when he held her captive in his flat. Melanie was able to enlist Denise&#x27;s help escaping from Graham. These events would see him brought to justice, although repercussions from these events would also lead to the Boulter&#x27;s marriage disintegrating, and Les and Denise both leaving Charnham.

At The Black Swan, psychotic Trish Wallace (Gabrielle Glaister) emerged as a recurring villain capable of rivalling Pete Callan. An unnerved Eileen was being blackmailed by someone who threatened to reveal to Pete that Eileen had framed him for arson; Pete already knew this, and the Callans endured several tumultuous plot twists as they schemed and plotted against each other. This culminated in the 2000th episode in late-2004, when Pete threw Eileen into the River Thames. Pete&#x27;s eventual comeuppance followed an armed showdown between Pete, Trish and Eileen in September 2005. Pete was shot dead after a shootout with S019 Officers, in a final act of suicide by cop.

Several other characters, including Sadie, Dave and Lucy, were written out of the series as Alison Davis ended her reign, to be replaced by ex-&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; producer Sean O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor quickly outlined his plans for the show, including a name change and many younger, more glamorous characters (which threatened to turn the soap into a &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; clone). However, his plans were cut short by the announcement that Channel 5 would not be renewing the series for 2006. This timing resulted in numerous barely-known characters populating the final episode.

===Final episode===
The final episode of &quot;Family Affairs&quot; was broadcast on 30 December 2005 in the UK, and on 29 June 2006 in Australia and New Zealand. 1.3 million people tuned in to watch the final in the UK.

The episode revolved mainly around the lead up to the Stanley Street New Year&#x27;s Eve party and the wedding of newcomers Nathan and Eve Fletcher. Eileen Callan returned and announced she had won the lottery and was now very wealthy. Eileen sold The Black Swann to Rex Randell and bought a house for the Costello family. Yasmin and Damian kissed and announced they were a couple. Dr Hector Price and George finally became a couple after a falling out with nurse and flatmate Meredith. Babs Woods&#x27; long-time boyfriend Howard returned.

Hester is murdered by her brother, Rex Randell, after his barmaid Katie saw footage of Rex murdering his late wife. After the murder, Rex faced up to Katie; the outcome of the showdown was not shown. Doug split from his long-term wife Cat.

The final scene saw most of the other characters celebrating the New Year.

==Cast and characters==
==Storylines==

The show generally concentrated on family-based storylines and marital upsets, although more extreme storylines involving murder, rape, prostitution, blackmail, drug use, and brother-sister incestuous relationships have also occurred. Perhaps, most significantly, &quot;Family Affairs&quot; has often been acclaimed for its constant inclusion of minority groups, having featured a higher density of gay and lesbian characters over its history than any other British soap. It has also been praised for its treatment and integration of characters from ethnic minorities, notable examples of which include the inimitable Yasmin, who had been with the show for seven years at its final episode in December, and the more recent addition of a gay Muslim character, Sami Shafiq (Hosh Kane).

&quot;Family Affairs&quot; also went to unprecedented lengths in its treatment of the controversial issue of child abuse; in 2005, the soap won its first British Soap Award for a storyline in which young Chloe Costello (Leah Coombes) was sexually abused by a family friend, Bradley Foster (Harry Capehorn). The storyline, backed by the NSPCC, aimed to destroy some unhelpful stereotypes about what most expect a paedophile to be like. Partly, as a result of the storyline, Kazia Pelka, who played Chloe&#x27;s mother Chrissy, also won the award for Best Dramatic Performance, culminating in a double victory for the show.

==Production notes==
Prior to the establishment of the outdoor Stanley Street set, most of the location footage was shot in West London. The Lock and its surrounding areas were filmed at Yeading Marina, shots of the town centre of Charnham were in Uxbridge, and wooded areas featured Ruislip, Denham and Iver among others. The houses seen in exterior shots were in Hayes, Uxbridge, and other parts of west London. The early episodes feature scenes shot near Wharncliffe Viaduct, a railway viaduct in Hanwell, west London.

Several episodes made heavy use of the police station sets of ITV1&#x27;s police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, made by the same TV production company. The words &quot;Sun Hill&quot; were removed from the front of the police station for the &quot;Family Affairs&quot; shoot. The hospital sets used for St Hugh&#x27;s on &quot;The Bill&quot; were also used to represent hospital St. David&#x27;s in &quot;Family Affairs&quot;.

<text>Spencer Perceval (1 November 1762 – 11 May 1812) was a British statesman and barrister who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1809 until his assassination in May 1812. He is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated, and the only solicitor-general or attorney-general to have become prime minister.

The younger son of The Earl of Egmont, an Anglo-Irish earl, Perceval was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, practised as a barrister on the Midland circuit, and in 1796 became a King&#x27;s Counsel. He entered politics at age 33 as a member of Parliament (MP) for Northampton. A follower of William Pitt the Younger, Perceval always described himself as a &quot;friend of Mr. Pitt&quot;, rather than a Tory. He was opposed to Catholic emancipation and reform of Parliament; he supported the war against Napoleon and the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.

After a late entry into politics, his rise to power was rapid; he was appointed as Solicitor General and then Attorney General for England and Wales in the Addington ministry, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons in the second Portland ministry, and then became prime minister in 1809. At the head of a weak government, Perceval faced a number of crises during his term in office, including an inquiry into the Walcheren expedition, the mental illness and incapacity of King George III, economic depression, and Luddite riots. He overcame those crises, successfully pursued the Peninsular War in the face of opposition defeatism, and won the support of the Prince Regent. His position was stronger by early 1812, when in the lobby of the House of Commons, he was assassinated by John Bellingham, a merchant with a grievance against his government. Bellingham was hanged one week later.

Perceval had four older brothers who survived to adulthood. Through expiry of their male-line, male heirs, the earldom of Egmont passed to one of his great-grandsons in the early 20th century and became extinct in 2011.

==Childhood and education==

Perceval was born in Audley Square, Mayfair, London, the seventh son of the 2nd Earl of Egmont; he was the second son of the Earl&#x27;s second marriage. His mother, Catherine Compton, Baroness Arden, was a granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Northampton. Spencer was a Compton family name; Catherine Compton&#x27;s great-uncle Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, had been prime minister.

His father, a political adviser to Frederick, Prince of Wales and King George III, served briefly in the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty. Perceval&#x27;s early childhood was spent at Charlton House, which his father had taken to be near Woolwich Dockyard.

Lord Egmont, Perceval&#x27;s father, died when he was eight. Perceval went to Harrow School, where he was a disciplined and hard-working pupil. It was at Harrow that he developed an interest in evangelical Anglicanism and formed what was to be a lifelong friendship with Dudley Ryder. After five years at Harrow, he followed his older brother Charles to Trinity College, Cambridge. There he won the declamation prize in English and graduated in 1782.

==Legal career and marriage==

As the second son of a second marriage, Perceval had an allowance of just £200 a year and, without the prospect of inherited wealth, had to make his own way in life. He chose the law as a profession, studied at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and was called to the bar in 1786. Perceval&#x27;s mother had died in 1783. Perceval and his brother Charles, now Lord Arden, rented a house in Charlton, where they fell in love with two sisters who were living in the Percevals&#x27; old childhood home. The sisters&#x27; father, Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, approved of the match between his eldest daughter Margaretta and Lord Arden, who was wealthy and already a Member of Parliament and a Lord of the Admiralty. Perceval, who was at that time an impecunious barrister on the Midland Circuit, was told to wait until the younger daughter, Jane, came of age in three years&#x27; time. When Jane reached 21, in 1790, Perceval&#x27;s career was still not prospering, and Sir Thomas still opposed the marriage. The couple eloped and married by special licence in East Grinstead. They set up home together in lodgings over a carpet shop in Bedford Row, later moving to Lindsey House, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields.

Perceval&#x27;s family connections obtained a number of positions for him: Deputy Recorder of Northampton, and commissioner of bankrupts in 1790; surveyor of the Maltings and clerk of the irons in the mint– a sinecure worth £119 a year – in 1791; and counsel to the Board of Admiralty in 1794. He acted as junior counsel for the Crown in the trial of Thomas Paine for seditious libel (1792), and the prosecution of John Horne Tooke for high treason (1794). Perceval joined the London and Westminster Light Horse Volunteers in 1794 when the country was under threat of invasion by France and served with them until 1803.

Perceval wrote anonymous pamphlets in favour of the impeachment of Warren Hastings, and in defence of public order against sedition. These pamphlets brought him to the attention of William Pitt the Younger, and in 1795 he was offered the appointment of Chief Secretary for Ireland. He declined the offer. He could earn more as a barrister and needed the money to support his growing family. In 1796 he became a King&#x27;s Counsel at the age of 33 and had an income of about £1,000 a year ().

==Early political career: 1796–1801==
In 1796, Perceval&#x27;s uncle, the 8th Earl of Northampton, died. Perceval&#x27;s cousin Charles Compton, who was MP for Northampton, succeeded to the earldom and took his place in the House of Lords. Perceval was invited to stand for election in his place. In the May by-election, Perceval was elected unopposed. Weeks later, he had to defend his seat in a fiercely contested general election. Northampton had an electorate of about 1,000 – every male householder not in receipt of poor relief had a vote – and the town had a strong radical tradition. Perceval stood for the Castle Ashby interest, Edward Bouverie for the Whigs, and William Walcot for the corporation. After a disputed count, Perceval and Bouverie were returned. Perceval represented Northampton until his death 16 years later, and is the only MP for Northampton to have held the office of prime minister. 1796 was his first and last contested election; in the general elections of 1802, 1806 and 1807, Perceval and Bouverie were returned unopposed.

When Perceval took his seat in the House of Commons in September 1796, his political views were already formed. &quot;He was for the constitution and Pitt; he was against Fox and France&quot;, wrote his biographer Denis Gray. During the 1796–1797 session, he made several speeches, always reading from notes. His public speaking skills had been sharpened at the Crown and Rolls debating society when he was a law student. After taking his seat in the House of Commons, Perceval continued with his legal practice, as MPs did not receive a salary, and the House only sat for a part of the year. During the Parliamentary recess of the summer of 1797, he was senior counsel for the Crown in the prosecution of John Binns for sedition. Binns, who was defended by Samuel Romilly, was found not guilty. The fees from his legal practice allowed Perceval to take out a lease on a country house, Belsize House in Hampstead.

It was during the next session of Parliament, in January 1798, that Perceval established his reputation as a debater – and his prospects as a future minister – with a speech in support of the Assessed Taxes Bill (a bill to increase the taxes on houses, windows, male servants, horses and carriages, in order to finance the war against France). He used the occasion to mount an attack on Charles Fox and his demands for reform. Pitt described the speech as one of the best he had ever heard, and later that year Perceval was appointed to the post of Solicitor to the Ordnance.

==Solicitor and attorney general: 1801–1806==
Pitt resigned in 1801 when both George III and the Cabinet opposed his bill for Catholic emancipation. As Perceval shared the King&#x27;s views on Catholic emancipation, he did not feel obliged to follow Pitt into opposition. His career continued to prosper during Henry Addington&#x27;s administration. He was appointed solicitor general in 1801 and attorney general the following year. Perceval did not agree with Addington&#x27;s general policies (especially on foreign policy), and confined himself to speeches on legal issues. He was retained in the position of attorney general when Addington resigned, and Pitt formed his second ministry in 1804. As attorney general, Perceval was involved with the prosecution of radicals Edward Despard and William Cobbett, but was also responsible for more liberal decisions on trade unions, and for improving the conditions of convicts transported to New South Wales.

When Pitt died in January 1806, Perceval was an emblem bearer at his funeral. Although he had little money to spare (by now he had 11 children), he contributed £1,000 towards a fund to pay off Pitt&#x27;s debts. He resigned as attorney general, refusing to serve in Lord Grenville&#x27;s Ministry of All the Talents, as it included Fox. Instead he became the leader of the Pittite opposition in the House of Commons.

During his period in opposition, Perceval used his legal skills to defend Princess Caroline, the estranged wife of the Prince of Wales, during the &quot;delicate investigation&quot;. The princess had been accused of giving birth to an illegitimate child, and the Prince of Wales ordered an inquiry, hoping to obtain evidence for a divorce. The government inquiry found that the main accusation was untrue (the child in question had been adopted by the princess), but it was critical of the behaviour of the princess. The opposition sprang to her defence and Perceval became her adviser, drafting a 156-page letter to King George III in her support. Known as , it was described by Perceval&#x27;s biographer as &quot;the last and greatest production of his legal career&quot;. When the King refused to let Caroline return to court, Perceval threatened publication of &quot;The Book&quot;, but Grenville&#x27;s ministry fell – again over a difference of opinion with the King on the Catholic question – before &quot;The Book&quot; could be distributed. As a member of the new government, Perceval drafted a cabinet minute acquitting Caroline on all charges and recommending her return to court. He had a bonfire of &quot;The Book&quot; at Lindsey House, and large sums of government money were spent on buying back stray copies. A few remained at large and &quot;The Book&quot; was published soon after his death.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1807–1809==
On the resignation of Grenville, the Duke of Portland put together a ministry of Pittites and asked Perceval to become Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. Perceval would have preferred to remain attorney general or become Home Secretary, and pleaded ignorance of financial affairs. He agreed to take the position when the salary (smaller than that of the Home Office) was augmented by the Duchy of Lancaster. Lord Hawkesbury (later Liverpool) recommended Perceval to the King by explaining that he came from an old English family and shared the King&#x27;s views on the Catholic question.

Perceval&#x27;s youngest child, Ernest Augustus, was born soon after Perceval became chancellor (Princess Caroline was godmother). Jane Perceval became ill after the birth and the family moved out of the damp and draughty Belsize House, spending a few months in Lord Teignmouth&#x27;s house in Clapham before finding a suitable country house in Ealing. Perceval paid £7,500 for the 17th century Elm Grove in 1808 (borrowing from his brother Lord Arden and the trustees of Jane&#x27;s dowry), and the Perceval family&#x27;s long association with Ealing began. Meanwhile, in town, Perceval had moved from Lindsey House into 10 Downing Street, when the Duke of Portland moved back to Burlington House shortly after becoming prime minister.

One of Perceval&#x27;s first tasks in Cabinet was to expand the Orders in Council that had been brought in by the previous administration and were designed to restrict the trade of neutral countries with France, in retaliation to Napoleon&#x27;s embargo on British trade. He was also responsible for ensuring that Wilberforce&#x27;s bill on the abolition of the slave trade, which had still not passed its final stages in the House of Lords when Grenville&#x27;s ministry fell, would not &quot;fall between the two ministries&quot; and be rejected in a snap division. Perceval was one of the founding members of the African Institute, which was set up in April 1807 to safeguard the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act.

As Chancellor of the Exchequer, Perceval had to raise money to finance the war against Napoleon. This he managed to do in his budgets of 1808 and 1809 without increasing taxes, by raising loans at reasonable rates and making economies. As leader of the House of Commons, he had to deal with a strong opposition, which challenged the government over the conduct of the war, Catholic emancipation, corruption, and Parliamentary reform. Perceval successfully defended the commander-in-chief of the army, the Duke of York, against charges of corruption when the Duke&#x27;s ex-mistress Mary Anne Clarke claimed to have sold army commissions with his knowledge. Although Parliament voted to acquit the Duke of the main charge, his conduct was criticised, and he accepted Perceval&#x27;s advice to resign. (He was reinstated in 1811).

== Prime Minister: 1809–1812 ==
Portland&#x27;s ministry contained three future prime-ministers – Perceval, Lord Hawkesbury and George Canning – as well as another two of the 19th-century&#x27;s great statesmen: Lord Eldon and Lord Castlereagh. But Portland was not a strong leader and his health was failing. The country was plunged into political crisis in the summer of 1809 as Canning schemed against Castlereagh, and the Duke of Portland resigned following a stroke. Negotiations began to find a new prime minister: Canning wanted to be either prime minister or nothing; Perceval was prepared to serve under a third person, but not under Canning. The remnants of the cabinet decided to invite Lord Grey and Lord Grenville to form &quot;an extended and combined administration&quot; in which Perceval was hoping for the home secretaryship. But Grenville and Grey refused to enter into negotiations, and the King accepted the Cabinet&#x27;s recommendation of Perceval for his new prime minister.

Perceval kissed the King&#x27;s hands on 4 October and set about forming his cabinet. The task was made more difficult by the fact that both Castlereagh and Canning had ruled themselves out of consideration by fighting a duel. Having received five refusals for the office, Perceval had to serve as his own Chancellor of the Exchequer – characteristically declining to accept the salary.

The new ministry was not expected to last. It was especially weak in the Commons, where Perceval had only one cabinet member– Home Secretary Richard Ryder – and had to rely on the support of backbenchers in debate. In the first week of the new Parliamentary session in January 1810 the government lost four divisions, one on a motion for an inquiry into the Walcheren Expedition (in which, the previous summer, a military force intending to seize Antwerp had instead withdrawn after losing many men to an epidemic on the island of Walcheren off the Dutch coast) and three on the composition of the finance committee. The government survived the inquiry into the Walcheren Expedition at the cost of the resignation of the expedition&#x27;s leader Lord Chatham. The radical MP Sir Francis Burdett was committed to the Tower of London for having published a letter in William Cobbett&#x27;s &quot;Political Register&quot; which denounced the government&#x27;s exclusion of the press from the inquiry. It took three days, owing to various blunders, to execute the warrant for Burdett&#x27;s arrest. The mob took to the streets in support of Burdett and troops were called out. As Chancellor, Perceval continued to find the funds to finance Wellington&#x27;s campaign in the Iberian Peninsula, whilst contracting a lower debt than his predecessors or successors.
King George III had celebrated his Golden Jubilee in 1809; by the following autumn he was showing signs of a return of the illness that had led to the threat of a Regency in 1788. The prospect of a Regency was not attractive to Perceval, as the Prince of Wales was known to favour Whigs and disliked Perceval for the part he had played in the &quot;delicate investigation&quot;. Twice Parliament was adjourned in November 1810, as doctors gave optimistic reports about the King&#x27;s chances of a return to health. In December select committees of the Lords and Commons heard evidence from the doctors, and Perceval finally wrote to the Prince of Wales on 19 December saying that he planned the next day to introduce a regency bill. As with Pitt&#x27;s bill in 1788, there would be restrictions: the regent&#x27;s powers to create peers and award offices and pensions would be restricted for 12 months, Queen Charlotte would be responsible for the care of the King, and the King&#x27;s private property would be looked after by trustees. The Prince of Wales, supported by the Opposition, objected to the restrictions, but Perceval steered the bill through Parliament. Everyone had expected the Regent to change his ministers but, surprisingly, he chose to retain his old enemy Perceval. The official reason given by the Regent was that he did not wish to do anything to aggravate his father&#x27;s illness. The King assented to the Regency Bill on 5 February, the Regent took the royal oath the following day and Parliament formally opened for the 1811 session. The session was largely taken up with problems in Ireland, the bullion controversy in England (a bill was passed to make bank notes legal tender), and military operations in the Peninsula.

When the restrictions on the Regency expired in February 1812, the King still showed no signs of recovery, and the Prince Regent decided, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Grey and Grenville to join the government, to retain Perceval and his ministers. Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, after intrigues with the Prince Regent, resigned as foreign secretary and was replaced by Castlereagh. The opposition meanwhile was mounting an attack on the Orders in Council, which had caused a crisis in relations with the United States and were widely blamed for depression and unemployment in England. Rioting had broken out in the Midlands and Northern England, and been harshly repressed. Henry Brougham&#x27;s motion for a select committee was defeated in the Commons, but, under continuing pressure from manufacturers, the government agreed to set up a Committee of the Whole House to consider the Orders in Council and their impact on trade and manufacture. The committee began its examination of witnesses in early May 1812.

== Assassination ==

At 5:15 pm, on the evening of 11 May 1812, Perceval was on his way to attend the inquiry into the Orders in Council. As he entered the lobby of the House of Commons, a man stepped forward, drew a pistol and shot him in the chest. Perceval fell to the floor, after uttering something that was variously heard as &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;oh my God&quot;. They were his last words. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.

At first it was feared that the shot might signal the start of an uprising, but it soon became apparent that the assassin – who had made no attempt to escape – was a man with an obsessive grievance against the government and had acted alone. He was John Bellingham, a merchant who believed he had been unjustly imprisoned in Russia and was entitled to compensation from the government, but all his petitions had been rejected. Perceval&#x27;s body was laid on a sofa in the speaker&#x27;s drawing room and removed to Number 10 in the early hours of 12 May. That same morning an inquest was held at the Cat and Bagpipes public house on the corner of Downing Street and a verdict of willful murder was returned.

Perceval left a widow and 12 children aged between three and 20, and there were soon rumours that he had not left them well provided for. He had just £106 5s 1d in the bank when he died. A few days after his death, Parliament voted to settle £50,000 on Perceval&#x27;s children, with additional annuities for his widow and eldest son. Perceval&#x27;s widow married Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Carr, brother of the Reverend Robert James Carr, then vicar of Brighton, in 1815 and was widowed again six years later. She died aged 74 in 1844.

Perceval was buried on 16 May 1812 in the Egmont vault at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Charlton, London. At his widow&#x27;s request, it was a private funeral. Lord Eldon, Lord Liverpool, Lord Harrowby and Richard Ryder were the pall-bearers. The previous day, Bellingham had been tried, and, refusing to enter a plea of insanity, was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging on 18 May.

==Legacy==
Perceval was a small, slight, and very pale man, who usually dressed in black. Lord Eldon called him &quot;Little P&quot;. He never sat for a full-sized portrait; likenesses are either miniatures or are based on a death mask by Joseph Nollekens. Perceval was the last British prime minister to wear a powdered wig tied in a queue, and knee-breeches according to the old-fashioned style of the 18th century. He is sometimes referred to as one of Britain&#x27;s forgotten prime ministers, remembered only for the manner of his death. Although not considered an inspirational leader, he is generally seen as a devout, industrious, principled man who at the head of a weak government steered the country through difficult times. A contemporary MP Henry Grattan, used a naval analogy to describe Perceval: &quot;He is not a ship-of-the-line, but he carries many guns, is tight-built and is out in all weathers&quot;. Perceval&#x27;s modern biographer, Denis Gray, described him as &quot;a herald of the Victorians&quot;.

Perceval was mourned by many; Lord Chief Justice Sir James Mansfield wept during his summing up to the jury at Bellingham&#x27;s trial. However, in some quarters he was unpopular and in Nottingham the crowds that gathered following his assassination were in a more cheerful mood. Public monuments to Perceval were erected in Northampton, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and in Westminster Abbey. The memorial in Westminster Abbey, by the sculptor Richard Westmacott, has an effigy of the dead Perceval with mourning figures representing Truth, Temperance and Power in front of a relief depicting the aftermath of the assassination in the House of Commons. Four biographies have been published: a book on his life and administration by Charles Verulam Williams, which appeared soon after his death; his grandson Spencer Walpole&#x27;s biography in 1894; Philip Treherne&#x27;s short biography in 1909; Denis Gray&#x27;s 500-page political biography in 1963. In addition, there are three books about his assassination, one by Mollie Gillen, one by David Hanrahan, and the latest by Andro Linklater entitled &quot;Why Spencer Perceval Had to Die&quot;.

Perceval&#x27;s assassination inspired poems such as &quot;Universal sympathy on the martyr&#x27;d statesman&quot; (1812):

One of Perceval&#x27;s most noted critics, especially on the question of Catholic emancipation, was the cleric Sydney Smith. In &quot;Peter Plymley&#x27;s Letters&quot; Smith writes:
If I lived at Hampstead upon stewed meats and claret; if I walked to church every Sunday before eleven young gentlemen of my own begetting, with their faces washed, and their hair pleasingly combed; if the Almighty had blessed me with every earthly comfort–how awfully would I pause before I sent forth the flame and the sword over the cabins of the poor, brave, generous, open-hearted peasants of Ireland!
American historian Henry Adams suggested that it was this picture of Perceval that stayed in the minds of Liberals for a whole generation.

In July 2014, a memorial plaque was unveiled in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall of the Houses of Parliament, close to where he was killed. The plaque had been proposed by Michael Ellis, Conservative MP for Northampton North (parts of which Perceval once represented).

In streets in Northampton and Northamptonshire his name is memorialised as it is by the main streets set back behind two sides of Northampton Square, London: Spencer and Percival Streets.

== Family ==
Spencer and Jane Perceval had 13 children, of whom 12 survived to adulthood. Four of the daughters never married, and lived together all their lives. During their mother&#x27;s life, they lived with her in Elm Grove, Ealing; after her death, the sisters moved to nearby Pitzhanger Manor House, while their brother Spencer took over Elm Grove. Cousin marriage was common: the remaining two daughters and two of the sons took this path.

# Jane (1791–1824) married her cousin Edward Perceval, son of Lord Arden, in 1821 and lived in Felpham, Sussex. She died three years after marrying, apparently in childbirth.
# Frances (1792–1877) lived with three unmarried sisters (Maria, Louisa and Frederica) at Pitzhanger Manor, Ealing from 1843.
# Maria (1794–1877) lived with her three unmarried sisters.
# Spencer (1795–1859) was, like his father, educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. After Perceval&#x27;s assassination, Spencer junior was voted an annuity of £1,000 (), free legal training at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and a tellership of the Exchequer, all of which left him financially secure. He became a Member of Parliament at the age of 22 and in 1821 married Anna, a daughter of the chief of the clan Macleod, with whom he had eleven children. He joined the Catholic Apostolic Church and was created an apostle in 1833. He served as a metropolitan lunacy commissioner.
# Charles (born and died 1796)
# Frederick James (1797–1861) was the only one of Perceval&#x27;s sons not to go to Harrow. Due to his fragile health he was sent to school at Rottingdean. He married for the first time in 1827, spent some time in Ghent, Belgium, was a director of the Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Society and a justice of the peace for Middlesex and for Kent, but generally led a quiet and retired life. Widowed in 1843, he married for the second time the following year. A grandson, Frederick Joseph Trevelyan Perceval, who was a Canadian rancher, became the 10th &quot;de jure&quot; Earl of Egmont (he did not claim the title) and was the father of the 11th earl.
# Rev. Henry (1799–1885) was educated at Harrow, where he was the only Perceval to become head of school. He went to Brasenose College, Oxford. In 1826 he married his cousin Catherine Drummond. For 46 years Henry was the rector of Elmley Lovett in Worcestershire.
# Dudley Montague (1800–1856) was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford. Like his brother Spencer, he was given free legal training at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn but was not called to the bar. He spent two years as an administrator at the Cape of Good Hope, where he married a daughter of Gen. Sir Richard Bourke, future Governor of New South Wales, in 1827. Back in England he obtained a treasury post and defended his father&#x27;s reputation after it was attacked in Napier&#x27;s history of the Peninsular War. In 1853 he stood unsuccessfully against William Gladstone in the election for an MP to represent Oxford University.
# Isabella (1801–1886) married her cousin Spencer Horatio Walpole in 1835 and was the only one of Perceval&#x27;s daughters to have children. Her husband was a lawyer who became an MP in 1846 and served as Home Secretary. They lived in the Hall on Ealing Green, next-door to Isabella&#x27;s four unmarried sisters.
# John Thomas (1803–1876) was educated at Harrow. After a three-year career as an officer in the Grenadier Guards and a term at Oxford University, he spent three years in asylums and became a campaigner for reform of the Lunacy Laws. In 1832, just after his release from an asylum, he married a cheesemonger&#x27;s daughter.
# Louisa (1804–1891) lived with her three unmarried sisters.
# Frederica (1805–1900) lived with her three unmarried sisters. In her will she left money to build All Saints Church, Ealing, in memory of her father (he was born on All Saints Day). It is also known as the Spencer Perceval Memorial Church.
# Ernest Augustus (1807–1896) was educated at Harrow. He spent nine years in the 15th Hussars, seven of them as a captain. In 1830, he married his cousin Beatrice Trevelyan, daughter of Sir John Trevelyan, 5th Baronet. The couple settled in Somerset and raised a large family, including antiquary Spencer George Perceval. Ernest served as private secretary to the Home Office on three occasions.

<text>The Convention of Peking or First Convention of Peking is an agreement comprising three distinct unequal treaties concluded between the Qing dynasty of China and Great Britain, France, and the Russian Empire in 1860.

==Background==
On 18 October 1860, at the culmination of the Second Opium War, the British and French troops entered the Forbidden City in Peking. Following the decisive defeat of the Chinese, Prince Gong was compelled to sign two treaties on behalf of the Qing government with Lord Elgin and Baron Gros, who represented Britain and France respectively. Although Russia had not been a belligerent, Prince Gong also signed a treaty with Nikolay Ignatyev.

The original plan was to burn down the Forbidden City as punishment for the mistreatment of Anglo-French prisoners by Qing officials. Because doing so would jeopardize the treaty signing, the plan shifted to burning the Old Summer Palace and Summer Palace instead. The treaties with France and Britain were signed in the Ministry of Rites building immediately south of the Forbidden City on 24 October 1860.

==Terms==
In the convention, the Xianfeng Emperor ratified the Treaty of Tientsin (1858).

In 1860, the area known as Kowloon was originally negotiated for lease in March, but in few months&#x27; time, the Convention of Peking ended the lease, and ceded the land formally to the British on 24 October.

Article 6 of the Convention between China and the United Kingdom stipulated that China was to cede the part of Kowloon Peninsula south of present-day Boundary Street, Kowloon, and Hong Kong (including Stonecutters Island) in perpetuity to Britain.

Article 6 of the Convention between China and France stipulated that &quot;the religious and charitable establishments which were confiscated from Christians during the persecutions of which they were victims shall be returned to their owners through the French Minister in China&quot;.

=== Manchuria ===
The treaty also confirmed the cession of the entirety of what is now known as Outer Manchuria to the Russian Empire, a total of 400,000 square kilometers, with Russia achieving the strategic goal of sealing off Chinese access to the Sea of Japan. It granted Russia the right to the Ussuri krai, a part of the modern day Primorye, the territory that corresponded with the ancient Manchu province of East Tartary. See Treaty of Aigun (1858), Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) and Sino-Russian border conflicts.

In addition to ceding territory that had been ruled by the Qing dynasty, the treaty also ceded territory under Korean jurisdiction, notably the island (by that time and currently a peninsula at the southernmost end of Primorsky Krai) of Noktundo. This was not known to the Koreans until the 1880s (20 or so years after the signing of the treaty, to which Korea was not a party), at which point it became a matter of official protest as the Koreans asserted that the Qing had no authority to cede Noktundo to Russia.

According to the Institute of Qing History the ceding of territory which created the modern border between Russia and North Korea and blocks China&#x27;s access to the Sea of Japan was caused as a result of mismanagement during the demarcation process: Article 1 of the 1860 Sino-Russian Peking Convention stipulates that the southeastern section of the Sino-Russian eastern border &quot;...from the mouth of the Bailing River along the mountains to the mouth of the Hubutu River, and then from the mouth of the Hubutu River along the Hunchun River and the ridge between the sea to the mouth of the Tumen River, the east belongs to Russia; the west belongs to China.&quot; In 1861, Chinese and Russian representatives signed the &quot;Sino-Russian Eastern Boundary Agreement: (), in which the border between the two countries is on the east bank of the Tumen River estuary and the Sea of Japan. The coast from the north-eastern bank of the lower reaches of the Tumen River to the coast of the Sea of Japan still belongs to China, where China separates Russia and Korea through the 3km wide Japanese coast. However, the &quot;Border Map from the Ussuri River to the Sea&quot; () document handed to China by Russia in 1862 shows that the border between the two countries is 20km north of the Tumen River estuary. This omission was allegedly caused by the director of the Ministry of Revenue Cheng Qi, who was serving as the special Chinese envoy for Sino-Russian border survey in 1861. Cheng Qi was addicted to opium and went to nearby Jilin City to replenish his drug stash, and entrusted the establishment of the border markers entirely to the Russian survey representatives. The Russian side took the opportunity to unilaterally draw a boundary map, thereby connecting Russia and the Korean Peninsula across the Tumen River, gaining a foothold for invading Korea, and blocking China&#x27;s passage to the Sea of Japan through the Tumen River. Cheng Qi was shortly fired from all official posts after the incident.

==Aftermath==

===Kowloon===
The governments of the United Kingdom and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) concluded the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong in 1984, under which the sovereignty of the leased territories, together with Hong Kong Island, ceded under the Treaty of Nanking (1842), and Kowloon Peninsula (south of Boundary Street), was to be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997.
===Noktundo===
The status of Noktundo, which had been under Korean jurisdiction from the turn of the 17th century but was (unbeknownst to the Koreans until the 1880s) ceded to Russia in the treaty, remains formally unresolved, as only one of two Korean jurisdictions/governments have accepted a border agreement with Russia. North Korea and the USSR signed a border treaty in 1985 officially certifying the Russian-North Korean border as running through the center of the Tumen River which left the now-peninsula of Noktundo on the Russian side of the border. This agreement is not recognized by South Korea, which has since demanded Noktundo&#x27;s return to Korean jurisdiction (ostensibly this would be North Korean jurisdiction, with the expectation of unified Korean control after an eventual Korean reunification).

<text>The humidex (short for humidity index) is an index number used by Canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to the average person, by combining the effect of heat and humidity. The term &quot;humidex&quot; was coined in 1965. The humidex is a nominally dimensionless quantity (though generally recognized by the public as equivalent to the degree Celsius) based on the dew point.

Range of humidex: Scale of comfort:

* 20 to 29: Little to no discomfort
* 30 to 39: Some discomfort
* 40 to 45: Great discomfort; avoid exertion
* Above 45: Dangerous; heat stroke quite possible

== History ==
The current formula for determining the humidex was developed by J. M. Masterton and F. A. Richardson of Canada&#x27;s Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979. Humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity, though both dew point and relative humidity (when used in conjunction with air temperature) are directly related to atmospheric moisture.

For a long time, the record humidex in Canada was set by Windsor, Ontario, which hit 52.1 on 20 June 1953, as reported by Environment Canada.

This value was beaten on 25 July 2007 when Carman, Manitoba, hit 52.6.

== Computation formula ==
When the temperature is and the dew point is , the humidex is 34. If the temperature remains and the dew point rises to , the humidex rises to 42. The humidex is higher than the U.S. heat index at equal temperature and relative humidity.

The humidex formula is as follows:

formula_1

where
* &quot;H&quot; denotes the Humidex
* &quot;T&quot;air is the air temperature in °C
* &quot;T&quot;dew is the dewpoint temperature in °C
* exp is the exponential function.

5417.7530 is a rounded constant based on the molecular weight of water, latent heat of evaporation, and the universal gas constant. The humidity adjustment approximately amounts to one Fahrenheit degree for every millibar by which the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere exceeds .

At the time the humidex was originally developed in 1965, Canada was still on the Fahrenheit scale, and thus the humidex was originally based on that. The 1979 reformulation, which added the 0.5555 factor (from the relation was largely to address metrication in Canada as the country switched to the Celsius scale.

<doc id="232878" wikidata="Q312569" url="?curid=232878" title="Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool">
<text>Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool (7 June 1770 – 4 December 1828) was a British Tory statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1827. Before becoming Prime Minister he had been Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. He held the constituency of Rye from 1790 until his elevation to the House of Lords in 1803, of which he was Leader from 1807 to 1827.

Liverpool&#x27;s fifteen years as Prime Minister saw the end of the Napoleonic Wars followed by a period of unrest and radicalism at home. During the first part of his premiership, repressive measures were taken to restore order at home, the Corn Laws were introduced and income tax was repealed. In the 1820s his leadership became more liberal, and the period saw a reform of the criminal law and prisons. Throughout his tenure as Prime Minister, Liverpool sought a compromise over the issue of Catholic emancipation. He resigned following a stroke in February 1827. Important events during Liverpool&#x27;s premiership included the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna, the 1812–1814 war with America, the Peterloo massacre, the Cato Street Conspiracy and the Queen Caroline affair.

Liverpool, known as Jenkinson until 1803 and as Hawkesbury from 1803 to 1808, was the son of Tory politician Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Christ Church, Oxford. Twice married, he had no children; on his death, the earldom passed to his younger half-brother.

==Early life==
Jenkinson was born on 7 June 1770, the son of politician Charles Jenkinson (who was later created the first Earl of Liverpool) and his first wife, Amelia Watts. Jenkinson&#x27;s 19-year-old mother, who was the daughter of senior East India Company official William Watts and his wife Frances Croke, died one month after his birth. Through his mother&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Isabella Beizor, Jenkinson was descended from Portuguese settlers in India, and he may also have had Indian ancestors. He was baptised on 29 June 1770 at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

Charles Jenkinson did not remarry until 1782, and as a small child Robert was looked after by his widowed paternal grandmother, Amarantha Jenkinson, in Winchester. Robert&#x27;s maternal aunt, Sophia Watts, and his paternal aunt Elizabeth, wife of Charles Wolfran Cornwall, were also involved in his early years. He briefly attended schools in Winchester and Chelsea before starting, aged nine, at Albion House preparatory school in Parsons Green.

When he was thirteen, Jenkinson became a boarder at his father&#x27;s old school, Charterhouse School, under the headmaster Samuel Berdmore. His father had ambitions of high office for him and exhorted him in letters to apply himself not just to his studies, but also to his appearance and personal habits. From Charterhouse, he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in April 1787. At university he was a sober and hardworking student. He formed what was to be a lifelong friendship with George Canning, although at times they would be political rivals. Together with a few other students, including Lord Henry Spencer, they set up a debating society in which Jenkinson would present the Tory and Canning the Whig point of view. Having spent a summer in Paris, where he witnessed the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, Jenkinson was created a Master of Arts at Oxford in May 1790.

== Early career (1790–1812)==

=== Member of Parliament ===
Jenkinson&#x27;s political career began when he was elected to two seats in the 1790 general election, Rye and Appleby. He chose to represent the former, and never sat for Appleby. Still under age when he was elected, he spent several months touring continental Europe and did not take up his seat for Rye until after his twenty-first birthday, near the end of the 1791 session.

He made his maiden speech in February 1792, giving the government&#x27;s reply to Samuel Whitbread&#x27;s critical motion on the government&#x27;s foreign policy. &quot;The Times&quot; praised it as &quot;able and learned; cloathed in the best language and delivered with all the powers and graces of oratory&quot;. Several speeches followed, including one opposing William Wilberforce&#x27;s motion to abolish Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade and one in opposition to an inquiry into the Priestley Riots.

After the 1792 parliamentary session ended in June, Jenkinson travelled to Koblenz, which was a centre for French émigrés. French newspapers accused him of being an agent of the government; &quot;The Times&quot; denied the rumours. His services as a capable speaker for the government were recognised in 1793 when he was appointed to the India Board. After the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition with France in 1793, Jenkinson became colonel of the Cinque Ports Light Dragoons, a fencible cavalry regiment, in 1794.

There was a rare conflict between Jenkinson and his father when he fell in love with Lady Louisa Hervey, daughter of the Earl of Bristol and his wife Elizabeth. Lord Bristol approved of the match and offered a £10,000 dowry, but Jenkinson&#x27;s father thought that Jenkinson should not marry before he was thirty unless it was to a fortune. He also objected to the Hervey family&#x27;s eccentricity and Whig connections, only relenting after the intervention of Pitt and George III. The couple married on 25 March 1795 at Wimbledon.

Jenkinson&#x27;s father was created Earl of Liverpool in May 1796, bringing Jenkinson the courtesy title of Lord Hawkesbury. The Cinque Ports Light Dragoons were posted to Scotland, where they provided a guard for the funeral of Robert Burns in 1796 and perpetrated the massacre of Tranent in 1797. Jenkinson was not present at the massacre, and &quot;was blamed for remaining at Haddington, as his presence might have prevented the outrages of the soldiery.&quot;. In March 1799 he became a Privy Councillor, member of the Board of Trade and master of the Royal Mint.

===Cabinet===

==== Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary ====
Hawkesbury, as he now was, obtained his first Cabinet position in 1801 when he became Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Henry Addington&#x27;s administration and was responsible for negotiating the Treaty of Amiens with France. In 1803 he was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Hawkesbury in order to support the government against Lord Grenville&#x27;s attacks. When Pitt returned to power in May 1804, Hawkesbury became Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Lords. After Pitt&#x27;s death in January 1806, the King asked Hawkesbury to form a government but he refused and instead was awarded the lucrative sinecure of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Following the resignation of Grenville in March 1807, Hawkesbury advised the King to ask the Duke of Portland to form a ministry and returned to his role as Home Secretary. In December 1808, on the death of his father, Hawkesbury became Lord Liverpool. Portland was more of a figurehead than the head of government. As a result of Portland&#x27;s weakness, the departments were left to themselves while the government was without a higher authority to smooth down differences between departments and arbitrate disagreements between ministers. The real figures of importance were a foursome of Pittites, consisting of Viscount Castlereagh, George Canning, Spencer Perceval and Lord Hawkesbury. The government was soon torn apart from inner disputes and rivalries. After the duel between Castlereagh and Canning, the government collapsed.

====War Secretary====
Liverpool accepted the position of Secretary of State for War and the Colonies when Spencer Perceval formed a ministry in November 1809. During his time in office, he ensured that the Cabinet gave sufficient support to the Peninsular War. In 1810, he was made a colonel of militia.

==Prime Minister (1812–1827)==
===Appointment===

Following the assassination of Spencer Perceval on 11 May 1812, the Cabinet proposed Liverpool as his successor, but James Stuart-Wortley moved a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons. The resolution was passed by four votes and Liverpool resigned, only to be reinstated when George, the Prince Regent, failed in his attempts to find an alternative. Liverpool was confirmed as Prime Minister on 8 June 1812.

Liverpool then assembled a Cabinet, with Viscount Castlereagh as Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons, Viscount Sidmouth at the Home Office, Nicholas Vansittart at the Exchequer and Bathurst at the War Office. Canning was offered a place in the Cabinet, but turned the offer down as he refused to serve under Castlereagh in the House of Commons. Liverpool&#x27;s first actions as Prime Minister were to cancel the Orders in Council in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the outbreak of war with the United States, and to assure the Prince Regent of the Cabinet&#x27;s neutrality on the question of Catholic emancipation. He then called a general election in October 1812 in order to increase the government majority in the House of Commons.

Liverpool chose not to move into Downing Street, instead dividing his time between his London home, Fife House, Whitehall, his modest country home at Coombe, Kingston upon Thames, and Walmer Castle.

===War===

The early years of Liverpool&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister saw the War of 1812 with the United States, which ended when The Treaty of Ghent was signed on 24 December 1814., and the final campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. After the downfall of Napoleon in April 1814, Liverpool was appointed to the Order of the Garter and London hosted the allied monarchs. Foreign Secretary Castlereagh was sent to the Congress of Vienna to negotiate the post-war terms of European settlement. In February 1815, Napoleon escaped from the Isle of Elba, where he had been exiled, and renewed his leadership of France until defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, nine days after the final act at the Congress of Vienna had been signed.

===Unrest at home===
Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the country experienced social and economic distress. In March 1815 Parliament passed an act forbidding the importation of wheat until the domestic price reached 80 shillings per quarter. Known as the corn law, the act protected the interests of landowners at the cost of increased bread prices. In 1816 the House of Commons voted to repeal the income tax that had been introduced to fund the war with France; Liverpool had argued that the tax should be retained in peacetime.

During the post-war years, unrest inspired by hardship or the desire for reform spread throughout the country and repressive measures were taken in response. After poor harvests led to rising bread prices, riots broke out in East Anglia in 1816. In Littleport a rioter was killed when troops opened fire and five rioters were subsequently executed. There was also a revival of Luddite activity. In November and December 1816, followers of Thomas Spence organised two meetings at Spa Fields in London at which the radical Henry Hunt was invited to speak. The second meeting was followed by the Spa Fields riots and an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Tower of London and Bank of England. The following month, the Prince Regent&#x27;s carriage window was broken in a possible assassination attempt. In response to these incidents, a measure to temporarily suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was passed by both Houses of Parliament.

On 16 August 1819, between 20,000 and 60,000 people gathered at St Peter&#x27;s Fields, Manchester, to hear Henry Hunt and other speakers demand parliamentary reform in the form of universal suffrage and annual parliaments. Against the advice of home secretary Sidmouth, local magistrates ordered troops to disperse the crowd and arrest the speakers. Eleven people were killed and hundreds injured in what became known as the Peterloo Massacre. Later that year, after the Whigs had tried to make political capital out of the Peterloo Massacre, parliament passed the Six Acts, which were designed to curtail disturbances of the peace while preserving traditional liberties. In February 1820, the Cato Street conspiracy, a plot to assassinate the cabinet and take over the government was uncovered. Two months later, there were outbreaks of unrest in Bonnymuir and Glasgow in Scotland.

King George III died in January 1820 and the Prince Regent became King George IV. He immediately demanded a divorce from his estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick; the Cabinet preferred the option of giving her an allowance on condition she remained abroad. When Caroline returned to London in June 1820 to public acclaim, Liverpool reluctantly issued a bill of pains and penalties to deprive her of her titles and dissolve her marriage. After evidence had been heard in the House of Lords, the bill was dropped at the third reading due to a lack of parliamentary support. The King nevertheless denied Caroline entry to his coronation in July 1821; she died the following month.

===Liberal Toryism===
Following what is sometimes seen as the reactionary early years of his premiership, the later years, from 1822 to 1827, have been described as a more liberal phase. In January 1822 Robert Peel replaced Sidmouth as home secretary and went on to introduce a number reforms to prisons and the criminal law. Later in 1822, following the suicide of Castlereagh, Canning became foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons, while two of his followers were promoted, F.J. Robinson to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer and William Huskisson to the Presidency of the Board of Trade.

==Retirement and death==
On 28 February 1827, Liverpool suffered a stroke at Fife House. He made only a partial recovery and was unable to return to office; the King appointed Canning as Prime Minister in April 1827. Liverpool suffered another stroke at Coombe in July 1827 and died on 4 December 1828 after a third attack. He was buried at Hawkesbury Church in Gloucestershire alongside his first wife and his parents.

==Personal life==
Liverpool married Louisa Hervey on 25 March 1795 and was widowed on 12 June 1821. His second marriage, on 24 September 1822, was to Mary, daughter of Reverend Charles Chester (formerly Bagot), who outlived him. Both marriages were childless and the earldom of Liverpool passed to his half-brother Charles Jenkinson on his death.

Liverpool was one of the founders of the National Gallery and was the first president of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, later the RNLI.

== Legacy ==
Robert William Seton-Watson sums up Jenkinson&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses:
John W. Derry says Jenkinson was: 

Jenkinson was the first British Prime Minister to regularly wear long trousers instead of breeches. He entered office at the age of 42 years and one day, younger than all of his successors. Liverpool served as Prime Minister for a total of 14 years and 305 days, making him the longest-serving Prime Minister of the 19th century. As of 2023, none of Liverpool&#x27;s successors has served longer.

In London, Liverpool Street and Liverpool Road, Islington, are named after Lord Liverpool. The Canadian town of Hawkesbury, Ontario, the Hawkesbury River and the Liverpool Plains, New South Wales, Australia, Liverpool, New South Wales, and the Liverpool River in the Northern Territory of Australia were also named after Lord Liverpool.

Lord Liverpool was portrayed by American actor Gilbert Emery in the 1934 film &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot;.

<text>Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon (1 November 1782 – 28 January 1859), styled The Honourable F. J. Robinson until 1827 and known between 1827 and 1833 as The Viscount Goderich (pronounced ), the name by which he is best known to history, was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1827 to 1828.

A member of the rural landowning aristocracy, Robinson entered politics through family connections. In the House of Commons, he rose through junior ministerial ranks, achieving cabinet office in 1818 as President of the Board of Trade. In 1823, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post he held for four years. In 1827, he was raised to the peerage, and in the House of Lords was Leader of the House and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies.

In 1827, Prime Minister George Canning died after only 119 days in office, and Goderich succeeded him. However, he was unable to hold together Canning&#x27;s fragile coalition of moderate Tories and Whigs, and he himself resigned after only 144 days. Canning and Goderich were the two shortest-ruling Prime Ministers in British history, until Liz Truss in 2022.

After leaving the premiership Goderich served in the cabinets of two of his successors, the Earl Grey and Sir Robert Peel.

==Early years: 1782–1804==
Robinson was born at Newby Hall, Yorkshire, the second son of Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, by his wife Lady Mary Yorke, a daughter of Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke. He was educated at a preparatory school at Sunbury-on-Thames, then attended Harrow School from 1796 to 1799, followed by St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1799 to 1802. William Pitt the Younger was Member of Parliament for Cambridge University, to which, as &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;accordingly most of the budding Tory statesmen of the day resorted&quot;. Robinson was an accomplished classicist, winning Sir William Browne&#x27;s Medal for the best Latin ode in 1801. After graduating in 1802 he was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He remained a member there until 1809, but did not pursue a legal career and was not called to the bar.

Against the background of the Napoleonic Wars, Robinson did part-time military service at home as captain (1803), ultimately major (1814–1817) in the Northern Regiment of West Riding Yeomanry.

== Early political career: 1804–1807==
===Member of Parliament, 1804–1812===
Robinson entered politics through a family connection. His mother&#x27;s cousin, the third Earl of Hardwicke, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, appointed him as his private secretary in 1804. Two years later Hardwicke secured for him the parliamentary seat of Carlow, a pocket borough near Dublin. In 1807 Robinson gave up the seat and was elected as MP for Ripon, close to his family home in Yorkshire.

=== First political appointments: 1807–1812 ===
In his first years in Parliament Robinson declined offers of junior ministerial posts, out of deference to his patron Hardwicke, who was an opponent of the Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland. However, the Foreign Secretary, George Canning, chose him as the secretary of Lord Pembroke&#x27;s mission to Vienna, aimed at securing a new treaty of alliance between Britain and the Austrian Empire. The mission was unsuccessful, but Robinson&#x27;s reputation was not damaged, and, as his biographer E Royston Pike puts it, &quot;as a good Tory [he was] given several small appointments in successive ministries.&quot; 

His political thinking was greatly influenced by Canning, but he became the protégé of Canning&#x27;s rival Lord Castlereagh, who appointed him his under-secretary at the War Office in May 1809. When Castlereagh resigned from the government in October, unwilling to serve under the new Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, Robinson resigned with him. In June 1810 he accepted office as a member of the Board of Admiralty. At the time of Perceval&#x27;s assassination early in 1812, he was absent from parliament ostensibly on militia duties in Yorkshire.

He was made a Privy Counsellor in August 1812,

=== Marriage ===
In 1814 Robinson married Lady Sarah Hobart (1793–1867), daughter of the 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire, and first cousin to Castlereagh&#x27;s wife. There were three children of the marriage, only one of whom survived to adulthood:
* Eleanor Henrietta Robinson (22 May 1815 – 31 October 1826)
* Hobart Frederick Robinson (baptised 8 September 1816 – 14 September 1816)
* George Frederick Samuel Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon (24 October 1827 – 9 July 1909)

== Senior Minister: 1812–1822==
Robinson served under Lord Liverpool as Vice-President of the Board of Trade between 1812 and 1818, and as joint-Paymaster of the Forces between 1813 and 1817, from which position he sponsored the Corn Laws of 1815. Robinson&#x27;s Corn Importation Bill, successfully presented to Parliament in February 1815, was a protectionist measure, imposing minimum prices for imported wheat and other grains. The historian Gregor Dallas writes:

The Corn Laws made the price of wheat artificially high, to the benefit of the landed classes and the detriment of the working classes. While the Bill was going through Parliament, Robinson&#x27;s London house in Old Burlington Street was frequently attacked by angry citizens; in one such attack the railings outside the house were ripped out, the front door smashed open, paintings ripped, and furniture thrown out of the window. In another attack two people were shot, one of them fatally. While describing the incident to the House of Commons, Robinson was moved to tears, showing, as the biographer P. J. Jupp put it, &quot;a propensity under stress which was to earn him the first of several nicknames, in this case the Blubberer&quot;.
In 1818 Robinson entered the cabinet as President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy, under the premiership of Lord Liverpool. In 1823 he succeeded Nicholas Vansittart as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The historian Richard Helmstadter writes:
== Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1822–1827==
Robinson served as Chancellor for four years, and was regarded as a success in the post. The public finances were in good order, with a revenue surplus for the first three years of his chancellorship. He cut taxes and made grants to house the King&#x27;s Library in the British Museum and to buy the Angerstein Collection for the National Gallery. Jupp writes, &quot;These achievements, together with his support for Catholic relief and the abolition of slavery, led to his being regarded as one of the most liberal members of the government and to two more nicknames – &#x27;Prosperity Robinson&#x27; and &#x27;Goody&#x27;.&quot; Robinson&#x27;s last year at the Treasury was overshadowed by a run on the banks, caused by the collapse of the City of London bankers Pole Thornton and Co. Robinson was not blamed for the collapse, but his measures to mitigate the crisis were widely seen as half-hearted.

Under strain from the financial crisis, Robinson asked Liverpool for a change of post. In January 1827 he was given a peerage as Viscount Goderich, but Liverpool had no time to reshuffle his cabinet, being taken ill in February 1827 and resigning the premiership. Liverpool was succeeded by Canning, whose appointment caused a major realignment in the political factions of the day. The Tories split into four groups, distinguished by their view of Catholic Emancipation. Canning and his followers were liberal on the matter; Robinson belonged to a moderate group that was willing to support Canning; the faction led by the Duke of Wellington and Robert Peel opposed emancipation; and an ultra-Tory group resisted any kind of liberalising measure. 

To the anger of the King, George IV, who regarded it as a betrayal, Wellington and Peel refused to serve under Canning. With half the Tories ranged against him, Canning was obliged to seek support from the Whigs. Goderich, appointed by Canning as Leader of the House of Lords as well as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, found the upper house no less stressful than the Commons. He was the target for the anger of the anti-Canning Tories in the Lords, suffering many personal verbal assaults. When he attempted to get a new Corn Law enacted, the proposal was defeated by an alliance of peers led by Wellington.

==Prime Minister: 1827–1828==
=== Appointment ===
Canning&#x27;s health had been declining since the beginning of 1827, and on 8 August he died. A prominent Whig commented, &quot;God has declared against us. He is manifestly for the tories, and I fear the king also, which is much worse.&quot; The King, however, though he had long inclined to favour Tories over Whigs, was still angry at the refusal of Wellington and Peel to serve in Canning&#x27;s cabinet. A widespread expectation (possibly shared by Wellington himself) that the King would send for Wellington was confounded. On the day of Canning&#x27;s death Goderich and the Home Secretary, William Sturges Bourne, were summoned to Windsor Castle, where the King announced his intention of appointing Goderich to the premiership.

=== Government crisis ===
Goderich immediately encountered difficulty in balancing the conflicting demands of the King and the Whigs about the composition of his cabinet. George considered that the three ministerial posts held by Whigs were quite enough; the Whigs pressed hard for the inclusion of a fourth, Lord Holland, as Foreign Secretary. Goderich satisfied nobody with his inability to resolve matters. A leading Whig, George Tierney, spoke of his party&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Goderich: &quot;[T]hey think Goderich has behaved so ill in this affair that they can have no confidence in him. They believe so much in the integrity of his character that they do not suspect him of any duplicity in what has passed, but his conduct has been marked by such deplorable weakness as shows how unfit he is for the situation he occupies.&quot; 

There was further discontent in the coalition cabinet at Goderich&#x27;s vacillation over the appointment of a Chancellor of the Exchequer, once again caught between the demands of the King and those of his Whig allies. Within a month, William Huskisson, a Tory colleague, was writing of Goderich: &quot;The king has taken the exact measure of him, and openly says he must do all the duties of a premier himself, because Goderich has no nerves! I am using nearly his own words; and he has been acting, and still talks of acting up to this declaration.&quot; George&#x27;s contempt for his Prime Minister was confirmed in his description of Goderich as &quot;a damned, snivelling, blubbering blockhead.&quot;
In addition to the conflicting pressures from the King and the Whigs, Goderich had to cope with the mental problems from which his wife was suffering. In December Huskisson wrote:
=== Resignation ===
Wellington was by now distancing himself from the Extreme-Tory wing of his party, and by January 1828 the King had concluded that the coalition could not continue and that a Tory ministry under Wellington would be preferable. Goderich had already written a letter of resignation to the King, but had not yet sent it, when he was summoned to Windsor. He described the disintegrating state of his administration; the King asked him to send for the Lord Chancellor, who was in turn bidden to summon Wellington to receive the King&#x27;s commission to form a government. According to one account, Goderich was in tears during his interview with the King, who passed him a handkerchief, but within days Goderich was rejoicing in his release from office: &quot;quite another man [who] sleeps at nights now, and laughs and talks as usual.&quot; His premiership had lasted 144 days, which remains one of the shortest in British history, twenty-five days longer than that of his immediate predecessor, Canning.

A Dutch art student has suggested that the painting &quot;The Staircase of the London Residence of the Painter&quot; by the Dutch painter Pieter Christoffel Wonder is an allegory of Goderich&#x27;s resignation. Goderich, the figure in the foreground, is offering his resignation to the king, depicted as a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

== Later years: 1828–1859 ==
===Later cabinet posts, 1830–1846===

In 1830 Goderich moved over to the Whigs and joined Lord Grey&#x27;s cabinet, as Colonial Secretary. Both on moral and on economic grounds he was strongly opposed to slavery throughout his career, and he worked hard in the 1830s for the emancipation of slaves throughout the British Empire. His work was continued by his successor as Colonial Secretary, Lord Stanley, whose abolitionist legislation Goderich piloted through the House of Lords.

In 1833 Goderich was created Earl of Ripon. He had not sought the advancement in the peerage, but wished to accept the King&#x27;s offer of the Garter, for which, at that time, a viscountcy was considered an insufficient rank. He left the Colonial Office in the same year, and did not wish to hold any further office, but Grey insisted on his taking the senior non-departmental post of Lord Privy Seal. However, the next year Goderich and Stanley broke with the Whigs over what they saw as a threat to the established status of the Church of Ireland.

From 1841 to 1843 Ripon served in Peel&#x27;s second administration as President of the Board of Trade, with the young W. E. Gladstone as his deputy. His final ministerial post was President of the Board of Control from 1843 to 1846. During his career, as Helmstadter observes, he had been, in succession, &quot;a Pittite, a Tory, a Canningite, a Whig, a Stanleyite, a Conservative, and a Peelite. Between 1818 and 1846 he was a member of every government except Wellington&#x27;s and Melbourne&#x27;s.&quot;

Apart from his political career Goderich served as the first president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1830 to 1833, and of the Royal Society of Literature from 1834 to 1845. He died in January 1859, aged 76. He outlived five of his successors in the prime ministry.

=== Death ===

Ripon died at Putney Heath, London, in January 1859, aged 76. He was succeeded by his only son, George who became a noted Liberal statesman and cabinet minister and was created Marquess of Ripon. The son was unique in being conceived at 11 Downing Street, while Robinson was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and being born at 10 Downing Street, when his father, now Goderich, was Prime Minister.

<text>The Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling. The guideline was proposed by Ian Holland at Northeastern University towards the end of 1987, and the following three recommendations serve as a succinct summary:
# Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units &quot;closely&quot; related to the current unit.
# Each unit should only talk to its friends; don&#x27;t talk to strangers.
# Only talk to your immediate friends.

The fundamental notion is that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of &quot;information hiding&quot;. It may be viewed as a corollary to the principle of least privilege, which dictates that a module possess only the information and resources necessary for its legitimate purpose.

It is so named for its origin in the Demeter Project, an adaptive programming and aspect-oriented programming effort. The project was named in honor of Demeter, &quot;distribution-mother&quot; and the Greek goddess of agriculture, to signify a bottom-up philosophy of programming which is also embodied in the law itself.

==History==
The law dates back to 1987 when it was first proposed by Ian Holland, who was working on the Demeter Project. This project was the birthplace of a lot of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) principles.

A quote in one of the remainders of the project seems to clarify the origins of the name:

==In object-oriented programming==
An object codice_1 can request a service (call a method) of an object instance codice_2, but object codice_1 should not &quot;reach through&quot; object codice_2 to access yet another object, codice_5, to request its services. Doing so would mean that object codice_1 implicitly requires greater knowledge of object codice_2&#x27;s internal structure.

Instead, codice_2&#x27;s interface should be modified if necessary so it can directly serve object codice_1&#x27;s request, propagating it to any relevant subcomponents. Alternatively, codice_1 might have a direct reference to object codice_5 and make the request directly to that. If the law is followed, only object codice_2 knows its own internal structure.

More formally, the Law of Demeter for functions requires that a method codice_13 of an object codice_1 may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects:
* codice_1 itself;
* codice_13&#x27;s parameters;
* any objects instantiated within codice_13;
* codice_1&#x27;s attributes;
* global variables accessible by codice_1 in the scope of codice_13.

In particular, an object should avoid invoking methods of an object returned by another method. For many modern object-oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier, the law can be stated simply as &quot;use only one dot&quot;. That is, the code codice_21 breaks the law where codice_22 does not. As an analogy, when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog&#x27;s legs to walk directly; instead, one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.

==Advantages==
The advantage of following the Law of Demeter is that the resulting software tends to be more maintainable and adaptable. Since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects, object implementation can be changed without reworking their callers.

Basili et al. published experimental results in 1996 suggesting that a lower &quot;Response For a Class&quot; (RFC, the number of methods potentially invoked in response to calling a method of that class) can reduce the probability of software bugs. Following the Law of Demeter can result in a lower RFC. However, the results also suggest that an increase in &quot;Weighted Methods per Class&quot; (WMC, the number of methods defined in each class) can increase the probability of software bugs. Following the Law of Demeter can also result in a higher WMC.

A multilayered architecture can be considered to be a systematic mechanism for implementing the Law of Demeter in a software system.
In a layered architecture, code within each layer can only make calls to code within the layer and code within the next layer down.
&quot;Layer skipping&quot; would violate the layered architecture.

==Disadvantages==
Although the LoD increases the adaptiveness of a software system, it may result in having to write many wrapper methods to propagate calls to components; in some cases, this can add noticeable time and space overhead.

At the method level, the LoD leads to narrow interfaces, giving access to only as much information as it needs to do its job, as each method needs to know about a small set of methods of closely related objects. On the other hand, at the class level, if the LoD is not used correctly, wide (i.e., enlarged) interfaces may be developed that require introducing many auxiliary methods. This is due to poor design rather than a consequence of the LoD per se. If a wrapper method is being used, it means that the object being called through the wrapper should have been a dependency in the calling class.

One proposed solution to the problem of enlarged class interfaces is the aspect-oriented approach, where the behavior of the method is specified as an aspect at a high level of abstraction. The wide interfaces are managed through a language that specifies implementations. Both the traversal strategy and the adaptive visitor use only a minimal set of classes that participate in the operation, and the information about the connections between these classes is abstracted out.
