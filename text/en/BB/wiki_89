<text>Mahāmudrā (Sanskrit: महामुद्रा, , contraction of ) literally means &quot;great seal&quot; or &quot;great imprint&quot; and refers to the fact that &quot;all phenomena inevitably are stamped by the fact of wisdom and emptiness inseparable&quot;. Mahāmudrā is a multivalent term of great importance in later Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism which &quot;also occurs occasionally in Hindu and East Asian Buddhist esotericism.&quot;

The name also refers to a body of teachings representing the culmination of all the practices of the New Translation schools of Tibetan Buddhism, who believe it to be the quintessential message of all of their sacred texts. The practice of Mahāmudrā is also known as the teaching called &quot;Sahajayoga&quot; or &quot;Co-emergence Yoga&quot;. In Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Kagyu school, Sahaja Mahāmudrā is sometimes seen as a different Buddhist vehicle (yana), the &quot;Sahajayana&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;lhen chig kye pa&quot;), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation.

Jamgon Kongtrul, a Tibetan nonsectarian (THL: ri-mé) scholar, characterizes mahāmudrā as the path to realizing the &quot;mind as it is&quot; (Wylie: &quot;sems nyid&quot;) which also stands at the core of all Kagyu paths. He states, &quot;In general, Mahāmudrā and everything below it are the ‘mind path’ &quot; (Wylie: &quot;sems lam&quot;) Mahāmudrā traditionally refers to the quintessence of mind itself and the practice of meditation in relation to a true understanding of it.

==History==
The usage and meaning of the term &quot;mahāmudrā&quot; evolved over the course of hundreds of years of Indian and Tibetan history, and as a result, the term may refer variously to &quot;a ritual hand-gesture, one of a sequence of &#x27;seals&#x27; in Tantric practice, the nature of reality as emptiness, a meditation procedure focusing on the nature of Mind, an innate blissful gnosis cognizing emptiness nondually, or the supreme attainment of buddhahood at the culmination of the Tantric path.&quot;

According to Jamgon Kongtrul, the Indian theoretical sources of the mahāmudrā tradition are Yogacara and tathagatagarbha (buddha-nature) texts such as the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra&quot;. The actual practice and lineage of mahāmudrā can be traced back to wandering mahasiddhas (great adepts) during the Indian Pala Dynasty (760-1142), beginning with the 8th century siddha Saraha.

Saraha&#x27;s &quot;Dohas&quot; (songs or poems in rhyming couplets) are the earliest mahāmudrā literature extant, and promote some of the unique features of mahāmudrā such as the importance of pointing-out instruction by a guru, the non-dual nature of mind, and the negation of conventional means of achieving enlightenment such as samatha-vipasyana meditation, monasticism, rituals, tantric practices and doctrinal study in favor of more the direct methods of mahāmudrā &#x27;non-meditation&#x27; and &#x27;non-action&#x27;. These teachings also became the wellspring for the body of instructions eventually known as the mind teachings of Tibet associated with mahāmudrā of the Kagyu lineages. Later Indian and Tibetan masters such as Padmavajra, Tilopa, and Gampopa incorporated mahāmudrā into tantric, monastic and traditional meditative frameworks.

===Etymology===

It has been speculated that the first use of the term was in the c. 7th century &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot;, in which it refers to a hand gesture.

The term is mentioned with increasing frequency as various Buddhist tantras developed further, particularly in the Yogatantras, where it appears in &quot;Tattvasaṁgraha (Compendium of Reality)&quot; and the &quot;Vajraśekhara (Vajra-peak)&quot;. In these sources, &quot;mahāmudrā&quot; also denotes a hand gesture, now linked to three other hand mudrās—the action (&quot;karma&quot;), pledge (&quot;samaya&quot;), and &quot;dharma&quot; mudrās—but also involves &quot;mantra recitations and visualizations that symbolize and help to effect one&#x27;s complete identification with a deity&#x27;s divine form or awakening Mind (bodhicitta).&quot;

In Mahāyoga tantras such as the &quot;Guhyasamāja tantra&quot;, mahāmudrā &quot;has multiple meanings, including a contemplation-recitation conducive to the adamantine body, speech, and Mind of the tathāgatas; and the object—emptiness—through realization of which &#x27;all is accomplished,&#x27;&quot; and it is also used as a synonym for awakened Mind, which is said to be &quot;primordially unborn, empty, unarisen, nonexistent, devoid of self, naturally luminous, and immaculate like the sky.&quot;

The idea of &quot;mahāmudrā&quot; emerges as a central Buddhist concept in the &quot;Anuttarayoga Tantras&quot; (also known as &quot;Yoginītantras&quot;) like the &quot;Hevajra&quot;, &quot;Cakrasaṁvara&quot;, and &quot;Kālacakra.&quot; 

According to Roger Jackson, in these tantras, mahāmudrā has multiple referents. It can refer to completion stage practices which work with forces in the subtle body (&quot;sūkṣma śarīra&quot;) to produce a divine form and &quot;a luminous, blissful, nonconceptual gnosis.&quot; In this context, it is seen as the highest practice which transcends and perfects all previous ones and leads to a direct realization of the nature of mind. In the context of sexual yoga, mahāmudrā can also refers to a yogi&#x27;s female consort. Furthermore, the term mahāmudrā can also refer to the ultimate truth and the ultimate realization (&quot;mahāmudrā-siddhī&quot;) in Buddhist tantra. As such, it is the &quot;great seal&quot; which marks all phenomena, i.e. Suchness (tathata), emptiness, the &quot;unchanging bliss beyond object and subject, shape, thought, or expression&quot;.

The tantric scholar Aryadeva summarises the meaning of mahāmudrā as: &quot;the discussion of how to attain mahāmudrā entails methods for meditating on Mind itself as something having voidness as its nature&quot;.

According to Reginald Ray, the term &quot;Mudrā&quot; denotes that in an adept&#x27;s experience of reality, each phenomenon appears vividly, while the term &quot;Mahā&quot; (&quot;great&quot;) refers to the fact that it is beyond concept, imagination, and projection.

== Indian sources ==
All of the various Tibetan mahāmudrā lineages originated with the Mahasiddhas of medieval India (c. 8th to 12th centuries). The earliest figure is the tenth century poet yogi Saraha, and his student Nagarjuna (this tantric figure not to be confused with the earlier philosopher Nagarjuna). Saraha&#x27;s collections of poems and songs, mostly composed in the apabhramsa language are the earliest Indian sources for mahāmudrā teachings, aside from the Buddhist tantras.

Other influential Indian mahasiddhas include Tilopa, his student Naropa and Naropa&#x27;s consort Niguma. Tilopa&#x27;s &quot;Ganges Mahāmudrā&quot; song is a widely taught short mahāmudrā text. Niguma is an important source for the Shangpa Kagyu lineage.

Tilopa&#x27;s pupil Maitripa (c.  1007–1085) became the principal master of mahāmudrā in India during his time and most lineages of mahāmudrā are traced from Maitripa. Maitripa was a very influential figure of the eleventh century, a scholar and tantrika who widely taught the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, a text which is widely seen as bridging the sutric Mahayana and Anuttarayogatantra views. He composed commentaries on the buddhist dohas, and his works include a collection of 26 texts on &quot;non-conceptual realization&quot; (&quot;amanasikara&quot;), which are a key Indian source of mahāmudrā teachings that blend sutra and tantra, and teach an instantaneous approach to awakening.

One of Maitripa&#x27;s students was the Kadam scholar Atisha, who taught mahāmudrā to his pupil Dromtönpa (1004–63) who decided not to make mahāmudrā a part of the Kadam tradition. Another pupil of Maitripa, Marpa Lotsawa, also introduced mahāmudrā to Tibet and his disciple Milarepa is also a central figure of this lineage. Another important figure in the introduction of mahāmudrā to the area is Vajrapani, yet another student of Maitripa. His student, Asu, also was a teacher of Rechungpa (1084-1161), one of Milarepa&#x27;s pupils.

Gampopa, a key figure of the Kagyu school, refers to three important cycles of Indian texts which discuss Mahāmudrā as his main sources:

* &quot;The Seven [or eight] Siddhiḥ Texts&quot; &quot;(Saptasiddhiḥ,&quot; Tib. &quot;Grub pa sde bdun),&quot; which include Padmavajra&#x27;s &quot;Guhyasiddhi&quot; and Indrabhuti&#x27;s &quot;Jñanasiddhi.&quot;
* &quot;The Cycle of Six Heart Texts&quot; or &quot;Six works on essential meaning&quot; (&quot;Snying po skor drug&quot;), including Saraha&#x27;s &quot;Dohakosha&quot; and Nagarjunagarbha&#x27;s &quot;Caturmudraniscaya&quot;.
* Maitripa&#x27;s &quot;Cycle of Teachings on Non-Cognition&quot; (&quot;Yid la mi byed pa &#x27;i chos skor&quot;).

This classification existed since the time of Butön Rinchen Drup (1290-1364).

Indian sources of mahāmudrā were later compiled by the seventh Karmapa Chödrak Gyatso (1454-1506) into a three-volume compilation entitled &quot;The Indian Mahāmudrā Treatises&quot; (Tib. &quot;Phyag rgya chen po &#x27;i rgya gzhung&quot;). This compilation includes the above three collections, along with the &quot;Anavilatantra&quot; and texts that teach a non-tantric &quot;instantaneous&quot;approach to the practice by an Indian master named Śākyaśribhadra.

==Tibetan traditions==

Mahāmudrā is most well known as a teaching within the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. However the Gelug and Sakya schools also practice mahāmudrā. The Nyingma school and Bon practise Dzogchen, a cognate but distinct method of direct introduction to the principle of śūnyatā. Nyingma students may also receive supplemental training in mahāmudrā, and the Palyul Nyingma lineage preserves a lineage of the &quot;Union of mahāmudrā and Ati Yoga&quot; originated by Karma Chagme.

===Kagyu tradition===
Gampopa Sönam Rinchen (1079-1153), a Kadam monk who was a student of the lay tantric yogi Milarepa, is a key figure in the Kagyu tradition. He is responsible for much of the development of Kagyu monastic institutions and for recording the teachings of the lineage in writing. He synthesized the Mahayana Kadam teachings with the tantric teachings he received from Milarepa and developed a unique system of mahāmudrā which he often taught without tantric empowerment, relying instead on guru yoga.

Mahāmudrā is defined by Gampopa as &quot;the realization of the natural state as awareness-emptiness, absolutely clear and transparent, without root&quot;. Gampopa also states that mahāmudrā is &quot;the paramita of wisdom, beyond thought and expression.&quot; Gampopa taught mahāmudrā in a five part system to his disciples, one of his most well known disciples, Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) became a very successful teacher who continued to teach this five part system and eight &quot;junior&quot; kagyu lineages are traced to him. This &quot;Five-Part Mahāmudrā&quot; system became one of the main ways that Mahāmudrā was transmitted in Kagyu lineages after Gampopa.

The tradition which follows Gampopa is called Dakpo Kagyu. A key Mahāmudrā author of this tradition is Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, well known for his &quot;Mahāmudrā: The Moonlight.&quot; Karma Kagyu Karmapas like the ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje also composed important Mahāmudrā texts. A development of these later mahāmudrā writers is the integration of the common Mahayana teachings on samatha and vipasyana as preliminaries to the practice of mahāmudrā.

====Three types of teaching====
The Kagyu lineage divides the mahāmudrā teachings into three types, &quot;sutra mahāmudrā,&quot; &quot;tantra mahāmudrā,&quot; and &quot;essence mahāmudrā,&quot; in a formulation that appears to originate with Jamgon Kongtrul. Sutra mahāmudrā, as the name suggests, draws its philosophical view and meditation techniques from the sutrayana tradition. Tantric mahāmudrā employs such tantric techniques as tummo, dream yoga, and ösel, three of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Essence mahāmudrā is based on the direct instruction of a qualified lama, known as pointing-out instruction.

====As a path beyond sutra and tantra====
Kagyu lineage figures such as Gampopa presented a form of mahāmudrā that was said to transcend the vehicles of sutrayana and vajrayana. According to Karl Brunnholzl, Gampopa saw Mahāmudrā as a third path that was neither sutra nor tantra which he called &quot;the path of prajña&quot; and &quot;the path of suchness,&quot; and which &quot;relies on blessing and is for those who are intelligent and of sharp faculties.&quot; Brunnholzl adds that for Gampopa, the mahāmudrā path of &quot;taking direct perceptions as the path&quot; relies on introduction by a genuine guru to the luminous dharmakaya and thus:

Through having been taught an unmistaken instruction of definitive meaning like that, one then takes native mind as the path, without separating the triad of view, conduct, and meditation in terms of this connate mind about which one has gained certainty within oneself.

Gampopa also stated that mahāmudrā was &quot;the highest path that actually transcends both sutra and tantra.&quot; Brunnholzl further states that &quot;In practice, most of Gampopa&#x27;s preserved teachings consist primarily of sutra-based instructions and then conclude with Mahāmudrā, either not teaching the path of mantra at all or mentioning it only in passing.&quot;

The Kagyu tradition bases their mahāmudrā teachings on the works of Indian mahasiddhas like Saraha and Maitripa. According to Klaus-Dieter Mathes,

Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha&#x27;s dohās, it is simply the realization of Mind&#x27;s co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. Maitrīpa (ca. 1007–1085) uses the term Mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Kagyupas to speak of Saraha&#x27;s mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.

The Kagyu teachings of mahāmudrā became a point of controversy. The possibility of sudden liberating realization and the practice of mahāmudrā without the need for tantric initiation was seen as contrary to the teachings of the Buddhist tantras and as being just a form of Chinese Chan (Zen) by certain critics. However, Dakpo Tashi Namgyal explicitly reaffirms that a tantric empowerment is not, in and of itself, a requirement for the path of liberation. He writes, &quot;(Gampopa) did not make the esoteric empowerment a prerequisite for receiving the Mahāmudrā teachings. He spoke about the method of directly guiding the disciple toward the intrinsic reality of the mind [...] if one follows venerable Gampopa’s system in elucidating Mahāmudrā alone, it is not necessary [...]&quot; In addition, he notes certain &quot;[...] followers of this meditative order (who later) adapted Mahāmudrā to the practice of esoteric tantra&quot;, which typically relies on empowerments.

==== Kagyu lineages ====
Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama identified a number of mahāmudrā lineages, according to their main practices for achieving mahāmudrā. In his teachings on the First Panchen Lama&#x27;s root text and auto-commentary the 14th Dalai Lama delineated the Kagyu practice lineages as follows:

* The Karma Kagyu &quot;Simultaneously Arising as Merged&quot; tradition - This is the tradition introduced by Gampopa with a main practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa.
* The Shangpa Kagyu &quot;Amulet Box&quot; tradition - This tradition came from Khyungpo Naljor and its main practice is the Six yogas of Niguma.
* The Drikung Kagyu &quot;Possessing Five&quot; tradition - Jigten Gonpo founded the school and mahāmudrā lineage whose main practice is known as the fivefold mahāmudrā consisting of refuge and bodhicitta, deity yoga, guru yoga, mahamudra meditation, and dedication of merit.
* The Drukpa lineage &quot;Six Spheres of Equal Taste&quot; tradition - Tsangpa Gyare founded this tradition which encompasses a range of practices, including the Six Yogas of Naropa.
* The Dagpo Kagyu &quot;Four Syllables&quot; tradition - This is the tradition that derives from Maitripa. The four syllables are &quot;a-ma-na-si&quot; which make up the Sanskrit word meaning &#x27;not to take to mind&#x27; and passed through the Dagpo Kagyu branches, i.e. any that descend from the teachings of Tilopa rather than those of Niguma, which in practice means all but the Shangpa Kagyu.

===Sakya tradition===
Following the great Sakya exegete and philosopher Sakya pandita (1182-1251), mahāmudrā in the Sakya school is seen as the highest tantric realization, which means that mahāmudrā practice is only taken on after having been initiated into tantric practice and practicing the creation and completion stages of deity yoga. In his &quot;A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes&quot; (&quot;Sdom gsum rab dbye&quot;), Sakya Pandita criticized the non-tantric &quot;sutra&quot; mahamudra approaches of the Kagyu teachers such as Gampopa who taught mahāmudrā to those who had not received tantric initiations and based themselves on the Uttaratantrasastra. He argued that the term mahāmudrā does not occur in the sutras, only in the highest class of tantras and that only through tantric initiation does mahāmudrā arise: &quot;Our own Great Seal consists of Gnosis risen from initiation.&quot; According to Sakya Pandita, through the four empowerments or initiations given by a qualified guru, most practitioners will experience a likeness of true mahāmudrā, though a few rare individuals experience true mahāmudrā. Through the practice of the creation and completion stages of tantra, the tantrika develops this partial understanding of bliss and emptiness into a completely non-dual gnosis, the real Mahamudra, which corresponds to the attainment of the Path of Seeing, the first Bodhisattva bhumi.

In Sakya, this insight known as mahāmudrā is described variously as &quot;the unity of lucidity and emptiness, the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of bliss and emptiness&quot; and also &quot;the natural reality (&quot;chos nyid gnyug ma&quot;) which is emptiness possessing the excellence of all aspects.&quot;

===Gelug tradition===

The Gelug school&#x27;s mahamudra tradition is traditionally traced back to the school&#x27;s founder Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), who was said to have received oral transmission from Manjushri, and it is also traced to the Indian masters like Saraha through the Drikung Kagyu master Chennga Chokyi Gyalpo who transmitted Kagyu Mahamudra teachings (probably the five-fold Mahamudra) to Tsongkhapa. Jagchen Jampa Pal (1310-1391), a holder of the &#x27;jag pa tradition of the Shangpa teachings, was also one of the teachers of Tsongkhapa.

However, a specifically &quot;Gelug&quot; Mahamudra system was only recorded at the time of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama (sometimes named the &quot;1st Panchen Lama&quot;, 1570–1662), who wrote a root Mahamudra text on the &quot;Highway of the Conquerors: Root Verses for the Precious Geden [Gelug] Kagyu [Oral] Transmission of Mahāmudrā&quot; (&quot;dGe-ldan bka&#x27;-brgyud rin-po-che&#x27;i phyag-chen rtsa-ba rgyal-ba&#x27;i gzhung-lam&quot;) and its auto commentary (the &quot;Yang gsal sgron me, &quot;Lamp re-illuminating Mahamudra&quot;&quot;), which is still widely taught and commented upon. Before this work, Gelug writings on Mahamudra tended to follow orthodox Kagyu teachings. This text and its auto commentary have become a central work on Mahamudra in the Gelug school. The current 14th Dalai Lama and Lama Thubten Yeshe are some of the modern Gelug figures which have written commentaries on this key Gelug Mahamudra text.

The Panchen Lama Chökyi Gyaltsen, himself was influenced by Kagyu teachings, and wished to imitate great siddhas like Milarepa and Sabaripa. He names various Mahamudra and Dzogchen lineages in his text, and comes to the conclusion that &quot;their definitive meanings are all seen to come to the same intended point.&quot; Chökyi Gyaltsen also sides with the Kagyu school against Sakya, arguing that there is a sutra level of Mahamudra. However, in his account, sutra Mahamudra is particularly associated with a gradual path and his presentation of insight practice (&quot;vipasyana&quot;) is uniquely Gelug.

Yongdzin Yeshe Gyaltsen (also known as Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, tutor of the 8th Dalai Lama, 1713–1793) composed a commentary on Chökyi Gyaltsen&#x27;s Mahamudra text, entitled &quot;The Lamp of the Clear and Excellent Path of the Oral Tradition Lineage&quot; (&quot;Yongs-&#x27;dzin ye shes rgyal mtshan&quot;). He also comments on Mahamudra in the context of Lama Chopa Guru Yoga.

Tibetan teacher Thubten Yeshe explains: &quot;Mahāmudrā means absolute seal, totality, unchangeability. Sealing something implies that you cannot destroy it. Mahāmudrā was not created or invented by anybody; therefore it cannot be destroyed. It is absolute reality&quot;.

== Practices and methods ==
A common schema used in the Kagyu school is that of Ground (buddha-nature, emptiness), Path (practice) and Fruition mahāmudrā (Buddhahood). The advice and guidance of a qualified teacher (lama) or guru is considered to be very important in developing faith and interest in the Dharma as well as in learning and practicing mahāmudrā meditation. Most often mahāmudrā (particularly essence mahāmudrā) is preceded by meeting with a teacher and receiving pointing-out instruction. Some parts of the transmission are done verbally and through empowerments and &quot;reading transmissions.&quot; A mahāmudrā student typically goes through various tantric practices before undertaking the &quot;formless&quot; practices described below; the latter are classified as part of &quot;essence mahāmudrā.&quot; 

Ngondro are the preliminary practices common to both Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen traditions and include practices such as contemplating the &quot;four thoughts that turn the mind&quot;, prostrations, and guru yoga. According to one scholar, most people have difficulty beginning directly with formless practices and lose enthusiasm doing so, so the tantric practices work as a complement to the formless ones. Others develop a sincere and strong interest in the mahāmudrā teachings on the nature of mind, but find themselves quite resistant to the path of tantra and its empowerments. Regardless of how one proceeds, it is regarded to be of great benefit to study and practice in reliance upon the lineage’s treasured quintessential instructions.

Another way to divide the practice of mahāmudrā is between the tantric mahāmudrā practices and the sutra practices. Tantric mahāmudrā practices involves practicing deity yoga with a yidam as well as subtle body practices like the six yogas of Naropa and can only be done after empowerment. After the preliminary practices, the Kagyu school&#x27;s sutra mahāmudrā practice is often divided into the ordinary or essential meditation practices and the extraordinary meditation practices. The ordinary practices are samatha (calming) and vipasyana (special insight). The extraordinary practices include &quot;formless&quot; practices like &#x27;one taste yoga&#x27; and &#x27;non-meditation&#x27;. The tradition also culminates with certain special enlightenment and post-enlightenment practices. 

According to Reginald Ray, the &quot;formless&quot; practices, also called &quot;Essence mahamudra,&quot; is when &quot;one engages directly in practices of abandoning discursive thinking and resting the mind in the clear, luminous awareness that is mahamudra.&quot; The reason that preparatory practices and &quot;form&quot; practices like deity yoga and vipasyana are needed is because formless practices are quite difficult and subtle, and most practitioners are not able to enter into the simple essence of mind successfully without considerable mental preparation.

===Four yogas and five paths===
In the Dagpo Kagyu tradition as presented by Dagpo Tashi Namgyal, Mahāmudrā is divided into four distinct phases known as the four yogas of mahāmudrā (S. &quot;catvāri mahāmudrā yoga&quot;, ). They are as follows:

# one-pointedness (S. &quot;ekāgra&quot;, T. རྩེ་གཅིག་ &quot;rtse gcig&quot;);
# simplicity (S. &quot;niṣprapānca&quot;, T. སྤྲོས་བྲལ་ &quot;spros bral&quot;), &quot;free from complexity&quot; or &quot;not elaborate;&quot;
# one taste (S. &quot;samarasa&quot;, T. རོ་གཅིག་ &quot;ro gcig&quot;);
# non-meditation (S. &quot;abhāvanā&quot;, T. སྒོམ་མེད་ &quot;sgom med&quot;), the state of not holding to either an object of meditation nor to a meditator. Nothing further needs to be &#x27;meditated upon&#x27; or &#x27;cultivated&#x27; at this stage.

These stages parallel the four yogas of Dzogchen semde. The four yogas of mahāmudrā have been correlated with the Mahāyāna five paths (S. &quot;pañcamārga&quot;), according to Tsele Natsok Rangdrol (&quot;Lamp of Mahāmudrā&quot;):

*Outer and inner preliminary practices: the path of accumulation
*One-pointedness: the path of application
*Simplicity: the path of seeing and most of the path of meditation (bhūmis one through six)
*One taste: the last part of the path of meditation, most of the path of no-more-learning (bhūmis seven through nine)
*Nonmeditation: the last part of the path of no-more learning (tenth bhūmi) and buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

Dakpo Tashi Namgyal meanwhile in his &quot;Moonlight of Mahāmudrā&quot; correlates them as follows:

*Outer and inner preliminary practices and one-pointedness: the path of accumulation
*Simplicity: the path of application
*One taste: the paths of meditation &amp; no-more-learning
*Nonmeditation: the path of no more learning &amp; buddhahood.

According to Je Gyare as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (&quot;Moonlight of Mahāmudrā&quot;):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and part of the path no-more-learning (bhūmis two through eight)
*Nonmeditation: rest of path of no-more-learning, buddhahood (bhūmis nine through thirteen)

According to Drelpa Dönsal as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (&quot;Moonlight of Mahāmudrā&quot;):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and no-more-learning (bhūmis two through ten)
*Nonmeditation: buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

===Ordinary meditation practices===

As in most Buddhist schools of meditation, the basic meditative practice of mahāmudrā is divided into two approaches: śamatha (&quot;tranquility&quot;,&quot;calm abiding&quot;) and vipaśyanā (&quot;special insight&quot;). This division is contained in the instructions given by Wangchuk Dorje, the ninth Karmapa, in a series of texts he composed; these epitomize teachings given on mahāmudrā practice.

====Śamatha====

Often associated with the yoga of one-pointedness, mahāmudrā śamatha contains instructions on ways to sit with proper posture, called the seven point posture of Vairocana. The mahāmudrā shamatha teachings also include instructions on how to work with a mind that is beset with various impediments to focusing, such as raising the gaze when one feels dull or sleepy, and lowering it again when one feels overly excited. Two types of mahāmudrā śamatha are generally taught: śamatha with support and śamatha without support.

Mahāmudrā śamatha with support involves the use of an object of attention to which the meditator continually returns his or her attention. Wangchuk Dorje mentions that one can use a wide variety of supports, visual objects like a candle flame, but also sounds, a smell, etc.

One of the main techniques involved in Mahāmudrā śamatha with support is mindfulness of breathing (Sanskrit: ānāpānasmṛti; Pali: ānāpānasati). Mindfulness of breathing practice is considered to be a profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the stages that follow. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, mindfulness of breathing is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis. The contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master Chogyam Trungpa, expressing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, &quot;your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense... The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath.&quot;

Śamatha without support or objectless meditation refers to resting the mind without the use of a specific focal point or object of concentration. According to Reginald Ray, in this practice &quot;the eyes are open and one gazes straight ahead into space, directing one&#x27;s mind to nothing at all.&quot;

In Gelug sutra mahāmudrā, the śamatha techniques are similar to the Kagyu presentation.

====Vipaśyanā====
The detailed instructions for the insight practices are what make Mahāmudrā (and Dzogchen) unique in Tibetan Buddhism. In Mahāmudrā vipaśyanā, Wangchuck Dorje gives ten separate contemplations that are used to disclose the essential mind within; five practices of &quot;looking at&quot; and five of &quot;pointing out&quot; the nature of mind. They all presume some level of stillness cultivated by mahāmudrā shamatha. In retreat, each contemplation would typically be assigned specific time periods.

The five practices for &quot;looking at&quot; the nature of the mind are as follows:
* &quot;Looking at the settled mind.&quot; One repeatedly looks at the mind&#x27;s still state, possibly posing questions to arouse awareness, such as &quot;what is its nature? It is perfectly still?&quot;
* &quot;Looking at the moving or thinking mind.&quot; One tries to closely examine the arising, existence, and ceasing of thoughts, possibly posing oneself questions so as to better understand this process, such as &quot;how does it arise? What is its nature?&quot;
* &quot;Looking at the mind reflecting appearances.&quot; One looks at the way in which phenomena of the external senses occur in experience. Usually, a visual object is taken as the subject. One repeatedly looks at the object, trying to see just how that appearance arises in the mind, and understand the nature of this process. One possibly asks questions such as &quot;what is their nature? How do they arise, dwell, and disappear? Is their initial appearance different from how they eventually understood?&quot;
* &quot;Looking at the mind in relation to the body.&quot; One investigates questions such as &quot;what is the mind? What is the body? Is the body our sensations? What is the relation of our sensations to our mental image of our body?&quot;
* &quot;Looking at the settled and moving minds together.&quot; When the mind is still, one looks at that, and when the mind is in motion, one looks at that. One investigates whether these two stages are the same or different, asking questions such as &quot;if they are the same, what is the commonality? If different, what is the difference?&quot;

The practices for &quot;pointing out the nature of mind&quot; build on these. One now looks again at each of the five, but this time repeatedly asks oneself &quot;What is it?&quot; In these practices, one attempts to recognize and realize the exact nature of, respectively:
* The settled mind,
* The moving or thinking mind,
* The mind reflecting appearances,
* The relation of mind and body,
* The settled and thinking mind together.

The above practices do not have specific &quot;answers&quot;; they serve to provoke one to scrutinize experience more and more closely over time, seeking to understand what is really there.

Gelug sutra Mahāmudrā, as presented by Chökyi Gyaltsen, practices a unique Gelug style of doing vipaśyanā, based primarily on Gelug Madhyamaka. According to Roger Jackson:

In an actual meditation session, this involves, first of all, analyzing whether the meditator who has achieved tranquil equipoise actually can be found in an ultimate sense. Seeking the meditator both within and apart from the various elements, one encounters the meditator nowhere; seeking ultimacy in phenomena (dharmas), one encounters it nowhere. Thus, one comes to abide in a space-like awareness of the void nature of both the person and dharmas. Next (or, alternatively) one examines more carefully whether the mind itself can be found in an ultimate sense: it is discovered to have the conventional nature of a flow of awareness and clarity, but no ultimacy, no true existence. In short, one should recognize that any existent that arises, whether an object of the mind or the mind itself, is merely conceptual, is void and—as Chos rgyan quotes his guru, Sangs rgyas ye shes, as saying—&quot;When . . . you are equipoised one-pointedly on that, marvelous!&quot; (GBZL: 4a; trans. Dalai Lama and Berzin: 100; YSGM: 30b). In the period between meditation sessions (rjes thob), one should see all appearances as deceptive (sgyu ma), as existing differently than they appear, but one must at the same time recognize that their ultimate voidness does not preclude their conventional functioning, any more than conventional functioning gives them true existence.

===Extraordinary meditation practices===

The practice of ordinary meditation eventually leads one to the yoga of simplicity, which according to Gampopa, is &quot;understanding the essential state of that awareness [of one-pointedness] as nonarising emptiness], which transcends conceptual modes of reality and unreality.&quot; One sees all phenomena just as they are, non-conceptually, beyond extremes of existence and non-existence.

====One taste====

According to Gampopa, the yoga of one taste is &quot;understanding diverse appearances as being one, from the standpoint of their intrinsic nature.&quot;

Phagmo Drupa says:

By meditating on the one taste of all things, the meditator will cognize the one taste of all these things. The diversity of appearances and nonappearances, mind and emptiness, emptiness and non-emptiness, Are all of one taste, undifferentiable in their intrinsic emptiness. Understanding and lack of understanding are of one taste; Meditation and nonmeditation are nondifferentiable; Meditation and absence of meditation are unified into one taste; Discrimination and lack of discrimination are one taste In the expanse of reality.

====Nonmeditation====
Gampopa states that nonmeditation is &quot;an unceasing realization of the union of appearance and its intrinsic emptiness.&quot;

Phagmo Drupa says:

By perfecting this [nonmeditation] stage the meditator attains naked, unsupported awareness. This nondiscriminatory awareness is the meditation! By transcending the duality of meditation and meditator, external and internal realities, the meditating awareness dissolves itself into its luminous clarity. Transcending the intellect, it is without the duality of meditation and post-meditation. Such is the quintessence of mind.

===Six Words of Advice===

Tilopa was a Bengali mahasiddha who developed the mahāmudrā method around 1,000 C.E. Tilopa gave Naropa, his successor, a teaching on mahāmudrā meditation called the Six Words of Advice.

In the following chart a translation is given of the Tilopa&#x27;s Six Words of Advice.

<text>LotusScript is an object-oriented programming language used by Lotus Notes (since version 4.0) and other IBM Lotus Software products.

LotusScript is similar to Visual Basic. Developers familiar with one can easily understand the syntax and structure of code in the other. The major differences between the two are in their respective integrated development environments and in the product-specific object classes provided in each language that are included. VB includes a richer set of classes for UI manipulation, whereas LotusScript includes a richer set of application-specific classes for Lotus Notes, Lotus Word Pro and Lotus 1-2-3. In the case of Lotus Notes, there are classes to work with Notes databases, documents (records) in those databases, etc. These classes can also be used as OLE Automation objects outside the Lotus Notes environment, from Visual Basic.

LotusScript also allows the definition of user-defined types and classes, although it is not possible to inherit from the product-specific classes. LotusScript programs can access Microsoft Office documents by using the OLE automation in libraries from MS Office.

<text>The University of Nevada, Reno (Nevada, the University of Nevada, or UNR) is a public land-grant research university in Reno, Nevada, United States. It is the state&#x27;s flagship public university and primary land grant institution. It was founded on October 12, 1874, in Elko, Nevada.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent $144 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 139th in the nation. The university has a medical school. The university is also home to the Donald W. Reynolds School of Journalism. It has graduated six Pulitzer Prize winners.

==History==
The Nevada State Constitution established the State University of Nevada in Elko on October 12, 1874. In 1881, it became Nevada State University. In 1885, Nevada State University moved from Elko to Reno. In 1906, it was renamed the University of Nevada.

The University of Nevada remained the only four-year academic institution in the state of Nevada until 1965, when the Nevada Southern campus (now the University of Nevada, Las Vegas) separated into its own university. In 1969, the university&#x27;s name was changed to the University of Nevada, Reno to distinguish from the new institution in Las Vegas.

==Academics==
Bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral programs are offered through:

===Centers===

Nevada sponsors a center dedicated to Basque studies (Including the Basque language) due to the large Basque population in Northern Nevada.

In addition, the university maintains and sponsors many centers, institutes &amp; facilities.

===Libraries===

The university and surrounding community is served by several campus libraries. The libraries are:
* Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center (main library). Opened on August 11, 2008, it was a $75.3 million project which began in September 2005. It replaced the Getchell library.
** Basque Library (housed in separate section of the Knowledge Center)
** Special Collections and University Archives (3rd floor of the Matthewson IGT-Knowledge Center) 
* DeLaMare Library (engineering, physical sciences, computer science, mining, and geology)
** Mary B. Ansari Map Library (housed in basement of DeLaMare)
* Savitt Medical Library
* Nell J. Redfield Learning and Resource Center (education library and resources)

===Rankings and reputation===
For 2025, University of Nevada, Reno was ranked tied for 204th overall among national universities and tied for 113th among public universities in the U.S. by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated the University 167th overall among American universities while University of Nevada, Las Vegas by comparison ranked 286th. UNR was also ranked No. 74 for best public college and No. 36 &quot;in the west&quot;.

For 2020, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked UNR 138th among 389 national universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

==Campus==
The University of Nevada, Reno is the flagship institution of Nevada. The campus is located just north of downtown Reno overlooking Truckee Meadows and the downtown casinos.

===Early construction===
The university&#x27;s first building, Morrill Hall, was completed in 1887 and still stands on the historic quad at the campus&#x27; southern end. The hall is named after U.S. Senator Justin Morrill, author of the 1862 Land-Grant College Act.

Lincoln Hall (all-male residence) and Manzanita Hall (all-female residence) were both opened in 1896. While Lincoln was under construction, boys were housed in the building which had previously held the now-defunct Bishop Whitaker&#x27;s School for Girls, which had shuttered in 1894.

===The Quad===
The tree-lined Quad is located in the southern part of the campus, surrounded by Morrill Hall and the Mackay School of Mines. This quadrangle is modeled after Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s at the University of Virginia.

===Herbarium===
The herbarium at the University of Nevada, Reno is made up of the herbarium of the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station (College of Agriculture) and the herbarium of the Biology Department. They have operated as one unit since 1978. Among those who worked at the herbarium were Patrick Beveridge Kennedy and Amos Arthur Heller at the experiment station and Philip Augustus Lehenbauer, Dwight Billings, Hugh Nelson Mozingo, and William Andrew Archer at the biology department.

===Mackay Stadium===
The football team plays at Mackay Stadium. The modern Mackay Stadium was completed in 1966 with a seating capacity of 7,500. The facility has been expanded several times in the last 15 years and now seats 30,000.

===E.L. Wiegand Fitness Center===
The University of Nevada began construction of a new 108,000 square foot fitness center in June 2015. Named the E.L. Wiegand Fitness Center, it opened in February 2017. Students&#x27; use of the fitness center is included in annual tuition and fees. The fitness center has four floors and includes a gym with three basketball courts, areas for weightlifting, cardio training, fitness classes, stadium stairs and an indoor running track. The project had a $46 million cost.

===Sustainability===
Since its creation in the fall of 2008, the University of Nevada, Reno&#x27;s Sustainability Committee has been gathering information on various aspects of campus sustainability and beginning the development of a plan for creating a more sustainable campus.
Significant efforts are made towards recycling and keeping the campus green. Many university buses run on bio-diesel fuels. The bicycle program has seen a significant increase in the number of bicycle users. The university&#x27;s Food Services has made a commitment of 1% of the meal plan revenue to go towards funding sustainable initiatives on campus. In order to reduce energy use, UNR has installed solar panels on the Joe Crowley Student Union and built its first LEED accredited building.
The University of Nevada has been ranked among the nation&#x27;s most sustainable colleges, receiving an overall grade of &quot;B+&quot; on the Sustainable Endowment Institute&#x27;s College Sustainability Report Card 2010.

==Athletics==

The university is simply called &quot;Nevada&quot; for athletics purposes. Its sports teams are nicknamed the Wolf Pack (always two words). They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I (FBS for football) and in the Mountain West Conference.
===Men&#x27;s basketball===

In March 2004, the Wolf Pack Men&#x27;s basketball team qualified for the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in school history. The team earned a repeat trip in 2005 and beat Texas in the first round before falling to eventual national runner-up Illinois. The team returned for 2006 as a No. 5 seed but was upset in the first round by former Big Sky Conference rival Montana. They began the 2006–07 season ranked #24. The Pack&#x27;s major star during this recent period of success was Nick Fazekas. In 2007, Nevada was ranked No. 9 in men&#x27;s basketball, which is the highest ranking that Nevada has ever held.

===Football===

The football team plays at Mackay Stadium. The modern Mackay Stadium replaced its predecessor and was completed in 1966 with a seating capacity of 7,500. The facility has been expanded several times in its history and now seats 30,000. In 2005, Nevada won a share of the WAC Title. The 2010 season saw Nevada at its best finishing the season ranked No. 11 in the AP and No. 13 in the BCS, stunning Boise State, 34–31, and costing the Broncos a possible shot at the BCS title, to win another share of the WAC title.

===Conference affiliations===
Nevada joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012.

Previous conference memberships include:

* 1954–1968 – Northern California Athletic Conference
* 1969–1978 – West Coast Conference – (Independent for football)
* 1979–1991 – Big Sky (swapped conference affiliations with Gonzaga University, which has been without football since 1941)
* 1992–1998 – Big West
* 1999–2012 – WAC

==Student media==

The university has four official Student Media organizations: The Nevada Sagebrush, Wolf Pack Radio, Insight Magazine (formally Artemisia), and The Brushfire Literature &amp; Arts Journal.

=== Nevada Sagebrush ===
Nevada&#x27;s editorially independent, monthly student newspaper is &quot;The Nevada Sagebrush&quot;. Prior to 2004, the newspaper called itself simply the &quot;Sagebrush&quot;.

The newspaper was given an Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Award for work completed during the 2007–2008, 2008–2009, 2011–2012 and most recently, 2014–15, school years. The newspaper won the Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker award in 2008 and 2009.

=== Wolf Pack Radio ===
Nevada&#x27;s official student-run radio broadcast is Wolf Pack Radio. The station curates songs and creates radio shows for the student population on their official website. The station also partners with KWNK to broadcast the student made radio shows on FM in the Reno area.

=== Insight Magazine ===
The university also sponsors Insight Magazine, the university&#x27;s photography and lifestyle magazine. Insight was previously known as Artemisia Magazine until summer 2008. Under the name Artemisia, the magazine served as the university yearbook since its inception in 1899.

=== Brushfire Literature &amp; Arts Journal ===
The Brushfire was created in 1950 to spread Literature and Arts with Nevada students. 

==Notable alumni and faculty==

<doc id="239277" wikidata="Q973459" url="?curid=239277" title="Killer Instinct (1994 video game)">
<text>Killer Instinct is a 1994 fighting game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. It was originally released for arcades by Midway in October 1994, and ported to both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy the following year. The game&#x27;s plot involves an all-powerful corporation organizing a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.

According to Ken Lobb, during his time at Namco, the groundwork for Killer Instinct started as a Namco&#x27;s fighting game project in the early planning stages, titled &quot;Melee&quot; (which itself later became &quot;Weaponlord&quot;). Aspects of &quot;Killer Instinct&#x27;s&quot; core gameplay were influenced from SNK fighting games, namely both the &quot;World Heroes&quot; and the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, particularly Kim Dragon and Kim Kaphwan characters.

&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; featured more detailed graphics and more diverse characters than any other games of its genre as well as some gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three-rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player&#x27;s life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced &quot;auto-doubles&quot;, a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are &quot;combo breakers&quot;, special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.

A critical and commercial success, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was followed by a sequel, the 1996 arcade game &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;, later ported to the Nintendo 64 as &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot;, as well as a new 2013 game rebooting the franchise, serving as a launch title for the Xbox One. An emulated version of the original game is included with the 2013 game, under the title &quot;Killer Instinct Classic&quot;. The SNES version of the game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online service on February 21, 2024. Retrospective lists by various publications included it among the best fighting games of all time.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; plays like many other fighting games, in which the player controls a character to beat an opponent in a one-on-one encounter. The game borrows the attack set of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and is also inspired by the finishing moves from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. There are also several features that distinguish it from other franchises:
* A double health bar: instead of winning two rounds, each player has two bars of health. The player who depletes the opponent&#x27;s health bar wins the bout, and a player does not recover health upon draining their opponent&#x27;s first health bar.
* Automatic combos: Many combos are automated, after an initial button press sequence.
* Finishing moves: Bearing resemblance to (but being less graphic than) &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s Fatalities, each character has at least two moves known as No Mercy (Danger Move in later revisions) to finish the opponent. Another finisher is the Humiliation, that forces the opponent to dance.
* Ultra Combo: Another finisher, it operates like an Ultimate Combo, though this one allows the character to deliver a long string of hits as the combo finisher instead, usually surpassing 20 hits, and can sometimes reach upwards of 80 hits.
* Combo Breaker: The player who is being caught in a combo may break out of it by performing a combo breaker move. A combo can be broken at either the auto-double or linker stage. After performing a combo breaker, a white starburst will appear at the tip of the breaker&#x27;s current health bar, enabling advanced versions of some special moves that require a different command.

==Plot==
Ultratech is a very powerful megacorporation which organizes a tournament called &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. Along with regular participants, experimental creatures created by Ultratech also fight in the tournament so their strength can be tested. Ultratech also discovers a technology to make bridges between dimensions, and releases a two-headed cyclops, satyr-like monster called Eyedol from his dimensional prison in Limbo.

==Characters==

In addition to the boss Eyedol, the game offers a roster of 10 playable characters: Black Orchid, an agent working to stop Ultratech; Chief Thunder, a Native American chief sent to look for his brother; Cinder, an escaped convict who—due to a failed chemical test—garners a body composed of flame; Fulgore, a cyborg created by Ultratech to stop Jago; Glacius, an alien abducted by Ultratech; Jago, a Tibetan warrior monk guided by the Tiger Spirit; Riptor, a &quot;velociraptor&quot; cloned by Ultratech; Sabrewulf, a man afflicted by lycanthropy; Spinal, the skeleton of an undead warrior; and T.J. Combo, a heavyweight champion boxer stripped of his title after he was discovered to be cheating with enhanced arms instead of natural ones. The Game Boy version omits Cinder and Riptor.

According to &quot;GamePro&quot; in 2010, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; is &quot;remembered for its colorful cast of combatants [including] a velociraptor, a sword-wielding skeleton, a creature made out of ice, and a host of other memorable characters&quot;. In 2012, Topless Robot wrote that it features &quot;one of the most amazing and varied cast of characters ever to grace a fighting game&quot;.

==Development==
The concept of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; dates back to early 1993, when game designer Ken Lobb sketched his concept during his time at Namco, dubbing it &quot;Melee&quot;. He sent his pitch to Namco, but it disapproved of the concept and instead made &quot;Weaponlord&quot; in its place. Lobb took the concept with him to Nintendo of America, where he became head developer. He flew to England and joined Rare, which was planning to rival the success of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper approved of his pitch. In early 1994, Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with WMS Industries, Midway&#x27;s parent company, which enabled Midway to develop and market games using the early arcade-based version of the Ultra 64 platform (later to become a home console and then be renamed to Nintendo 64) and formed a joint venture company called Williams/Nintendo to market Nintendo-exclusive home conversions of these games. &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was announced as the first of these games. The announcement came at a time when Nintendo was still known for its stance against violent video games. To avert speculation that &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; would not be as violent as the title suggests, Nintendo&#x27;s director of marketing George Harrison stated that &quot;Williams would not have entered into this deal if they thought their hands would be tied. We won&#x27;t restrict them in any way&quot;. He added that Nintendo believed that an industry-standard ratings system, which was expected to be in place by the time the home version was released, would make their stance against violent games no longer necessary.

The music was composed by Graeme Norgate and Robin Beanland, their first works for Rare. Beanland and Norgate would later go on to compose the music of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997). Initially released in 1994, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;″s arcade-based Ultra 64 hardware is different than the home console version which would be renamed to Nintendo 64 in 1996. The Ultra 64 arcade is a proprietary hardware platform co-developed by Rare and Midway, and created by Chris Stamper and Pete Cox. This hardware uses a 64-bit MIPS CPU and the Nintendo 64 file format for data structure, but not the Nintendo 64 memory media or graphics technology. The game&#x27;s attract mode advertises plans to be &quot;available for your home in 1995 only on Nintendo Ultra 64&quot;. The game was slated to be part of the North American launch lineup for the system. However, the Nintendo 64&#x27;s release was delayed to December 1996 and the game was converted to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy for 1995 release.

&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; is the first arcade game to use an internal hard disk drive in addition to the game&#x27;s ROMs. This allows it to store massive amounts of data thereby giving it the ability to have more detailed graphics than other games of this genre. The game uses pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, created with Silicon Graphics computers. The backgrounds are stored as a &quot;movie&quot; which adjusts frames based on the players&#x27; movements. &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;″s R4600 processor is clocked at 100 MHz. Unlike most arcade games of the time, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; does not display which version number of the game is being played.

In the SNES port, many of the features found in the arcade version were altered, downgraded, or removed to fit the standard 16-bit format. The graphic detail was vastly reduced, and the character sprites are smaller. The stages with a 3D panning camera were simplified into a 2D panning view using parallax scrolling for the background and a raster effect for the ground or arena, thus simulating a pseudo-3D effect. Zooming and scaling were removed. Some of the stages were redesigned. The full-motion videos that show the characters after a victory were mostly replaced by still images. Voice samples and sound effects were shortened or removed, and the music&#x27;s quality is lower. Most of the characters&#x27; special moves and danger moves were retained, but some of the special graphical effects were removed. Some other modes were added, including a training mode and a tournament mode (used for multi-player purposes).

According to Peter Main, Nintendo&#x27;s vice president of marketing at the time, the game had a marketing budget of $20 million.

== Release ==
The Europe, Australia, Canada, and US releases of the SNES game have black cartridge casing, instead of the standard grey shell. Nintendo made a large-scale advertising campaign.

A Game Boy port was also made, but cuts were necessary due to the system&#x27;s limitations. As a result, neither Cinder nor Riptor are featured, and the moves were severely altered due to the more limited controls of the portable. Unlike the original, the Game Boy version received poorer reviews. The game&#x27;s support for Super Game Boy adds some coloring, and a two player versus match by inserting a second controller.

&quot;Killer Cuts&quot;, an arranged soundtrack CD featuring original music from &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, was released as a pack-in for the SNES release of the game, included with the first 100,000 copies sold in the US and the first 20,000 copies sold in Canada. The soundtrack was digitally re-released as part of a double-album set with the &quot;Killer Instinct: Season One&quot; soundtrack on October 14, 2014.

A digital port of the game&#x27;s arcade version, titled &quot;Killer Instinct Classic&quot;, is available as part of the &quot;Season One Ultra Edition&quot; of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; for the Xbox One. This port was developed by Code Mystics and published by Microsoft Studios, and includes a number of additional features, such as a new training mode, unlockable character sprite galleries and cutscenes, several visual filters, and the ability to play the game in both its original 1.4 revision and its later 1.5D revision. An update in late December 2014 added online multiplayer functionality. The SNES version was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online service on February 21, 2024.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was a commercial hit. In the United States, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported it to be one of the most-popular arcade games in January 1995. By May 1995, the arcade game had received about plays. It went on to be one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1995. , the game sold 17,000 arcade units.

&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; gained critical acclaim. An early 1995 article on the fighting game industry in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated that &quot;for now, the undisputed king at the arcades is &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s not the breakthrough title we&#x27;re all waiting for — and sooner a new genre has to explode. But for the moment at least, Nintendo&#x27;s plans for Ultra 64 seem to be progressing smoothly&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the arcade version of the game an A+ rating.

===Super NES===
The SNES version of the game was also met with positive reviews upon its release and was commercially successful, selling 3.2 million units, with more than 150,000 copies sold in the US on its release day alone and more than one million copies sold by November 23, 1995.

The game&#x27;s use of 3D-rendered models attracted acclaim. &quot;VideoGames&quot; reviewer Tyrone Rodriguez gave the game a score of 8 (Great), preferring it over &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (the other editors&#x27; additional scores being 8–6–6). &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the SNES version of the game an A and praised the quality of the port. Also, the game was also praised for its combo system, soundtrack and controls. &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized that the SNES version suffers from a lower frame rate than the arcade version and is also missing some of its best sounds and graphical effects, and complained that the combo system makes it too easy for experienced players to defeat newcomers with a single chain of hits. They concluded that &quot;this version of &quot;Killer&quot; isn&#x27;t flawless, but it is surprisingly addictive and fun to play&quot;. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were divided, with Andrew Baran commenting that &quot;while it&#x27;s a nice attempt on the Super NES, it wasn&#x27;t the same&quot; as the arcade version, whereas the other three declared it &quot;a superb translation&quot; which has lower quality graphics and sound than the arcade version but retains its content, playability, and overall feel. They scored it a 7.75 out of 10. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the game a review score of 93%, adding: &quot;Rare weren&#x27;t lying when they said the home version would play better than the coin-op: no-one realised they were talking about the SNES!&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Super NES version of the game: &quot;Nintendo and Rare have managed one very impressive trick: getting the 16-bit Super NES to display 512 colors at once, twice the usual number, which gives the graphics an extra gloss&quot;.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; panned the Game Boy version, unanimously concluding it to be &quot;an arcade translation that should never have been attempted on the Game Boy&quot;. They particularly complained of the difficulty in executing moves using only two buttons, the pixelated graphics, and the poor sound. They scored it a 2.5 out of 10. &quot;GamePro&quot;, in contrast, declared it to be second only to the Game Boy version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; among portable fighting games, arguing that the two-button control is &quot;a little awkward but still masterable&quot; and that the graphics are less than outstanding only when unfairly compared to the SNES version.

===Retrospective===
Retrospectively, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was ranked as the 148th best game made on any Nintendo system by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; in 2006, as well as the 95th on a similar list by &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; in 2009. In platform-specific retro lists, it was also ranked as the 19th and 38th best SNES game of all time by ScrewAttack and &quot;GamesRadar&quot; respectively, and as the 13th best arcade game of the 1990s by &quot;Complex&quot;.

&quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was included on several lists of top fighting games of all time, including by ScrewAttack in 2008 (ranked fifth best), &quot;GamePro&quot; that same year (ranked 18th best), and UGO in 2010 (ranked tenth best). In 2004, &quot;GamesTM&quot; called it possibly &quot;the best combo-heavy fighter ever&quot;. In 2009, Virgin Media ranked it as the eighth top fighting game of all time, stating that it was &quot;most famous for having the longest combos in the business&quot;. In 2007, it was voted the sixth top 2D fighting game of all time by CraveOnline users, and ranked the sixth best 2D fighting game of all time by &quot;Complex&quot; in 2013. IGN listed the game at #82nd on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;. In 2018, Complex rated Killer Instinct 53rd in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked Killer Instinct 94th on its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine rated 45th in its Top 100 Video Games. They lauded the game writing: &quot;Graphically stunning, combo-riffic fighter. At the moment, it rules the arcade.&quot;

==Sequels==

A sequel titled &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; was released in 1996. Like the first game, it was ported to a home console, this time to the Nintendo 64 as &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot;.

A new &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, published by Microsoft and developed by Double Helix Games and Iron Galaxy Studios with input from Rare, was released as a launch title for the Xbox One in 2013. Certain releases of the game include the &quot;Killer Instinct Classic&quot; port of the original arcade game and its sequel.

<doc id="239286" wikidata="Q6979811" url="?curid=239286" title="Nationalist terrorism">
<text>Nationalist terrorism is a form of terrorism motivated by a nationalist agenda. Nationalist terrorists seek to form self-determination in some form, which may take the form of gaining greater autonomy, establishing a completely independent sovereign state (separatism), or joining another existing sovereign state with which the nationalists identify (irredentism). Nationalist terrorists often oppose what they consider to be occupying, imperial, or otherwise illegitimate powers. Violence may also be directed at immigrants who are seen as a threat to the prosperity of the local or native population of the country. Nationalist terrorism is linked to a national, ethnic, religious, or other identifying group, and the feeling among members of that group that they are oppressed or denied rights, especially rights accorded to others.

As with the concept of terrorism itself, the term &quot;nationalist terrorism&quot; and its application are highly contentious issues. What constitutes an illegitimate regime and what types of violence and war are acceptable against such a state are subjects of debate. Groups described by some as &quot;nationalist terrorists&quot; tend to consider themselves &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, engaged in valid but asymmetric warfare.

==List of alleged terrorist groups==

The following are nationalist groups, which in some circles have been deemed terrorist:
*Grey Wolves
*Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)
* Pro-khalistan groups
*ETA 
*EOKA
*Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan (PKK)

*Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA)
*Front de libération du Québec (FLQ)
*Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)
*Tamil Tigers (LTTE)
*Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)
*Wawelberg Group
*Lehi
*Irgun
*Chetniks
*Ustashe
*National Bolshevik Front (NBF)

The label of a group as carrying out &quot;nationalist terrorism&quot; does not preclude it being described in other terms:
*Nationalist terrorism may overlap with religiously motivated terrorism, so Palestinian nationalist militant/terrorist groups are also sometimes Islamic (Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad), and Zionist groups are also sometimes Jewish (Kach and Kahane Chai, Gush Emunim Underground).
*Nationalist terrorism may also be identified with the left wing (for example, ETA, LTTE, IRA) or the right wing (AUC, Sombra Negra)

<text>Religious terrorism (or, religious extremism) is a type of religious violence where terrorism is used as a strategy to achieve certain religious goals or which are influenced by religious beliefs and/or identity.

In the modern age, after the decline of ideas such as the divine right of kings and with the rise of nationalism, terrorism has more often been based on anarchism, and revolutionary politics. Since 1980, however, there has been an increase in terrorist activity motivated by religion.

Former United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that terrorist acts in the name of religion and ethnic identity have become &quot;one of the most important security challenges we face in the wake of the Cold War.&quot; However, political scientists Robert Pape and Terry Nardin, social psychologist Brooke Rogers, and sociologist and religious studies scholar Mark Juergensmeyer have all argued that religion should only be considered one incidental factor and that such terrorism is primarily geopolitical.

==Definition==
According to Juergensmeyer, religion and violence have had a symbiotic relationship since before the Crusades and even since before the Bible. He defines religious terrorism as consisting of acts that terrify, the definition of which is provided by the witnesses – the ones terrified – and not by the party committing the act; accompanied by either a religious motivation, justification, organization, or world view. Religion is sometimes used in combination with other factors, and sometimes as the primary motivation. Religious terrorism is intimately connected to current forces of geopolitics.

Bruce Hoffman has characterized modern religious terrorism as having three traits:
* The perpetrators must use religious scriptures to justify or explain their violent acts or to gain recruits.
* Clerical figures must be involved in leadership roles.
* Perpetrators use apocalyptic images of destruction to justify the acts.

==Martyrdom and suicide terrorism==
Important symbolic acts such as the blood sacrifice link acts of violence to religion and terrorism. Suicide terrorism, self-sacrifice, or martyrdom has throughout history been organized and perpetrated by groups with both political and religious motivations. Suicide terrorism or martyrdom is efficient, inexpensive, easily organized, and extremely difficult to counter, delivering maximum damage for little cost. The shocking nature of a suicide attack also attracts public attention. Glorifying the culture of martyrdom benefits the terrorist organization and inspires more people to join the group. According to one commentator, retaliation against suicide attacks increases the group&#x27;s sense of victimization and commitment to adhere to doctrine and policy. This process serves to encourage martyrdom, and so suicide terrorism, self-sacrifice, or martyrdom represent &quot;value for money&quot;. Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, has made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being the foundations of most suicide attacks, which are often labelled as &quot;religious&quot;.

==Financing==

Terrorism activities worldwide are supported through not only the organized systems that teach holy war as the highest calling, but also through the legal, illegal, and often indirect methods financing these systems; these sometimes use organizations, including charities, as fronts to mobilize or channel sources and funds. Charities can involve the provision of aid to those in need, and oblations or charitable offerings are fundamental to nearly all religious systems, with sacrifice as a furtherance of the custom.

==Criticism of the concept==
Robert Pape compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing from 1980 to 2003. He argues that the news reports about suicide attacks are profoundly misleading – &quot;There is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world&#x27;s religions&quot;. After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers&#x27; actions stem from political conflict, not religion.

Michael A. Sheehan stated in 2000, &quot;A number of terrorist groups have portrayed their causes in religious and cultural terms. This is often a transparent tactic designed to conceal political goals, generate popular support and silence opposition.&quot;

Terry Nardin wrote, 
A basic problem is whether religious terrorism really differs, in its character and causes, from political terrorism... defenders of religious terrorism typically reason by applying commonly acknowledged moral principles... But the use (or misuse) of moral arguments does not in fact distinguish religious from nonreligious terrorists, for the latter also rely upon such arguments to justify their acts... political terrorism can also be symbolic... alienation and dispossession... are important in other kinds of violence as well. In short, one wonders whether the expression &#x27;religious terrorism&#x27; is more than a journalistic convenience.
Professor Mark Juergensmeyer wrote, 
...religion is not innocent. But it does not ordinarily lead to violence. That happens only with the coalescence of a peculiar set of circumstances – political, social, and ideological – when religion becomes fused with violent expressions of social aspirations, personal pride, and movements for political change. 
and 
Whether or not one uses &#x27;terrorist&#x27; to describe violent acts depends on whether one thinks that the acts are warranted. To a large extent the use of the term depends on one&#x27;s world view: if the world is perceived as peaceful, violent acts appear to be terrorism. If the world is thought to be at war, violent acts may be regarded as legitimate. They may be seen as preemptive strikes, as defensive tactics in an ongoing battles, or as symbols indicating to the world that it is indeed in a state of grave and ultimate conflict.

David Kupelian wrote, &quot;Genocidal madness can&#x27;t be blamed on a particular philosophy or religion.&quot;

Riaz Hassan wrote, &quot;It is politics more than religious fanaticism that has led terrorists to blow themselves up.&quot;

On July 2, 2013, in Lahore, 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haraam or forbidden.

<text>John Wallis (; ; ) was an English clergyman and mathematician, who is given partial credit for the development of infinitesimal calculus.

Between 1643 and 1689 Wallis served as chief cryptographer for Parliament and, later, the royal court. He is credited with introducing the symbol ∞ to represent the concept of infinity. He similarly used 1/∞ for an infinitesimal. He was a contemporary of Newton and one of the greatest intellectuals of the early renaissance of mathematics.

== Life ==

John Wallis was born in Ashford, Kent. He was the third of five children of Revd. John Wallis and Joanna Chapman. He was initially educated at a school in Ashford but moved to James Movat&#x27;s school in Tenterden in 1625 following an outbreak of plague. Wallis was first exposed to mathematics in 1631, at Felsted School (then known as Martin Holbeach&#x27;s school in Felsted); he enjoyed maths, but his study was erratic, since &quot;mathematics, at that time with us, were scarce looked on as academical studies, but rather mechanical&quot; (Scriba 1970). At the school in Felsted, Wallis learned how to speak and write Latin. By this time, he also was proficient in French, Greek, and Hebrew. As it was intended he should be a doctor, he was sent in 1632 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there, he kept an &quot;act&quot; on the doctrine of the circulation of the blood; that was said to have been the first occasion in Europe on which this theory was publicly maintained in a disputation. His interests, however, centred on mathematics. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1637 and a Master&#x27;s in 1640, afterwards entering the priesthood. From 1643 to 1649, he served as a nonvoting scribe at the Westminster Assembly. He was elected to a fellowship at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge in 1644, from which he had to resign following his marriage.

Throughout this time, Wallis had been close to the Parliamentarian party, perhaps as a result of his exposure to Holbeach at Felsted School. He rendered them great practical assistance in deciphering Royalist dispatches. The quality of cryptography at that time was mixed; despite the individual successes of mathematicians such as François Viète, the principles underlying cipher design and analysis were very poorly understood. Most ciphers were ad hoc methods relying on a secret algorithm, as opposed to systems based on a variable key. Wallis realised that the latter were far more secure – even describing them as &quot;unbreakable&quot;, though he was not confident enough in this assertion to encourage revealing cryptographic algorithms. He was also concerned about the use of ciphers by foreign powers, refusing, for example, Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s request of 1697 to teach Hanoverian students about cryptography.

Returning to London – he had been made chaplain at St Gabriel Fenchurch in 1643 – Wallis joined the group of scientists that was later to evolve into the Royal Society. He was finally able to indulge his mathematical interests, mastering William Oughtred&#x27;s &quot;Clavis Mathematicae&quot; in a few weeks in 1647. He soon began to write his own treatises, dealing with a wide range of topics, which he continued for the rest of his life. Wallis wrote the first survey about mathematical concepts in England where he discussed the Hindu-Arabic system.

Wallis joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of Charles I, by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford University, where he lived until his death on . In 1650, Wallis was ordained as a minister. After, he spent two years with Sir Richard Darley and Lady Vere as a private chaplain. In 1661, he was one of twelve Presbyterian representatives at the Savoy Conference.

Besides his mathematical works he wrote on theology, logic, English grammar and philosophy, and he was involved in devising a system for teaching a deaf boy to speak at Littlecote House. William Holder had earlier taught a deaf man, Alexander Popham, to speak &quot;plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone&quot;. Wallis later claimed credit for this, leading Holder to accuse Wallis of &quot;rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls&quot;.

=== Wallis&#x27; appointment as Savilian Professor of Geometry at the Oxford University ===
The Parliamentary visitation of Oxford, that began in 1647, removed many senior academics from their positions, including in November 1648, the Savilian Professors of Geometry and Astronomy. In 1649 Wallis was appointed as Savilian Professor of Geometry. Wallis seems to have been chosen largely on political grounds (as perhaps had been his Royalist predecessor Peter Turner, who despite his appointment to two professorships never published any mathematical works); while Wallis was perhaps the nation&#x27;s leading cryptographer and was part of an informal group of scientists that would later become the Royal Society, he had no particular reputation as a mathematician. Nonetheless, Wallis&#x27; appointment proved richly justified by his subsequent work during the 54 years he served as Savilian Professor.

== Contributions to mathematics ==

Wallis made significant contributions to trigonometry, calculus, geometry, and the analysis of infinite series. In his &quot;Opera Mathematica&quot; I (1695) he introduced the term &quot;continued fraction&quot;.

===Analytic geometry===
In 1655, Wallis published a treatise on conic sections in which they were defined analytically. This was the earliest book in which these curves are considered and defined as curves of the second degree. It helped to remove some of the perceived difficulty and obscurity of René Descartes&#x27; work on analytic geometry.

In &quot;Treatise on the Conic Sections&quot;, Wallis popularised the symbol ∞ for infinity. He wrote, &quot;I suppose any plane (following the &quot;Geometry of Indivisibles&quot; of Cavalieri) to be made up of an infinite number of parallel lines, or as I would prefer, of an infinite number of parallelograms of the same altitude; (let the altitude of each one of these be an infinitely small part 1/∞ of the whole altitude, and let the symbol ∞ denote Infinity) and the altitude of all to make up the altitude of the figure.&quot;

===Integral calculus===
&quot;Arithmetica Infinitorum&quot;, the most important of Wallis&#x27;s works, was published in 1656. In this treatise the methods of analysis of Descartes and Cavalieri were systematised and extended, but some ideas were open to criticism. He began, after a short tract on conic sections, by developing the standard notation for powers, extending them from positive integers to rational numbers:

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7

Leaving the numerous algebraic applications of this discovery, he next proceeded to find, by integration, the area enclosed between the curve &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;, &quot;x&quot;-axis, and any ordinate &quot;x&quot; = &quot;h&quot;, and he proved that the ratio of this area to that of the parallelogram on the same base and of the same height is 1/(&quot;m&quot; + 1), extending Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula. He apparently assumed that the same result would be true also for the curve &quot;y&quot; = &quot;ax&quot;&quot;m&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is any constant, and &quot;m&quot; any number positive or negative, but he discussed only the case of the parabola in which &quot;m&quot; = 2 and the hyperbola in which &quot;m&quot; = −1. In the latter case, his interpretation of the result is incorrect. He then showed that similar results may be written down for any curve of the form

:formula_8

and hence that, if the ordinate &quot;y&quot; of a curve can be expanded in powers of &quot;x&quot;, its area can be determined: thus he says that if the equation of the curve is &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;0 + &quot;x&quot;1 + &quot;x&quot;2 + ..., its area would be &quot;x&quot; + x2/2 + &quot;x&quot;3/3 + ... . He then applied this to the quadrature of the curves , , , etc., taken between the limits &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1. He shows that the areas are, respectively, 1, 1/6, 1/30, 1/140, etc. He next considered curves of the form and established the theorem that the area bounded by this curve and the lines &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1 is equal to the area of the rectangle on the same base and of the same altitude as &quot;m&quot; : &quot;m&quot; + 1. This is equivalent to computing

:formula_9

He illustrated this by the parabola, in which case &quot;m&quot; = 2. He stated, but did not prove, the corresponding result for a curve of the form &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;.

Wallis showed considerable ingenuity in reducing the equations of curves to the forms given above, but, as he was unacquainted with the binomial theorem, he could not effect the quadrature of the circle, whose equation is formula_10, since he was unable to expand this in powers of &quot;x&quot;. He laid down, however, the principle of interpolation. Thus, as the ordinate of the circle formula_10 is the geometrical mean of the ordinates of the curves formula_12 and formula_13, it might be supposed that, as an approximation, the area of the semicircle formula_14 which is formula_15 might be taken as the geometrical mean of the values of

:formula_16

that is, formula_17 and formula_18; this is equivalent to taking formula_19 or 3.26... as the value of π. But, Wallis argued, we have in fact a series formula_20... and therefore the term interpolated between formula_17 and formula_22 ought to be chosen so as to obey the law of this series. This, by an elaborate method that is not described here in detail, leads to a value for the interpolated term which is equivalent to taking
:formula_23
(which is now known as the Wallis product).

In this work the formation and properties of continued fractions are also discussed, the subject having been brought into prominence by Brouncker&#x27;s use of these fractions.

A few years later, in 1659, Wallis published a tract containing the solution of the problems on the cycloid which had been proposed by Blaise Pascal. In this he incidentally explained how the principles laid down in his &quot;Arithmetica Infinitorum&quot; could be used for the rectification of algebraic curves and gave a solution of the problem to rectify (i.e., find the length of) the semicubical parabola &quot;x&quot;3 = &quot;ay&quot;2, which had been discovered in 1657 by his pupil William Neile. Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The logarithmic spiral had been rectified by Evangelista Torricelli and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel. The cycloid was the next curve rectified; this was done by Christopher Wren in 1658.

Early in 1658 a similar discovery, independent of that of Neile, was made by van Heuraët, and this was published by van Schooten in his edition of Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Geometria&quot; in 1659. Van Heuraët&#x27;s method is as follows. He supposes the curve to be referred to rectangular axes; if this is so, and if (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) are the coordinates of any point on it, and &quot;n&quot; is the length of the normal, and if another point whose coordinates are (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;η&quot;) is taken such that &quot;η&quot; : &quot;h&quot; = &quot;n&quot; : &quot;y&quot;, where &quot;h&quot; is a constant; then, if &quot;ds&quot; is the element of the length of the required curve, we have by similar triangles &quot;ds&quot; : &quot;dx&quot; = &quot;n&quot; : &quot;y&quot;. Therefore, &quot;h ds&quot; = &quot;η&quot; &quot;dx&quot;. Hence, if the area of the locus of the point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;η&quot;) can be found, the first curve can be rectified. In this way van Heuraët effected the rectification of the curve &quot;y&quot;3 = &quot;ax&quot;2 but added that the rectification of the parabola &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;ax&quot; is impossible since it requires the quadrature of the hyperbola. The solutions given by Neile and Wallis are somewhat similar to that given by van Heuraët, though no general rule is enunciated, and the analysis is clumsy. A third method was suggested by Fermat in 1660, but it is inelegant and laborious.

===Collision of bodies===
The theory of the collision of bodies was propounded by the Royal Society in 1668 for the consideration of mathematicians. Wallis, Christopher Wren, and Christiaan Huygens sent correct and similar solutions, all depending on what is now called the conservation of momentum; but, while Wren and Huygens confined their theory to perfectly elastic bodies (elastic collision), Wallis considered also imperfectly elastic bodies (inelastic collision). This was followed in 1669 by a work on statics (centres of gravity), and in 1670 by one on dynamics: these provide a convenient synopsis of what was then known on the subject.

===Algebra===
In 1685 Wallis published &quot;Algebra&quot;, preceded by a historical account of the development of the subject, which contains a great deal of valuable information. The second edition, issued in 1693 and forming the second volume of his &quot;Opera&quot;, was considerably enlarged. This algebra is noteworthy as containing the first systematic use of formulae. A given magnitude is here represented by the numerical ratio which it bears to the unit of the same kind of magnitude: thus, when Wallis wants to compare two lengths he regards each as containing so many units of length. This perhaps will be made clearer by noting that the relation between the space described in any time by a particle moving with a uniform velocity is denoted by Wallis by the formula

:&quot;s&quot; = &quot;vt&quot;,

where &quot;s&quot; is the number representing the ratio of the space described to the unit of length; while the previous writers would have denoted the same relation by stating what is equivalent to the proposition

:&quot;s&quot;1 : &quot;s&quot;2 = &quot;v&quot;1&quot;t&quot;1 : &quot;v&quot;2&quot;t&quot;2.

===Number line===
Wallis has been credited as the originator of the number line &quot;for negative quantities&quot; and &quot;for operational purposes.&quot; This is based on a passage in his 1685 treatise on algebra in which he introduced a number line to illustrate the legitimacy of negative quantities:

Yet is not that Supposition (of Negative Quantities) either Unuseful or Absurd; when rightly understood. And though, as to the bare Algebraick Notation, it import a Quantity less than nothing: Yet, when it comes to a Physical Application, it denotes as Real a Quantity as if the Sign were formula_24; but to be interpreted in a contrary sense... formula_25, signifies formula_26 Yards Forward; and formula_27, signifies formula_26 Yards Backward.

It has been noted that, in an earlier work, Wallis came to the conclusion that the ratio of a positive number to a negative one is greater than infinity. The argument involves the quotient formula_29 and considering what happens as formula_30 approaches and then crosses the point formula_31 from the positive side. Wallis was not alone in this thinking: Leonhard Euler came to the same conclusion by considering the geometric series formula_32, evaluated at formula_33, followed by reasoning similar to Wallis&#x27;s (he resolved the paradox by distinguishing different kinds of negative numbers).

===Geometry===
He is usually credited with the proof of the Pythagorean theorem using similar triangles. However, Thabit Ibn Qurra (AD 901), an Arab mathematician, had produced a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem applicable to all triangles six centuries earlier. It is a reasonable conjecture that Wallis was aware of Thabit&#x27;s work.

Wallis was also inspired by the works of Islamic mathematician Sadr al-Tusi, the son of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, particularly by al-Tusi&#x27;s book written in 1298 on the parallel postulate. The book was based on his father&#x27;s thoughts and presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. After reading this, Wallis then wrote about his ideas as he developed his own thoughts about the postulate, trying to prove it also with similar triangles.

He found that Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate is equivalent to the one currently named &quot;Wallis postulate&quot; after him. This postulate states that &quot;On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle&quot;. This result was encompassed in a trend trying to deduce Euclid&#x27;s fifth from the other four postulates which today is known to be impossible. Unlike other authors, he realised that the unbounded growth of a triangle was not guaranteed by the four first postulates.

===Calculator===
Another aspect of Wallis&#x27;s mathematical skills was his ability to do mental calculations. He slept badly and often did mental calculations as he lay awake in his bed. One night he calculated in his head the square root of a number with 53 digits. In the morning he dictated the 27-digit square root of the number, still entirely from memory. It was a feat that was considered remarkable, and Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society, sent a colleague to investigate how Wallis did it. It was considered important enough to merit discussion in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society of 1685.

== Musical theory ==
Wallis translated into Latin works of Ptolemy and Bryennius, and Porphyrius&#x27;s commentary on Ptolemy. He also published three letters to Henry Oldenburg concerning tuning. He approved of equal temperament, which was being used in England&#x27;s organs.

==Other works==
His &quot;Institutio logicae&quot;, published in 1687, was very popular. The &quot;Grammatica linguae Anglicanae&quot; was a work on English grammar, that remained in print well into the eighteenth century. He also published on theology.

==Wallis as cryptographer==
While employed as lady Vere&#x27;s chaplain in 1642 Wallis was given an enciphered letter about the fall of Chicester which he managed to decipher within two hours. This started his career as a cryptographer. He was a moderate supporter of the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War and therefore worked as a decipherer of intercepted correspondence for the Parliamentarian leaders. For his services he was rewarded with the Livings of St. Gabriel and St. Martin&#x27;s in London.

Because of his Parliamentarian sympathies Wallis was not employed as a cryptographer after the Stuart Restoration, but after the Glorious Revolution he was sought out by lord Nottingham and frequently employed to decipher encrypted intercepted correspondence, though he thought that he was not always adequately rewarded for his work. King William III from 1689 also employed Wallis as a cryptographer, sometimes almost on a daily basis. Couriers would bring him letters to be decrypted and waited in front of his study for the product. The king took a personal interest in Wallis&#x27; work and well-being as witnessed by a letter he sent to Dutch Grand pensionary Anthonie Heinsius in 1689.

In these early days of the Williamite reign directly obtaining foreign intercepted letters was a problem for the English, as they did not have the resources of foreign &quot;Black Chambers&quot; as yet, but allies like the Elector of Brandenburg without their own Black Chambers occasionally made gifts of such intercepted correspondence, like the letter of king Louis XIV of France to king John III Sobieski of Poland that king William in 1689 used to cause a crisis in French-Polish diplomatic relations. He was quite open about it and Wallis was rewarded for his role. But Wallis became nervous that the French might take action against him.

Wallis relationship with the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was cordial. But Leibniz also had cryptographic interests and tried to get Wallis to divulge some of his trade secrets, which Wallis declined to do as a matter of patriotic principle.

Smith gives an example of the painstaking work that Wallis performed, as described by himself in a letter to Richard Hampden of 3 August 1689. In it he gives a detailed account of his work on a particular letter and the parts he had encountered difficulties with.

Wallis&#x27; correspondence also shows details of the way he stood up for himself, when he thought he was under-appreciated, financially or otherwise. He lobbied enthusiastically, both on his own behalf, and that of his relatives, as witnessed by letters to Lord Nottingham, Richard Hampden and the MP Harbord Harbord that Smith quotes. In a letter to the English envoy to Prussia, James Johnston Wallis bitterly complains that a courtier of the Prussian Elector, by the name of Smetteau, had done him wrong in the matter of just compensation for services rendered to the Elector. In the letter he gives details of what he had done and gives advice on a simple substitution cipher for the use of Johnston himself.

Wallis&#x27; contributions to the art of cryptography were not only of a &quot;technological&quot; character. De Leeuw points out that even the &quot;purely scientific&quot; contributions of Wallis to the science of linguistics in the field of the &quot;rationality&quot; of Natural language as it developed over time, played a role in the development of cryptology as a science. Wallis&#x27; development of a model of English grammar, independent of earlier models based on Latin grammar, is a case in point of the way other sciences helped develop cryptology in his view.

Wallis tried to teach his own son John, and his grandson by his daughter Anne, William Blencowe the tricks of the trade. With William he was so successful that he could persuade the government to allow the grandson to get the survivorship of the annual pension of £100 Wallis had received in compensation for his cryptographic work.

William Blencowe eventually succeeded Wallis as official Cryptographer to Queen Anne after Wallis&#x27; death in 1703.

<text>The Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (, SP; ), also called the Swiss Socialist Party (; , PS), is a political party in Switzerland. The SP has had two representatives on the Federal Council since 1960 and received the second-highest number of votes in the 2023 Swiss federal election.

The SP was founded on 21 October 1888 and is currently the second-largest of the four leading coalition political parties in Switzerland. It is the only left-leaning party with representatives on the Federal Council, positioning itself at the centre-left. Currently, Élisabeth Baume-Schneider and Beat Jans represent the party. As of January 2024, the SP is the second-largest political party in the Federal Assembly.

Amongst all pro-European parties in Switzerland the SP is the largest and unlike most other Swiss parties, the SP supports Swiss membership in the European Union. Additionally, it supports labour rights and tax incentives for companies that offer shares to employees. The party is a member of the Progressive Alliance and an associate member of the Party of European Socialists.

== History ==

Before the establishment of the national SP, there were various 19th-century labour movements in Switzerland such as the Grütli Union, the Swiss Trade Union Federation and several local social democratic parties. Most of these labour parties only lasted a short time, until the foundation of the Social Democratic Party on 21 October 1888 (the Swiss Labour Day). Albert Steck of Bern composed the party&#x27;s platform which emphasised democracy, rejected revolutionary aspirations, and mandated a democratic solution to the social question. The first party president was Alexander Reichel of Bern.

Two years after the party&#x27;s foundation, Jakob Vogelsanger was the first Social Democrat to be elected to the National Council. In 1904, the moderate party platform was replaced at a party conference in Aarau with a Marxist program written by Otto Lang. The first-past-the-post voting system for elections to the National Council and the borders of the electorates initially prevented the party from achieving serious political power on the national level, despite growing numbers of supporters. Two popular initiatives for the introduction of a proportional voting system were rejected.

The party&#x27;s historical archives are hosted today by the Swiss Social Archives, which was founded in 1906 by Paul Pflüger. At a 1912 party conference in Neuchâtel, the question of women&#x27;s suffrage was debated for the first time. The SP accepted a proposal that committed the party to take any opportunity to &quot;agitate for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage.&quot;

=== Interwar period ===
Although Switzerland remained neutral in the First World War, it did not avoid the spiralling economic crisis that accompanied it. The resulting social tension was unleashed in 1918 by the labour unions and the SP who organised the 1918 Swiss general strike. The goal of the strike was a fundamental reorganisation of society. The Federal Council issued an ultimatum to the strikers and allowed the military occupation of central points. In this way the strike was ended after four days. Political action was quickly taken to conciliate the strikers with the introduction of a 48-hour working week and a popular initiative on proportional elections to the National Council in the 1918 Swiss referendums which passed on 13 October 1918. In the 1919 Swiss federal election, the SP doubled its mandate from 20 to 41 members.

With the third party platform, adopted in 1920, disagreement within the party grew ever greater. In particular the fact that the platform called for the foundation of a dictatorship of the proletariat during the transitional phase from a capitalist class-based society to a socialist commune sparked violent dispute within the party. In 1921, the party decided not to join the Communist International. The left-wing of the party then split from the SP and founded the Communist Party of Switzerland. In 1926, the SP joined the Labour and Socialist International and continued to be a member of until 1940.

With increasing power in parliament, the party now also demanded membership of the government, but their candidate in 1929 was not elected to the Federal Council. On the other hand, the party managed to enter the executive at a cantonal level in 1933. Geneva was the first canton to have a socialist government, with Léon Nicole as president. In the fourth party platform, promulgated in 1935, the SP rejected the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but supporting the creation of a socialist society on &quot;free and consensual foundations&quot; remained the party&#x27;s goal.

=== In government ===

In the 1943 Swiss federal election, the SP achieved the greatest electoral success in its history and became the largest parliamentary group. Ernst Nobs was the first member of SP to be elected to the Federal Council. With introduction of the , a further demand dating back to the time of the Landesstreik was achieved. After the failure of an SP referendum on economic reforms in 1953, the SP member of the Federal Council, Max Weber, and the general-secretary, David Farbstein, resigned. The SP remained in opposition until the introduction of the &quot;magic formula&quot; in 1959, which gave it two seats on the Federal Council. Since that time the SP has been a member of the grand coalition which governs Switzerland. In 1959, the fifth party platform was also agreed in which the party committed itself to reformist socialism on &quot;democratic foundations&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the SP gained new followers from the new social movements that arose from the protests of 1968, but lost part of their traditional voter base in the working class. This change led to fierce internal disputes and led to a decline in electoral success. After serious losses in the 1987 Swiss federal election, the SP was only the third-largest party in the National Council. This resulted in the foundation of a breakaway Democratic-Social Party, which was not a success.

The sixth party platform was promulgated in 1982. This presented the party as a modern people&#x27;s party that supported democratic socialism and had social justice as its highest goal. In 1983, the SP nominated Lilian Uchtenhagen as their candidate for the Federal Council, the first time that a woman had been a candidate. The parliamentary majority elected Otto Stich instead. Part of the party demanded that the SP withdraw from the governing coalition as a result of this, but this was rejected by a party conference. Ten years later in March 1993, Ruth Dreifuss was elected as the first SD woman to serve in the Federal Council. On that occasion too, the United Federal Assembly did not choose the official candidate of the SP (Christiane Brunner), but the unofficial candidate Dreifuss (the ).

In 1990, the SP party conference accepted Switzerland&#x27;s accession to the International Monetary Fund with clear conditions and elected the Valais canton councillor, Peter Bodenmann, as party president. At the 1992 party conference in Genf, the SP decided to support accession to the European Economic Area as a first step towards membership of the European Economic Community and endorsed a drug policy involving the decriminalisation of drug consumption, controlled sale of drugs for medicinal purposes, and eventual legalisation of drugs. The following year, the SP supported the national people&#x27;s initiative &quot;for a reasonable drug policy&quot; which envisioned the legalisation of cannabis. The SP supported the 1994 national initiative &quot;for the protection of the Alps&quot; which sought a substantial shift of transport of goods through the Alps from road to rail. After Otto Stich&#x27;s resignation from the Federal Council in 1995, the Federal Councillor Moritz Leuenberger was elected as his successor. In the 1995 Swiss federal election, the SP made a substantial recovery and was once again the largest party in the Federal Council.

In June 1997, the party conference chose Zurich city councillor, Ursula Koch as party president (the first woman to hold the role), rather than the favourite . In the 1999 Swiss federal election, Koch was also elected to the Federal Council. She resigned as party president and Federal councillor in 2000, due to internal party pressure. Her successor was Christiane Brunner, who led the party until 2004.

In the 2007 Swiss federal election, the SP suffered massive losses, falling to 19.5% of the vote, with only 43 seats in the National Council. In the following federal elections (2011 and 2015), their electoral support remained at the same level. In the Council of States, where the SP traditionally have had only a few seats, the party was able to increase its representation over the 2000s and now hold 12 out of 46 seats. In 2017, the party withdrew from the Socialist International and joined the Progressive Alliance. After losing a large vote share in the 2019 elections to the green party the SP regained some of its 2019 losses in the most recent 2023 elections and currently holds 41 seats on the National Council obtaining 18.27% of the vote.

== Structure ==

The SP is composed of around 900 sections across Switzerland, which exist at cantonal and municipal levels. Each of the 32,000 party members are registered in a local section and thus are members of both the cantonal and national parties. Local sections elect delegates to attend the regular party members&#x27; conferences; these delegates are entitled to vote in cantonal party conferences.

Each of the 26 cantonal sections (Valais is divided into two sections, namely &quot;Oberwallis&quot; and &quot;Valais Romand&quot;) elect delegates for national party conferences. The number of delegates for each canton is equivalent to the number of seats that the canton has in the National Assembly.

The SP has a youth party called the Young Socialists Switzerland (JUSO/JS). The JS are independent of the SP in political terms but are supported by it financially and institutionally. Within the SP, the JS are seen as equivalent to a cantonal section and so they are entitled to send some delegates to party conferences. As of 2022, the president of the JS is Nicola Siegrist. There is also a separate, smaller SP youth party called Junge SP in the Olten region.

== Ideology ==
The SP supports classical social democratic policies, as well as some democratic socialist ones, and has been described as one of the more left-leaning social democratic parties in Europe. To that rule, the SP stands for a government offering strong public services. The SP is against far-reaching economic liberalism and has anti-capitalist tendencies, and is in favor of social progressivism, environmental policy with climate change mitigation, for an open foreign policy and a national security policy based on pacifism.

In economic, financial, and social welfare policy, the SP rejects policies of economic liberalisation such as deregulation, lowering taxes for high-income citizens, and decreases in government spending on social insurance. The SP also opposes raising the retirement age. In addition, the SP is a proponent of increasing welfare spending in some areas such as for a publicly financed maternity leave, universal health care and a flexible retirement age. In tax policy, the SP opposes the notion of lowering taxes for high-income citizens. By campaigning for the harmonisation of all tax rates in Switzerland, the SP seeks more redistribution. The SP is skeptical toward the privatization of state enterprises. Nonetheless, the SP also promotes more competition in the areas of agriculture and parallel imports.

In social policy, the SP is committed to social equity and an open society. The SP aims at making working conditions for women in families easier by promoting more external childcare centers and more opportunities for part-time jobs. It also aims at reinforcing sexual equality in terms of eliminating wage differences based on gender, supports civil union for Same-sex couples and takes an easier stance toward abortions. The SP also rejects strengthening restrictions on asylum seekers and immigrants. The party supports the integration of immigrants by which the immigrants are assigned to immigration procedures immediately after entering the country. The SP has a liberal stance toward drugs and is in favor of publicly regulated heroin consumption and the legalization of cannabis. Nevertheless, the SP supports the smoking ban in restaurants and bars.

In foreign policy, the SP promotes further participation by Switzerland in international organizations. It supports immediate entry of Switzerland into the European Union, while recently supported EU bilateral accords The SP also stands for a less strict neutrality of Switzerland, and supports increased international efforts on the part of Switzerland in the areas of peace and human rights. However, the SP supports keeping the military neutrality and opposes entry into NATO. Its pacifist stance is also reflected in its military policy as the SP supports reducing the number of Swiss militia while making the military apparatus more professional and scrapping conscription. Another demand of the SP is to end the tradition of gun ownership, using severe and recent examples of abuse in terms of murder as proof.

The SP has common environmentalist policies with the Green Party of Switzerland which are reflected in the expansion of ecotax reforms and increased state support for energy saving measures and renewable energies. The SP is against the construction of new roads where possible and instead proposes to shift the transportation of goods from the roads to the railways and the introduction of a cap and trade and traffic management system when it comes to transportation across the Swiss Alps. Furthermore, the SP stands for an expansion of the public transportation system network and opposes nuclear power.

== Electoral performance ==
In 2003, the party held 52 mandates out of 200 in the National Council (lower chamber of the Swiss parliament); nine out of 46 in the Council of States (upper chamber) and two out of seven mandates in the Federal Council (executive body). By 2005, it held 23.8% of the seats in the Cantonal governments and 23.2% in the Cantonal parliaments (index BADAC, weighted with the population and number of seats). At the 2023 Swiss federal election, the party won 18.27% of the popular vote and 41 out of 200 seats on the National Council.

<text>Luis Vigoreaux Lorenzana Jr. (born July 1, 1951) is a Puerto Rican actor and producer. He is the son of Luis Vigoreaux, a Puerto Rican media personality and Rosaura Lorenzana Vilches. He is the brother of Roberto Vigoreaux, local senator, television producer, actor, singer, marketing executive, telecommunications technician and entrepreneur.

==Personal life==
Vigoreaux enjoys a close friendship with José Carlos Agrelot, the elder son of Puerto Rican comedian José Miguel Agrelot. Their fathers were best friends and working together at a show the day Luisito and José Jr. were born. Vigoreaux and Jose Jr. were born in the same hospital on the same day. Both of their fathers were eventually buried at the same cemetery after their deaths, just metres from each other.

Vigoreaux and his brother Roberto were deeply impacted by the premature death of their mother, Rosaura, due to cancer when they were young. Their father, Luis Vigoreaux, began a relationship with actress Lydia Echevarria while he and his first wife, Rosaura, were still married. Their father eventually left their mother for Echevarria, a fact that caused much friction in the Vigoreaux home. Through his father, Vigoreaux has two other siblings; sisters Vanessa Vigoreaux, an occasional theatrical actress, and Glendalys Vigoreaux.

Vigoreaux followed his younger brother, who began acting as a child for Disney, into acting. As they came of age, both Vigoreaux brothers, Luisito particularly, worked closely with their father on his TV productions.

===Luis Vigoreaux Sr.&#x27;s Death===

In January 1983 Vigoreaux&#x27;s father was found murdered, burned to death inside the trunk of his car. At the time, Vigoreaux had been working with his father on a new TV show named &quot;A Millón&quot;, for WAPA-TV. Aspiring to become a producer, Vigoreaux was to assist his father with production for the show; however, with his father&#x27;s death, he became the show&#x27;s main producer. Under Vigoreaux, &quot;A Millón&quot;, became the #1 game show for several years, hosted by Hector Marcano, Sonia Noemí, and Rafael Jose.

In 1984, Vigoreaux&#x27;s stepmother Echevarría was accused of the murder of Luis Vigoreaux as a conspirator. Vigoreaux and his brother&#x27;s contempt for their step-mother became obvious when they opposed the commutation of her sentence. Governor Pedro Rossello eventually commuted her 208-year sentence, after serving 13 years.

Puerto Rican tabloids have speculated about the relationship between Vigoreaux, Roberto, and their sisters. Many believed due to their extensive history, there was friction, which Vigoreaux denied. Vigoreaux and his sisters have appeared together on public outings on several occasions. On July 15, 2008, Vigoreaux&#x27;s sister Glendalys committed suicide in Glendale, Arizona .

===Relationships===
Long after his divorce from second wife, Marisol Gallisá, Vigoreaux married Dana Miró, also a show host and daughter of Telemundo Puerto Rico&#x27;s show host Eddie Miró.

==Role as a media producer==

It wasn&#x27;t until 1984 that Vigoreaux stepped into the public light when he co-hosted a daily game show with his brother Roberto called &quot;Parejo, Doble y Triple&quot; (&quot;Square, Double and Triple&quot;), at WAPA-TV. Vigoreaux&#x27;s appearance on this show dramatically increased his popularity within Puerto Rico.

In 1986, both Luisito and his brother Roberto appeared in a Burger King commercial for the Puerto Rican market, where they acted and sang.

Vigoreaux went on to host other shows such as &quot;Sabado en Grande&quot; (&quot;Big Saturday&quot;, also with Roberto), &quot;El Show del Mediodía&quot; (&quot;The Midday Show&quot;) and &quot;De Magazin&quot;, one of several successful media partnerships with talent agent and former beauty queen Desiree Lowry. He has since hosted, co-hosted and/or produced several other shows, both on television and radio. His most controversial show has been &quot;Sunshine&#x27;s Café&quot;, a comedy show starring Sunshine Logroño that aired in the mid-to late 1980s.

Vigoreaux co-hosted a TV show named Ruben &amp; Co. along with Millie Cangiano.

, he was a co-host of a cooking show named &quot;Conecta&#x27;os por la Cocina&quot; along with Bizcocho, another legendary Puerto Rican television personality.

===The &quot;Vigoreaux Trademark&quot;===
Vigoreaux is famous for his sometimes self-deprecating sense of humor and blatant frankness. After being convicted once of a DUI charge in 1989, he was parodied by fellow actors, who even played Pedro Flores&#x27; &quot;Borracho No Vale&quot; (&quot;Being Drunk Doesn&#x27;t Count&quot;) as a theme song for Luisito. Not only did he play along with the joke, he refers humorously to the conviction to this day.

Vigoreaux is also known for using profanity occasionally in public. This, plus his uncompromising attitude, has earned him the reputation of being Puerto Rican television&#x27;s &quot;enfant terrible&quot;; a title which he is reportedly proud of. Because both Vigoreaux and his brother have humorous tendencies to be foul-mouthed they&#x27;ve earned the &quot;El Vigoreaux Trademark&quot; designation by fellow entertainers. Sunshine Logroño jokingly refers to Vigoreaux as &quot;Luisito &#x27;Satanás&#x27; (Satan) Vigoreaux&quot;.

<text>Florida State University (FSU or Florida State) is a public research university in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida and a preeminent university in the state. Chartered in 1851, it is located on Florida&#x27;s oldest continuous site of higher education.
Florida State University maintains 17 colleges, as well as 58 centers, facilities, labs, institutes, and professional training programs. In 2023, the university enrolled 43,701 students from all 50 states and 135 countries. Florida State is home to Florida&#x27;s only national laboratory, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, and was instrumental in the commercial development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol. Florida State University also operates the John &amp; Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the nation&#x27;s largest museum/university complexes. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).
The university is classified &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The university had research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures of $414 million. Per 2022 National Science Foundation data the university ranked 82nd out of 890 evaluated institutions. The university has an annual budget of $3 billion and an annual estimated economic impact of $15.5 billion.

Florida State has a collaborative relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and is allowed to use the name Seminoles and certain imagery. FSU&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, known by their &quot;Florida State Seminoles&quot; nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Florida State&#x27;s varsity teams have won 19 all-time national athletic championships in nine sports.

==History==

Florida State University is traceable to a plan set by the 1823 U.S. Congress to create a higher education system. The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the primary system by providing for land allocated for the schools. In 1845 Congress passed the law admitting Florida as the 27th state. In a supplementary act to the law granting admission, Congress authorized two townships to host seminaries, one east and one west of the Suwannee River.
In 1851, the Florida Legislature authorized the seminaries to be awarded to the two towns offering the best school support. The legislature declared the first purpose of these institutions was to train male and female teachers in all subjects generally taught at public schools, then to educate the public in agriculture, science, law and citizenship.
While the East Seminary was settled in Ocala in 1853, the West Seminary state institution opportunity created a contentious fight between the towns of Quincy, Marianna, and Tallahassee. Quincy dropped out of the competition in the following years, while Marianna and Tallahassee refused to yield. Failing to resolve the impasse, the conflict was returned to the governor and legislature for resolution. In 1854, as an incentive to the state, Tallahassee re-established an old school for boys, now called the Florida Institute, and combined the school with land and buildings. The legislature finally awarded Tallahassee with the West Seminary in 1856. The governor signed the law on January 1, 1857. In October 1858 the school was made coeducational by incorporating the Female Institute, which was located nearby.
The West Florida Seminary was located on the former Florida Institute property. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee.
===Civil War and Reconstruction===
During 1860–1861, the legislature amended the 1851 law and started military instruction for students, partly due to the desire to protect the instructional staff from conscription, which would have closed the school. During the Civil War, the seminary became &quot;&#x27;The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute.&#x27;&quot; Enrollment grew to around 250 students. The school arguably became the state&#x27;s largest and most respected educational institution. In 1865, at the Battle of Natural Bridge south of Tallahassee, cadets from the school joined active-duty Confederate troops in the defensive line.The cadets were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson and led into battle by Captain D.W. Gwynn. Some reports show the cadets played a minor role in the battle defending artillery pieces. The combined Confederate forces defeated attacking Union forces leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces.
At the surrender of Florida, Union military forces disarmed the cadets and used campus buildings as barracks until September 1865. The school then reopened and resumed its academic purpose. The FSU Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) is authorized to display a battle streamer Natural Bridge 1865. FSU is one of four institutions that can display a military battle streamer.

===First state university===

In 1883, the institution officially known as the West Florida Seminary was organized by the Board of Education as The Literary College of the University of Florida. (In the terminology of the time, schools were divided into seminaries and literary institutions; the name does not imply a focus on literature.) Under the new university charter, the seminary became the institution&#x27;s Literary College and was to contain several &quot;schools&quot; or departments in different disciplines. However, in the new university association the seminary&#x27;s &quot;separate Charter and special organization&quot; were maintained. Florida University also incorporated the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery, and recognized three more colleges to be established at a later date. The Florida Legislature recognized the university under the title &quot; University of Florida&quot; in Spring 1885 but committed no additional financing or support. Without legislative support, the university project struggled. The institution never assumed the &quot;university&quot; title, and the association dissolved when the medical college relocated to Jacksonville later that year.
According to Doak Campbell, Florida State University&#x27;s fifth president, &quot;During the first 50 years...its activities were limited to courses of secondary-school grade. Progress was slow. Indeed, it was not until the turn of the [twentieth] century that it could properly qualify as a collegiate institution.&quot; In 1901, it became Florida State College.
===Buckman Act===

The 1905 Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into a school for white men (University of the State of Florida), a school for white women (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the character of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. The school&#x27;s early and major benefactor, James Westcott III, willed substantial monies to support continued operations. In 1911, his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the state, stating the change in character was within the intent of the Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women&#x27;s college in the US. It was the first state women&#x27;s college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two state universities in Florida until 1919.
===Return to coeducational status===
Returning soldiers using the G.I. Bill after World War II stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University. The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College. The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added, including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing, and Social Welfare. Strozier Library (1956), and Tully Gymnasium (1956) were built at this time.
===Activism===
====Civil Rights====

Florida State University ranked third in the United States for free speech and thought in a ranking released in 2024 by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. 

After many years as a whites-only university, in 1962, Maxwell Courtney became the first African-American undergraduate student admitted to Florida State. Fred Flowers joined the FSU baseball team as the first African-American athlete in university history in 1965. In 1966 Lenny Hall became the first African-American basketball player for Florida State. In 1968 Calvin Patterson became the first African-American player for the university football team.

During the 1960s and 1970s Florida State University became a center for student activism especially in the areas of racial integration, women&#x27;s rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War. The school acquired the nickname &quot;Berkeley of the South&quot; during this period, about similar student activities at the University of California, Berkeley. The school is also said to have originated the 1970s fad of &quot;streaking,&quot; said to have been first observed on Landis Green.
In 1972 Margaret Menzel, a professor in the biology department, led a class-action lawsuit charging discrimination against women in pay and promotion. The case was settled in 1975 with an agreement that the university would establish a task force to investigate bias against women at the university and to revise its anti-nepotism policy so as to not discriminate against the wives of university employees. Bill Wade, a gay male student, was elected Homecoming Princess using the name &quot;Billie Dahhling&quot; in 1980. While Wade&#x27;s election may initially have been more college prank than protest, the controversy of the social acceptance of homosexuality was evident at FSU in the 1980s. Official university policy established in 2013 prohibits discrimination against multiple protected groups, including the LGBT community.

===Medicine and Preeminance===

The Florida Legislature approved the creation of the allopathic Florida State University College of Medicine in June 2000 due to a need for medical doctors, especially in primary care fields. It was the first medical school approved in the United States in almost two decades. The King Life Sciences Building, located next to the College of Medicine, was added June 2008, to complement medical research with research in related fields.
In 2013 the Florida Legislature and the Florida Board of Governors designated Florida State University and the University of Florida as the first two &quot;preeminent universities&quot; among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida. The status is based on objective criteria and must be earned annually. The shared goal of having top national universities in Florida is highly political, often centering on the use of the term &quot;flagship,&quot; a poorly defined and frequently inflammatory informal title.

==Campus==

===Main campus – Tallahassee===
The state acquired the land of the main campus from the City of Tallahassee in January 1857 when the Florida Institute was transferred. The main campus consists of . Outside Leon county the university owns more than . The main campus is bordered by Stadium Drive to the west, Tennessee Street (U.S. Route 90) to the north, Macomb Street to the east, and Gaines Street to the south. The Westcott Building is the school&#x27;s readily identifiable structure at College Avenue and S. Copeland Street. The Westcott location is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida and is the home of Ruby Diamond Concert Hall which serves as the university&#x27;s primary performance venue.
Historic student housing residence halls include Broward, Bryan, Cawthon, Gilchrist, Jennie Murphree, Landis, and Reynolds and are located on the older eastern half of campus. Newer residence hall complexes, Ragans and Wildwood, located near the athletic quadrant; and DeGraff Hall, located on Tennessee Street.
On and around the Florida State University main campus are seven libraries: Robert Manning Strozier Library, Dirac Science Library named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Florida State University professor Paul Dirac, Claude Pepper Library, College of Music Allen Music Library, College of Law Research Center, College of Medicine Maguire Medical Library and the FAMU/FSU Engineering Library. Strozier Library is located at the center of the campus and is open extended hours during Fall and Spring semesters. 
 Next to the Donald L. Tucker Center, the College of Law is between Jefferson Street and Pensacola Street. The College of Business is in the heart of campus near the FSU Student Union and across from the HCB Classroom Building. The science and research quad is located in the northwest quadrant of the campus. The College of Medicine, King Life Science buildings (biology) as well as the Department of Psychology are located on the west end of campus on Call Street and Stadium Drive.
Located off Stadium Drive in the southwest quadrant is the University Center, which encloses Doak Campbell Stadium and Bobby Bowden Field. The stadium seats 79,560 spectators. Doak Campbell Stadium is contained within the brick facade walls of the University Center. It is reportedly the largest continuous brick structure in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The brick complex also houses offices of the university, the registrar, the Dedman School of Hospitality, and classrooms.

The FSU Southwest Campus was acquired by the university in 1930 and was formerly known as &quot;The Farm&quot;. It encompasses another of land off Orange Drive. The southwest campus currently houses the Florida A&amp;M University – Florida State University College of Engineering, which is housed in a two-building joint facility with Florida A&amp;M University. In addition to the College of Engineering, The Don Veller Seminole Golf Course and Club are located here and at the Morcom Aquatics Center. The FSU Research Foundation buildings, as well as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, are located on the Southwest Campus in Innovation Park.

===Other campuses===
Florida State University Panama City is located approximately from the main campus. The campus began operations in 1967, and FSU assumed control in July 1982. The Bay County Commission donated a 26-acre waterfront site for a new campus, which was completed in 1987. In Fall, 2023 the campus had over 1200 students engaged in undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The satellite institution currently has a ratio of 20 students to each faculty member.
The College of Medicine has six regional campuses located in Daytona Beach, Fort Pierce, Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota and Tallahassee. Three rural based medical training facilities are located in Marianna, Immokalee and Thomasville, Georgia. 

Florida State has campuses in London, Florence, Panama City, Panama and Valencia, Spain. These campuses are a part of the year-round international programs.

==Organization and administration==
Florida State University is divided into 17 colleges and over 110 centers, facilities, labs, and institutes offering 277 degree programs. 

As a part of the State University System of Florida, Florida State University falls under the purview of the seventeen member Florida Board of Governors. Guided by the Board of Governors, the thirteen member Board of trustees is &quot;responsible for the administration of its university in a manner that is dedicated to, and consistent with the university’s mission which shall be otherwise consistent with the mission and purposes of the State University System as
defined by the Board of Governors&quot;. The president of the university answers to the Board of Trustees. The university executive staff report to the president, with subordinate sections reporting through the staff.

The Faculty Senate is the legislative body for the university and elected from member of the general faculty. The Faculty Senate prepares academic policy and sets academic standards. Any action of the Faculty Senate is subject to the veto authority of the university president, which may be appealed to the university trustees by two-thirds Senate vote.

The student government was established in 1935 and consists of executive, judicial, and legislative branches. The student government executive branch is led by the student body president and includes the student body&#x27;s vice president, treasurer, seven agencies, four bureaus, and an executive cabinet responsible for handling an agenda set out by the student body president. The legislative branch includes eighty senators, and the judicial branch consists of a chief justice and four associate justices, who must be in their second or third year of law school.

===Relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida===

Reforming male collegiate sports after the 42-year hiatus (1905–1947) when FSU was a women-only college, FSU students voted to use the name &quot;Seminoles&quot; as the university collective name and symbol. The Seminole imagery in some university activities is by permission of the Tribal Council, the governing body of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. FSU&#x27;s use of the Seminole imagery was granted an NCAA waiver in 2005, due to the coordination the Seminole Tribe of Florida has with Florida State.

===Finances===

 FSU&#x27;s university-wide financial endowment was $785.2 million with total assets valued at $1.03 billion. The endowment helps provide scholarships to students, support teaching and research, and fund other specific purposes designated by donors.

In 2022 Florida State University was rated by Fitch, Moody&#x27;s and S&amp;P Global as having the highest credit rating of all universities in Florida. Moody&#x27;s Ratings graded FSU debt at Aa1 and Aa2 in 2022. S&amp;P Global Ratings rated the university AA+ overall in 2022. Fitch Ratings affirmed the FSU Issuer Default Rating at AA+ on February 14, 2022, with a stable outlook. Fitch&#x27;s Analytical Conclusion states: As a comprehensive flagship university, FSU has a statewide and even national draw for students and has considerable fundraising capabilities. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch&#x27;s expectation that the university will sustain adjusted cash flow margins, as defined in Fitch&#x27;s criteria, in line with historical trends, and that balance sheet strength will be maintained and improve over time.

==Academics==
Florida State University aspires to become a top ten public research university and AAU member. The university is the home of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory among other advanced research facilities. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 supercomputer and the development of the process to syntheisize the anti-cancer drug Taxol.

Florida State University is divided into 17 colleges and schools including the Colleges of Applied Studies, Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Communication &amp; Information, Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice, Education, Engineering, Fine Arts, Human Sciences, Law, Medicine, Motion Picture Arts, Music, Nursing, Social Sciences &amp; Public Policy, and Social Work, plus the Graduate School, Dedman School of Hospitality, and the Jim Moran School of Entrepreneurship.

<doc id="239309" wikidata="Q3936964" url="?curid=239309" title="Castle Risk">
<text>Castle Risk is a version of the board game Risk that is played on a map of Europe. It was first released as a stand-alone game by Parker Brothers in 1986 and later appeared on the reverse side of the board in an early 1990s version of the standard Risk game.

==Map==
The map is divided into six empires and three neutral areas. A player receives four troops per turn for each empire the player controls and six troops for controlling all the neutral areas. A common variation in play is to have each of the neutral regions worth two troops a turn.

Empires:
*French Empire (Paris, Gascony, Netherlands, Brittany, Marseille, Burgundy)
*British Empire (London, Wales, Ireland, Yorkshire, Scotland)
*Russian Empire (Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Livonia, Smolensk, Ukraine, Poland)
*German Empire (Prussia, Berlin, Saxony, Rhine, Bavaria)
*Ottoman Empire (Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece)
*Austrian Empire (Trieste, Galicia, Vienna, Bohemia, Hungary)

Neutral territories:
*Italy (Switzerland, Venice, Rome, Naples)
*Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Portugal)
*Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland)

==Rules==
The rules of Castle Risk differ from original Risk in several respects. Each empire has a capital city (of the player&#x27;s choosing) and once the capital is lost that player is out of the game. In addition, reinforcements are granted at the end of a turn instead of at the beginning (except in the case of the Reinforcements card). This makes fortifying the territory a player has just conquered much easier, but denies that player the opportunity to place the new troops in the best strategic position for the turn about to begin.

Castle Risk introduces specific person cards. The cards allow players to modify dice rolls (General and Marshall), to attack by sea instead of land (Admiral), place extra armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporary non-aggression pacts (Diplomats), or to look at another player&#x27;s cards, discarding one in the process (Spy).

Another new rule is the addition of &quot;hidden armies&quot;, which are reinforcements that a player hides in a location of their choosing at the beginning of the game. They can be in any location, including an opponent&#x27;s territory (except their own or an opponent&#x27;s capital), which makes them very useful for launching a surprise attack. Hidden armies can only be withdrawn at the beginning of a players&#x27; turn and the player must have control of the territory at the start of their turn. Their power, when revealed, is based on the number of reinforcements cards that have already been played.

<doc id="239311" wikidata="Q3658810" url="?curid=239311" title="Carl Thompson (luthier)">
<text>Carl Thompson (born February 5 1939) is a luthier and musician specializing in the construction of high-quality custom bass guitars. He is based in Brooklyn, New York.

Born in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, to a large musical family, Thompson moved to New York City in 1967 to pursue a career as a jazz guitarist. After working in a guitar shop to supplement his income, he started his own guitar repair business. He made his first instrument in 1974 and quickly gained renown in the craft.

Carl Thompson has invented several important designs for modern basses. The most important advances in design attributed to Carl are his invention of Neck-thru instruments using a single piece heel block, as well as lengthening the electric bass from a 34&quot; scale to a 36&quot; and 38&quot;, which extends the harmonic overtones producing a richer timbre that is more consistent with the traditional acoustic bass. The piccolo bass, a guitar of the same dimensions as a normal bass but tuned an octave higher, was envisioned by Stanley Clarke and first built for him by Carl. Carl also constructed the first six string contrabass guitar envisioned by Anthony Jackson. 

Carl&#x27;s most popular endorsee is Les Claypool of the band Primus, who plays and owns seven Carl Thompson basses, his most famous being the Rainbow Bass, a six-string fretless bass made of several different woods. He has made at least four basses for Stanley Clarke. Clarke honored Thompson at one of his concerts and invited him on stage, calling him &quot;a very great bass maker&quot; and stating &quot;(Carl) made one of my first piccolo basses. In fact, he made &quot;the&quot; first piccolo bass.&quot; Carl has also built guitars for Lou Reed and Hank Williams III, and Jason Momoa.

Thompson basses are sought after, and he maintains a two-year waiting list, though some orders can take well over three years to complete. The cost for a basic four-string bass made by Thompson is about $5,500. Basses such as the &quot;Rainbow Bass&quot; can cost well over $10,000, although Carl will not make copies of the bass for his clients despite being asked to do so in the past. He maintains that all his basses are one-of-a-kind.

Thompson continues to be an active musician, practicing several hours a day, and performing once a week at a local Brooklyn restaurant. He has a fascination with jazz singers, and is a respected vocal coach of young singers.

<doc id="239313" wikidata="Q5359167" url="?curid=239313" title="Elendor">
<text>Elendor is a free online text-based multi-user game that simulates the environment of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Users create characters by determining species, sex, culture, description, history (and sometimes persona) and then role-playing with other users within the setting and atmosphere of Tolkien&#x27;s world. For the purposes of consistency, the game accepts &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and to a lesser extent the other works of Tolkien as canonical materials. The time frame is shortly before the onset of the main events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; with Bilbo having gone to Rivendell. The game is run on a MUSH server using a variant of PennMUSH.

The game was established in October 1991 and has been called &quot;the original Tolkien Middle-Earth MUSH&quot;. It has been noted for its large player population, and at its height during the late 1990s and early 2000s, the time of the production and release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, &quot;Elendor&quot; was regarded as one of the most popular text-based worlds on the Internet. It was chosen as &quot;Best Tolkien Community Site&quot; by Yahoo! Internet Life magazine.

==Game play and mechanics==

&quot;Elendor&quot; comprises twenty-one factions known within the game as cultures. Each covers a different group or geographic area of Middle-earth. As in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, action is confined to the northwest of Middle-earth. Users may play an Orc from Moria, an Elf from Mirkwood, a mortal Man from Dunland or a Hobbit from the Shire and other creatures and species. Some cultures and species are restricted and require approval by the game administration. These include the Ents, Trolls and Dúnedain as well as other special or powerful species. &quot;Feature&quot; Characters (FC) and &quot;Book Feature&quot; Characters (BFC) are granted to users as rewards for their dedicated work for a culture, good roleplaying ability and seniority.

The cultures are each governed by a &quot;+ruler&quot; (an out of character position) and a council of &quot;Local Admins&quot; or &quot;LAs&quot; who assist the +ruler. These users are responsible for the theme and day-to-day operation of their respective cultures. Above the +rulers is a council of &quot;royals&quot;, and then &quot;wizards&quot;, who are MUSH-wide administrators who have wide-ranging responsibilities that range from code and server maintenance to user arbitration and game theme oversight.

<text>A sex shop is a retailer that sells products related to adult sexual or erotic entertainment, such as sex toys, lingerie, pornography, and other related products. 

An early precursor of the modern sex shop was a chain of stores set up in Paris in the 1920s by Léon Vidal, the founder of the lingerie manufacturing company Diana Slip. His shops sold erotic books and photographs as well as lingerie. 

Beate Uhse AG opened a sex shop in 1962 in Flensburg, West Germany, and it has been described as the world&#x27;s first &quot;official&quot; sex shop. Sex shops can now be found in many countries and online. Sex shops are part of the sex industry. In most jurisdictions, sex shops are regulated by law, with access not legally permitted to minors, the age depending on local law. Some jurisdictions prohibit sex shops and the merchandise they sell. In some jurisdictions that permit it, they may also show pornographic movies in private video booths, or have private striptease or peep shows. An adult movie theater may be attached. There are also many online sex shops selling a variety of adult content such as sex toys, pornographic magazines, pornographic films and fetish wear etc. These types of shop are often favoured by the consumer as they have less overheads and can be perused within the comfort of the home. Their discreetness is also appealing to some.

==Terminology==
Sex shops may also be called adult shop, adult store, erotic shop, porn shop, adult entertainment store, or adult book store. In some jurisdictions, polite euphemisms are used such as &quot;marital aid store&quot; or &quot;adult novelties store&quot;.

== History ==

=== Australia ===
Sex shops have operated in Australia since the 1960s, first in the urban areas of Sydney, notably Kings Cross. The development of sex shops in the country was assisted by the legalisation of the import of pornographic magazines in 1971, the appearance of mass-produced battery-powered vibrators in the 1970s and the arrival of X-rated videos in the 1980s. The popularity of Internet pornography in the 2000s resulted in a drop in sex shop sales, some store closures and diversification into non-sex-related adult goods.

Sex shops in Australia are regulated by state laws and are subject to local planning controls. While laws differ between states, licensees must abide by strict conditions that commonly require premises to be at least 200 metres from schools and churches. Windows are often required to be blacked out and admission restricted to over 18s, with offences prosecuted by police under section 578E of the Crimes Act.

In the state of New South Wales (NSW), sex shops cannot trade at street level and are required to trade either above or below ground. Under NSW law, non-contraceptive sex products can be sold only in shops that have been granted a restricted premise licence by local councils. Nevertheless, by 2013, a number of NSW lingerie stores had begun selling adult toys and books in shopping malls without being granted a licence.

=== China ===

Mainland China&#x27;s first sex shop opened in Beijing in 1993 and by 2013, there were over 2,000 sex shops in the city. Most of their products were made in China.

=== Canada ===
The first sex shop in North America was called The Garden. It was opened in October 1971 by Ivor Sargent on Crescent Street in downtown Montreal, Quebec. The Garden combined the concepts used by Beate Uhse in Germany and Ann Summers in the UK. The store&#x27;s opening attracted long lines of shoppers. The Palm Beach Post commented: &quot;Like the chicken or the egg controversy, no one is really sure which came first-the sex boutique or the so-called sexual revolution&quot;.

There are no specific laws against using or buying sex toys at any particular age, but there are laws restricting the purchase of pornography. Although the age of consent is 16 in Canada, an age of 18+ is required to purchase or view pornography. Most sex shops sell adult videos, which means that most sex toys are on sale only to adults.

=== Germany ===

Beate Uhse-Rotermund started selling contraception information by mail order in 1946, and she opened her first shop in 1962. Legal restrictions in West Germany dating back to 1872 were tightened in 1968. Pornography was legalized in West Germany in 1975, although this never happened in East Germany.

=== Hungary ===
The first Hungarian sex shop opened on 15 November 1989, before the end of communism in Hungary, at 14 Károly Boulevard in Budapest, under the name Intim Center, which still exists today. At that time, the three T-categories were so suddenly moved from the forbidden to the tolerated that even the press of the time reported the administrative uncertainties surrounding the sex shop in this way.

=== Italy ===
The first sex shop in Italy was opened in 1972 in Milan by Angela Masia and her husband Ercole Sabbatini. This was the first &quot;official&quot; sex shop. Since then more sex shops have opened, mostly in Rome. In 2018, the city of Pistoia in Tuscany banned the opening of new sex shops in the city&#x27;s history centre.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, sex shops contain hentai magazines, adult videos and DVDs.

=== The Netherlands ===

The first sex shops in the Netherlands were opened in the early 1970s, by entrepreneurs like Beate Uhse and Lasse Braun. The world&#x27;s first Muslim-aimed online sex shop called El Asira opened in the Netherlands in 2010. It had 70,000 hits to the website in the first four days of operation.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, sex shops are often criticized by public and political figures, often of a conservative nature.

In May 2017, State Duma Deputy from United Russia Vitaly Milonov addressed the head of the Ministry of Health, Veronika Skvortsova, with the initiative to equate intimate products with medicinal products. According to Milonov, it is necessary to introduce control over the distribution of intimate goods: &quot;The use and application of such products will occur exclusively as prescribed by a doctor.&quot;

In 2018, Milonov proposed closing all sex shops in Russia. In his opinion, all sex shops in Russia should disappear along with advertising since only &quot;sick people&quot; shop there. This is in contrast to his position in 2013 when he only called for reducing the number of sex shops in St. Petersburg.

=== Singapore ===
Sex shops are extremely rare in Singapore. A few had been opened by 2005, but only about 1–2 currently exist. These shops mainly sell lingerie, condoms, BDSM tools, genuine enhancement pills, tenga items and various sex toys. Their goods can be seen through a store window.

=== South Africa ===
After Nelson Mandela backed the anti-discrimination law that legalised sex toys, &quot;Adult World&quot; was established in 1994 as South Africa&#x27;s first sex shop. Adult World came to operate a total of 52 shops within South Africa and 15 shops in Australia. Many religious Christian communities believed that the use of these adult lifestyle centres would lead to higher crime rates and attempted to organise mass demonstrations at their opening to force the closure of Adult World.

In July 1998, Adult World opened their largest adult lifestyle shop in Parow, Cape Town which they named &quot;Adult World Warehouse&quot;. The adult movie star Christi Lake attended the opening of the shop, where a protest march of over 500 people brought traffic to a standstill. During the next couple of days, the protesters held placards which proclaimed &quot;Real men don&#x27;t need pornography&quot; and &quot;Protect our people from banned pornography&quot;. When the shop was opened, it was found that 70% of the customer base were women who wished to learn more about adult lifestyle products.

As Adult World grew more popular, a focus on the development of adult shops within Australia took place.

=== Spain ===
Sex shops in Spain did not appear until after the end of the Francoist dictatorship in 1975. The first sex shop opened in Spain was &quot;Kitsch&quot; in Madrid in 1978. Many subsequently opened across the country.

=== United Kingdom ===

Almost all licensed adult stores in the UK are forbidden from having their wares in open shop windows under the Indecent Displays Act 1981, which means often the shop fronts are boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no sex articles (for example, pornography or sex toys) should be visible from the street. However, lingerie, non-offensive covers of adult material, etc. may be shown depending on the licence conditions of the local authority. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced the R18-rated classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops. No customer can be under 18 years old.

In London, few boroughs that have licensed sex shops. In the district of Soho within the City of Westminster a handful of sex shops were opened by Carl Slack in the early 1960s, and by the mid-1970s the number had grown to 59. Some had nominally &quot;secret&quot; backrooms selling hardcore photographs and novels, including Olympia Press editions.

In 1978, the businessman David Sullivan opened the &quot;Private Shop&quot;, the first of his chain of sex shops which went on to expand across the UK. The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 required sex shops to apply for a sex establishment licence from their local authority. As a result hundreds of sex shops were closed. There followed purges of corrupt police officers, along with new and tighter licensing controls by the City of Westminster, led to a crackdown on illegal premises in Soho. In the early 1990s, London&#x27;s Hackney council sought to shut down Sh! Women&#x27;s Erotic Emporium, because they did not have a licence. Sh! took the council to court and consequently won the right to remain open, as there were no sufficient reasons for the closure. In 2003, the Ann Summers chain of lingerie and sex toy shops won the right to advertise for shop assistants in Job Centres, which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the sex industry. In 2007, a Northern Ireland sex shop was denied a licence by the Belfast City Council. The shop appealed and won, but this was overturned by the House of Lords.

The licensing or closing of unlicensed sex shops, along with cultural changes such as the substantial relaxation of general censorship and the ready availability of non-commercial sex, and the availability of sexual material online, have reduced the red-light district of Soho to just a small area. The borough has 15 licensed sex shops and several remaining unlicensed ones. Islington and Camden each have multiple sex shops; the former also has three pornographic cinemas.

Sex shops in Scotland are regulated under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.

=== United States ===

In the United States, a series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1960s (based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution) generally legalized sex shops, while still allowing states and local jurisdictions to limit them through zoning. Zoning regulations often caused shops to be located either on the outskirts of town, or clumped into a single area, creating a type of red light district of adult stores and businesses. Into the 1980s, nearly all American sex shops were oriented to an almost entirely male clientele. Many included adult video arcades, and nearly all were designed so that their customers could not be seen from the street: they lacked windows, and the doors often involved an L-shaped turn so that people on the street could not see in. In addition, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, stores that also had theaters or arcades were sometimes closed by government order, citing the spread of AIDS as the motive.

On the one hand, there are stores resembling the UK&#x27;s Ann Summers, tending toward &quot;softer&quot; product lines. On the other hand, there are stores that evolved specifically out of a sex-positive culture, such as San Francisco&#x27;s Good Vibrations and Xandria. The latter class of stores tend to be very consciously community-oriented businesses, sponsoring lecture series and being actively involved in sex-related health issues, etc.

<doc id="239318" wikidata="Q2514706" url="?curid=239318" title="Bajirao I">
<text>Bajirao I (&quot;born as Visaji&quot;, ; 18 August 1700 – 28 April 1740) was the 7th Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy. He, after Shivaji, is considered to be the most charismatic and dynamic leader in Maratha history. At just twenty years old, he had already gained a reputation for rapid decision-making and a passion for military adventure. Widely considered one of the greatest military generals of his time, he is credited with consolidating the Maratha state and transforming it into an empire.

In the Deccan region, the Nizam of Hyderabad emerged as a significant threat. Bajirao then led a campaign against the Nizam in which Nizam suffered a decisive defeat at Palkheda. This victory solidified the Marathas’ authority in the Deccan region. In Bundelkhand, he rescued the Bundela ruler Chhatrasal from a Mughal siege, gaining independence for Bundelkhand. Gratefully, Chhatrasal granted Bajirao a jagir and his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage.

In the 1730s, Bajirao asserted Maratha tax rights in Gujarat, defeating rebel Trimbak Rao Dabhade in 1731 at Battle of Dabhoi; he also engaged in a diplomatic mission to persuade Rajput courts for chauth payments. Further efforts to establish Maratha dominance saw him responsible for the Battle of Delhi (1737) which may be said to mark the pinnacle of his military career. He secured the important territory of Malwa after defeating the combined forces of Mughal-Nizam-Nawab of Awadh in Battle of Bhopal (1737). 

Bajirao&#x27;s adventurous life has been picturized in Indian cinema and also featured in novels. Bajirao had two wives Kashibai and Mastani. Bajirao&#x27;s relationship with his second wife Mastani is a controversial subject; very little is known with certainty about it. She was generally referenced cryptically in books, letters or documents from that era.

==Early life==

Bajirao was born into the Bhat family in Sinnar, near Nashik. His father Balaji Vishwanath was the &quot;Peshwa&quot; of Shahu I and his mother was Radhabai Barve. Bajirao had a younger brother, Chimaji Appa, and two younger sisters, Anubai and Bhiubai. Anubai was married to Venkatrao Ghorpade (Joshi) of Ichalkaranji and Bhiubai was married to Abaji Naik Joshi of Baramati.

Being born in a Brahmin family, his education included reading, writing and learning Sanskrit however, he did not remain confined to his books. Bajirao displayed a passion for the military at an early age and often accompanied his father on military campaigns. He was with his father when his father was imprisoned by Damaji Thorat before being released for a ransom. Bajirao had been on the expedition to Delhi in 1719 with his father and was convinced the Mughal Empire was disintegrating and would be unable to resist northward Maratha expansion. When Balaji Vishwanath died in 1720, Shahu appointed the 20-year-old Bajirao as Peshwa despite opposition from other chieftains.

Bajirao&#x27;s first wife was Kashibai, the daughter of Mahadji Krishna Joshi and Bhawanibai of Chas (a wealthy banking family). Bajirao always treated his wife Kashibai with love and respect. Their relationship was healthy and happy. They had four sons: Balaji Bajirao (also called Nanasaheb), Ramachandra Rao, Raghunath Rao and Janardhan Rao, who died at an early age. Nanasaheb was appointed Peshwa by Shahu in 1740, succeeding his father.

Bajirao took Mastani as his wife, the daughter of Rajput king Chhatrasal, born from his Muslim concubine. The relationship was a political one, arranged to please Chhatrasal. Mastani had a son, Krishna Rao, in 1734. Since his mother was Muslim, Hindu priests refused to conduct the upanayana ceremony and he became known as Shamsher Bahadur. After the deaths of Bajirao and Mastani in 1740, Kashibai raised six-year-old Shamsher Bahadur as her own. Shamsher received a portion of his father&#x27;s dominion of Banda and Kalpi. In 1761, he and his army fought alongside the Peshwa in the Third Battle of Panipat between the Marathas and the Afghans. Wounded in the battle, Shamsher died several days later in Deeg.

Bajirao moved his base of operations from Saswad to Pune in 1728, laying the foundation for the transformation of the kasba into a large city. He began the construction of Shaniwar Wada on 10 January 1730.
Bajirao was appointed Peshwa, succeeding his father, by Shahu on 17 April 1720. By the time of his appointment, the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah had upheld Maratha claims to the territories held by Shivaji at his death. A treaty gave the Marathas the right to collect taxes (chauth) in the Deccan&#x27;s six provinces. Bajirao convinced Shahu that the Maratha Empire had to go on the offensive against its enemies to defend itself. He believed the Mughal Empire was in decline, and wanted to take advantage of the situation with aggressive expansion into North India. Bajirao compared the Mughals&#x27; declining fortune to a tree which, if attacked at its roots, would collapse. He is reported to have said:
As a new Peshwa, however, he faced several challenges. Bajirao promoted young men like himself, such as Malhar Rao Holkar, Ranoji Shinde, the Pawar brothers and Fateh Singh Bhosle, as commanders; these men did not belong to families who were hereditary Deshmukhs in the Deccan sultanates.

The Mughal viceroy of the Deccan, Asaf Jah I, Nizam of Hyderabad, had created a &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous kingdom in the region. He challenged Shahu &#x27;s right to collect taxes on the pretext that he did not know whether Shahu or his cousin, Sambhaji II of Kolhapur, was the rightful heir to the Maratha throne. The Marathas needed to assert their rights over the nobles of newly acquired territories in Malwa and Gujarat. Several nominally-Maratha areas were not actually under the Peshwa&#x27;s control; for example, the Siddis controlled the Janjira fort.

== Military campaigns and wars ==
=== The Nizam ===
At the outset of Bajirao&#x27;s Peshwa rule, the Mughal leaders, led by Nizam-ul-Mulk, rebelled against the Sayyid Brothers. To quell the uprising, the Sayyid brothers sought assistance from the Marathas. However, in the Battle of Balapur, where Bajirao, Malhar Rao Holkar, and Khanderao Dabhade were present, the combined forces of the Sayyid Brothers and the Marathas were defeated by the Nizam&#x27;s forces. Sankarji Malhar was captured as a prisoner of war, marking Bajirao&#x27;s first significant military engagement as Peshwa.

On 4 January 1721, Bajirao met Nizam of Hyderabad at Chikhalthana to resolve their disputes. However, the Nizam refused to recognize the Maratha right to collect taxes from the Deccan provinces. He was made vizier of the Mughal Empire in 1721 by emperor Muhammad Shah, who, alarmed at his increasing power, transferred him from the Deccan to Awadh in 1723. The Nizam rebelled against the order, resigned as vizier and marched towards the Deccan. The emperor sent an army against him, which the Nizam defeated at the Battle of Sakhar-kheda; this forced the emperor to recognise him as viceroy of the Deccan. The Marathas, led by Bajirao, helped the Nizam win this battle. For his valor, Bajirao was honored with a robe, a 7,000-man mansabdari, an elephant, and a jewel. After the battle, the Nizam tried to appease the Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu and the Mughal emperor; in reality, however, he wanted to carve out a sovereign kingdom and considered the Marathas his rivals in the Deccan.

In 1725, the Nizam sent an army to clear Maratha revenue collectors from the Carnatic region. The Marathas dispatched a force under Fateh Singh Bhosle to counter him; Bajirao accompanied Bhosle, but according to Stewart Gordon, Bajirao did not command the army. According to Govind Sakharam Sardesai, Bajirao personally led the campaign under Shahu&#x27;s command. In contrast, Stewart Gordon&#x27;s account suggests that Bajirao was present during the campaign but did not assume command.

In the Deccan, Sambhaji II of Kolhapur State had become a rival claimant to the title of Maratha King. The Nizam took advantage of the internal dispute, refusing to pay the chauth because it was unclear who was the real Chhatrapati (Shahu or Sambhaji II) and offering to arbitrate. Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi advised Shahu to begin negotiations and agree to arbitration. Sambhaji II was supported by Chandrasen Jadhav, who had fought Bajirao&#x27;s father a decade earlier. Bajirao convinced Shahu to refuse the Nizam&#x27;s offer and instead launch an assault.

The Nizam invaded Pune, where he installed Sambhaji II as the King. He then marched out of the city, leaving behind a contingent headed by Fazal Beg. The Nizam plundered Loni, Pargaon, Patas, Supa and Baramati, using his artillery. On 27 August 1727, Bajirao began a retaliatory guerilla attack on the Nizam with his trusted lieutenants Malhar Rao Holkar, Ranoji Shinde and the Pawar brothers. He began to destroy the towns held by the Nizam; leaving Pune, he crossed the Godavari River near Puntamba and plundered Jalna and Sindkhed. Bajirao destroyed Berar, Mahur, Mangrulpir and Washim before turning north-west to Khandesh. He crossed the Tapi River at Kokarmunda and entered eastern Gujarat, reaching Chota Udaipur in January 1728. After hearing that the Nizam had returned to Pune, Bajirao feinted toward Burhanpur; he thought that after hearing about the threat to the strategically important Burhanpur, the Nizam would try to save it. Bajirao did not enter Burhanpur, however, arriving at Betawad in Khandesh on 14 February 1728. When the Nizam heard that his northern territories had been devastated by Bajirao, he left Pune and marched towards the Godavari to meet Bajirao on an open plain where his artillery would be effective. The Nizam went on ahead of his artillery; on 25 February 1728, the armies of Bajirao and the Nizam faced each other at Palkhed, a town about west of Aurangabad. The Nizam was quickly surrounded by Maratha forces and trapped, his lines of supply and communication were cut. He was forced to make peace; he signed the Treaty of Mungi Shevgaon on 6 March, recognising Shahu as the King and the Maratha right to collect taxes in the Deccan.

This event is considered as an example of brilliant execution of military strategy. In his &quot;Military History of India&quot;, Jadunath Sarkar wrote:&quot;This campaign gives a classic example of what the predatory horse, when led by a genius, could achieve in the age of light artillery.&quot;

=== Bundelkhand ===

In Bundelkhand, Chhatrasal rebelled against the Mughal Empire and established an independent kingdom. In December 1728, a Mughal force led by Muhammad Khan Bangash attacked him and besieged his fort and family. Although Chhatrasal repeatedly sought Bajirao&#x27;s assistance, he was busy in Malwa at the time. He compared his dire situation to that of Gajendra Moksha. In his letter to Bajirao, Chhatrasal wrote the following words:
 In March 1729, the Peshwa responded to Chhatrasal&#x27;s request and marched towards Bundelkhand with 25,000 horsemen and his lieutenants Pilaji Jadhav, Tukoji Pawar, Naro Shankar, and Davalji Somwanshi. Bangash was later forced to leave, signing an agreement that &quot;he would never attack Bundelkhand again&quot;. Chhatrasal&#x27;s position as ruler of Bundelkhand was restored. He granted a large jagir to Bajirao, and gave him his daughter Mastani. Before Chhatrasal&#x27;s death in December 1731, he ceded one-third of his territories to the Marathas.

=== The Portuguese ===
The Luso–Maratha War of 1729–1732 was an armed conflict between the Portuguese Empire and the Maratha Confederacy, who invaded Portuguese territory in India. This conflict resulted in a Portuguese victory. The Marathas withdrew from Portuguese territory. Nevertheless, Bajirao planned to resume hostilities against the Portuguese with an attack on Salcette Island on 13 March 1733. Peace would prove to be short, as five years later the Marathas would again invade Portuguese territory and attack Bassein.

===Gujarat===
After consolidating Maratha influence in central India, Bajirao decided to assert the Maratha right to collect taxes from the wealthy province of Gujarat and sent a Maratha force under Chimaji Appa there in 1730. Sarbuland Khan, the province&#x27;s Mughal governor, ceded the right to collect chauth to the Marathas. He was soon replaced by Abhay Singh, who also recognized the Maratha right to collect taxes. This irked Shahu&#x27;s senapati (commander-in-chief), Trimbak Rao Dabhade, whose ancestors had raided Gujarat several times and asserted their right to collect taxes from the province. Annoyed at Bajirao&#x27;s control of what he considered his family&#x27;s sphere of influence, he rebelled against the Peshwa. Two other Maratha nobles from Gujarat, Damaji Rao Gaekwad and Kadam Bande, also sided with Dabhade.

After Girdhar Bahadur&#x27;s defeat in 1728, the Mughal emperor had appointed Jai Singh II to subdue the Marathas. Jai Singh recommended a peaceful agreement; the emperor disagreed, replacing him with Muhammad Khan Bangash. Bangash formed an alliance with the Nizam, Trimbak Rao and Sambhaji II. Bajirao learned that Dabhade and Gaikwad had made preparations for an open fight on the plain of Dabhoi with a force of 40 thousand, while Bajirao&#x27;s numbers hardly reached 25 thousand in all. Bajirao repeatedly sent messages to Dabhade to solve the dispute amicably in the presence of Shahu. Bajirao resolved the dispute with Sambhaji II on 13 April by signing the Treaty of Warna, which demarcated the territories of Shahu and Sambhaji II. The Nizam met Bajirao at Rohe-Rameshwar on 27 December 1732, and promised not to interfere with Maratha expeditions.

Shahu and Bajirao avoided a rivalry with the powerful Dabhade clan after subduing Trimbak Rao; Trimbak&#x27;s son, Yashwant Rao, was appointed as Shahu&#x27;s senapati. The Dabhade clan were allowed to continue collecting chauth from Gujarat if they deposited half the revenue in Shahu&#x27;s treasury.

===Siddis===
The Siddis of Janjira controlled a small, strategically important territory on India&#x27;s west coast. Although they originally held only the Janjira fort, after Shivaji&#x27;s death they expanded their rule to a large part of central and northern Konkan. After the death of Siddi chief Yakut Khan in 1733, a war of succession broke out among his sons; one, Abdul Rehman, asked Bajirao for help. Bajirao sent a Maratha force led by Sekhoji Angre, son of Kanhoji Angre. The Marathas regained control of several portions of the Konkan, and besieged Janjira. Their strength was diverted after Peshwa&#x27;s rival, Pant Pratinidhi, occupied Raigad Fort (near Janjira) in June 1733. Sekhoji Angre died in August (further weakening the Maratha position), and Bajirao signed a peace treaty with the Siddis. He allowed the Siddis to retain control of Janjira if they accepted Abdul Rehman as the ruler; they were also allowed to retain control of Anjanvel, Gowalkot and Underi. The Marathas retained Raigad, Rewas, Thal and Chaul.

The Siddis launched an offensive to regain their lost territories soon after the Peshwa returned to Satara, then Bajirao dispatched a force to prevent them from taking over Raigad Fort in June 1734. Chimnaji made a surprise attack on a Siddi camp near Rewas on 19 April 1736, killing about 1,500 (including their leader, Siddi Sat). In June 1736, Bajirao dispatched a force under Yesaji Gaikwad, Dhanaji Thorat and Sidoji Barge to gain the control territories like Gowalkot. On 25 September of that year, the Siddis signed a peace treaty which confined them to Janjira, Gowalkot and Anjanvel.

=== Rajputana ===
With Shahu&#x27;s consent, Bajirao began a northward journey on 9 October 1735. Accompanied by his wife, Kashibai, he intended to visit Rajput courts and persuade them to pay chauth. Bajirao arrived at Mewar&#x27;s southern frontier in January 1736, where Rana Jagat Singh II had made arrangements for his visit.

Diplomatic talks got underway. Bajirao also visited Jagmandir Palace, in the centre of Pichola Lake (at Rana Jagat Singh&#x27;s invitation), and Nath-Dwara. After resolving matters in Mewar, Bajirao advanced towards Jaipur. Jai Singh hastened south with his forces, and they met in Bhambholao (near Kishangarh).

Their meeting lasted for several days, with talks about chauth and the cession of Malwa from the Mughal Emperor. Bajirao then returned to the Deccan. The emperor did not agree to his demands, however, and he planned to march on Delhi to force him to agree.

=== March to Delhi ===

After the death of Trimbak Rao, Bangash&#x27;s alliance against the Marathas fell apart. The Mughal emperor recalled him from Malwa, and re-appointed Jai Singh II as the governor of Malwa. However, the Maratha chief Holkar defeated Jai Singh in the 1733 Battle of Mandsaur. After two more battles, the Mughals decided to offer the Marathas the right to collect the equivalent of 22 lakh in chauth from Malwa. On 4 March 1736, Bajirao and Jai Singh reached an agreement at Kishangad. Jai Singh convinced the emperor to agree to the plan, and Bajirao was appointed deputy governor of the region. Jai Singh is believed to have secretly informed Bajirao that it was a good time to subdue the weakening Mughal emperor.

Learning of the advancing Maratha army, the Mughal emperor asked Saadat Ali Khan I to march from Agra and check the advance. The Maratha chiefs Malhar Rao Holkar, Vithoji Bule and Pilaji Jadhav crossed Yamuna and plundered the Mughal territories in the Doab. Saadat Khan led a force of 150,000, defeated them at Jalesar, and retired to Mathura. Malhar Rao Holkar rejoined Bajirao&#x27;s army near Gwalior. Samsam-ud-Daulah, Mir Bakshi and Muhammad Khan Bangash invited Saadat Ali Khan to a banquet in Samsam-ud-Daulah&#x27;s tent in Mathura, thinking that the Marathas had retreated to the Deccan. During the feast, they learnt Bajirao had slipped along the Jat and Mewati hill route (avoiding the direct Agra-Delhi route) and was at Delhi. The Mughal commanders left the feast and began a hasty return to capital. The Mughal emperor dispatched a force, led by Mir Hasan Khan Koka, to check Bajirao&#x27;s advance. The Marathas defeated his force on 28 March 1737 in outskirts of Delhi at Rikabganj. When the news of the defeat of the Mughal troops by the Marathas spread, a sudden fear seized the citizens of Delhi who expected the attack of the Maratha conqueror any moment. But Baji Rao did not proceed with his victory although he could have taken the city unopposed. He had received intelligence that the Vazir with his army was coming towards Delhi in rapid marches when he heard that Baji Rao was before the gates of the capital. The Peshwa realised that any further stay in the city would greatly imperil his position and endanger the lines of communication with the Maratha mainland. He was content with the imperial offer of the Viceroyalty of Malwa. He, therefore, left Delhi with his soldiers towards the south. During his way back he encountered the Mughal Vizier Qamar-ud Din Khan at Badshahpur. After a long and tiring march following a heavy engagement, the Peshwa was in no mood to attack the Vazir. Neither could the Vazir array his forces for battle, as his artillery and a part of his men were yet on the road. There was a brush between the two forces in the failing light of the day; one elephant and a few horses were seized by the Marathas with the loss of 30 men at their side. Afterwards, they moved another eight miles before encamping for the night. Finding himself heavily outnumbered to the Wazir&#x27;s army and possibility of reinforcement from the other Mughal nobles he made a decision to quickly retreat from Badshahpur during early night. Passing through Rajputana Bajirao reached Narnol and then Ajmer. The Mughals could not pursue the Marathas and the Emperor had recalled them to Delhi. The Rajput princes once again affirmed their loyalty to the Peshwa and solicited his protection.

This event caused great consternation and dismay in the capital. Although the Peshwa left the city suddenly, he exposed the weakness of the government. The demoralizing effect which the Peshwa&#x27;s surprise attack produced on the army and the citizens of Delhi was permanent.

===Battle of Bhopal===
Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah sought help from the Nizam after Bajirao&#x27;s march to Delhi; the Nizam set out from the Deccan, met Bajirao&#x27;s returning force at Sironj, and told the Peshwa he was going to Delhi to repair his relationship with the Mughal emperor. The Nizam was joined by other Mughal chiefs, and a 30,000-man Mughal army (reinforced by artillery), was dispatched against Bajirao. The Peshwa assembled an 80,000-man force. To counter aid to the Nizam from the Deccan, Bajirao stationed a force of 10,000 (under Chimaji Appa) on the Tapti River with instructions to prevent Nasir Jung from advancing beyond Burhanpur. He and his forces crossed the Narmada in early December 1737, communicating with agents and spies posted to observe enemy moves. The Nizam sheltered in Bhopal, a fortified town with a lake at his rear, to keep his army and artillery secure.

The Nizam, unable to hold out any longer, signed a peace agreement at Doraha on 7 January 1738. Malwa was ceded to the Marathas; the Mughals agreed to pay the equivalent of 5,000,000 in reparations, with the Nizam swearing on the Quran to abide by the treaty.

=== Deccan ===

Between 1738 and 1740, Nader Shah launched an invasion of India. In response to this threat, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah summoned the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah, to Delhi. Accepting the emperor&#x27;s request, Asaf Jah mobilized his army and marched to Delhi in a bid to resist the invasion.

In the absence of the Nizam, Bajirao launched an attack on Hyderabad with the aim of capturing the six provinces of Deccan. Having already secured Malwa through the Battle of Bhopal from Jai Singh II, Bajirao sought to expand Maratha influence by targeting Hyderabad in the absence of the Nizam. In December 1739, Bajirao led a formidable force of 50,000 horse and foot soldiers towards Hyderabad. Nasir Jung, having received intelligence about the Marathas&#x27; intent to capture the Deccan in the absence of his father, mobilized 10,000 soldiers and marched against Bajirao. The Battle ensued after both parties crossed the Godavari River.

In the ensuing battle, according to some sources, Bajirao suffered defeat, and his army was compelled to make a humiliating peace treaty, marking a significant setback for the Maratha forces. However, based on alternative accounts, Bajirao attempted to alleviate his sorrow through engaging in wartime activities. When his request for additional territories from the Nizam to establish a northern route was unsuccessful, he laid siege to Nasir Jang, the Nizam&#x27;s son, in the Aurangabad fort, ultimately forcing him to relinquish the districts of Nemad and Khargon.

According to some historical sources, Peshwa Bajirao&#x27;s last battle took place in Rawarkhedi, Madhya Pradesh in 1739, against Nasir Jung, the Nizam&#x27;s son. Nasir Jung lost the battle and escaped. Nasir sued for peace and an agreement was signed between Bajirao and Nasir. According to which, Marathas were deprived of their authority to collect chauth from the six provinces of Deccan, Bajirao promised to not invade the Deccan again. Khargone and Handia, previously promised by the Nizam, were formally ceded to the Maratha Empire.

This marked the final military engagement for Bajirao, as he died in April 1740 following the conclusion of this conflict.

==Battle tactics, character and legacy ==

Bajirao was known for rapid tactical movements in battle, using cavalry. British field marshal Bernard Montgomery studied Bajirao&#x27;s tactics in the Palkhed campaign, particularly his rapid movements and his troops&#x27; ability to live off the land (with little concern about supply and communication lines) while conducting &quot;maneuver warfare&quot; against the enemy. In his book, &quot;A Concise History of Warfare&quot;, Montgomery wrote the following about Bajirao&#x27;s victory at Palkhed:
Montgomery further wrote,

Bajirao is considered one of celebrated personality in the history of Maratha Empire by many historians.

In his introduction to &quot;Bajirao I: The Great Peshwa&quot;, K. M. Panikkar wrote:

He is also considered to be one of the greatest military generals of his time. Jadunath Sarkar called Bajirao, &quot;a heavenly-born cavalry leader&quot;. Also describing his twenty years military career, Jadunath Sarkar wrote:
Shahu also had an implicit faith on Bajirao. On the other occasion he has called Bajirao as &quot;the man with iron nerves&quot;.

==Death==

Bajirao&#x27;s body was exhausted due to ceaseless wars and military campaigns. The first illness Bajirao encountered which appeared on 23 April, when the symptoms were mild. On 26 April the fever has grown to an extent that, Bajirao became delirious. He died on Sunday i.e. 28 April, 1740 at night, after about 8:30 p.m. He was cremated the same day on the bank of Narmada River. Balaji Bajirao ordered Ranoji Shinde to build a chhatri as a memorial. The memorial is enclosed by a dharmashala. The compound has two temples, dedicated to Nilkantheshwar Mahadev (Shiva) and Rameshwar (Rama).

<text>Ignatius Loyola Donnelly (November 3, 1831 – January 1, 1901) was an American Congressman, populist writer, and pseudoscientist. He is known primarily now for his fringe theories concerning Atlantis, Catastrophism (especially the idea of an ancient impact event affecting ancient civilizations), and Shakespearean authorship. These works are widely regarded as examples of pseudoscience and pseudohistory. Donnelly&#x27;s work corresponds to the writings of late-19th and early-20th century figures such as Helena Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and James Churchward.

==Life and career==
Donnelly was the son of Philip Carrol Donnelly, an immigrant from Fintona, County Tyrone, Ireland who had settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His sister was the writer Eleanor C. Donnelly. On June 29, 1826, Philip had married Catherine Gavin, who was the daughter of John Gavin, also an immigrant from Fintona, County Tyrone, Ireland. After starting as a peddler, Philip studied medicine at the Philadelphia College of Medicine.

Catherine provided for her children by operating a pawn shop. Ignatius, her youngest son, was admitted to the prestigious Central High School, the second oldest public high school in the United States. There he studied under the presidency of John S. Hart, excelling primarily in literature.

Donnelly decided to become a lawyer and became a clerk for Benjamin Brewster, who later became Attorney General of the United States. Donnelly was admitted to the bar in 1852. In 1855, he married Katherine McCaffrey, with whom he had three children. In 1855, he resigned his clerkship, entered politics with campaign speeches for Democratic candidates, and participated in communal home building schemes. He fell away from the Catholic Church sometime in the 1850s, and thereafter, never participated in any organized religion.

Donnelly moved to the Minnesota Territory in 1857 amidst rumors of a financial scandal, and there he settled in Dakota County. He initiated a utopian community called Nininger City, together with several partners. However, the Panic of 1857 doomed the attempt at a cooperative farm and community and left Donnelly deeply in debt.

His wife Katherine died in 1894. In 1898, he married his secretary, Marian Hanson.

Donnelly died on January 1, 1901, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, age 69 years. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in St. Paul, Minnesota. His personal papers are archived at the Minnesota Historical Society.

==Political and literary career==

Donnelly entered politics, this time as a Republican, with two unsuccessful campaigns for the state legislature (1857, 1858). Though he was not elected, Donnelly was recognized as a highly effective political speaker, which led to a successful campaign for lieutenant governor, which he held from 1860 to 1863. He was a Radical Republican Congressman from Minnesota in the 38th, 39th, and 40th congresses, (1863–1869), a state senator from 1874 to 1878 and 1891–1894 and a state representative from 1887 to 1888 and 1897–1898. As a legislator, he advocated extending the powers of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to provide education for freedmen so that they could protect themselves once the bureau was withdrawn. Donnelly was also an early supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage. After leaving the Minnesota State Senate in 1878, he returned to his law practice and writing.

In 1877, Donnelly spoke at a meeting of 10,000 people where he read his preamble to the conference platform. The document of 12 short paragraphs, as altered slightly for the party&#x27;s first nominating convention in Omaha that July, was the pithiest and soon became the most widely circulated statement of the Populist credo. Donnelly talked about the corruption of politics and voting, newspapers giving out false and biased material, and how the Populists needed to take back the country that was their own.

In 1882, he published &quot;&quot;, his best-known work. It details theories concerning the mythical lost continent of Atlantis. The book sold well and is widely credited with initiating the theme of Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization that became such a feature of popular literature during the 20th century and contributed to the emergence of Mayanism. Donnelly suggested that Atlantis, whose story was told by Plato in the dialogues of Timaeus and Critias, had been destroyed during the same event remembered in the Bible as the Great Flood. He cited research on the ancient Maya civilization by Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg and Augustus Le Plongeon, claiming that it had been the place of a common origin of ancient civilizations in Africa, especially ancient Egypt, Europe, and the Americas. He also thought that it had been the original home of an Aryan race whose red-haired, blue-eyed descendants could be found in Ireland. Donnelly wrote that Ireland was the &quot;Garden of Phoebus&quot; (Hyperborea) of the Western mythologists.

A year after &quot;Atlantis&quot;, he published &quot;&quot;, in which he expounded his belief that the Flood, as well as the destruction of Atlantis and the extinction of the mammoth, had been brought about by the near-collision of the earth with a massive comet. This book also sold well, and both books seem to have had an important influence on the development of Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s controversial ideas half a century later.

In 1888, he published &quot;The Great Cryptogram&quot; in which he proposed that Shakespeare&#x27;s plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea that was popular during the late 19th and early 20th century. He then traveled to England to arrange the English publication of his book by Sampson Low, speaking at the Oxford (and Cambridge) Union in which his thesis &quot;Resolved, that the works of William Shakespeare were composed by Francis Bacon&quot; was put to an unsuccessful vote. The book was a complete failure, and Donnelly was discredited.

Donnelly also made several other campaigns for public office during the 1880s. He made a losing campaign for Congress, this time as a Democrat, in 1884. In 1887, he successfully campaigned for a seat in the Minnesota State Legislature as an independent. During this period, he was also an organizer of the Minnesota Farmers&#x27; Alliance.

In 1892, Donnelly wrote the preamble of the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s Omaha Platform for the presidential campaign of that year. He was nominated for Vice President of the United States in 1900 by the People&#x27;s Party, also known as the Populist Party. The People&#x27;s Party was a development of the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance, and had a platform that demanded the abandonment of the gold standard and later for the adoption of free silver, the abolition of national banks, a graduated income tax, a direct election of senators, civil service reform, and an eight-hour day. That year, Donnelly also campaigned for governor of Minnesota but was defeated.

The People&#x27;s Party protested the railroad companies corrupting government and advocated government regulation of the railroads. Donnelly had a key leadership role in this party, yet he received $10,000 from the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company.

==State park==
During the 1930s, an organization was formed to lobby for the creation of a state park at Donnelly&#x27;s home at Nininger near Hastings, Minnesota. The house was still standing in 1939, but the effort failed and the house has since been demolished.

==Reception==
Donnelly&#x27;s writings on Atlantis have been rejected by scholars and scientists. He has been described as a crank and pseudoscience promoter. Gordon Stein has noted that &quot;most of what Donnelly said was highly questionable or downright wrong.&quot;

However, Donnelly&#x27;s concept of &quot;hyperdiffusionism,&quot; which purports to detect prehistoric catastrophes in the mythologies of multiple unrelated cultures, is credited as inspiring J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional Númenor. In his 1939 essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories,&quot; Tolkien gave some credence to diffusion as a source of mythology.

==Works==
His books include:
*&quot;The Mourner&#x27;s Vision: A Poem&quot; (1850), a long poem he wrote at the age of 18.
*&quot;&quot; (1882), in which he attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from its high-Neolithic culture.
* &quot;&quot; (1883), in which he proposed that a comet hit the earth in prehistoric times and destroyed a high civilization.
* &quot;The Shakespeare Myth&quot; (1887)
* &quot;Essay on the Sonnets of Shakespeare&quot;
* &quot;The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon&#x27;s Cipher in Shakespeare&#x27;s Plays&quot; (1888), in which he maintained he had discovered codes in the works of Shakespeare indicating that their true author was Francis Bacon.
* &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Column&quot; (1890), a science fiction novel set during 1988 about a worker revolt against a global oligarchy. (Published under the pseudonym of Edmund Boisgilbert.)
* &quot;Doctor Huguet: A Novel&quot; (1891) (Published under the pseudonym of Edmund Boisgilbert.)
* &quot;The Golden Bottle or the Story of Ephraim Benezet of Kansas&quot; (1892)
* &quot;The Bryan Campaign for the American People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1896)
* &quot;The Cipher in the Plays, and on the Tombstone&quot; (1899)

<text>Wake Forest University (WFU) is a private research university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States. Founded in 1834, the university received its name from its original location in Wake Forest, north of Raleigh, North Carolina. The Reynolda Campus, the university&#x27;s main campus, has been located north of downtown Winston-Salem since the university moved there in 1956. 
Wake Forest also maintains other academic campuses in Charlotte, North Carolina; Washington, D.C.; Venice; Vienna; and London.

Wake Forest University&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate schools include the School of Business, School of Arts and Sciences, School of Professional Studies, School of Divinity, School of Law, and School of Medicine. 
There are over 250 student clubs and organizations at the university, including fraternities and sororities, intramural sports, a student newspaper and a radio station. The university is classified among &quot;R-2: Doctoral Universities – High Research Activity&quot; and its undergraduate admissions is considered selective. 
According to the National Science Foundation, Wake Forest spent $191 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 117th in the nation.

Wake Forest University athletic teams are known as the Demon Deacons and compete in eighteen NCAA Division I intercollegiate sports. Those teams have won 10 NCAA team championships and the university is a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

==History==

During the Baptist State Convention of 1833, at Cartledge Creek Baptist Church in Rockingham, North Carolina, establishment of Wake Forest Institute was ratified. The school was founded after the North Carolina Baptist State Convention purchased a plantation from Calvin Jones in an area north of Raleigh (Wake County) called the &quot;Forest of Wake&quot;. The new school, designed to teach both Baptist ministers and laymen, opened on February 3, 1834, as the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute. Students and staff were required to spend half of each day doing manual labor on its plantation. Samuel Wait, a Baptist minister, was selected as the principal, later president, of the institute.

===Wake Forest College===

In 1838, the school was renamed Wake Forest College, and the manual-labor system was abandoned. The town that grew up around the college came to be called the town of Wake Forest. In 1862, during the American Civil War, the school closed due to the loss of most students and some faculty to service in the Confederate States Army. The college re-opened in 1866 and prospered over the next four decades under the leadership of presidents Washington Manly Wingate, Thomas H. Pritchard, and Charles Taylor. In 1894, the School of Law was established, followed by the School of Medicine in 1902. In 1911, Louise Heims Beck became the university&#x27;s first librarian, later going on to become a vaudeville performer and the recipient of a Tony Award. The university held its first summer session in 1921. Lea Laboratory was built in 1887–1888, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The leading college figure in the early 20th century was William L. Poteat, a biologist and the first layman to be elected president in the college&#x27;s history. &quot;Dr. Billy&quot; continued to promote growth, hired many outstanding professors, and expanded the science curriculum. He also stirred upheaval among North Carolina Baptists with his strong support of teaching the theory of evolution but eventually won formal support from the Baptist State Convention for academic freedom at the college.

===Move to Winston-Salem===

The School of Medicine moved to Winston-Salem (then North Carolina&#x27;s second-largest city) in 1941 under the supervision of Dean Coy Cornelius Carpenter, who guided the school through the transition from a two-year to a four-year program. The school then became the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. The following year, 1942, Wake Forest admitted its first female undergraduate students, after World War II dramatically depleted the pool of male students.

In 1946, as a result of large gifts from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, the entire college agreed to move to Winston-Salem, a move that was completed for the beginning of the fall 1956 term, under the leadership of Harold W. Tribble. Charles and Mary Reynolds Babcock (daughter of R. J. Reynolds) donated to the college about of fields and woods at &quot;Reynolda&quot;, their estate. A name change to Smith Reynolds University was considered, but dropped. From 1952 to 1956, fourteen new buildings were constructed on the new campus. These buildings were constructed in Georgian style. The old campus in Wake Forest was sold to the Baptist State Convention to establish the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.

===Desegregation===
On April 27, 1962, Wake Forest&#x27;s board of trustees voted to accept Edward Reynolds, a native of Ghana, as the first black full-time undergraduate at the school. This made Wake Forest the first major private university in the South to desegregate. Reynolds, a transfer student from Shaw University, became the first black graduate of the university in 1964, when he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. He went on to earn master&#x27;s degrees at Ohio University and Yale Divinity School, and a PhD in African history from the University of London in 1972. He became a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of several history books. 
Other diversity milestones:
* Japanese student Konsukie Akiyama became the first Asian graduate in 1909.
* The first women undergraduates were admitted in 1942.
* James G. Jones became the first American Indian graduate in 1958. He was from the Lumbe nation.
* On February 23, 1960, ten Wake Forest students joined eleven students from Winston-Salem State Teachers College (present-day Winston-Salem State University) for a sit-in at Woolworth&#x27;s lunch counter in downtown Winston-Salem. The students&#x27; non-violent protest, along with other protests in Winston-Salem, led to the desegregation of the city&#x27;s restaurants and lunch counters on May 23 of that year.
* Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in Wait Chapel on the Wake Forest campus on October 11, 1962.
* Herman Eure (biology) and Dolly McPherson (English) became the first black tenure-track professors in 1974.
* The Office of Minority Affairs was formed in 1978 and later became the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Wake Forest also added an Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion, an LGBTQ Center, and a Women&#x27;s Center.
* In 1982, poet/actress/author Maya Angelou was hired as Reynolds Professor of American Studies.
* In 2002, Wake Forest added a cultural diversity requirement to its curriculum, mandating all undergraduates take one of 74 courses to educate them on cultural diversity.
* Wake Forest appointed its first (part-time) Muslim chaplain in 2010. In 2011, the first associate chaplain for Jewish Life was named.

====Recognition====
Wake Forest&#x27;s Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Barbee Oakes was named one of the &quot;25 Women Making a Difference&quot; in 2012 Diverse Issues in Higher Education, recognizing her for commitment to initiatives that promote pluralism and foster community. Wake Forest was among 40 schools across the country awarded the 2012 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award by Insight into Diversity magazine. 

====Controversy==== 
On March 12, 2019, Wake Forest was one of eight colleges and universities involved in the Varsity Blues scandal. It was later revealed that former Wake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson accepted a $50,000 bribe to help a future student be admitted into the university.

===Recent history===

A graduate studies program was inaugurated in 1961, and in 1967 the school became the fully accredited Wake Forest University. The Babcock Graduate School of Management, now known as the School of Business, was established in 1969. The James R. Scales Fine Arts Center opened in 1979.

Other alternative service plans are available for those who intend to be an army doctor, lawyer, or chaplain with source of commissioning via ROTC.

At Wake Forest contracted ROTC cadets are given full scholarship, a monthly stipend, and book money by the US Army. The university extends the scholarship with free room and board.

The program also serves students from Winston-Salem State University and Salem College.

===Fraternities and sororities===
With 25 chapters, fraternity and sorority membership consists of around 45 percent of the undergraduate student population. Wake Forest requires that all new members of fraternities and sororities complete at least one semester of full-time studies, so the primary recruiting time is during the spring semester.

Most fraternities and sororities have lounges in campus residence halls, with surrounding rooms being reserved for the chapter. One fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, has a residence off campus.

All fraternities and sororities at Wake Forest belong to one of three councils – the Interfraternity Council, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the Panhellenic Council. Each of these councils has an executive board that provides resources and programming to its member organizations.

Fraternities on campus: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Sigma Phi, Chi Psi, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Alpha Psi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Pi, and Theta Chi.

Sororities on campus: Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Sigma Theta, Delta Xi Phi, Delta Zeta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Beta Gamma, Kappa Delta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Professional or Academic Fraternities and Sororities on campus: Alpha Kappa Psi, Alpha Phi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Psi.

Wake Forest is also home to the Sigma Delta chapter of Order of Omega, an honor society for members of Greek organizations. Members are selected from the top three percent of Greeks on campus based on high standards in the areas of scholarship, leadership, and involvement within their respective organization and within the fraternity/sorority, campus and local communities.

In the mid-2010s, fraternities at Wake Forest began to come under more public scrutiny for claims of sexual assault, racism, and violence.

===Athletic activities===
Wake Forest offers classes in yoga, Pilates, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Zumba, BodyPump, and indoor cycling. Wake Forest students field 36 club sport teams that compete against other colleges and universities at the regional and national level. Over half of the student body participates in 18 different intramural sports. The university&#x27;s fitness and recreation center, Reynolds Gym, is the oldest gym in the ACC. It was renovated in March 2018 and renamed the Wake Forest Wellbeing Center. The project includes the addition of the Sutton Center which opened in January 2016.

===Dining facilities===
Wake Forest undergraduate students living on campus are required to sign up for a meal plan in coordination with the Office of Residence Life and Housing and Aramark. Several dining rooms, a food court, bar and grill, Starbucks, and convenience stores are available.

===Undergraduate student housing===
Students are guaranteed housing for four years. , students were required to live on campus for their first three years as a full-time enrolled student.

The three main community areas for the 2013–2014 academic year are:
* South Campus (First Year Student Housing): Babcock Hall, Bostwick Hall, Johnson Hall, Luter Hall, Collins Hall, South Hall, Angelou Hall
* Quad Area (Upperclass Student Housing): Kitchin Hall, Davis Hall, Poteat/Huffman Halls, Taylor/Efird Halls
* North Area (Upperclass Student Housing): Magnolia Hall, Dogwood Hall, Polo Hall, Martin Hall, Palmer Hall, Piccolo Hall, North Campus Apartments, Student Apartments, Polo Road houses area.

===Personal and career development===
In 2009, President Nathan Hatch outlined in his strategic plan a campus culture in which personal and career development would become an integral component of the undergraduate student experience. Later that year, he created a cabinet-level position and appointed Andy Chan as the vice president for personal and career development.

Chan&#x27;s work has included hosting a national conference in 2012 (&quot;Rethinking Success: From the Liberal Arts to Careers in the 21st Century&quot;) featuring Condoleezza Rice, and issuing &quot;A Roadmap for Transforming the College-To-Career Experience&quot; in 2013. Wake Forest quadrupled the size of the staff, integrated personal and career development into freshman orientation, and added &quot;College to Career&quot; courses.

===Arts===
Every student takes at least one course in the arts (art history, studio art, theatre, dance, music performance and music in liberal arts) before graduating. In 2011–2012, more than 500 Wake Forest students were directly involved in performances on campus, and 110 public exhibitions in theatre, music dance and visual arts held in Scales Fine Arts Center in 2012–2013. The university&#x27;s home, Winston-Salem, calls itself the &quot;City of Arts &amp; Innovation&quot;.

Students also can take advantage of a number of other art-related opportunities:
* The WFU Art Collections consist of nine independent collections with more than 1,600 works located in 35 on- and off-campus locations. Every four years, selected students make an art-buying trip to New York City to add to the collections.
* Students are within walking distance of the Reynolda House Museum of American Art, the Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology, the Charlotte and Philip Hanes Art Gallery and START, the student art gallery.
* The Theatre Department, which allows students to participate from their first year, supports interdisciplinary exploration of its plays through the Interdisciplinary Performance and the Liberal Arts Center (IPLACe), which connects the performing arts and other academic departments.
* The student-run Reynolda Film Festival is a free weeklong series of film screenings and workshops featuring a keynote address by a well-known and respected representative of the film industry.
* The Secrest Artists Series offers the Wake Forest community several free opportunities each year to hear world-class concerts. 

===School songs===
Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni reunions and athletic games is the alma mater, &quot;Dear Old Wake Forest&quot;, and the fight song &quot;O Here&#x27;s To Wake Forest&quot;.

===Screamin&#x27; Demons===

Student attendance of Wake Forest Football and Basketball games is high, in part due to the program known as &quot;Screamin&#x27; Demons&quot;. At the beginning of each respective athletic season students on the Reynolda Campus can sign up for the program whereby they pay $40 for each year; in addition to the best seats at the games, this gets students a football shirt in the fall and a tie-dye T-shirt in the spring along with a card that serves as an automatic pass to the sporting events. They lose this privilege if they miss two of the games. Through the planning of Sports Marketing and the Screamin&#x27; Demons program, basketball game seats in the students section are difficult to attain without participating in the Screamin&#x27; Demons program. The arena can seat only 2,250 of the 4,500 undergraduate students at Wake Forest. At least 150 seats are always set aside for non-Screamin Demons, who sit behind the 2,100 member group.

==Athletics==

Originally, Wake Forest&#x27;s athletic teams were known as The Old Gold and Black or the Baptists, due to its association with the Baptist Convention (from which it later separated itself). However, in 1923, after a particularly impressive win against nearby rival the Duke Blue Devils, a newspaper reporter wrote that the Deacons &quot;fought like Demons&quot;, giving rise to the current team name, the &quot;Demon Deacons&quot;.

Wake Forest&#x27;s Athletic teams have won a total of ten NCAA team national championships in five different sports. The women&#x27;s field hockey team has won three (2002, 2003, 2004), the men&#x27;s golf team has won three (1974, 1975, 1986), the men&#x27;s soccer team (2007), the baseball team (1955), and men&#x27;s tennis (2018), women&#x27;s golf (2023) have won one each. Wake Forest has a 96% student athlete graduation rate. Wake Forest is sometimes referred to as being a part of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; or &quot;The Big Four&quot;, terms that refer to the four North Carolina schools that compete heatedly against each other within the ACC; these include Duke, North Carolina, and North Carolina State, as well as Wake Forest.

Hoover was part of the program&#x27;s only NCAA tournament appearance in 1988, when Wake Forest beat Villanova and lost to Tennessee. Wake Forest has appeared in the Women&#x27;s NIT four times, all under Petersen. In 2015, Dearica Hamby was drafted 6th overall in the WNBA draft by the San Antonio Stars (now Las Vegas Aces).

<doc id="239332" wikidata="Q285265" url="?curid=239332" title="Software patents under the European Patent Convention">
<text>The patentability of software, computer programs and computer-implemented inventions under the European Patent Convention (EPC) is the extent to which subject matter in these fields is patentable under the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of October 5, 1973. The subject also includes the question of whether European patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in these fields (sometimes called &quot;software patents&quot;) are regarded as valid by national courts.

Under the EPC, and in particular its Article 52, &quot;programs for computers&quot; are not regarded as inventions for the purpose of granting European patents, but this exclusion from patentability only applies to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such. As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much stricter scrutiny when compared to their American counterpart, that does not mean that all inventions including some software are &quot;de jure&quot; not patentable.

== Article 52 of the European Patent Convention ==
The European Patent Convention (EPC), Article 52, paragraph 2, excludes from patentability, in particular
Paragraph 3 then says:

The words &quot;as such&quot; have caused patent applicants, attorneys, examiners, and judges a great deal of difficulty since the EPC came into force in 1978. The Convention, as with all international conventions, should be construed using a purposive approach. However, the purpose behind the words and the exclusions themselves is far from clear.

One interpretation, which is followed by the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, is that an invention is patentable if it provides a new and non-obvious &quot;technical&quot; solution to a technical problem. The problem, and the solution, may be entirely resident within a computer such as a way of making a computer run faster or more efficiently in a novel and inventive way. Alternatively, the problem may be how to make the computer easier to use, such as in T 928/03.

== Patentability under European Patent Office case law ==

Like the other parts of the paragraph 2, computer programs are open to patenting to the extent that they provide a technical contribution to the prior art. In the case of computer programs and according to the case law of the Boards of Appeal, a technical contribution typically means a &quot;further technical effect&quot; that goes beyond the normal physical interaction between the program and the computer.

Though many argue that there is an inconsistency on how the EPO now applies Article 52, the practice of the EPO is fairly consistent regarding the treatment of the different elements of Article 52(2). A mathematical method is not patentable, but an electrical filter designed according to this method would not be excluded from patentability by Article 52(2) and (3).

According to the jurisprudence of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, a technical effect provided by a computer program can be, for example, a reduced memory access time, a better control of a robotic arm or an improved reception and/or decoding of a radio signal. It does not have to be external to the computer on which the program is run; reduced hard disk access time or an enhanced user interface could also be a technical effect.

=== First hurdle: patentable subject-matter requirement ===
As of 2013, the criterion used for distinguishing &quot;inventions&quot; from &quot;non-inventions&quot; at the EPO, i.e. the patent eligibility requirement at the EPO, is that the subject-matter must have a technical character. Whether the subject-matter has a technical character is assessed without reference to the prior art. According to Stefan Steinbrener, former chairman of an EPO Technical Board of Appeal, this means that:
Any of the subject-matter listed in Article 52(2) EPC may comprise an invention if it has technical character or contributes to it (in particular because a technical problem is solved by using technical means or a technical effect is achieved, technical interactions occur or technical adaptations are effected, in other words: if such subject-matter lends itself to a technical application).&quot;

Some ten years before 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;T 154/04-r12&quot;&gt;Decision T 154/04 of 15 November 2006, Reasons 12, published in the Official Journal of the European Patent Office 2008, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; a shift occurs in the case law. The &quot;contribution approach&quot; or &quot;technical effect approach&quot;, used to assess what was regarded as an invention within the meaning of Art. 52(1) and (2), was abandoned. According to the &quot;contribution approach&quot; (see for instance T 52/85), the claimed subject-matter did not concern an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC when no contribution was made in a field not excluded from patentability. The &quot;contribution approach&quot; was a disguised inventive step assessment.

Decisions such as T 258/03 and T 154/04 have made it clear that the contribution approach was no longer applicable. Indeed 
The structure of the EPC (...) suggests that it should be possible to determine whether subject-matter is excluded under Article 52(2) EPC without any knowledge of the state of the art (including common general knowledge). (T 258/03, Reasons 3.1).
It now suffices that a physical entity or activity involves technical means to be considered as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC. Having technical character is an implicit requisite of an &quot;invention&quot; within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC (requirement of &quot;technicality&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;T 154/04-r5b&quot;&gt; Decision T 154/04, Reasons 5 (B).&lt;/ref&gt;

But the patentable subject matter test of Article 52(2) and (3) is only the first step towards patentability, the first hurdle. Computer programs can also be refused and are often refused on the ground of lack of inventive step. This is the second hurdle, which should not mixed up with the first hurdle. As a Board of appeal put it in T 258/03 (Reasons 4.6) in relation to the fact that the &quot;contribution approach&quot; was no longer applicable, 
[we are] aware that [our] comparatively broad interpretation of the term &quot;invention&quot; in Article 52(1) EPC will include activities which are so familiar that their technical character tends to be overlooked, such as the act of writing using pen and paper. Needless to say, however, this does not imply that all methods involving the use of technical means are patentable. They still have to be new, represent a non-obvious technical solution to a technical problem, and be susceptible of industrial application.

The technical character requirements relating to the first hurdle is now a formal requirement. In other words, it is a simple test that is related to the language used in the patent claim. Acceptable software patent claims can meet the first hurdle by starting with &quot;computer-implemented method for...&quot; or &quot;system configured to...&quot;.

=== Second hurdle: inventive step requirement ===
The interpretation of the term &quot;invention&quot; in the patentable subject-matter test, as used by the Boards of Appeal, has come with an adjustment of the case law relating to the inventive step requirement.

Any non-technical feature, i.e. a feature from a field excluded from patentability under , cannot be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step, unless they (the non-technical features) do interact with the technical subject-matter to solve a technical problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;T 154/04-r5f&quot;&gt; Decision T 154/04, Reasons 5 (F).&lt;/ref&gt; Assessing whether or not a feature contributes to the technical character of a claim has been viewed as difficult.

Furthermore, the &quot;state of the art&quot; (used as the starting point for the inventive step assessment) should be construed as meaning the &quot;state of technology&quot;, the person skilled in the art is the person skilled in the relevant field of technology, and &quot;for the purpose of the problem-and-solution approach, the problem must be a technical problem which the skilled person in the particular technical field might be asked to solve at the relevant priority date&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T 154/04-r5g&quot;&gt; Decision T 154/04, Reasons 5 (G).&lt;/ref&gt; Fields excluded under Art. 52(2) are not considered part of the technology for the assessment of inventive step.

Thus an expert in marketing or insurance policies for instance cannot be chosen as the fictional person skilled in the art, while a computer hardware or memory management expert may be chosen as the reference fictional person. This means that the mere implementation of a business method on a computer or computer network rarely involves an inventive step, while improving a computer-assisted industrial process or providing a more efficient memory management within a computer may involve an inventive step. 

The case law of the EPO Boards of Appeal is not binding on the first instance departments of the EPO (i.e. the Examining Divisions), and different Examining Divisions of the EPO may assess patentability differently. Likewise, during an opposition procedure before the EPO, where the grant of a recently granted European patent may be opposed by a third party (opponent), the patent may be revoked if the Opposition Division form a different view on whether or not the invention in question was patentable.

The practice for assessing the technical character for the second hurdle in the EPO is described in the Guidelines for Examination, which provides specific examples in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. To meet the second hurdle, a software invention needs to present a &quot;technical application&quot;. This application is the purpose of the invention as defined in the patent claim, establishing a connection between a technical limitation of the patent claim and the technical purpose of the invention.

== Enforceability before national courts ==
The case law of the EPO Boards of Appeal is not binding on the EPO member states and different national courts acting on different cases may take a different view of patentability under Art. 52(2) EPC. The decision of EPO (directly or in appeal proceedings) not to a grant a European patent can however not be challenged in national courts. Any European patent issued by the EPO may be revoked in a patent infringement lawsuit or revocation proceedings before a national court if for instance the court judges the invention as non-patentable in view of new prior art evidence or in view of a reconsideration of the available prior art. Furthermore, member states have certain degree of freedom regarding exceptions: the extent to which another party may use a patent, for example to decompile software that would otherwise infringe a European patent.

=== United Kingdom ===
Peter Prescott QC, while sitting as a Deputy Judge in the UK High Court, and in consideration of &quot;CFPH&#x27;s applications&quot; noted that the EPO decisions are prescriptive, but not binding on the UK courts, but also recalled the judgement of the Court of Appeal in &quot;Fujitsu&#x27;s application&quot; which stated that it would be disastrous if there was any substantial divergence between the interpretations given by the UK courts and the EPO to Article 52(2) EPC.

The judgement in &quot;CFPH&#x27;s applications&quot; was the first in a flurry of UK court cases since 2005 involving re-consideration by the High Court of patent applications refused by the UK Patent Office.

The two patent applications in question both involved networked interactive wagering on the outcomes of events. Each application was refused as relating to a method of doing business as such. The applications were not refused as relating to a computer program as such, because the computer program was simply a tool that was being used to implement a new set of business rules and the invention was not really about the computer program. Although the judgement stressed that the reasoning used was quite different from the type that would have been applied by the EPO, the judge was satisfied that the EPO would have come to the same conclusion using their own reasoning.

The decision criticises the EPO&#x27;s reliance on insisting that an invention must provide a technical contribution, and not merely a business based contribution. As evidenced by the judgment in &quot;Dyson v Hoover&quot; the commercial background to an invention may help to show that a certain technical advance was or was not obvious.

In &quot;Research In Motion UK Ltd. v Inpro Licensing SARL&quot;, the UK High Court had the opportunity to consider a patent that had been granted by the EPO. The patent involved the &#x27;pretreating&#x27; of web pages before they were downloaded to machines of modest processing capacity. Mr Justice Pumfrey came to the conclusion that the claimed invention was obvious, but specifically rejected the allegation that it was excluded from patent protection as a computer program as such. He noted that &quot;all modern industry depends upon programmed computers, and one must be astute not to defeat patents on the ground that the subject matter is excluded under Article 52 unless the invention lies in excluded subject matter &quot;as such&quot;&quot; (emphasis added).

The UK Court of Appeal judgment in &quot;Aerotel v Telco and Macrossan&#x27;s Application&quot; criticised EPO practice to deem non-technical subject matter, such as new music or a story, as part of the prior art as not being intellectually honest. The EPO Boards of Appeal have since responded by saying that the technical effect approach (with the rider) applied in the Aerotel/Macrossan judgement is irreconcilable with the European Patent Convention.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, in the case &quot;Logikverifikation&quot; (13 December 1999), the German Federal Court (German: &quot;Bundesgerichtshof&quot; or &quot;BGH&quot;) ruled on a case involving a national patent application claiming a computer-implemented invention, namely a &quot;method for hierarchical logic verification of highly-integrated circuits&quot;. Going against the run of previous case law, it overruled the German Federal Patent Court (German: &quot;Bundespatentgericht&quot; or &quot;BPatG&quot;), and came to the conclusion that the claimed subject-matter did properly meet the &#x27;technical&#x27; requirement, can not be excluded from patentability for that reason and that the court has to go into substantial examination. The question about the exclusion of &quot;computer programs as such&quot;(sic) was mentioned the first time, but set aside as the court did not see the need to determine that question.

BPatG objections were also overruled in the decisions &quot;Sprachanalyseeinrichtung&quot; (German BGH, 11 May 2000) and &quot;Suche fehlerhafter Zeichenketten&quot; (German BGH, 17 October 2001). In the civil law tradition of mainland Europe however, legal precedent does not necessarily acquire the same formally binding character that it assumes in the common law traditions typical of most English-speaking countries.

In fact, more recently the same court has repeatedly upheld the rejection of patent claims to computers and programs operating thereon, as in &quot;Rentabilitätsermittlung&quot; as well as in &quot;Informationsübermittlungsverfahren&quot;.

=== France ===
France was the first European nation that excluded «les programmes ou séries d&#x27;instructions pour le déroulement des opérations d&#x27;une machine calculatrice» (&quot;programs or series of instructions for the procession of operations of a calculating machine&quot;, i.e. computer programs) from being an industrial invention in 1968 in Loi n°68-1 Article 7. Two relevant decisions, namely &quot;Mobil Oil Corp.&quot;, and &quot;SA SAGEM&quot;, rejected the patentability. for the reason of missing a technical character. In &quot;Schlumberger&quot;, it was determined that a patent cannot be invalidated only because it uses a computer program as part of the technical process. In &quot;Infomil&quot;, the court declared that a claim for an information system always has technical character and is therefore protectible.

===Unified Patent Court===
The Unified Patent Court is a court common to several member states of the European Union, including Germany, France and Italy. It has jurisdiction regarding European patents as any national court would do. With the entry into force of the Unified Patent Court Agreement, patent proprietors also have the possibility to request unitary effect for European patents: which means that the European patent after grant will be regarded a single undividable patent for those EU countries that participate. For the latter patents, the Unified Patent Court will generally have exclusive competence. Regarding software, Article 27k of the Unified Patent Court Agreement allows decompiling of software, even without the consent of the patent owner.

Groups opposed to software patents have argued that the proposed Unified Patent Court court may have strong ties to the patent industry. They assume therefore it allows software patents to be enforced despite rules that forbid them – such as explicitly allowing decompiling of software protected by patents in the Unified Patent Court Agreement – and failed attempts by the European Parliament to bring those provisions under EU law rather than under Unified Patent Court law.

== Referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal ==

Under , the President of the EPO has the power to refer a point of law to an Enlarged Board where two Boards of Appeal have given different decisions on that question.

On 27 October 2006, in its judgment in Aerotel v Telco and Macrossan&#x27;s Application, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales said (at para. 25) that &quot;The decisions of the EPO Boards of Appeal [in this software patentability area] are mutually contradictory&quot; and (also at para. 25) that &quot;surely the time has come for matters to be clarified by an Enlarged Board of Appeal&quot;. And even though the English Court of Appeal went on to say (at para. 25) that it &quot;is formally no business of ours to define questions to be asked of an Enlarged Board of Appeal&quot;, it went on to suggest (at para. 76) questions which it thought that the President of the EPO may refer to an EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal.

In response, Alain Pompidou, then president of the EPO, is reported to have said that the EPO was very interested in developments in the case law of national courts and that he had &quot;taken note of the UK decision, but a decision on whether or not it would be opportune to follow the suggestions for a referral has not yet been taken.&quot; Subsequently, however, it appears that Alain Pompidou has written a letter dated 22 February 2007 to Lord Justice Jacob of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (with a copy to the United Kingdom Patent Office) advising that he has &quot;decided that at the moment there is an insufficient legal basis for a referral under Article 112(1)(b)&quot;, and that &quot;the appropriate moment for a referral would be where the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not&quot;.

Subsequently, the Board in decision T 154/04 refused to refer questions &quot;explicitly taken from the questions proposed for referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal in the &quot;Aerotel/Macrossan&quot; judgement&quot; to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

Eventually, on 22 October 2008, the then President of the EPO, Alison Brimelow, referred a point of law to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The questions which were the subject of the referral related to the patentability of programs for computers under the European Patent Convention (EPC) and were, according to the President of the EPO, of fundamental importance as they related to the definition of &quot;the limits of patentability in the field of computing.&quot; The referral had been quoted as relating to the &quot;deeply contentious question about how to assess the patentability of software-related inventions&quot;. In May 2010 however, the Enlarged Board of Appeal considered the referral to be inadmissible because, in their opinion, no divergent decisions had been identified in the referral.

== Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions ==
Proposed in 2002, one motivation at least for the controversial draft &quot;EU Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions&quot; was to have been to establish common practice for the national courts; and, in cases of doubt as to its interpretation, to have created a requirement for national courts of last instance to seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice. Even though Switzerland for instance is a member of the European Patent Organisation but not a member of the European Union, the EPO also signalled that it would have been likely to adjust its practice, if necessary, to conform with whatever text had finally emerged from the EU legislative procedure,

However, the directive became highly controversial, drawing increasing legislative notoriety to this area of European law. Proponents of the Directive claimed its purpose was to clarify the meaning of Article 52, by consolidating existing EPO practice. Opponents claimed the Directive would dismantle perceived more stringent restrictions against software patenting employed or employable by national courts, and lead to an increased assertion of patents on software Union-wide across the EU. After a history of procedural wrangling, and sustained lobbying and publicity efforts from both sides, the Directive, which had largely been supported by the European Commission and most member-state governments in contrast with their national parliaments, was overwhelmingly rejected by the European Parliament on 6 July 2005, terminating the legislative procedure.

This failure to reform the exclusion of software followed the failed attempt to delete programs for computers from Art. 52(2)(c) of the convention in 2000 at the diplomatic conference in Munich. At the time the reform was explicitly derogated in order to await the outcome of the consultation process for this EU Directive.

Final interpretation of the law in this area thus continues to be the responsibility of national courts, following national case-law (except when a European patent application is refused or when a European patent is revoked in opposition proceedings before the EPO, in which case the EPO has the final say regarding the interpretation of the EPC). A decisive supra-national authority for European patent law cases could be created under either proposals for the European Union patent or the Unified Patent Court.

== Statistics ==
According to a European Commission press release of 2002, &quot;since the EPC came into force in 1978, at least 30,000 patents for computer-implemented inventions have already been issued [by the EPO]&quot;.

<text>The European Patent Office (EPO) is one of the two organs of the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg), the other being the Administrative Council. The EPO acts as executive body for the organisation while the Administrative Council acts as its supervisory body as well as, to a limited extent, its legislative body. The actual legislative power to revise the European Patent Convention lies with the Contracting States themselves when meeting at a Conference of the Contracting States.

Within the European Patent Office, examiners are notably in charge of studying European patent applications, filed by applicants, to decide whether to grant a patent for an invention. The patents granted by the European Patent Office are called European patents.

==Function==

The European Patent Office (EPO) grants European patents covering the Contracting States to the European Patent Convention and several other states that have concluded extension and validation agreements with the EPO. The EPO provides a single patent grant procedure, but not a single patent from the point of view of enforcement. Hence a patent granted by the EPO is not a single or unitary European Union patent or uniformly recognised Europe-wide patent, but a bundle of national patents. Patents granted by the EPO can, however, be challenged centrally at the EPO via opposition proceedings. Besides granting European patents, the EPO is also in charge of establishing patentability search reports for national patent applications on behalf of the patent offices of France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, San Marino, Lithuania, Latvia and Monaco.

===Role in the unitary patent===
Since the European patent with unitary effect (also called &quot;unitary patent&quot;) entered into force on 1 June 2023, some administrative tasks relating thereto are performed by the EPO. Those tasks include the collection of renewal fees and registration of unitary effect upon grant, exclusive licenses and statements that licenses are available to any person. Decisions of the EPO regarding the unitary patent are open to appeal to the Unified Patent Court (UPC), rather than to the EPO Boards of Appeal.

==Legal status==
The European Patent Office is not a legal entity as such, but an organ of the European Patent Organisation, which has a legal personality.

==Location and staff==
The EPO headquarters are located in Munich, Germany. The EPO has also a branch in Rijswijk, Netherlands, near The Hague, sub-offices in Berlin, Germany, and Vienna, Austria, and an office for liaison with the EU institutions in Brussels, Belgium. At the end of 2019, the European Patent Office had a staff of 6 608 (with 3 675 based in Munich, 2 624 in Rijswijk, 227 in Berlin, 87 in Vienna and 3 in Brussels). The EPO comprised staff from 35 different nationalities, with 74% having a nationality different from that of the country they work in. In terms of gender diversity, 34% of all staff members were women. One quarter of managers were women, a slight increase on previous years. In 2019, the EPO spent over EUR 5 million on , with 94% of staff receiving at least one training activity during the year.

The premises of the European Patent Office enjoy a form of extraterritoriality. In accordance with the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which forms an integral part of the European Patent Convention under , the premises of the European Patent Organisation, and therefore those of the European Patent Office, are inviolable. The authorities of the States in which the Organisation has its premises are not authorized to enter those premises, except with the consent of the President of the European Patent Office. Such consent is however &quot;assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt protective action&quot;.

== Management ==

The European Patent Office is directed by a president, who is responsible for its activities to the Administrative Council. The president also represents the European Patent Organisation. The president has therefore a dual role: representative of the European Patent Organisation and head of the European Patent Office. The President of the European Patent Office is appointed by the Administrative Council. A majority of three-quarters of the votes of the Contracting States represented and voting in the Administrative Council is required for the appointment of the President.

The President is assisted by a collective body known as the Management Advisory Committee (MAC). Currently, the MAC comprises the President, three Vice-Presidents and several Principal Directors and Directors. Each MAC member is responsible for a specific business area and reports to the President. The MAC is expected to implement initiatives in alignment with general policy and propose initiatives or policy changes that could impact the activities of the EPO.

More generally, the &quot;management of the EPO is dominated by the delegates of the contracting States in the Administrative Council,&quot; these delegates being, according to Otto Bossung, primarily guided by their national interests rather than by supranational interests such as for instance the implementation of the EU internal market.

== Languages ==
 The three official languages of the European Patent Office are English, French and German and publications including the European Patent Bulletin and Official Journal of the European Patent Office are published in all three of those languages.

European patent applications may be filed in any language provided that a translation into one of the official languages is submitted within two months if the language of filing is not an EPO official language. The official language in which the application is filed or into which it is translated is taken to be the language of the proceedings and the application is published in that language. Documentary evidence may also be submitted in any language, although the EPO may require a translation.

Some Contracting States to the European Patent Convention have an official language which is not an official language of the EPO, such as Dutch, Italian or Spanish. These languages are referred to as &quot;admissible non-EPO languages&quot;. Residents or nationals of such States may submit any documents subject to a time limit in an official language of that State and there is a period of one month for filing a translation into an official language or the document is deemed not to have been filed. The filing fee and examination fee are reduced by 30% for certain categories of applicants, namely for small and medium-sized enterprises, natural persons, and &quot;non-profit organisations, universities or public research organisations&quot;, when filing a patent application or an examination request in an admissible non-EPO language and subsequently, or at the earliest simultaneously, file the necessary translation.

== Departments and directorates-general==

The European Patent Office includes the following departments to carry out the procedures laid down in the EPC:
* a Receiving Section, responsible for the examination on filing and the examination as to formal requirements of European patent applications;
* Search Divisions, &quot;responsible for drawing up European search reports&quot;;
* Examining Divisions, responsible for prior art searches and the examination of European patent applications;
* Opposition Divisions, responsible for the examination of oppositions against any European patent;
* a Legal Division, &quot;responsible for decisions in respect of entries in the Register of European Patents and in respect of registration on, and deletion from, the list of professional representatives&quot;;
* Boards of Appeal, &quot;responsible for the examination of appeals from decisions of the Receiving Section, the Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, and the Legal Division&quot;; and
* an Enlarged Board of Appeal to notably ensure uniform application of patent law.

The above departments of European Patent Office are organized into three &quot;Directorates-General&quot; (DG), each being directed by a Vice-President, the DG Patent Granting Process, the DG Corporate Services, and the DG Legal and International Affairs, and a Boards of Appeal Unit, acting as the EPO&#x27;s judiciary. According to Sir Robin Jacob, the members of the EPO Boards of Appeal are &quot;judges in all but name&quot;.

The European Patent Office does not make decisions on infringement matters. National courts have jurisdiction over infringement matters regarding European patents. Regarding the validity of European patents however, both the European Patent Office during opposition proceedings () and national courts during nullity proceedings () may decide to revoke a European patent.

== Activities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==
In the international procedure according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the European Patent Office acts as a Receiving Office, an International Searching Authority (ISA), an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) and, with effect from 1 July 2010, as a so-called Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA). The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides an international procedure for handling patent applications, called international applications, during the first 30 months after their first filing in any country party to the PCT. The European Patent Office does not grant &quot;international patents,&quot; as such patents do not exist. After 30 months (or, for a few countries, after 20 months) an international application must be converted into national or regional patent applications, and then are subject to national/regional grant procedures.

As Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA), the European Patent Office has announced that it will conduct no more than 700 supplementary international searches per year.

== Online services ==
The EPO offers on its web site several free services, including Espacenet and Open Patent Services (OPS) for searching within its collection of patent documents, the legal texts published in its Official Journal, the European Patent Register containing legal information relating to published European patent applications and European patents (the European Patent Register also allowing the inspection of files under ), and a publication server of the European patent applications and patents. There is also the CMS software for filing European patent applications online.

== International cooperation ==

The EPO engages in several forms of international co-operation within and outside of Europe, with other intellectual property offices, as well as with international organisations that are outside of the patent system. The EPO cooperates with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) as one of the Trilateral Patent Offices. It also works with the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), China&#x27;s National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in a co-operation known as the &quot;five IP offices&quot; or IP5.

On 27 April 2017, the EPO and the Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO) signed a program enabling increased work-sharing and accelerated treatment of patent applications between both patent offices. The agreement, known as the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH), was signed by the presidents of the EPO and EAPO in Munich. The EAPO president Saule Tlevlessova stated, &quot;The signing of this bilateral PPH agreement opens a new page in the history of EAPO-EPO co-operation, and will serve to benefit applicants and our offices.&quot;

Currently, the EPO offers three types of cooperation agreements with non-member states :
* Technical co-operation aims to align national or regional patent systems in emerging economies with the European patent system. It enables partners to access the EPO&#x27;s tools or participate in pilot programmes such as the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) which offers a fast-track procedure. 
* Reinforced partnerships build on technical co-operation and develop strategic ties in technical areas of mutual interest. Partner offices can avoid duplication of work through the re-use of EPO results.
* In the validation system, inventors and businesses filing for a European patent can extend the scope of protection to a validation state. This scheme enables long-term technical cooperation that can be customised according to partner requirements.

== Employees&#x27; representation and labour relations ==

The main staff union active within the EPO is the &quot;Staff Union of the European Patent Office&quot; (SUEPO).

As an international organization, EPO enjoys immunity and national courts have—in principle—no jurisdiction regarding disputes in which EPO is a party. Labour disputes can be submitted by employees to the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILOAT). Courts in the Netherlands have however on occasion taken jurisdiction when it found a breach of fundamental principles of human rights, based on European Court of Human Rights case law. Jurisdiction was assumed for example because the ILOAT procedure (of over 3 years) was too lengthy for a process involving health issues or regarding a conflict with labour unions, as no appeal to ILOAT or any other judicial organization was possible. The background to the latter judgment was the ongoing conflict between EPO staff and management, in particular the refusal of EPO to recognise the staff unions, blocking of e-mail communication between the unions and their members and restriction of the right to strike. Opstelten&#x27;s intervention was criticised by a number of Dutch legal experts including Cedric Ryngaert, Professor of International Law in Utrecht, who considered the Minister&#x27;s intervention to be unusual: &quot;Basically he erodes the power of the Court. International organisations are going to increasingly put themselves above the law, which is already a problem now. Opstelten relies on an Act from the seventies, which must be applied dynamically. Instead he takes a very conservative view.&quot;

Labour relations at the EPO during the presidency of Benoît Battistelli have been strained and marked by conflict with a noticeable escalation during 2014. Staff discontent has been attributed to Battistelli&#x27;s style of management which, according to reports in the German newspapers &quot;Die Zeit&quot; and &quot;Die Welt&quot;, was perceived by staff as being unduly autocratic and unsuited to a European intergovernmental body such as the EPO.

Concern has been expressed regarding the high number of suicides of EPO employees, five in over three years. The EPO President Battistelli dismissed the suggestions -by EPO staff union SUEPO- of a possible link between the suicide and working conditions at the EPO as &quot;totally inappropriate&quot; and accused the staff union of &quot;abusing a personal tragedy and inciting controversy&quot;. The EPO staff union SUEPO said that a direct link between the suicide and the working conditions had not been demonstrated but that the Dutch Labour Inspectorate should be given the opportunity of investigating the matter.

==Controversial investment fund==
In June 2018, the German Federal Court of Auditors () and financial experts criticized the planned establishment by the EPO of a fund, called &quot;EPO Treasury Investment Fund&quot; (EPOTIF), to manage 2.3 billion euros of its assets, the fund including risky financial products such as asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and credit default swaps.

==Quality of granted patents==
At the end of the 2010s and into the 2020s, a decline in the quality of patents granted by the EPO was reported and criticised, as the decline in the quality of searches and examinations at the EPO is seen as harmful to the industry (more invalid European patents granted means more legal uncertainty in the market).

<doc id="239340" wikidata="Q847092" url="?curid=239340" title="Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle">
<text>The extensor carpi radialis longus is one of the five main muscles that control movements at the wrist. This muscle is quite long, starting on the lateral side of the humerus, and attaching to the base of the second metacarpal bone (metacarpal of the index finger).

==Structure==
It originates from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus, from the lateral intermuscular septum, and by a few fibers from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

The fibers end at the upper third of the forearm in a flat tendon, which runs along the lateral border of the radius, beneath the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis; it then passes beneath the dorsal carpal ligament, where it lies in a groove on the back of the radius common to it and the extensor carpi radialis brevis, immediately behind the styloid process.

One of the three muscles of the radial forearm group, it initially lies beside the brachioradialis, but becomes mostly tendon early on. Passing between the brachioradialis and the extensor carpi radialis brevis, this tendon continues into the second tendon compartment together with the latter muscle.

It is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the second metacarpal bone, on its radial side.

===Innervation===
The extensor carpi radialis longus is a wrist extensor that is innervated by the radial nerve, from spinal roots C6 and C7. All other major extensor muscles in the superficial layer of the posterior compartment (the extensor digitorum, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and extensor digiti minimi) are innervated by the posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve.

==Function==
As the name suggests, this muscle is an extensor at the wrist joint and travels along the radial side of the arm, so it will also abduct (radial abduction) the hand at the wrist. That is, it manipulates the wrist so as to move the hand towards the thumb (i.e. abduction—away from the mid-position of the hand) and away from the palmar side (i.e. extension—increased angle between the palm and the front of the forearm).

==Exercises==
The muscle, like all extensors of the forearm, can be strengthened by exercise that resist its extension.

===Example exercises===
*Reverse wrist curls with dumbbells can be performed.

<text>In human anatomy, extensor carpi radialis brevis is a muscle in the forearm that acts to extend and abduct the wrist. It is shorter and thicker than its namesake extensor carpi radialis longus which can be found above the proximal end of the extensor carpi radialis brevis.

==Origin and insertion==
It arises from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, by the common extensor tendon; from the radial collateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles.

The fibres end approximately at the middle of the forearm in the form of a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the extensor carpi radialis longus, and accompanies it to the wrist; it passes beneath the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, beneath the extensor retinaculum, and inserts into the lateral dorsal surface of the base of the third metacarpal bone, with a few fibres inserting into the medial dorsal surface of the second metacarpal bone.

==Relations==
Under the extensor retinaculum the tendon lies on the back of the radius in a shallow groove, to the ulnar side of that which lodges the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longus, and separated from it by a faint ridge.

==Innervation==
Like all the muscles in the posterior forearm, ECR brevis is supplied by a branch of the radial nerve.

==Function==
It is an extensor, and an abductor of the hand at the wrist joint. That is, it serves to manipulate the wrist so that the fingers moves away from the palm.
The muscle, like all extensors of the forearm, can be strengthened by exercise that resist its extension; Reverse wrist curls with dumbbells can be performed.

<text>Fort Wagner or Battery Wagner was a beachhead fortification on Morris Island, South Carolina, that covered the southern approach to Charleston Harbor. Named for deceased Lt. Col. Thomas M. Wagner, it was the site of two American Civil War battles in the campaign known as Operations Against the Defenses of Charleston in 1863, in which United States forces took heavy casualties while trying to seize the fort. The Union Army&#x27;s second assault on Fort Wagner, the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, included African American soldiers from the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and 3rd United States Colored Infantry Regiment. Josiah T. Walls, who went on to become a United States Congressman from Florida, was one of the soldiers.

==Construction==
Fort Wagner measured by , and spanned an area between the Atlantic on the east and an impassable swamp on the west. Its walls, composed of sand and earth, rose above the level beach and were supported by palmetto logs and sandbags. The fort&#x27;s arsenal included fourteen cannons, the largest a Columbiad that fired a 128-pound shell. It was a large structure capable of sheltering nearly 1,000 of the fort&#x27;s 1,700-man garrison and provided substantial protection against naval shelling. The fort&#x27;s land face was protected by a water-filled trench, wide and deep, surrounded by buried land mines and sharpened palmetto stakes. The fort itself was supported by defenses throughout Morris Island.

==History==

The First Battle of Fort Wagner, occurred on July 11, 1863. Only 12 Confederate soldiers were killed, as opposed to 339 losses for the U.S. side.

The Second Battle of Fort Wagner, a week later, is better known. It was the Union attack on July 18, 1863, led by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first major American military units made up of black soldiers. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw led the 54th Massachusetts on foot while they charged, and was killed in the assault.

Although a tactical defeat, the publicity of the battle of Fort Wagner led to further action for black U.S. troops in the Civil War, and it spurred additional recruitment that gave the Union Army a further numerical advantage in troops over the South.

Union forces besieged the fort after the unsuccessful assault. By August 25, Union entrenchments were close enough to attempt an assault on the Advanced Rifle Pits, 240 yards in front of the Battery, but the attempt was defeated. A second attempt, by the 24th Massachusetts Infantry, on August 26 was successful. After enduring almost 60 days of heavy U.S. shelling, the Confederates abandoned it on the night of September 6–7, 1863, withdrawing all operable cannons and the garrison. 

The main reason the fort was abandoned was a concern about the loss of the garrison due to artillery fire and the threat of imminent assault. On September 6, the garrison commander, Colonel Keitt, wrote to his superiors, &quot;The garrison must be taken away immediately after dark, or it will be destroyed or captured. It is idle to deny that the heavy Parrott shells have breached the walls and are knocking away the bomb-proofs. Pray have boats immediately after dark at Cummings Point to take away the men. I say deliberately that this must be done or the garrison will be sacrificed. I am sending the wounded and sick now to Cummings Point, and will continue to do so, if possible, until all are gone. I have a number of them now there. I have not in the garrison 400 effective men, including artillery. The engineers agree in opinion with me, or, rather, shape my opinion. I shall say no more.&quot;A council of war in Charleston on the 4th had already reached the same conclusion, and the evacuation was carried out as planned.

The fall of Battery Wagner had considerable strategic significance. With its loss and that of Fort Gregg, Morris Island fell to the US. Although Charleston remained in the hands of the rebels its port was effectively closed. At the end of the year, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles could report that &quot;the commerce of Charleston has ceased.&quot; The impact also showed directly in rebel customs receipts, which fell drastically from 1863 to 1864. The labors and sacrifices of the US forces during the storms and siege had in the end shut down a vital lifeline to the rebellion.

==54th Massachusetts==
The best-known regiment that fought for the Union in the battle of Fort Wagner was the 54th Massachusetts, which was one of the first African-American regiments in the war. The 54th was controversial in the North, where many people supported the abolition of slavery but still treated African Americans as lesser or inferior to whites. Though some claimed blacks could not fight as well as whites, the actions of the 54th Massachusetts demonstrated once again the fallacy in that argument, as this was not the first time blacks ever fought in war or even for the United States.

William Carney, an African American and a sergeant with the 54th, is considered the first black recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions at Fort Wagner in recovering and returning the unit&#x27;s American flag to Union lines. After the battle, the Confederates buried the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer, Colonel Shaw, in an unmarked mass grave with the African-American soldiers of his regiment as an insult to him. Instead, his family considered it an honor that Shaw was buried with his men.

Morris Island is smaller than 1,000 acres and is subject to extensive erosion by storm and sea. Much of the site of Fort Wagner has been eroded away, including the place where the Union soldiers were buried. However, by the time that happened, the soldiers&#x27; remains were no longer there because soon after the end of the Civil War, the Army disinterred and reburied all the remains, including presumably those of Shaw, at the Beaufort National Cemetery in Beaufort, South Carolina, where their gravestones were marked as &quot;unknown&quot;. The number missing presumed dead at Battery Wagner was 391, among the 10 regiments involved. 54th with the most at 146. 100 NY with 119, 48th NY with 112. The number of unknowns at Beaufort on their Civil War Monument 1870s is 174 unknowns. These unknowns collected from three Southern states. Sites include East Florida, Millen and Lawton, Georgia and Hilton Head, South Carolina. Two Confederate POW sites are included. Given the missing at Morris Island is more than double the total unknowns at Beaufort National Cemetery, it appears many bodies were not removed and were lost to the shifting sea and sands.

==In popular culture==
The fort is an important setting in the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot;. The final scene portrays Shaw and the men of the 54th Massachusetts leading the attack and storming the fort unsuccessfully. 

In the 2017 book &quot;Magnus Chase and the Ship of the Dead&quot;, a character named T.J. dies charging the battlements at Fort Wagner.

==Preservation==
Within twenty years of the Civil War, the remnants of the fort had been washed away by erosion on Morris Island. A group of three ex-servicemen traveled to the fort in May 1885 and reported that the entire fort and approaches to it had washed away into the ocean.

Although the Atlantic Ocean consumed Fort Wagner and the original site is now offshore, the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of historic Morris Island, which had gun emplacements and other military installations during the war.

<doc id="239351" wikidata="Q527634" url="?curid=239351" title="Extensor carpi ulnaris muscle">
<text>In human anatomy, the extensor carpi ulnaris is a skeletal muscle located on the ulnar side of the forearm. The extensor carpi ulnaris acts to extend and adduct at the carpus/wrist from anatomical position.

Being an extensor muscle, extensor carpi ulnaris is located on the posterior side of the forearm.

==Origin and insertion==
It originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the posterior border of the ulna, and crosses the forearm to the ulnar (medial) side to insert at the base of the 5th metacarpal.

==Action==
The extensor carpi ulnaris extends the wrist, but when acting alone inclines the hand toward the ulnar side; by its continued action it extends the elbow-joint.

The muscle is a minor extensor of the carpus in carnivores, but has become a flexor in ungulates. In this case it would be described as &quot;ulnaris lateralis&quot;.

==Innervation==
Despite its name, the extensor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve (C7 and C8), the continuation of the deep branch of the radial nerve. It would therefore be paralyzed in an injury to the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

==Injuries==
A common injury to the extensor carpi ulnaris is tennis elbow. This injury occurs in people who participate in activities requiring repetitive arm, elbow, and wrist, especially when they are tightly gripping an object. Some symptoms of an extensor carpi ulnaris injury include pain when shaking hands or when squeezing/gripping an object. The pain worsens when a person moves their wrist with force. This pain intensifies because the extensor carpi ulnaris has an injury near the elbow area and as a person moves their arm, the muscle contracts, thus causing it to move over the medial epicondyle of the humerus. As a result, this causes irritation to the already existing injury. Some treatments for tennis elbow include occupational therapy, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and rest from the activity that caused the injury. A similar injury involving the medial elbow is known as golfer&#x27;s elbow.


===Treatment and diagnosis===
An ECU injury most often requires imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound) for diagnosis. After the ECU injury is diagnosed, a physician will choose a course of treatment, which depends upon the severity of the injury. Conservative treatments include immobilization and stabilization of the affected wrist by placing it in a cast. A long arm cast may be required in order to ensure that all wrist movement has been stopped. The duration of the immobilization is at the treating physician&#x27;s discretion. After the immobilization period has ended, the cast will be removed and further analysis of the injury will be required. If the injury did not improve with the conservative courses of treatment, or if the injury was initially too severe for conservative treatment, invasive procedures may become necessary. Steroid injections and surgical procedures are the most prominent invasive procedures. Surgical repair or reconstruction of the ECU is not often required, yet a severe ECU injury may cause these approaches to be necessary.

<text>David Lee Chaum (born 1955) is an American computer scientist, cryptographer, and inventor. He is known as a pioneer in cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies, and widely recognized as the inventor of digital cash. His 1982 dissertation &quot;Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups&quot; is the first known proposal for a blockchain protocol. Complete with the code to implement the protocol, Chaum&#x27;s dissertation proposed all but one element of the blockchain later detailed in the Bitcoin whitepaper. He has been referred to as &quot;the father of online anonymity&quot;, and &quot;the godfather of cryptocurrency&quot;.

He is also known for developing ecash, an electronic cash application that aims to preserve a user&#x27;s anonymity, and inventing many cryptographic protocols like the blind signature, mix networks and the Dining cryptographers protocol. In 1995 his company DigiCash created the first digital currency with eCash. His 1981 paper, &quot;Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms&quot;, laid the groundwork for the field of anonymous communications research.

More recently in 2020, Chaum founded xx network, a privacy-focused blockchain platform, and in 2021 launched xx coin (abbreviation XX), a cryptocurrency designed to enhance user privacy and provide quantum resistance.

== Life and career ==

Chaum was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles, California. He gained a doctorate in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1982. Also that year, he founded the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), which currently organizes academic conferences in cryptography research. Subsequently, he taught at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration and at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He also formed a cryptography research group at CWI, the Dutch National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam. He founded DigiCash, an electronic cash company, in 1990.

Chaum received the Information Technology European Award for 1995. In 2004, he was named an IACR Fellow. In 2010, at the RSA Conference, he was honored with the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics. In 2019, he was awarded the honorary title of Dijkstra Fellow by CWI. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lugano in 2021.

Chaum resides in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles.

== Notable research contributions ==

=== Vault systems ===
Recently credited by Alan Sherman&#x27;s &quot;On the Origins and Variations of Blockchain Technologies&quot;, Chaum&#x27;s 1982 Berkeley dissertation proposed every element of the blockchain found in Bitcoin except proof of work. The proposed vault system lays out a plan for achieving consensus state between nodes, chaining the history of consensus in blocks, and immutably time-stamping the chained data. The paper also lays out the specific code to implement such a protocol.

=== Digital cash ===

Chaum is credited as the inventor of secure digital cash for his 1983 paper, which also introduced the cryptographic primitive of a blind signature. These ideas have been described as the technical roots of the vision of the Cypherpunk movement that began in the late 1980s. Chaum&#x27;s proposal allowed users to obtain digital currency from a bank and spend it in a manner that is untraceable by the bank or any other party.
In 1988, he extended this idea (with Amos Fiat and Moni Naor) to allow offline transactions that enable detection of double-spending.

In 1990, he founded DigiCash, an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research. The first electronic payment was sent in 1994. In 1998, DigiCash filed for bankruptcy, and in 1999 Chaum sold off DigiCash and ended his involvement with the company.

=== New types of digital signatures ===

In the same 1982 paper that proposed digital cash, Chaum introduced blind signatures. This form of digital signature blinds the content of a message before it is signed, so that the signer cannot determine the content. The resulting blind signature can be publicly verified against the original, unblinded message in the manner of a regular digital signature.

In 1989, he (with Hans van Antwerpen) introduced undeniable signatures. This form of digital signature uses a verification process that is interactive, so that the signatory can limit who can verify the signature. Since signers may refuse to participate in the verification process, signatures are considered valid unless a signer specifically uses a disavowal protocol to prove that a given signature was not authentic.

In 1991, he (with Eugene van Heyst) introduced group signatures, which allow a member of a group to anonymously sign a message on behalf of the entire group. However an appointed group manager holds the power to revoke the anonymity of any signer in the case of disputes.

=== Anonymous communication ===

In 1981, Chaum proposed the idea of an anonymous communication network in a paper.
His proposal, called mix networks, allows a group of senders to submit an encryption of a message and its recipient to a server. Once the server has a batch of messages, it will reorder and obfuscate the messages so that only this server knows which message came from which sender. The batch is then forwarded to another server who does the same process. Eventually, the messages reach the final server where they are fully decrypted and delivered to the recipient. A mechanism to allow return messages is also proposed. Mix networks are the basis of some remailers and are the conceptual ancestor to modern anonymous web browsing tools like Tor (based on onion routing). Chaum has advocated that every router be made, effectively, a Tor node.

In 1988, Chaum introduced a different type of anonymous communication system called a DC-Net, which is a solution to his proposed Dining Cryptographers Problem. DC-Nets is the basis of the software tool Dissent.

In 2017, Chaum published a description of a new variety of mix network. A real-world implementation of this network, called cMix and running on the xx network, later became the data transmission layer for the instant messaging platform xx messenger.

=== Trustworthy voting systems ===

Chaum has made numerous contributions to secure voting systems, including the first proposal of a system that is end-to-end verifiable. This proposal, made in 1981, was given as an application of mix networks. In this system, the individual ballots of voters were kept private which anyone could verify that the tally was counted correctly. This, and other early cryptographic voting systems, assumed that voters could reliably compute values with their personal computers. In 1991, Chaum introduced SureVote which allowed voters to cast a ballot from an untrustworthy voting system, proposing a process now called &quot;code voting&quot; and used in remote voting systems like Remotegrity and DEMOS.

In 1994, Chaum introduced the first in-person voting system in which voters cast ballots electronically at a polling station and cryptographically verify that the DRE did not modify their vote (or even learn what it was). In the following years, Chaum proposed (often with others) a series a cryptographically verifiable voting systems that use conventional paper ballots: Prêt à Voter, Punchscan, and Scantegrity. The city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity for its November, 2009 election. This was the first time a public sector election was run using any cryptographically verifiable voting system.

In 2011, Chaum proposed Random Sample Elections. This electoral system allows a verifiably random selection of voters, who can maintain their anonymity, to cast votes on behalf the entire electorate.

=== Other contributions ===

In a 1979 report published as Memorandum No. UCB/ERL M79/10 by the Electronics Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, Chaum proposed a mechanism for splitting a cryptographic key into partial keys that could be distributed among mutually suspicious groups. This concept was a significant predecessor to what is now known as secret sharing.

In 1985, Chaum proposed the original anonymous credential system, which is sometimes also referred to as a pseudonym system. This stems from the fact that the credentials of such a system are obtained from and shown to organizations using different pseudonyms which cannot be linked.

In 1988, Chaum with Gilles Brassard and Claude Crépeau published a paper that introduced zero-knowledge arguments, as well as a security model using information-theoretic private-channels, and also first formalized the concept of a commitment scheme.

1991, with Torben Pedersen, he demonstrated a well-cited zero-knowledge proof of a DDH tuple. This proof is particularly useful as it can prove proper reencryption of an ElGamal ciphertext.

Chaum contributed to an important commitment scheme which is often attributed to Pedersen. In fact, Pedersen, in his 1991 paper, cites a rump session talk on an unpublished paper by Jurjen Bos and Chaum for the scheme. It appeared even earlier in a paper by Chaum, Damgard, and Jeroen van de Graaf.

In 1993 with Stefan Brands, Chaum introduced the concept of a distance-bounding protocol.

In 2019, he was one of the speakers at the fifth Ethereum developer conference, which was held in Japan.

In July 2024, Chaum sat down with Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum for a panel on the future of privacy at Plasmacon conference at the United Nations University in Tokyo, Japan.

<text>Marcel Camus (21 April 1912 – 13 January 1982) was a French film director. He is best known for &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot; (&quot;Black Orpheus&quot;), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and the 1960 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Biography==
Camus was born in Chappes, in the Ardennes département of France. He studied art and intended to become an art teacher. However, World War II interrupted his plans. He spent part of the war in a German prisoner-of-war camp. 
Prior to directing films, Camus assisted filmmakers in France, including Jacques Feyder, Luis Buñuel, and Jacques Becker. He directed nearly a dozen films, including &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot; (also known as &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and the 1960 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film

In 1960, Camus made a second Brazilian-themed film, &quot;Os bandeirantes&quot;. Twenty years after &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;, Camus returned to Brazilian themes for what would prove to be his last film, &quot;Bahia&quot; (also known as &quot;Otalia da Bahia&quot; and &quot;Os pastores da noite&quot;), based on a novel by Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado. These films, however, failed to recapture the success of &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;. In 1970, Camus had a moderate success with a World War II comedy, &quot;Le Mur de l&#x27;Atlantique&quot; (The Atlantic Wall), starring the well-known French comedian Bourvil. Camus ended his career working primarily in television.

Camus married one of the stars of &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;, Marpessa Dawn, but they divorced shortly thereafter. He then married another actress from &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;, Lourdes de Oliveira. Camus and de Oliveira have two children, including the writer Jean-Christophe Camus.

Camus died in Paris and is buried there in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

<doc id="239367" wikidata="Q914475" url="?curid=239367" title="Flexor carpi radialis muscle">
<text>In anatomy, flexor carpi radialis is a muscle of the human forearm that acts to flex and (radially) abduct the hand. The Latin &quot;carpus&quot; means wrist; hence flexor carpi is a flexor of the wrist.

==Origin and insertion==
The flexor carpi radialis is one of four muscles in the superficial layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm. 

This muscle originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus as part of the common flexor tendon. It runs just laterally of flexor digitorum superficialis and inserts on the anterior aspect of the base of the second metacarpal, and has small slips to both the third metacarpal and trapezium tuberosity.

The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is visible on the anterior surface of the forearm, just proximal to the wrist, when the wrist is flexed. It is the tendon seen most lateral, closest to the thumb.

==Nerve and artery==
Like most flexors of the anterior compartment of the forearm, FCR is innervated by the median nerve, specifically by axons from cervical nerve roots C6 and C7. The muscle receives its blood supply from the ulnar artery.

==Exercises==
The muscle, like all flexors of the forearm, can be strengthened by exercises that resist its flexion. A wrist roller can be used, Zottman Curls, and wrist curls with dumbbells can also be performed.

==See also==
* Flexor retinaculum of the hand
* Flexor carpi ulnaris

<text>Joseph Stannard (13 September 1797 7 December 1830) was an English marine, landscape and portrait painter. He was a talented and prominent member of the Norwich School of painters.

After attending the Norwich Grammar School, his parents paid for him to be trained as an artist by Robert Ladbrooke, one of the founding members of the Norwich Society of Artists. During his career he exhibited in both Norwich and London, with some success. In 1816 he joined a rival society in Norwich, which lasted a few years. He was influenced by the work of the Dutch masters, whose works he studied and copied following a visit to Holland in 1821. His own most important painting, &quot;Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon&quot;, was first exhibited in Norwich in 1825.

In 1826 he married the artist Emily Coppin. Several other members of his family, including their daughter Emily, were talented artists. He suffered from poor health during most of his life and died from tuberculosis in 1830, aged only 33.

==Background==

Joseph Stannard belonged to the Norwich School of painters, all of whom were connected personally or professionally. Though they were mainly inspired by the Norfolk countryside, many also depicted coastal and urban scenes. Its most important members were John Crome and John Sell Cotman—the leading spirits and finest artists of the movement—as well as Stannard, James Stark, George Vincent, Robert Ladbrooke and Edward Thomas Daniell, the best etcher of the school. Stannard belonged to the second generation, which also included John Berney Crome, Stark, Vincent and Miles Edmund Cotman.

According to the art historian Andrew Moore, the Norwich School &quot;has long been recognised as a unique phenomenon in the history of 19th-century British art.&quot; Norwich was the first English city outside London with the right conditions for a provincial art movement. It had more locally born artists than any similar city, and its theatrical, artistic, philosophical and musical cultures were cross-fertilised in a way that was unique outside the capital. The Norwich Society of Artists, founded by Crome and Ladbrooke in 1803, arose from the need for artists in the city to teach each other and their pupils. It held regular exhibitions and had an organised structure, showing works annually until 1825 and again from 1828 until it was dissolved in 1833. The first group of its kind to be created since the formation of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768, it was remarkable in acting in its artists&#x27; interests for 30 yearsa longer period than for any similar group.

==Life and family==

Joseph Stannard was born close to St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Norwich on 13 September 1797. He was the elder son of Abraham Stannard, who was possibly a musician, and Mary Bell, and was baptised by his parents on 17 September at St Michael-at-Plea, Norwich. He attended Norwich Grammar School and his early artistic talents encouraged his parents to ask the prominent landscape artist John Crome to take on Joseph as a pupil. Crome was at time Norwich&#x27;s most famous artist, and his fees proved to be too high for the Stannards, so they paid for their son to be apprenticed by Robert Ladbrooke in the city. Ladbrooke, who had already given him informal lessons, was able to teach the young artist to become a skilled draughtsman, with the potential to develop his own style. Impressed by Stannard&#x27;s ability, he even waived his tuition fees, offering an annual payment of £10 to entice him to work in his studio. Stannard stayed as Ladbrooke&#x27;s pupil for seven years, although there is little evidence of his master&#x27;s influence in his artistic style. When Ladbrooke seceded from the Norwich Society of Artists in 1816, Stannard sided with him.

He met and got to know his fellow artist Emily Coppin in 1820 when attending meetings of the Norwich Society of Artists, and in 1826 they were married. She had been influenced by a visit to Holland with her father, the artist Daniel Coppin, where there was the opportunity for her to study the techniques of the Dutch still life painters, and copy works by Jan van Huysum. Emily Coppin Stannard was a notable painter of fruit and flowers, who received three gold medals from the Norwich Society of Arts and was still painting 50 years after her husband&#x27;s death. In 1823 the &quot;Norwich Mercury&quot; wrote of her that &quot;she is an honour to art, an honour to the city, and an honour to her sex, by the taste, industry, and knowledge, her beautifully disposed and elaborately finished pictures display.&quot;

The Stannards belonged to an artistic family. Their daughter Emily, who was born in Norwich in 1827, was a still life painter and a teacher, who exhibited with the Norfolk and Norwich Association in 1856 and the Norwich Industrial Exhibition in 1867. Their niece Eloise Harriet Stannard and her younger brother Alfred George Stannard were both artists, as was Joseph&#x27;s brother Alfred Stannard.
Stannard&#x27;s paintings depict the local scenery around Norwich and the Norfolk coast, which he enjoyed exploring. He was an excellent oarsman and a skilled ice-skater; crowds would gather to watch him perform on the ice.

He contracted tuberculosis two years after his marriage, and suffered from poor health for much of his later life. Friends and relatives rallied to support him as his illness developed. To try and recuperate, he stayed at the sea-side resort of Great Yarmouth, which resulted in the oil painting &quot;Yarmouth Beach and Jetty&quot;. He died from tuberculosis on 7 December 1830, aged 33, having lived in Norwich all his life. His death was announced in the &quot;Bury and Norwich Post&quot;: &quot;Same day, in St. Giles&#x27;s Terrace, aged 34, Mr. Joseph Stannard, artist, in whom Norwich has lost a talented citizen, and art a favoured and most deserving votary.&quot; He is buried, together with an infant daughter and his sister Eloise, in the Church of St John Maddermarket, Norwich.

Emily Coppin Stannard, who was to outlive her husband by nearly 55 years, died on 6 January 1885; her daughter Emily, whose father had died when she was two years old, was trained to be artist by her mother, and assisted her in her work as a teacher. She died in 1894, having lived in Norwich most of her life.

==Career==

Joseph Stannard was one of the most important members of the Norwich School of Artists even n though his career lasted only fifteen years and his output was affected by illness. The art historians Josephine Walpole and Andrew Hemingway both rank him as the most distinguished painter of the school after John Crome and John Sell Cotman. A precocious artist, he began exhibiting when still a boy; one of his paintings was exhibited at the Norwich Society of Artists in 1811, when he was 14. He was praised by the local press in 1817, when the &quot;Norfolk Chronicle&quot; noted that he was &quot;a rising genius&quot;, and there was a positive review of his work in &quot;The Norwich Mercury&quot; in August 1818.

In 1816, Stannard, Robert Ladbrooke and his sons, James Sillett and John Thirtle seceded from the Norwich Society of Artists to form their own society. Led by Ladbrooke, seven members of the Norwich Society opened an exhibition entitled &#x27;The Twelfth of the Norfolk and Norwich Society of Artists&#x27;, which was held in the Shakespeare Tavern, on Theatre Plain. Stannard exhibited five works in the first year of the new society&#x27;s existence: &quot;Study from Nature&quot;; &quot;Distant View of Norwich from Whitlingham&quot;;.&quot;Pencil Sketches&quot;; &quot;View of the Foundry Bridge&quot; and &quot;View of the City from Fuller&#x27;s Hole&quot;, exhibiting 13 works with the society in total. The Society was dissolved after three years.

He developed an interest in the stage and made connections with Norwich&#x27;s Theatre Royale from 18191820, which resulted in works such as &quot;A Scene in the Melodrama of the &quot;Broken Sword&quot;&quot;, &quot;A Portrait of Mrs. Hammond, of the Theatre Royal, Norwich&quot; and &quot;A Portrait of Mr. Beacham, in the character of Riber&quot;. In 1819 he exhibited in London. The same year he showed &quot;Scene in a Norwich Alehouse&quot;, his only picture to receive a review in the local press. The &quot;Norwich Mercury&quot; described it as &quot;nicely wrought&quot;, noting that &quot;it depicted all the well-known iterants of the city&quot;.
Between 1820 and 1829, Stannard exhibited works at the Royal Academy and the British Institution in London, showing eight works at the British Institution from 1824 to 1828 (&quot;Breydon, looking towards Yarmouth&quot;; &quot;Mundesley Cliffs, looking towards Cromer&quot;; &quot;A View near Norwich&quot;; &quot;Breydon—Morning&quot;; &quot;On the Norwich River&quot;; &quot;A Marine View&quot;; &quot;Gorleston Pier—Pilot Boats Going Off&quot; and &quot;Fresh Breeze, Lowestoft Roads&quot;). He was influenced by the work of earlier Dutch artists, whose works he studied and copied during a visit to Holland in 1821 that was perhaps inspired by a similar visit by his future wife and her father in 1820.

By 1823 he was suffering financially, a situation created by the patronage of the Norwich manufacturer and entrepreneur John Harvey, who commissioned Stannard to paint &quot;Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon&quot;. Harvey, who perhaps had not realised the large cost of the work, declined to accept it, and Stannard was left unable to recover his expenses. In 1823 he left Emily Coppin in Norwich and went to London, where he sat for his portrait by William Beechey, and was possibly employed by the artist William Anderson. By 1824, with his debts cleared, he was working again in Norwich.

In 1827 a collection of his etchings were published as &quot;Norfolk Etchings&quot;. The artist John Middleton was his pupil, but he was not a teacher and usually had no pupils. From 1824 he taught his friend Edward Thomas Daniell how to etch. Daniell, then a student at Oxford University, worked with Stannard during his holidays, and as Daniell&#x27;s ability developed, the relationship between pupil and teacher became more equal. Daniell sued him when a newly built studio obscured his light; Stannard was forced to remove it after losing the case.

==&quot;Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon&quot;==

Stannard&#x27;s masterpiece—his best known work and his most important commission—is &quot;Thorpe Frolic, Afternoon&quot; (1824), an oil painting that shows a large civic regatta. The annual &#x27;frolic&#x27; was that year attended by almost 20,000 spectators, at a time when the population of Norwich was approximately 50,000. Part sporting event and part social occasion, the event was held on the river Yare at Thorpe, east of Norwich. It was organised by John Harvey, who aspired to promote the city as an international port, and entailed sailing and rowing competitions, picnics, speeches and music.

The painting it was first exhibited in Norwich in 1825, the year the &quot;Norfolk Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;of all the gay, the bustling, the delightful scenes in nature, we know of none more refreshing and enchanting than a &#x27;Water Frolic&#x27;.&quot; It was commissioned by Harvey in 1823, who asked for &quot;the finest painting you can&quot;, and the work involved in producing the large oil-on-canvas work meant that for five months it took precedence over all other undertakings. The high production costs were in the end borne by Stannard and not Harvey, whose financial situation had deteriorated following the end of the Napoleonic wars 

The scene has no mythological imagery, suggestion of pageantry or notion of any patriotism, but a costumed gondolier in his boat is shown, suggestive of the regattas of Venice, adding a new dimension. Stannard shows the beauty of the setting by painting in the fields beyond the river, woodland, and the buildings of the gentry, whilst also recreating the event using his artistic licence. &quot;Thorpe Frolic, Afternoon&quot; was praised by the &quot;Norfolk Chronicle&quot;, which described the work as &quot;intensely interesting, masterly and elegant&quot;. The &quot;Norwich Mercury&quot; also admired his painting, noting it to be a work of great skill, and adding that it was a striking blend of fact and fiction. The painting is on display at Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery. The naval historian Oliver Warner, who congratulated Stannard on the work, describing it as &quot;entrancing&quot; and adding that it is &quot;a picture good enough in itself to justify a long journey&quot;.

==Technique==

Stannard painted chiefly river and coastal landscapes in oil. As an oil painter he has more in common with the Dutch masters than with Crome or Cotman. In Holland he sketched the local scenery, depicting rivers and coastline in pencil and crayon. His visit to Holland enabled him to develop a new oil technique and deepen his interest in marine subjects. According to Walpole, who regards Stannard as close to being Britain&#x27;s most significant marine artist, his paintings betray his love of the sea as a subject, and are depicted with &quot;inherent skill and devastating honesty to produce some of the most poetic and sensitive sea paintings of all time&quot;.

A few watercolours can be attributed to him, including &quot;Lugger in a Squall&quot;, with a small number owned by Norfolk Museums. An excellent draughtsman, his accomplished pencil drawings (and perhaps some of his oil paintings) were made &quot;in situ&quot;. The drawings were often made in preparation of larger works. He was a talented figure drawer; in Moore&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Stannard&#x27;s excellence in figure drawing among the Norwich painters may be seen in his watercolour studies, equalled only by the Joy brothers of Yarmouth.&quot; In the opinion of author Derek Clifford, Stannard &quot;was a shining exception to the Norwich landscapists&#x27; inability to draw the human figure.&quot;

He was a talented portrait painter, and by 1818 had received a number of commissions. He produced character studies; his &quot;Norwich Ratcatcher&quot; is perhaps the best known of these works, which, alongside &quot;Old Lying Plummer&quot;, &quot;Scene in a Norwich Alehouse&quot; and &quot;Joe Doe the Butcher&#x27;s Porter&quot;, have what Walpole describes as &quot;the same characteristic feeling of identity&quot;.

His restricted output of 12 etchings were issued in small numbers, or—as with &quot;Unloading Ships&quot;—not issued at all; they are prized for both their rarity and quality. The author Geoffrey Searle describes Stannard as an original and distinguished etcher who talents approached those of John Crome, John Sell Cotman and Edward Daniell, describing &quot;Boats on Breydon&quot; as &quot;glorious&quot; and &quot;Mundesley Beach&quot; as having &quot;an uncompromisingly gloomy splendour&quot;. He skilfully portrayed human figures, typically depicted within their working environment, and revealing their personalities in a way that was unusual among the Norwich School etchers. Stannard&#x27;s prints of his etchings were for his friends and not for profit, and so are modest in size. After his death an edition of his etchings was produced. No copies are known to have survived.

==Legacy==
Stannard remained an obscure artist during most of the 19th century, perhaps due to his early death in 1830 and because he did not try to make his name by living away from Norwich. His popularity as an artist was affected by the relatively small number of works produced, and the tendency for them to be sold in London rather than in Norwich. it is possible that most of his early works were in imitation of the old masters, explaining why he remained unnoticed by the local press until the 1820s.

<doc id="239376" wikidata="Q1030061" url="?curid=239376" title="Field of the Cloth of Gold">
<text>The Field of the Cloth of Gold (, ) was a summit meeting between King Henry VIII of England and King Francis I of France from 7 to 24 June 1520. Held at Balinghem, between Ardres in France and Guînes in the English Pale of Calais, it was a very expensive display of wealth by both kings.

The summit was arranged to increase the bond of friendship between the two kings following the Anglo-French treaty of 1514. The two monarchs would meet again in 1532 to arrange Francis&#x27;s assistance in pressuring Pope Clement VII to pronounce Henry&#x27;s first marriage as illegitimate. Under the guidance of English Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, these European states sought to outlaw war forever among Christian peoples.

The Pale of Calais, home to the meeting in Balinghem, was the final English possession in France. This territorial leftover from the Hundred Years&#x27; War caused some tensions between the English and French, as the latter preferred a location closer to the border, but topographical considerations proved the decisive factor.

==Background==
Two entities had started to emerge as powers in Western Europe at this time: France, under Francis I, and the Habsburg-dominated Holy Roman Empire, under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The Kingdom of England, still a lesser power, was being courted as an ally by the two major powers. The 1518 Treaty of London, a non-aggression pact between major European powers to help resist the Ottoman expansion into southeastern Europe, had just been signed. Henry also held meetings with Charles V a month before the Field of Cloth of Gold in the Netherlands and again afterwards at Calais, Henry&#x27;s only possession on the Continent.

Both Henry and Francis wished to be seen as Renaissance princes. Renaissance thinking held that a strong ruler could choose peace from a place of strength. The meeting was designed to show how magnificent each court was, and how this could be a basis for mutual respect and peace between states that were traditional enemies. Henry and Francis were also figures of similar age and dashing reputation, so there was almost certainly a mutual curiosity.

Everything was arranged to provide equality between the two groups. The meeting place (now indicated by a commemorative plaque on the D231 road, &quot;Route de Marquise&quot;) was at the very edge of the English territory around Calais. The valley where the first meeting took place was landscaped to provide areas of equal elevation for the two government parties. The whole event was planned and executed by English Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a charismatic, eloquent master diplomat who as a papal legate had immense power in the name of Pope Leo X at the time of the meeting. Included among the English guests were Thomas More and Anne Boleyn&#x27;s mother and sister.

An earlier meeting between the kings of England and France presaged this one. From 27 to 30 October 1396, Charles VI of France and Richard II of England had met at Ardres near Calais to treat for peace during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The scale, splendour and pageantry were comparable to the later Field of the Cloth of Gold meeting held on the same site in 1520.

==The meeting==

Each king tried to outshine the other, with dazzling tents and clothes, huge feasts, music, jousting and games. The tents and the costumes displayed so much cloth of gold, an expensive fabric woven with silk and gold thread, that the site of the meeting was named after it.

The most elaborate arrangements were made for the accommodation of the two monarchs and their large retinues; and on Henry&#x27;s part especially no efforts were spared to make a great impression in Europe with this meeting. Before the castle of Guînes, a temporary palace covering an area of nearly was erected for the reception of the English king. The palace was in four blocks with a central courtyard; each side was long. The only solid part was the brick base about high. Above the brickwork, the walls were made of cloth or canvas on timber frames, painted to look like stone or brick.

One further aspect of King Henry&#x27;s retinue was the presence of two royal monkeys covered in gold leaf; these were known to have been gifts from the Ottoman Sultan Selim I and brought much laughter and merriment from Francis I as contemporary Cardinal Wolsey recounts, &quot;The French King was overcome with much curiosity playing with those little knaves that did all they could to steal and pester his advisers, yet he willed them to be present at every banquet&quot;. The slanting roof was made of oiled cloth painted to give the colour of lead and the illusion of slates. Contemporaries commented especially on the huge expanse of glass, which made visitors feel they were in the open air. Chronicle descriptions make it clear the decorations, carved and painted had martial iconography;

Galyon Hone was one of the stained-glass artists employed at the Field. The building was decorated in the most sumptuous fashion and furnished with a profusion of golden ornaments. Red wine flowed from the two fountains outside. The chapel was served by 35 priests. Composer Jean Mouton was most likely in charge of the musical production by Francis I; the French royal chapel had one of the finest choirs in Europe, and contemporary accounts indicated that they &quot;delighted their hearers.&quot; The wooden ceiling for one of the tents may later have been installed in the New Chapel at Ightham Mote where, with its colours faded, one with appropriate features can still be seen. Musical production on the English side was probably led by composer William Cornysh the Younger, master of the Royal Chapel for Henry VIII.

Some idea of the size of Henry&#x27;s following may be gathered from the fact that in one month 2,200 sheep and other viands in a similar proportion were consumed. In the fields beyond the castle, 2,800 tents were erected for less distinguished visitors.

Journeying from Calais, Henry reached his headquarters at Guînes on Monday, 4 June 1520, and Francis took up his residence at Ardres. After Cardinal Wolsey, with a splendid train, had visited the French king, the two monarchs met at the Val d&#x27;Or, a spot midway between the two places, on Thursday, 7 June Corpus Christi.

The following days were taken up with tournaments, in which both kings took part. There were banquets in which the kings entertained each other&#x27;s queens. The many other entertainments included archery displays and wrestling between Breton and Cornish wrestlers.
Wolsey said Mass and the two sovereigns separated on Sunday, 24 June, the feast-day of St John the Baptist. The painting depicts a dragon flying overhead and this could be interpreted to mean that the Mass itself was interrupted by a mysterious event thought to be a dragon flying over the congregation. The superstitious would have viewed this as a great portent, but it was probably a firework accidentally or deliberately set off. Alternatively the dragon in the painting could be interpreted as symbolic, perhaps representing a highly romanticized Salamander (the symbol of Francis) or a portent of doom, signifying that for all its glamour, the summit was to prove largely fruitless. The sermon was read by Richard Pace, an intimate friend of Erasmus. Wolsey gave a general indulgence for all present.

Catherine of Aragon was noted to attend some events, including a joust, wearing costume in Spanish fashion. Her Spanish hair style, with a plait of hair encased in jewelled &quot;tranzado&quot; coif would have appeared very different to English and French women. This clothing choice at the Field of the Cloth of Gold emphasized her affinity with Spain and advocacy for Spanish policy. In England her clothes were not always made in this Spanish fashion.

==Consequences==
This meeting made a great impression on contemporaries, but its political results were very minor. While the carefully established rules of the tournament stated that the two kings would not compete against each other, Henry surprisingly challenged Francis in a wrestling match, but it turned sour for Henry when he quickly lost.

Relations between the two countries worsened soon after the event when Cardinal Wolsey arranged an alliance with Charles V, who declared war on France later that year commencing the Italian War of 1521–26.

==List of participants==
A record of the list of participants survives in at least two places: in the Rutland Papers and in the &quot;Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of King Henry VIII&quot;, catalogued as &quot;Letters indented specifying, in accordance with the treaty of 12 March 1519, the number and rank of the lords, ladies and gentlemen to attend the King and Queen at the interview with Francis I&quot;. The latter source lists the following:

*The Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; dramatised the meeting in its first season (2007).
*The plot of Magnus Mills&#x27; 2015 novel, entitled &quot;The Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot;, echoes elements of the meeting.

*In Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel, &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, he references the &quot;Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot; during a scene when the narrator meets Gilberte: &quot;She [Gilberte] was in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp, to &#x27;take the field,&#x27; which the sun, by casting over it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had turned into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.&quot; &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, vol. 1, &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, Marcel Proust, p. 433, First Vintage Books edition, 1982.
*The 1976 musical &quot;Rex&quot;, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, tells the story of Henry VIII, and portrays the event in a song named &quot;The Field of Cloth of Gold&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Bodenseekreis (&quot;Lake Constance district&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south-east of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west, clockwise) Konstanz, Sigmaringen and Ravensburg, and in Bavaria, Lindau district. To the south, on the opposite shores of Lake Constance, lies Switzerland.

== History ==
The district was created in 1973, when the previous district Tettnang was merged with most of the district Überlingen.

== Geography ==
The district is located at the northern shore of Lake Constance (), which also gives the district its name. The landscape covered by the district is called &quot;Oberschwäbisches Hügelland&quot; and &quot;Westallgäuer Hügelland&quot;, and as the name suggests it is mostly hilly landscape.

==Partnerships==
The district has a partnership with the Muldentalkreis in Saxony, Germany, as well as with the Polish district Częstochowa.

== Coat of arms ==
The blue colour as well as the three wavy lines at the bottom of the coat of arms represent the Lake Constance. The wheel derives from the coat of arms of the Lords of Markdorf and Raderach, but it also represents the industry in the district.

<text>Karl Ritter von Ghega or Karl von Ghega () (10 January 1802 – 14 March 1860) was an Austrian nobleman and the designer of the Semmering Railway from Gloggnitz to Mürzzuschlag. During his time, he was the most prominent of Austrian railway engineers and architects.

==Biography==
Born in Venice as Carlo Ghega to an ethnic Albanian family. His father, Anton Ghega, was an officer in the Austrian navy in the government service. He studied in Padua, where he took the examination for doctor of mathematics at the age of 18. He was attached to the Imperial board of Public Buildings when the railway movement commencing throughout Europe attracted his attention. He began his engineering career with road and hydraulic engineering in Venice. Among other things he contributed to the building of the road over Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo to Toblach. From 1836 to 1840 he was a construction supervisor for the railway track from Brno to Břeclav, the so-called Emperor Ferdinand North Railway. During this time, in 1836 and 37 he studied also the railways in England and other European countries. In 1842, entrusted with the entire planning of the future state railway, he made a study trip to North America.
After his return to the state railway he began with the planning of the railway line to the south, from Mürzzuschlag to Graz and Trieste. The crossing of the Semmering was not believed possible, but as early as 1844 he submitted a plan for the crossing of the Semmering, with locomotives without an extra rail for gear wheels. Before the building was fully decided, he began to enforce the construction of locomotives which could overcome such upward gradients. Construction of the &quot;Semmeringbahn&quot; was begun in 1848 and completed in 1854. In 1856, the Borovnica viaduct, one of the most imposing railroad bridges of the era, was built upon the plans by von Ghega as part of the Austrian Southern Railway from Vienna to Trieste.

Carl von Ghega was next assigned to the building of a railway in Transylvania, but he could not see this project to its end because of his death in Vienna from tuberculosis.

===Other sources about origin===
According to the authors of &quot;Encyclopedia of North American Railroads&quot; – page 493, Carl Ritter von Ghega was &quot;An ethnic Italian&quot;. According to the source &quot;Dictionary of American Family Names&quot; - page 31, &quot;Ghegan&quot; is an Italian surname. According to the source &quot;Export: Austrian Architecture in Europe&quot; - page 14, ”Despite his family&#x27;s Italian descent he was raised as an Austrian and grew up speaking three languages (German, Italian, Slovenian)”.

<text>In applied probability, a population process is a Markov chain in which the state of the chain is analogous to the number of individuals in a population (0, 1, 2, etc.), and changes to the state are analogous to the addition or removal of individuals from the population. Typical population processes include birth–death processes and birth, death and catastrophe processes.

Although named by analogy to biological populations from population dynamics, population processes find application in a much wider range of fields than just ecology and other biological sciences. These other applications include telecommunications and queueing theory, chemical kinetics and financial mathematics, and hence the &quot;population&quot; could be of packets in a computer network, of molecules in a chemical reaction, or even of units in a financial index. 

Population processes are typically characterized by processes of birth and immigration, and of death, emigration and catastrophe, which correspond to the basic demographic processes and broad environmental effects to which a population is subject. However, population processes are also often equivalent to other processes that may typically be characterized under other paradigms (in the literal sense of &quot;patterns&quot;). Queues, for example, are often characterized by an arrivals process, a service process, and the number of servers. In appropriate circumstances, however, arrivals at a queue are functionally equivalent to births or immigration and the service of waiting &quot;customers&quot; is equivalent to death or emigration.

<doc id="239388" wikidata="Q1414040" url="?curid=239388" title="Govan">
<text>Govan ( ; Cumbric: &quot;Gwovan&quot;; Scots: &quot;Gouan&quot;; Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Baile a&#x27; Ghobhainn&quot;) is a district, parish, and former burgh now part of southwest Glasgow, Scotland. It is situated west of Glasgow city centre, on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the mouth of the River Kelvin and the district of Partick. Historically it was part of the County of Lanark.

In the early medieval period, the site of the present Govan Old churchyard was established as a Christian centre for the Brittonic Kingdom of Alt Clut (Dumbarton Rock) and its successor realm, the Kingdom of Strathclyde. This latter kingdom, established in the aftermath of the Viking siege and capture of Alt Clut by Vikings from Dublin in 870, created the sandstone sculptures known today as the Govan Stones.

Govan was the site of a ford and later a ferry which linked the area with Partick for seasonal cattle drovers. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, textile mills and coal mining were important; in the early-nineteenth century, shipbuilding emerged as Govan&#x27;s principal industry. In 1864, Govan gained burgh status, and was the fifth-largest burgh in Scotland. It was incorporated into the City of Glasgow in 1912.

==History==

===Early history===
Recent studies of the archaeology of Govan Old have revealed the presence of an ancient Christian church. Two associated Christian burials are radiocarbon dated to the 5th or 6th centuries, making Govan the earliest known Christian site in the region. Govan is believed to have then been part of a kingdom ruled from Dumbarton Rock, known as &quot;Alt Clut&quot;, the rock on the Clyde. During the Viking Age, following the sack of Dumbarton Rock in 870, Govan is believed to have been one of the major centres of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. In 1855, an elaborately carved sandstone sarcophagus was found during digging in the churchyard. It is now kept inside the church, as part of the Govan Stones museum collection. It may have been used to contain the body or relics of St. Constantine, a Pictish king seemingly killed by Vikings in 877 – the style of carving indicates an origin in the late 9th or early 10th century.

Govan&#x27;s earliest recorded name may be found in the &quot;Historia regum Anglorum&quot; attributed to Symeon of Durham. This is a 12th-century Latin source, but one believed to be based on much earlier materials; it records a place near Dumbarton Rock named &quot;Ouania&quot;. Based on this, Govan&#x27;s Cumbric language name has been reconstructed as *&quot;(G)uovan&quot;. Govan is &quot;Baile a&#x27; Ghobhainn&quot; (the smith&#x27;s town) in Scottish Gaelic. Bishop Leslie in his &quot;Scotia Descriptio&quot; of 1578 says it got its name from the excellence of its ale &quot;(God-win)&quot;, whereas Chalmers in his &quot;Caledonia&quot; says it is derived from Scottish Gaelic, &quot;Gamhan&quot; (a ditch).

The earliest references to Govan are found in connection with the Christian church. In 1136, when Glasgow Cathedral was formally consecrated, King David I (1124–53) gave to the See the lands of Partick and also of the church at Govan (on opposite sides of the River Clyde), which became a prebend of Glasgow. Govan Old Parish Church was rebuilt in 1762, 1826, and again 1884–1888. Within it and its roughly circular churchyard is one of the finest collections of Early Christian stones in Britain, known as the Govan Stones, dating from the c.9th to 11th centuries.

Not much is known about any medieval village that may have surrounded the church until 1454 when it is recorded that whole houses, barns and mills in the village were brought down by a great flood.In 1756 the Govan Weavers Society was formed to assist members and their families and this organisation continues as a charity in Govan holding annual events and supporting local causes. See www.govanweavers.com .

By the 16th century, extensive coal mine workings had been developed around Craigton and Drumoyne.
There is an oddity whereby part of eighteenth-century parish of Govan (which was in Lanarkshire) is counted as being within Renfrewshire. There existed a hospital in the area, and as quasi-religious foundations were not taxed, it had never been assigned to a sheriffdom. Thus, when Renfrewshire was created out of a sheriffdom of Lanarkshire in the early fifteenth century, the lands associated with the hospital (Polmadie) were not technically in the newly created shire, as they were not part of the sheriffdom. They were, however, very much a part of the physical landscape that became Renfrewshire. A similar uncertainty existed regarding the nearby lands of Pollokshields and Westends. People lived with the inconsistency in the records. When the railway was to be built in the late nineteenth century, however, the confusion over proper descriptions in the land titles made necessary legal transactions difficult and had to be reconciled. The county added to the description of these lands, the phrase: &quot;but now by annexation in the County of Renfrew.&quot;

By the early part of the 19th century, Govan was rapidly losing its rural appearance and assuming the character of a town with the development of new industries and factories, including Reid&#x27;s Dye Works and Pollok&#x27;s Silk Mill. Town officials arranged for the deepening of the Clyde in 1759, the reclamation of the channels between the islands (The Whyte Inch, The Black Inch, and The King&#x27;s Inch), and the construction of quays and docks. This facilitated the development of shipbuilding as a major industry. By the 1860s, the village needed a higher order of administration and it was made a burgh in 1864, under the General Police (Scotland) Act 1862. At the time, it was the fifth largest burgh in Scotland and contained within its boundaries the areas of Plantation, Cessnock, Ibrox, Craigton, and Drumoyne. in 1901 the Burgh boundaries increased further west to include Linthouse and West Drumoyne.

With Morris Pollok as its first Provost, the Burgh and its Commissioners ensured that during the next 48 years Govan became a well-equipped, modern town. During the late 19th century, the population of Govan increased more than tenfold: from 9,000 in 1864 to 95,000 by 1907. In 1901 Govan was the 7th largest town in Scotland. In 1912, Glasgow annexed Govan after a series of annexation battles.

A prominent feature of the Govan landscape was the Doomster or Moot Hill, which stood near the river, north of the present Govan Cross. It was removed in the early 19th century and Reid&#x27;s Dyeworks was erected on the site. The origins of the Doomster Hill are a mystery. One hypothesis is that it was a prehistoric burial mound. In 1996, a team from Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; programme carried out an archeological excavation at the site. They suggested that the hill may have been a 12th-century Norman motte.

===20th century to the present===

Traditionally viewed as a lower working-class area, Govan has typically supported the Labour Party, but the Scottish National Party (SNP) has also been strong there. In 1973, the SNP won a by-election with Margo MacDonald as their candidate. The SNP won another by-election victory in 1988, this time with Jim Sillars as candidate. The latest victory for the SNP was in the 2007 Scottish parliamentary elections, when Nicola Sturgeon became the MSP for the constituency.

The area has had a reputation for deprivation and poverty, partly due to the construction of housing estates in the 1930s to relieve the overcrowded slum district of The Gorbals. The most famous of these housing estates is Moorepark, sometimes referred to jocularly as &quot;The Wine Alley&quot; – this area was named by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in April 1994 as one of the worst areas in Britain, with drug abuse being a widespread problem and unemployment standing at nearly 30% (up to three times the national average at the time).

It was parodied by the BBC sitcom &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;. Although Govan was the stated setting for the show, episodes were seldom filmed there.

Despite these developments, there were numerous older buildings around Govan until quite recently, most notably the terraces and tenements situated around Govan Road. These were not cleared until well into the 1970s. However, there is the potential for tourism development, for example, the planned development of the Govan Old site, which hosts the historically significant stone carvings, has led to the development of the surrounding townscape and new infrastructure. Such developments benefit the aesthetic and connective appeal of the Govan area for future visitors.

==Economy==

Govan was at one point the centre of the world-renowned Clydeside shipbuilding industry. In 1841, Robert Napier began iron shipbuilding in Govan, and in 1843 produced its first ship, the &quot;Vanguard&quot;. He also procured a contract with the Royal Navy to produce vessels, notably the &quot;Jackal&quot;, the &quot;Lizard&quot;, and the &quot;Bloodhound&quot;. He also allowed naval officers in training to visit the shipyard to familiarise themselves with the new vessels. Napier&#x27;s Shipyard in Govan was later acquired by William Beardmore and Company in 1876 and incorporated into William Beardmore and Company in around 1900.

Govan&#x27;s other major shipbuilding firm was founded in the 1860s as: Randolph, Elder and Company, later becoming John Elder and Company. In 1885, the yard moved further west to its present site and was reorganised as the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Ltd. This company continued until 1965, when it filed for bankruptcy. The following year in 1966, the yard was again reorganised as Fairfields and guaranteed by the government in response. The following year, Fairfields and the other major Clydeside yards (Stephens, Connels, Yarrows and John Browns) were merged to form Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS).

In 1971, Upper Clyde Shipbuilders went into receivership and the Conservative government led by Edward Heath refused to give them a £6,000,000 loan. Rather than go on strike, which was the traditional form of industrial action, the union leadership of the yards decided to have a work-in and complete the orders that the shipyards had in place. In this way they dispelled the idea of the workers being &quot;work-shy&quot; and also wanted to illustrate the long-term viability of the yards. Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company was renamed Govan Shipbuilders in 1973. 

In 1977, the Labour government of James Callaghan passed the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 (c. 3) which nationalised Govan and grouped it with other major British shipyards as British Shipbuilders. In May 1979, Margaret Thatcher was elected Prime Minister and her ministry soon began its privatisation programme. British Aerospace, established by the same act, was privatised in 1981. British Shipbuilders road to privatisation was not as swift, and the group was sold piece by piece throughout the course of the 1980s.

Kværner of Norway, as part of a planned development of a large international shipbuilding group, took over Govan. British Shipbuilders&#x27; sale of Govan to the Norwegian firm was completed in 1988, and the yard was renamed Kvaerner Govan.

In 1999, GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine division purchased the yard when Kværner announced its departure from the shipbuilding industry. GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine division already owned YSL (purchased in 1985) and VSEL (purchased in 1995). Marconi Electronic Systems and its Marconi Marine unit were sold to British Aerospace in 1999 to form BAE Systems. The shipbuilding operations became BAE Systems Marine, which subsequently became part of BVT Surface Fleet, a naval shipbuilding joint venture between BAE Systems and VT Group, which became BAE Systems Surface Ships in 2009.

Alexander Stephen and Sons also established a shipyard in nearby Linthouse in 1870. The yard eventually closed in the wake of the collapse of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders consortium in 1971.

A list of almost 3000 ships built at Govan has been collected in the &quot;Clydebuilt Database&quot;. Ships built by the following companies: Robert Napier &amp; Company, Randolph Elder &amp; Company, Dobbie Hedderwick &amp; Co., Dobie &amp; Company, Mackie &amp; Thomson, Smith &amp; Rodgers, London &amp; Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Co.

==Transport==
Govan is served by Govan Subway Station, Ibrox Subway Station and Cessnock Subway Station on the Glasgow subway system.

Govan railway station opened on 2 December 1868. It closed permanently to regular passenger services on 9 May 1921.

Regular bus services, mainly operated by McGill&#x27;s Bus Services and First Glasgow, offer frequent routes to Glasgow City Centre, as well as to numerous locations in Renfrewshire.

==Sports==
Govan borders the district of Ibrox, home to the Scottish football club Rangers F.C. who traditionally incorporate the red and black civic colours in the socks of their kit; their Ibrox Stadium has a stand named for Govan (the closest to the heart of the burgh), although officially this was re-named after their former player Sandy Jardine in 2014.

Govan is home to the Scottish Junior football team Benburb F.C. who until March 2014 played at Tinto Park (Drumoyne) then moved to the adjacent New Tinto Park. They share a rivalry with St Anthony&#x27;s F.C. who originated from the Helen Street area of Govan, but are now based further west at Shieldhall. Linthouse and Parkgrove were 19th century senior sides, who fell into decline and are now defunct.

There were two other sporting venues for local residents and workers located in the south of Govan (with no space available in the industrial northern area at the Clyde): White City Stadium and Albion Greyhound Stadium, both now entirely demolished.

==Media==
Govan is served by community radio station Sunny Govan, broadcasting on 103.5FM to the city of Glasgow and surrounding districts, discussing local issues and providing advice, and with diverse musical output covering soul, hip-hop and reggae.

Govan has had several local newspapers over the years such as the Govan Chronicle and &quot;Govan Press&quot; published by the Cossar Family (1851-1983) and by John Maclean (2006–2014) which also served the communities of Kinning Park, Cardonald, Penilee and Hillington, and the &quot;Govan Post&quot; (1983–1988) published by Cook, Paton &amp; Co. of Paisley, now part of Dunfermline Press.

==Religion==
===Church of Scotland===
The church of Govan was a prebend of Glasgow. It was dedicated to St Constantine, who had been buried at Govan. 
On 13 July 1577, the teinds of Govan were granted to the University of Glasgow, and the Principal of the University ex officio was appointed minister of the parish. This settlement was set aside on 20 December 1621, and only the patronage of Govan was left to the University. There was a chapel in the parish at Partick. Govan Church was rebuilt in 1762, and again in 1826. A later rebuilding was begun in 1884 and was opened 19 May 1888.

<text>Johann Adam Otto Bütschli (3 May 1848 – 2 February 1920) was a German zoologist and professor at the University of Heidelberg. He specialized in invertebrates and insect development. Many of the groups of protists were first recognized by him.

He was the first scientist to recognize the structures now known as chromosomes.

==Life==

Bütschli was born in Frankfurt am Main. He studied mineralogy, chemistry, and paleontology in Karlsruhe and became assistant of Karl Alfred von Zittel (geology and paleontology). He moved to Heidelberg in 1866 and worked with Robert Bunsen (chemistry). He received his PhD from the University of Heidelberg in 1868, after passing examinations in geology, paleontology, and zoology. He joined Rudolf Leuckart at the University of Leipzig in 1869. After leaving his studies to serve as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Bütschli worked in his private laboratory and then for two years (1873–1874) with Karl Möbius at the University of Kiel. After that, he worked privately. In 1876, he made Habilitation. He became professor at the University of Heidelberg, as successor of Alexander Pagenstecher, in 1878. He held this position for over 40 years.

<text>BibTeX is both a bibliographic flat-file database file format and a software program for processing these files to produce lists of references (citations). The BibTeX file format is a widely used standard with broad support by reference management software.

The BibTeX program comes bundled with the LaTeX document preparation system, and is not available as a stand-alone program. Within this typesetting system its name is styled as formula_1. The name is a portmanteau of the word &quot;bibliography&quot; and the name of the TeX typesetting software.

BibTeX was created by Oren Patashnik in 1985. No updates were published between February 1988 and March 2010, when the package was updated to improve URL printing and clarify the license. There are various reimplementations of the program.

The purpose of BibTeX is to make it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner, by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information, similarly to the separation of content and presentation/style supported by LaTeX itself. 

==Processor==
The processor program works with several specific files to produce the reference list and format the citations. In the words of the program&#x27;s author Oren Patashnik, the processor works as follows:
It takes as input:

BibTeX chooses from the codice_1 file(s) only those entries specified by the codice_2 file (that is, those given by LaTeX&#x27;s or commands), and creates as output a codice_3 file containing these entries together with the formatting commands specified by the codice_4 file [..]. LaTeX will use the codice_3 file, perhaps edited by the user, to produce the reference list.
===History===
BibTeX was created by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport in 1985. The program is written in WEB/Pascal.

Version 0.98f was released in March 1985.

With version 0.99c (released February 1988), a stationary state was reached for 22 years.

In March 2010, version 0.99d was released to improve URL printing. Further releases were announced.

===Reimplementations===
;BibTeXu
:A reimplementation of bibtex (by Yannis Haralambous and his students) that supports the UTF-8 character set. Taco Hoekwater of the LuaTeX team criticized it in 2010 for poor documentation and for generating errors that are difficult to debug.
;bibtex8
:A reimplementation of bibtex that supports 8-bit character sets.
;CL-BibTeX
:A completely compatible reimplementation of bibtex in Common Lisp, capable of using bibtex .bst files directly or converting them into human-readable Lisp .lbst files. CL-BibTeX supports Unicode in Unicode Lisp implementations, using any character set that Lisp knows about.
;MLBibTeX
:A reimplementation of BibTeX focusing on multilingual features, by Jean-Michel Hufflen.
;BibLaTeX
:A complete reimplementation. &quot;It redesigns the way in which LaTeX interacts with BibTeX at a fairly fundamental level. With biblatex, BibTeX is only used to sort the bibliography and to generate labels. Instead of being implemented in BibTeX&#x27;s style files, the formatting of the bibliography is entirely controlled by TeX macros.&quot; It uses the bibliography processing program Biber and offers full Unicode and theming support. BibLaTeX comes with a new file format specification that uses the same syntax as the BibTeX file format but with more and different bibliographic entry types and field types.
;Bibulous
:A drop-in BibTeX replacement based on style templates, including full Unicode support, written in Python.

==Database files==
BibTeX uses a style-independent text-based file format, a kind of flat-file database, to store bibliography items, such as articles, books, and theses. BibTeX database file names usually end in codice_6. A BibTeX database file is formed by a list of entries, with each entry corresponding to a bibliographical item. Entry types correspond to various types of bibliographic sources such as codice_7, codice_8, or codice_9.

An example entry describing a mathematical handbook is structured with an entry type—here, codice_10—followed by a unique citation key, such as codice_11. It also includes a list of fields, like codice_12 and codice_13:
@book{abramowitz+stegun,
 author = &quot;Milton {Abramowitz} and Irene A. {Stegun}&quot;,
 title = &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Functions with
 Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables&quot;,
 publisher = &quot;Dover&quot;,
 year = 1964,
 address = &quot;New York City&quot;,
 edition = &quot;ninth Dover printing, tenth GPO printing&quot;


If a document references this handbook, the bibliographic information can be formatted in different ways depending on the chosen citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). LaTeX handles this by specifying the citation command codice_14, which addresses the citation key and relies on the desired bibliography style defined in the LaTeX document.

For example, if the command codice_15 appears in a LaTeX document, the bibtex program will include this book in the list of references and generate appropriate LaTeX formatting code. When viewing the formatted LaTeX document, the result might look like this:

: Abramowitz, Milton and Irene A. Stegun (1964), &quot;Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables.&quot; New York: Dover.

Depending on the style file, BibTeX may rearrange authors&#x27; last names, change the case of titles, omit fields present in the codice_6 file, format text in italics, add punctuation, etc. Since the same style file is used for an entire list of references, these are all formatted consistently with minimal effort required from authors or editors.

===Entry types===
A BibTeX database can contain the following types of entries:

;codice_7
:An article from a journal or magazine.

===Field types===
A BibTeX entry can contain various types of fields. The following types are recognized by the default bibliography styles; some third-party styles may accept additional ones:
;codice_32
:Publisher&#x27;s address (usually just the city, but can be the full address for lesser-known publishers)
;codice_33
:An annotation for annotated bibliography styles (not typical)
;codice_12
:The name(s) of the author(s) (in the case of more than one author, separated by codice_35)
;codice_36
:The title of the book, if only part of it is being cited
;codice_37
:The email of the author(s)
;codice_38
:The chapter number
;codice_39
:The key of the cross-referenced entry
;codice_40
:Digital object identifier
;codice_41

;codice_42
:The name(s) of the editor(s)
;codice_43
:How it was published, if the publishing method is nonstandard
;codice_44
:The institution that was involved in the publishing, but not necessarily the publisher
;codice_45
:The journal or magazine the work was published in
;codice_46
:A hidden field used for specifying or overriding the alphabetical order of entries (when the &quot;author&quot; and &quot;editor&quot; fields are missing). Note that this is very different from the key (mentioned just after this list) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry.
;codice_47
:The month of publication (or, if unpublished, the month of creation)
;codice_48
:Miscellaneous extra information
;codice_49
:The &quot;(issue) number&quot; of a journal, magazine, or tech-report, if applicable. Note that this is not the &quot;article number&quot; assigned by some journals.
;codice_50
:The conference sponsor
;codice_51
:Page numbers, separated either by commas or double-hyphens.
;codice_52
:The publisher&#x27;s name
;codice_53
:The school where the thesis was written
;codice_54
:The series of books the book was published in (e.g. &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; or &quot;Lecture Notes in Computer Science&quot;)
;codice_13
:The title of the work
;codice_56
:The field overriding the default type of publication (e.g. &quot;Research Note&quot; for techreport, &quot;{PhD} dissertation&quot; for phdthesis, &quot;Section&quot; for inbook/incollection)
;codice_57
:The volume of a journal or multi-volume book
;codice_58
:The year of publication (or, if unpublished, the year of creation)

In addition, each entry contains a key (Bibtexkey) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry. This key is the first item in a BibTeX entry, and is not part of any field.

==Style files==
BibTeX formats bibliographic items according to a style file, typically by generating TeX or LaTeX formatting commands, but style files can also be used to generate other types of output like HTML. BibTeX style files commonly use the file extension codice_59 and are written in a simple, stack-based programming language (dubbed &quot;BibTeX Anonymous Forth-Like Language&quot;, or &quot;BAFLL&quot;, by Drew McDermott) that describes how bibliography items should be formatted. There are some packages that can generate codice_59 files automatically, such as custom-bib and Bib-it.

Most journals or publishers that support LaTeX use a customized bibliographic style file for the convenience of the authors, often included as part of a complete LaTeX template.

<doc id="239394" wikidata="Q1431155" url="?curid=239394" title="V6 PRV engine">
<text>The V6 PRV engine is an overhead cam V6 automobile engine designed and manufactured by the company &quot;Française de Mécanique&quot; for PRV, an alliance of Peugeot, Renault and Volvo Cars. Sold from 1974 to 1998, it was produced in four displacements between 2.5 L and 3.0, and in both SOHC and DOHC and 2-valve and 4-valve per cylinder configurations. Originally carbureted, it adopted fuel-injection for improved emissions compliance and improved performance, and was offered in turbo and biturbo versions in a limited number of vehicles made by Renault, Chrysler Motors, and French supercar manufacturer Venturi.

It was gradually replaced after 1994 by another engine jointly developed by Peugeot-successor PSA and Renault, known as the &quot;ES&quot; engine at PSA and the &quot;L&quot; engine at Renault.

==Corporate history==
In 1966, Peugeot and Renault entered a cooperative agreement to manufacture common components. The first joint subsidiary, &quot;La Française de Mécanique&quot; (also called &quot;Compagnie Française de Mécanique&quot; or simply &quot;FM&quot;) was launched in 1969. The FM factory was built in Douvrin near Lens in northern France. The PRV engines are sometimes referred to as &quot;Douvrin&quot; engines, though that name is more commonly applied to a family of straight-fours produced at the same time.

In 1971, Volvo joined Peugeot and Renault in the creation of PRV, an equally-held public limited company (plc). PRV originally planned to build V8 engines, although these were later scrapped in favor of a smaller and more fuel-efficient V6.

The PRV engine followed a standard V8 90-degree cylinder bank configuration rather than the customary 60, but had its crankpins 120 degrees apart. The Maserati V6 of the Citroën SM followed a remarkably similar pattern of development.

The 1973 energy crisis, and taxes levied against engine displacement greater than 2.8 litres made large V8 engines less attractive, and expanded the market for smaller displacement engines.

Additionally, Renault needed a V6 engine to fit in its new model, the Renault 30. Renault&#x27;s internal designation for the PRV was Z-Type.

Machinery for assembling the engines arrived at Douvrin in early June 1973, and buildings for producing the engines were finished in January 1974. The first PRV engines were officially introduced on 3 October 1974 in the Volvo 264, designated the B27 by the automaker. Adoption was swift, and the PRV V6 had been sold in at least five different models by the end of 1975.

The B27 was used in the Volvo 264/265 until 1980. The B28 was also used in the Volvo 264/265 and in a rare version of the 240 GLT (244/245 GLT 6) between 1980 and 1983, and in the Volvo 760 between 1982 and 1986. The last version of the PRV engine in a Volvo was the B280, installed in the Volvo 760 from 1987 to 1990 and in the Volvo 780 (all model years). The Volvo 262 C was also fitted with the PRV, the first years with the B27 and the last years with the B28. The B280 was significantly changed; only the engine block remained the same as the B27/B28, the rest is different. The B280 was also installed in a small number of 960s in 1991.

In 1984, the first commercially available turbocharged PRV V6 was sold in the Renault 25 V6 Turbo. This was the first to be even-fire with split crankpins, and was the first of the second generation, and indeed EFI engine of any sort. Turbocharged versions went on to be used in the Renault Alpine GTA V6 Turbo (essentially the same engine as the 25 Turbo at , Renault Alpine A610, and Renault Safrane Bi-turbo – both with low compression. Naturally aspirated 2963 cc and 2975 cc versions of both low- and high-compression 3-litre engines appeared in a number of Peugeot, Citroën and Renault cars until 1997.

While Renault were working forced induction into the PRV, Peugeot and Citroën developed their own 24-valve engines as an option in the 605 and XM respectively. The compression remained the same as the Renault 12v, but the pistons differed, as did some of the timing gear, and the heads were re-engineered to allow easier maintenance (the camshaft being fitted from the opposite end for example). This engine was however extremely expensive, and suffered cam wear problems. This was due to the exhaust valves sharing a single lobe, while each inlet valve had its own lobe. This was at least partially solved by the use of ceramic followers as one of a succession of recalls.

Meanwhile, French supercar manufacturer Venturi had been developing their own versions of the PRV. The most powerful versions they built were in the Atlantique 300 at from a turbocharged, 12-valve 3.0 L iteration, and they successfully raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with the 600LM with a twin turbocharged, 24-valve 3.0-litre, pushing out over in race spec, and the road-going spin-off, the 400GT managed . This used the low compression bottom end common to the Renault turbo engines, coupled to 24-valve cylinder heads with bespoke rockers and tappets.

Peugeot too allowed a small group of engineers to create a team for endurance racing, and after a few years the team grew to be called WM Peugeot. The ultimate version of the car used a low compression 3.0-litre bottom end coupled to bespoke twin-cam heads. It is the only DOHC PRV. This car still holds the top speed record at 24 Hours of Le Mans set in 1988. By taping over the engine cooling intakes to improve aerodynamics, the team managed to push the car to on the straight before the engine was destroyed.

Volvo began to withdraw from the PRV consortium in the late 1980s and the year model 1991 was the last year for the PRV in a Volvo, shifting its powerplant reliance onto in-house inline engines: the successor to its PRV-powered 760, the 960, debuted with a new inline six &quot;white block&quot; Modular engine. Peugeot, Renault and Citroën continued using the PRV until 1997.

After producing 970,315 units, production of the PRV V6 was stopped on 15 June 1998.

==Engineering==

===Uneven firing order===
The original engineering work done on the V8 engine can still be seen in the resulting V6 engine: its cylinder banks are arranged at 90°, instead of the much more common 60°. V8 engines nearly universally feature 90° configurations, because this allows a natural firing order. V6 engines, on the other hand, produce even firing intervals between cylinders when their two banks of cylinders are arranged at 60°. 90-degree V6 engines, like the PRV, experience uneven firing, which can be addressed using split crankshaft journals. 90° V6 engines are shorter (less tall, not less long) and wider than 60° engines, allowing lower engine bay hood/bonnet profiles.

First-generation PRV engines (1974–1985) featured uneven firing order. Second-generation PRV engines (introduced in 1984 in the Renault 25 Turbo) featured split crankshaft journals to create evenly spaced ignition events. Other similar design examples are the &quot;odd-fire&quot; and &quot;even-fire&quot; Buick V6 and the Maserati V6 seen in the Citroën SM.

The PRV was also the basis for the 90° V6 engine used by Alfa Romeo in the 155 V6 Ti in the 1996 DTM/ITC season from Silverstone onwards. The engines in that series required the use of bank separation angle and cylinder bore spacing from a production based engine, and as a 90° V6 has greater room between banks than a 60° V6 for a more optimal induction system, Alfa Romeo used the PRV as a basis as it had been used in the Lancia Thema, a car which shared its platform with the Alfa Romeo 164, as well as the Fiat Croma and Saab 9000.

Other sources declare that the 90° V6 engine in 1996 Alfa Romeo 155 V6 Ti is based on a 2.6 L V8 from 1970 Alfa Romeo Montreal with two cylinders removed, as allowed by the rules, however the FIA homologation documentation shows the homologated production engine was a &quot;2850cm³&quot; capacity &quot;V6&quot; engine. The bore spacing of the Montreal engine was too close to be suitable for the 155 V6 Ti in any case. Limone invented the &quot;Montreal V8&quot; story to throw the press off the scent and to satisfy FIAT management who were unhappy that a non-FIAT group developed engine was being used.

<text>The Volvo M400 is a gearbox from Volvo. It was used in Volvo 164 and in a modified version, a limited number of the early 1970 1800E. It is a stronger version of the M40 gearbox, designed to withstand the higher power of the B30 engine. Its drain plug is on the opposite side from that of the M40. 

It was never factory-equipped with the &quot;long stick&quot; shifter handle. The shifter interchanges, opening up swap possibilities. Owners have found that while the bearings&#x27; lifespan might be similar to that of the M40, the torque capacity is on the order of double. Gear ratios are effectively the same (though derived from a different tooth count) as the M40s and followed that transmission&#x27;s change to a lower (numerically higher) first gear beginning with the 1973 model year. 

When equipped with the electrically operated overdrive, the gearbox was known as the M410.

<text>An ophiolite is a section of Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed, and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks.

The Greek word ὄφις, &quot;ophis&quot; (&quot;snake&quot;) is found in the name of ophiolites, because of the superficial texture of some of them. Serpentinite especially evokes a snakeskin. (The suffix &quot;-lite&quot; is from the Greek &quot;lithos&quot;, meaning &quot;stone&quot;.) Some ophiolites have a green color. The origin of these rocks, present in many mountainous massifs, remained uncertain until the advent of plate tectonic theory.

Their great significance relates to their occurrence within mountain belts such as the Alps and the Himalayas, where they document the existence of former ocean basins that have now been consumed by subduction. This insight was one of the founding pillars of plate tectonics, and ophiolites have always played a central role in plate tectonic theory and the interpretation of ancient mountain belts.

==Pseudostratigraphy and definition==

The stratigraphic-like sequence observed in ophiolites corresponds to the lithosphere-forming processes at mid-oceanic ridges. From top to bottom, the layers in the sequence are:

* Pelagic sediments: mostly siliceous oozes, calcareous oozes and red clays deposited since the crust formed.
* Extrusive sequence: basaltic pillow lavas show magma/seawater contact.
*Sheeted dike complex: vertical, parallel dikes that fed lavas above.
* High level intrusives: isotropic gabbro, indicative of a fractionated magma chamber.
* Layered gabbro, resulting from settling out of minerals from a magma chamber.
* Cumulate peridotite: dunite-rich layers of minerals that settled out from a magma chamber.
* Tectonized peridotite: harzburgite/lherzolite-rich mantle rock.

A Geological Society of America Penrose Conference on ophiolites in 1972 defined the term &quot;ophiolite&quot; to include all of the layers listed above, including the sediment layer formed independently of the rest of the ophiolite. This definition has been challenged recently because new studies of oceanic crust by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and other research cruises have shown that &quot;in situ&quot; ocean crust can be quite variable in thickness and composition, and that in places sheeted dikes sit directly on peridotite tectonite, with no intervening gabbros.

== Formation and emplacement ==
Ophiolites have been identified in most of the world&#x27;s orogenic belts. However, two components of ophiolite formation are under debate: the origin of the sequence and the mechanism for ophiolite emplacement. Emplacement is the process of the sequence&#x27;s uplift over lower density continental crust.

===Origin===
Several studies support the conclusion that ophiolites formed as oceanic lithosphere. Seismic velocity structure studies have provided most of the current knowledge of the oceanic crust&#x27;s composition. For this reason, researchers carried out a seismic study on an ophiolite complex (Bay of Islands, Newfoundland) in order to establish a comparison. The study concluded that oceanic and ophiolitic velocity structures were identical, pointing to the origin of ophiolite complexes as oceanic crust. The observations that follow support this conclusion. Rocks originating on the seafloor show chemical composition comparable to unaltered ophiolite layers, from primary composition elements such as silicon and titanium to trace elements. Seafloor and ophiolitic rocks share a low occurrence of silica-rich minerals; those present have a high sodium and low potassium content. The temperature gradients of the metamorphosis of ophiolitic pillow lavas and dykes are similar to those found beneath ocean ridges today. Evidence from the metal-ore deposits present in and near ophiolites and from oxygen and hydrogen isotopes suggests that the passage of seawater through hot basalt in the vicinity of ridges dissolved and carried elements that precipitated as sulfides when the heated seawater came into contact with cold seawater. The same phenomenon occurs near oceanic ridges in a formation known as hydrothermal vents. The final line of evidence supporting the origin of ophiolites as seafloor is the region of formation of the sediments over the pillow lavas: they were deposited in water over 2 km deep, far removed from land-sourced sediments.
Despite the above observations, there are inconsistencies in the theory of ophiolites as oceanic crust, which suggests that newly generated ocean crust follows the full Wilson cycle before emplacement as an ophiolite. This requires ophiolites to be much older than the orogenies on which they lie, and therefore old and cold. However, radiometric and stratigraphic dating has found ophiolites to have undergone emplacement when young and hot: most are less than 50 million years old.
Ophiolites therefore cannot have followed the full Wilson cycle and are considered atypical ocean crust.

===Ophiolite emplacement===
There is yet no consensus on the mechanics of emplacement, the process by which oceanic crust is uplifted onto continental margins despite the relatively low density of the latter. All emplacement procedures share the same steps nonetheless: subduction initiation, thrusting of the ophiolite over a continental margin or an overriding plate at a subduction zone, and contact with air.

===Hypotheses===

====Emplacement by irregular continental margin====
A hypothesis based on research conducted on the Bay of Islands complex in Newfoundland as well as the East Vardar complex in the Apuseni Mountains of Romania suggest that an irregular continental margin colliding with an island arc complex causes ophiolite generation in a back-arc basin and obduction due to compression. The continental margin, promontories and reentrants along its length, is attached to the subducting oceanic crust, which dips away from it underneath the island arc complex. As subduction takes place, the buoyant continent and island arc complex converge, initially colliding with the promontories. However, oceanic crust is still at the surface between the promontories, not having been subducted beneath the island arc yet. The subducting oceanic crust is thought to split from the continental margin to aid subduction. In the event that the rate of trench retreat is greater than that of the island arc complex&#x27;s progression, trench rollback will take place, and by consequence, extension of the overriding plate will occur to allow the island arc complex to match the trench retreat&#x27;s speed. The extension, a back-arc basin, generates oceanic crust: ophiolites. Finally, when the oceanic lithosphere is entirely subducted, the island arc complex&#x27;s extensional regime becomes compressional. The hot, positively buoyant ocean crust from the extension will not subduct, instead obducting onto the island arc as an ophiolite. As compression persists, the ophiolite is emplaced onto the continental margin. Based on Sr and Nd isotope analyses, ophiolites have a similar composition to mid-ocean-ridge basalts, but typically have slightly elevated large ion lithophile elements and a Nb depletion. These chemical signatures support the ophiolites having formed in a back-arc basin of a subduction zone.

====As trapped forearc====
Ophiolite generation and subduction may also be explained, as suggested from evidence from the Coast Range ophiolite of California and Baja California, by a change in subduction location and polarity. Oceanic crust attached to a continental margin subducts beneath an island arc. Pre-ophiolitic ocean crust is generated by a back-arc basin. The collision of the continent and island arc initiates a new subduction zone at the back-arc basin, dipping in the opposite direction as the first. The created ophiolite becomes the tip of the new subduction&#x27;s forearc and is uplifted (over the accretionary wedge) by detachment and compression. Verification of the two above hypotheses requires further research, as do the other hypotheses available in current literature on the subject.

==Research==

Scientists have drilled only about 1.5 km into the 6- to 7-kilometer-thick oceanic crust, so scientific understanding of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of &quot;in situ&quot; oceanic crust. Oceanic crust generally has a layered velocity structure that implies a layered rock series similar to that listed above. But in detail there are problems, with many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating to oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges. However, seismic sounding of mid-ocean ridges has revealed only a few magma chambers beneath ridges, and these are quite thin. A few deep drill holes into oceanic crust have intercepted gabbro, but it is not layered like ophiolite gabbro.

The circulation of hydrothermal fluids through young oceanic crust causes serpentinization, alteration of the peridotites and alteration of minerals in the gabbros and basalts to lower temperature assemblages. For example, plagioclase, pyroxenes, and olivine in the sheeted dikes and lavas will alter to albite, chlorite, and serpentine, respectively. Often, ore bodies such as iron-rich sulfide deposits are found above highly altered epidosites (epidote-quartz rocks) that are evidence of relict black smokers, which continue to operate within the seafloor spreading centers of ocean ridges today.

Thus, there is reason to believe that ophiolites are indeed oceanic mantle and crust; however, certain problems arise when looking closer. Beyond issues of layer thicknesses mentioned above, a problem arises concerning compositional differences of silica (SiO2) and titania (TiO2). Ophiolite basalt contents place them in the domain of subduction zones (~55% silica, &lt;1% TiO2), whereas mid-ocean ridge basalts typically have ~50% silica and 1.5–2.5% TiO2. These chemical differences extend to a range of trace elements as well (that is, chemical elements occurring in amounts of 1000 ppm or less). In particular, trace elements associated with subduction zone (island arc) volcanics tend to be high in ophiolites, whereas trace elements that are high in ocean ridge basalts but low in subduction zone volcanics are also low in ophiolites.

Additionally, the crystallization order of feldspar and pyroxene (clino- and orthopyroxene) in the gabbros is reversed, and ophiolites also appear to have a multi-phase magmatic complexity on par with subduction zones. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that most ophiolites are generated when subduction begins and thus represent fragments of fore-arc lithosphere. This led to introduction of the term &quot;supra-subduction zone&quot; (SSZ) ophiolite in the 1980s to acknowledge that some ophiolites are more closely related to island arcs than ocean ridges. Consequently, some of the classic ophiolite occurrences thought of as being related to seafloor spreading (Troodos in Cyprus, Semail in Oman) were found to be &quot;SSZ&quot; ophiolites, formed by rapid extension of fore-arc crust during subduction initiation.

A fore-arc setting for most ophiolites also solves the otherwise-perplexing problem of how oceanic lithosphere can be emplaced on top of continental crust. It appears that continental accretion sediments, if carried by the downgoing plate into a subduction zone, will jam it up and cause subduction to cease, resulting in the rebound of the accretionary prism with fore-arc lithosphere (ophiolite) on top of it. Ophiolites with compositions comparable with hotspot-type eruptive settings or normal mid-oceanic ridge basalt are rare, and those examples are generally strongly dismembered in subduction zone accretionary complexes.

==Groups and assemblages==

Ophiolites are common in orogenic belts of Mesozoic age, like those formed by the closure of the Tethys Ocean. Ophiolites in Archean and Paleoproterozoic domains are rare.

Most ophiolites can be divided into one of two groups: Tethyan and Cordilleran. Tethyan ophiolites are characteristic of those that occur in the eastern Mediterranean sea area, e.g. Troodos in Cyprus, and in the Middle East, such as Semail in Oman, which consist of relatively complete rock series corresponding to the classic ophiolite assemblage and which have been emplaced onto a passive continental margin more or less intact (Tethys is the name given to the ancient sea that once separated Europe and Africa). Cordilleran ophiolites are characteristic of those that occur in the mountain belts of western North America (the &quot;Cordillera&quot; or backbone of the continent). These ophiolites sit on subduction zone accretionary complexes (subduction complexes) and have no association with a passive continental margin. They include the Coast Range ophiolite of California, the Josephine ophiolite of the Klamath Mountains (California, Oregon), and ophiolites in the southern Andes of South America. Despite their differences in mode of emplacement, both types of ophiolite are exclusively supra-subduction zone (SSZ) in origin.

Based on mode of occurrences, the Neoproterozoic ophiolites appear to show characteristics of both mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB)-type and SSZ-type ophiolites and are classified from oldest to youngest into: (1) MORB intact ophiolites (MIO); (2) dismembered ophiolites (DO); and (3) arc-associated ophiolites (AAO) (El Bahariya, 2018). Collectively, the investigated ophiolites of the Central Eastern Desert (CED) fall into both MORB/back-arc basin basalt (BABB) ophiolites and SSZ ophiolites. They are spatially and temporally unrelated, and thus, it seems likely that the two types are not petrogenetically related. Ophiolites occur in different geological settings, and they represent change of the tectonic setting of the ophiolites from MORB to SSZ with time.

==Origin and evolution of the concept==
The term &quot;ophiolite&quot; originated from publications of Alexandre Brongniart in 1813 and 1821. In the first, he used &quot;ophiolite&quot; for serpentinite rocks found in large-scale breccias called mélanges. In the second publication, he expanded the definition to encompass a variety of igneous rocks as well such as gabbro, diabase, ultramafic and volcanic rocks. Ophiolites thus became a name for a well-known association of rocks occurring in the Alps and Apennines of Italy. Following work in these two mountains systems, Gustav Steinmann defined what later became known as the &quot;Steinmann Trinity&quot;: the mixture of serpentine, diabase-spilite and chert. The recognition of the Steinmann Trinity served years later to build up the theory around seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. A key observation by Steinmann was that ophiolites were associated to sedimentary rocks reflecting former deep sea environments. Steinmann himself interpreted ophiolites (the Trinity) using the geosyncline concept. He held that Alpine ophiolites were &quot;submarine effusions issuing along thrust faults into the active flank of an asymmetrically shortening geosyncline&quot;. The apparent lack of ophiolites in the Peruvian Andes, Steinmann theorized, was either due to the Andes being preceded by a shallow geosyncline or representing just the margin of a geosyncline. Thus, Cordilleran-type and Alpine-type mountains were to be different in this regard. In Hans Stille&#x27;s models a type of geosyncline called eugeosynclines were characterized by producing an &quot;initial magmatism&quot; that in some cases corresponded to ophiolitic magmatism.

As plate tectonic theory prevailed in geology and geosyncline theory became outdated ophiolites were interpreted in the new framework. They were recognized as fragments of oceanic lithosphere, and dykes were viewed as the result of extensional tectonics at mid-ocean ridges. The plutonic rocks found in ophiolites were understood as remnants of former magma chambers.

In 1973, Akiho Miyashiro revolutionized common conceptions of ophiolites and proposed an island arc origin for the famous Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus, arguing that numerous lavas and dykes in the ophiolite had calc-alkaline chemistries.

==Notable examples==


Examples of ophiolites that have been influential in the study of these rocks bodies are:

* Coast Range Ophiolite in the California Coast Ranges, from Santa Barbara through San Francisco Counties, California.
* Semail Ophiolite in Oman and the United Arab Emirates, widely considered one of the best exposed ophiolite sequences
* Troodos Ophiolite in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, of economic interest since it contains the copper deposits of Cyprus (from which copper is named)
* Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Australia was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, as &quot;the only known example of an ophiolite...complex in the process of being formed and currently in its original geological setting&quot;.
* Bay of Islands Ophiolite in Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland, named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 because of its superbly exposed complete ophiolite stratigraphic sequence
*Yakuno, Horokanai, and Poroshiri, three full ophiolite sequences in Japan
* Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt, South Island, New Zealand. The rocktype dunite is named after this locality.
* Zambales ophiolite complex including the Coto and Acoje blocks, Luzon, Philippines. The ~45 Myr old Zambales ophiolite forms part of the basement of the Luzon island arc complex.

<text>An insectivore is a carnivorous animal or plant that eats insects. An alternative term is entomophage, which can also refer to the human practice of eating insects.

The first vertebrate insectivores were amphibians. When they evolved 400 million years ago, the first amphibians were piscivores, with numerous sharp conical teeth, much like a modern crocodile. The same tooth arrangement is however also suited for eating animals with exoskeletons, thus the ability to eat insects is an extension of piscivory.

At one time, insectivorous mammals were scientifically classified in an order called Insectivora. This order is now abandoned, as not all insectivorous mammals are closely related. Most of the Insectivora taxa have been reclassified; those that have not yet been reclassified and found to be truly related to each other remain in the order Eulipotyphla.

Although individually small, insects exist in enormous numbers. Insects make up a very large part of the animal biomass in almost all non-marine, non-polar environments. It has been estimated that the global insect biomass is in the region of 1012 kg (one billion tons) with an estimated population of 1018 (one billion billion, or quintillion) organisms. Many creatures depend on insects as their primary diet, and many that do not (and are thus not technically insectivores) nevertheless use insects as a protein supplement, particularly when they are breeding.

==Examples==
Examples of insectivores include different kinds of species of carp, opossum, frogs, lizards (e.g. chameleons, geckos), nightingales, swallows, echidnas, numbats, anteaters, armadillos, aardvarks, pangolins, aardwolfs, bats, and spiders. Even large mammals are recorded as eating insects; the sloth bear is perhaps the largest insectivore. Insects also can be insectivores; examples are dragonflies, hornets, ladybugs, robber flies, and praying mantises. Insectivory also features to various degrees amongst primates, such as marmosets, tamarins, tarsiers, galagos and aye-aye. There is some suggestion that the earliest primates were nocturnal, arboreal insectivores.

==Insectivorous plants==
Insectivorous plants are plants that derive some of their nutrients from trapping and consuming animals or protozoan. The benefit they derive from their catch varies considerably; in some species, it might include a small part of their nutrient intake and in others it might be an indispensable source of nutrients. As a rule, however, such animal food, however valuable it might be as a source of certain critically important minerals, is not the plants&#x27; major source of energy, which they generally derive mainly from photosynthesis.

Insectivorous plants might consume insects and other animal material trapped adventitiously. However, most species to which such food represents an important part of their intake are specifically, often spectacularly, adapted to attract and secure adequate supplies. Their prey animals typically, but not exclusively, comprise insects and other arthropods. Plants highly adapted to reliance on animal food use a variety of mechanisms to secure their prey, such as pitfalls, sticky surfaces, hair-trigger snaps, bladder-traps, entangling furriness, and lobster-pot trap mechanisms. Also known as &quot;carnivorous plants&quot;, they appear adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings.

Insectivorous plants include the Venus flytrap, several types of pitcher plants, butterworts, sundews, bladderworts, the waterwheel plant, brocchinia and many members of the Bromeliaceae. The list is far from complete, and some plants, such as Roridula species, exploit the prey organisms mainly in a mutualistic relationship with other creatures, such as resident organisms that contribute to the digestion of prey. In particular, animal prey organisms supply carnivorous plants with nitrogen, but they also are important sources of various other soluble minerals, such as potassium and trace elements that are in short supply in environments where the plants flourish. This gives them a decisive advantage over other plants, whereas in nutrient-rich soils they tend to be out-competed by plants adapted to aggressive growth where nutrient supplies are not the major constraints.

Technically these plants are not strictly insectivorous, as they consume any animal that they can secure and consume; the distinction is trivial, however, because not many primarily insectivorous organisms exclusively consume insects. Most of those that do have such a restrictive diet, such as certain parasitoids and hunting wasps, are specialized to exploit particular species, not insects in general. Indeed, much as large mantids and spiders will do, the larger varieties of pitcher plants have been known to consume vertebrates such as small rodents and lizards. Charles Darwin wrote the first well-known treatise on carnivorous plants in 1875.

<text>The Continental League of Professional Baseball Clubs (known as the Continental League or CL) was a proposed third major league for baseball in the United States and Canada. The league was announced in 1959 and scheduled to begin play in the 1961 season. Unlike predecessor competitors such as the Players&#x27; League and the Federal League, it sought membership within organized baseball&#x27;s existing organization and acceptance within Major League Baseball as any attempt at outsider leagues could be quashed by them per a 1922 Supreme Court case declaring MLB exempt from federal antitrust laws. The league disbanded in August 1960 without playing a single game as a concession by lawyer William Shea as part of his negotiations with Major League Baseball to expand to incorporate at least eight new teams.

==History==

===Background===
The move of the New York Giants (to San Francisco) and the Brooklyn Dodgers (to Los Angeles) following the 1957 season led New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. to appoint a four-man committee to bring the National League back to the city in 1958. Early overtures to entice one of the other six existing NL teams – the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Pittsburgh Pirates were reportedly approached – were abandoned.

===New league announced===

The Continental League was the idea of attorney William Shea, who proposed it in November 1958. On July 27, 1959, the new league was formally announced, with teams in Denver, Houston, Minneapolis–St. Paul, New York City, and Toronto. The name of the league was said to have been the suggestion of Colorado senator Edwin C. Johnson.

Representing the team owners at the announcement were Bob Howsam (Denver), Craig F. Cullinan Jr. (Houston), Wheelock Whitney Jr. (Minneapolis–St. Paul), Dwight F. Davis, Jr., who was representing the group headed by Joan Whitney Payson (New York), and Jack Kent Cooke (Toronto). Owners in each city had agreed to pay $50,000 to the league and committed to a capital investment of $2.5 million, not including stadium costs. A minimum seating capacity of 35,000 was established by the league for the venues in which its teams would play.

At least three other teams were expected to be in place before play began in 1961, and the league said it had received applications from 10 cities. The three that were later selected were Atlanta (announced December 8, 1959), Dallas–Fort Worth (announced December 22, 1959), and Buffalo (backed by Robert O. Swados and announced on January 29, 1960). Former Dodgers president Branch Rickey was named league president on August 18, 1959. Appearing in that capacity as a guest on the live CBS broadcast of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; on Sunday, September 13, 1959, he pronounced the new league as &quot;Inevitable as tomorrow morning.&quot;

On February 18, 1960, Rickey and Cooke announced an opening date of April 18, 1961.

===Established leagues respond===
The Major League Baseball commissioner&#x27;s office was noncommittal on the issue. At that time, however, the American League and the National League enjoyed far more autonomy than they do today, answering more to their constituent owners (who were universally hostile to the new league) than to the Commissioner&#x27;s Office. They reacted to the formation of the new league by announcing plans to expand by adding two teams in each of the existing leagues. Priority would be given, it was stated, to cities that did not have Major League Baseball. Accordingly, the NL placed one of its expansion teams in Houston (the then-Houston Colt .45s, now the American League Astros), a Continental League city without an existing Major League Baseball team.

Though the AL placed one of its expansion teams (the Washington Senators, now the Texas Rangers) in a previously existing Major League Baseball city (Washington, D.C.), this was done to replace the original Senators team, which had relocated to Minneapolis–St. Paul and became the Minnesota Twins. Like Houston, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul were a Continental League city without an existing Major League Baseball team.

However, notwithstanding aforementioned promise to expand to non-MLB cities, the National League owners had always had misgivings regarding their apparent ceding of the nation&#x27;s largest market to the American League. Thus, once expansion was committed to, it was virtually inevitable the NL would return to New York City. The NL opted to offer its tenth franchise to the owners of the Continental League New York team, who immediately accepted, effectively killing any attempt to revive the proposed league. This franchise would become the New York Mets. The AL then followed by placing a second expansion team in Los Angeles, the Angels, giving the American League its first presence on the West Coast.

===The league disbands===
With Shea&#x27;s mission to bring the National League back to New York successful, he stopped championing the Continental League&#x27;s formation. The promise of expansion achieved the owners&#x27; desired effect; on August 2, 1960, the Continental League formally disbanded.

==Legacy==
Baseball historians concur that even without the imminent threat of a third major league, Major League Baseball expansion would inevitably have happened due to such factors as pressure from Congress, the rapid growth of professional football, and the replacement of conservative long-tenured owners with younger businessmen who tended to be far more amenable to expansion. Nevertheless, the Continental League undoubtedly compelled MLB to hasten expansion by several years. Although Major League Baseball had succeeded in preventing the launch of an eight-team CL, it only did so by committing to eventually add eight franchises of its own. MLB finished honoring this commitment in 1969 when the AL and NL each added two more teams for a total of eight over the course of the decade, thereby matching the total number of new teams envisioned by the Continental League.

Although William Shea&#x27;s efforts to create a third major league are not well known today, Shea Stadium, home of the New York Mets from 1964 to 2008, was named in his honor for his efforts in bringing National League baseball back to New York. Over the next two decades, Shea would become involved in efforts to secure second franchises for the New York metropolitan area in each of the other three major sports. He brokered the 1963 sale of the Titans of New York (now known as the New York Jets) from Harry Wismer to Sonny Werblin, ensuring the survival of the then-struggling American Football League franchise, and then worked to bring the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association to Nassau Coliseum. Shea also helped negotiate the mergers of both rival leagues with the established National Football League and National Basketball Association respectively. On the other hand, he actively opposed efforts to establish a World Hockey Association team on Long Island by successfully lobbying the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers to award an NHL franchise (the New York Islanders) to Nassau County.

Of the eight proposed Continental League cities, all but one eventually received relocated or expansion Major League Baseball franchises – Minneapolis–St. Paul in 1961, Houston and New York in 1962, Atlanta in 1966, Dallas–Fort Worth in 1972, Toronto in 1977, and Denver in 1993. Buffalo, although it made efforts to lure an MLB team to then-new Pilot Field in the early 1990s, has not succeeded in bringing Major League Baseball back. (There had been a major league team in Buffalo in the nineteenth century.) Buffalo remains home to the Buffalo Bisons, a team in the Triple-A International League. Buffalo also played host to the majority of Toronto Blue Jays home games for the 2020 season and part of the next season due to cross-border travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) is a tern in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar breeding distribution covering the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Europe (as far south as Brittany), Asia, and North America (as far south as Massachusetts). The species is strongly migratory, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later. Recent studies have shown average annual round-trip lengths of about for birds nesting in Iceland and Greenland and about for birds nesting in the Netherlands. These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom. The Arctic tern nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle).

Arctic terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of and a wingspan of . They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red/orange beak and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is , and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs.

Arctic terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching fifteen to thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated two million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird&#x27;s numbers in the southern reaches of its ranges.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Sterna&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;stearn&quot;, &quot;tern&quot;. The specific &quot;paradisaea&quot; is from Late Latin &quot;paradisus&quot;, &quot;paradise&quot;.
The Scots names &quot;pictarnie&quot;, &quot;tarrock&quot; and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the common tern.

== Distribution and migration ==
The Arctic tern has a continuous worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution; there are no recognized subspecies. It can be found in coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and Eurasia during the northern summer. During the southern summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.

The Arctic tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year. The shortest distance between these areas is . The long journey ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet. One example of this bird&#x27;s remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic tern ringed as an unfledged chick on the Farne Islands, Northumberland, UK, in the northern summer of 1982 that reached Melbourne, Australia in October, just three months after fledging – a journey of more than . Another example is that of a chick ringed in Labrador, Canada, on 23 July 1928. It was found in South Africa four months later.

A 2010 study using tracking devices attached to the birds showed that the above examples are not unusual for the species. In fact, the study showed that previous research had seriously underestimated the annual distances travelled by the Arctic tern. Eleven birds that bred in Greenland or Iceland covered on average in a year, with a maximum of . The difference from previous estimates is due to the birds taking meandering courses rather than following a straight route as was previously assumed. The birds follow a somewhat convoluted course in order to take advantage of prevailing winds. The average Arctic tern lives about 30 years and will, based on the above research, travel some during its lifetime, the equivalent of a roundtrip from Earth to the Moon more than three times.

A 2013 tracking study of half a dozen Arctic terns breeding in the Netherlands shows average annual migrations of c. . On their way south, these birds roughly followed the coastlines of Europe and Africa.

Arctic terns usually migrate sufficiently far offshore that they are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.

== Description and taxonomy ==

The Arctic tern is a medium-sized bird around from the tip of its beak to the tip of its tail. The wingspan is . The weight is . The beak is dark red, as are the short legs and webbed feet. Like most terns, the Arctic tern has high aspect ratio wings and a tail with a deep fork.

The adult plumage is grey above, with a black nape and crown and white cheeks. The upperwings are pale grey, with the area near the wingtip being translucent. The tail is white, and the underparts pale grey. Both sexes are similar in appearance. The winter plumage is similar, but the crown is whiter and the bills are darker.

Juveniles differ from adults in their black bill and legs, &quot;scaly&quot; appearing wings, and mantle with dark feather tips, dark carpal wing bar, and short tail streamers. During their first summer, juveniles also have a whiter forecrown.

The species has a variety of calls; the two most common being the &quot;alarm call&quot;, made when possible predators (such as humans or other mammals) enter the colonies, and the &quot;advertising call&quot;.

While the Arctic tern is similar to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern&#x27;s call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.

This bird&#x27;s closest relatives are a group of South Polar species, the South American (&quot;Sterna hirundinacea&quot;), Kerguelen (&quot;S. virgata&quot;), and Antarctic (&quot;S. vittata&quot;) terns.

The immature plumages of Arctic tern were originally described as separate species, &quot;Sterna portlandica&quot; and &quot;Sterna pikei&quot;.

== Reproduction ==
Breeding begins around the third or fourth year. Arctic terns mate for life and, in most cases, return to the same colony each year. Courtship is elaborate, especially in birds nesting for the first time. Courtship begins with a so-called &quot;high flight&quot;, where a female will chase the male to a high altitude and then slowly descend. This display is followed by &quot;fish flights&quot;, where the male will offer fish to the female. Courtship on the ground involves strutting with a raised tail and lowered wings. After this, both birds will usually fly and circle each other.

Both sexes agree on a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male continues to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.

It is one of the most aggressive terns, fiercely defensive of its nest and young. It will attack humans and large predators, usually striking the top or back of the head. Although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal of a human&#x27;s size, it is still capable of drawing blood, and is capable of repelling many raptorial birds, polar bears and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes and cats.

The nest is usually a depression in the ground, which may or may not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.

When hatched, the chicks are downy. Being precocial, the chicks begin to move around and explore their surroundings within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter with the help of their parents.

Arctic terns are long-lived birds that spend considerable time raising only a few young, and are thus said to be K-selected. A 1957 study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82%.
== Ecology and behaviour ==

The diet of the Arctic tern varies depending on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise the most important part of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year-old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.

Arctic terns sometimes dip down to the surface of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.

While nesting, Arctic terns are vulnerable to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. Scientists have experimented with bamboo canes erected around tern nests. Although they found fewer predation attempts in the caned areas than in the control areas, canes did not reduce the probability of predation success per attempt. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food.
== Conservation status ==

The total population for the arctic tern is estimated at more than two million individuals, with more than half of the population in Europe. The breeding range is very large, and although the population is considered to be decreasing, this species is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.
Arctic terns are among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.

The population in New England was reduced in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade. Exploitation continues in western Greenland, where the population of the species has been reduced greatly since 1950. In Iceland, the Arctic tern has been regionally uplisted to Vulnerable as of 2018, due to the crash of sandeel (&quot;Ammodytes&quot; spp.) stocks.

At the southern part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to a lack of food. However, most of these birds&#x27; range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole. The Arctic terns&#x27; dispersal pattern is affected by changing climatic conditions, and its ability to feed in its Antarctic wintering is dependent on sea-ice cover, but unlike breeding species, it is able to move to a different area if necessary, and can be used as a control to investigate the effect of climate change on breeding species.

== Cultural depictions ==
The Arctic tern has appeared on the postage stamps of several countries and dependent territories. The territories include Åland, Alderney, and Faroe Islands. Countries include Canada, Finland, Iceland, and Cuba.

The Arctic tern was featured prominently in a sketch on the improv comedy television show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; involving Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles. In the sketch, Colin alluded the call of the arctic tern to sounding like the band name Backstreet Boys.

<doc id="239414" wikidata="Q518090" url="?curid=239414" title="Teasing">
<text>Teasing has multiple meanings and uses. In human interactions, teasing exists in three major forms: &quot;playful&quot;, &quot;hurtful&quot;, and &quot;educative&quot;. Teasing can have a variety of effects, depending on how it is used and its intended effect. When teasing is unwelcome, it may be regarded as harassment or mobbing, especially in the workplace and school, or as a form of bullying or emotional abuse. If done in public, it may be regarded as humiliation. Teasing can also be regarded as educative when it is used as a way of informal learning. Adults in some of the Indigenous American communities often tease children to playfully illustrate and teach them how their behavior negatively affects the community. Children in many Indigenous American communities also learn by observing what others do in addition to collaborating with them. Along with teasing, this form of informal learning is different from the ways that Western American children learn. Informal ways of child learning include mutual responsibility, as well as active collaboration with adults and peers. This differentiates from the more formal way of learning because it is not adult-oriented.

People may be teased on matters such as their appearance, weight, behavior, family, gender, faith, health/medical issues, abilities, clothing, and intelligence. From the victim&#x27;s point of view, this kind of teasing is often hurtful, irrespective of the intention of the teaser.

One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognize this both as play or harassment.

==Nature==
A common form of teasing is verbal bullying or taunting. This behavior is intended to distract, disturb, offend, sadden, anger, bother, irritate, or annoy the recipient. Because it is hurtful, it is different from joking and is generally accompanied by some degree of social rejection. Teasing can also be taken to mean &quot;To make fun of; mock playfully&quot; or be sarcastic about and use sarcasm.

Dacher Keltner uses Penelope Brown&#x27;s classic study on the difference between &quot;on-record&quot; and &quot;off-record&quot; communication to illustrate how people must learn to read others&#x27; tone of voice and facial expressions in order to learn appropriate responses to teasing.

A form of teasing that is usually overlooked is educational teasing. This form is commonly used by parents and caregivers in two Indigenous American communities and Mexican Heritage communities to guide their children into responding with more Prosocial behavior. For example, when a parent teases a child who is throwing a tantrum for a piece of candy, the parent will pretend to give the child candy but then take it away and ask the child to correct their behavior before giving the child that piece of candy. In this way, the parent teaches the child the importance of maintaining self-control. When adults educate children through teasing, they are informally teaching the children. This type of learning is often overlooked because it is different from the way Western American Communities teach their children.

Another form of teasing is to pretend to give something which the other desires, or give it very slowly. This is usually done by arousing curiosity or desire, and may not actually involve the intent to satisfy or disclose. This form of teasing could be called &quot;tantalizing&quot;, after the story of Tantalus. Tantalizing is generally playful among adults, although among children it can be hurtful, such as when one child acquires possession of another&#x27;s property and will not return it. It is also common in flirting and dating. For example, a person who is interested in someone else romantically might reject an advance the first time in order to arouse interest and curiosity, and give in the second or third time.

Whether teasing is playful or hurtful or educative is largely subject to the interpretation of the person being teased. If the person being teased feels harmed, then the teasing is hurtful. A difference in power between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful. Ultimately though, if someone perceives themselves as the victim of teasing, and experiences the teasing as unpleasant, then it is considered hurtful. If parents&#x27; intentions are positive, as in many Indigenous American communities, then teasing to the community can be seen as an educational tool. The child may or may not understand that at the moment. If the other person continues to do it after being asked to stop then it is a form of bullying or abuse.

Another way to look at teasing is as an honest reflection on differences, expressed in a joking fashion with the goal of &quot;clearing the air&quot;. It can express comfort with the other which can be comforting. As opposed to being nice to someone&#x27;s face while making disparaging remarks behind their back, teasing can be a way to express differences in a direct fashion rather than internalizing them.

==In Indigenous American communities==

Some indigenous American communities use teasing to teach their children about the expectations and values of the community and to change negative behaviors. Teasing gives children a better understanding of how their behavior affects the people around them. Teasing in Indigenous American communities is used to learn community acceptance, humbleness, correcting behavior and social control.

In some Mexican indigenous American communities, teasing is used in an effective educative way. Teasing is found more useful because it allows the child to feel and understand the relevant effect of their behavior instead of receiving out-of-context feedback. Some parents in Indigenous American communities believe it mildly embarrasses the children in a shared reference to give them a good sense of the consequences of their behavior. This type of teasing is thought to teach children to be less egocentric, teaches autonomy and responsibility to monitor their own behavior. Parental teasing also is practiced to encourage the child to think of their behavior in a social context. Some Indigenous American mothers have reported that this urges the children to understand how their behavior affects others around them. From examples in Eisenberg&#x27;s article, parents use teasing as a way of reinforcing relationships and participation in group/community activities (prosocial behavior). Parents tease their children to be able to &quot;control the behavior of the child and to have fun with them&quot;.

An Inuit principle of learning that follows a similar teasing pattern is known as issumaksaiyuk, meaning to cause thought. Oftentimes, adults pose questions or hypothetical situations to the children (sometimes dangerous) but in a teasing, playful manner, often dramatizing their responses. These questions raise the child&#x27;s awareness to issues surrounding their community, as well as give them a sense of agency within the community as a member capable of having an effect and creating change. Once the child begins to answer the questions reasonably, like an adult, the questions would stop.

In some Cherokee communities, teasing is a way of diffusing aggressive or hostile situations and teaching the individual about the consequences of their behavior. It allows the individual to feel how their behaviors are affecting others and control their behavior.

==Other usages==
To tease, or to &quot;be a tease&quot; in a sexual sense can refer to the use of posture, language or other means of flirting to cause another person to become sexually aroused. Such teasing may or may not be a prelude to intercourse, an ambiguity which can lead to uncomfortable situations. In a more physical sense, it can also refer to sexual stimulation.

Teasing is also used to describe playing part of a song at a concert. Jam bands will often quote the main riff of another song during jams.

&quot;Tease it&quot; is also used as a slang term to smoke marijuana. The word &quot;tease&quot; can also be used as a noun to stand for marijuana.

In a very different context, hair can be teased, &quot;ratted&quot;, or &quot;backcombed&quot;. As the name suggests, backcombing involves combing the hair backwards from end to root to intentionally tangle the strands to create volume. It can also be done excessively in sections to create dreadlocks.

<text>Anthony Woodley, Baron Woodley (born 2 January 1948) is a British trade unionist who was the Joint-General Secretary of Unite, a union formed through the merger of Amicus and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, from 2007 to 2011. Despite stepping down as Joint-General Secretary, he remained as the Head of Organising for Unite until December 2013 and is still a consultant to the union. He was previously the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers union (T&amp;G) from 2004 to 2007.

He was created a Labour life peer in November 2020 with the title Baron Woodley, &quot;of Wallasey in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral&quot;, after initially declining the peerage.

==Early life==
Born in Wallasey, Cheshire (now Merseyside), he was educated at a secondary modern school on the Wirral. At the age of 15, he was taken on by the Ocean Steam Ship Company, working as a steward for four years. In 1967, he started working for Vauxhall Motors at Ellesmere Port, where he first joined the TGWU.

==Trade unionist==
In 1980, he was elected as a full-time union convenor; his father George had also been a union convenor at the plant for the National Union of Vehicle Builders. He was also appointed as a full-time district official of the TGWU in 1989, later becoming the National Officer of the Vehicle Building and Automotive Group, and was elected as TGWU Deputy General Secretary in 2002.

He first came to national prominence when, on 30 May 2003, he was elected to succeed Bill Morris as General Secretary of the TGWU. He received 66,958 votes, 21,822 more than the second-placed candidate Jack Dromey, who was widely perceived as the Blairite candidate. He was considered to be a member of the so-called &quot;Awkward Squad&quot; of trade union leaders opposed to New Labour policies that they perceived to be against the interests of working people.

After his election he said in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper:

:&quot;A priority for stronger unions in the workplace must be a repeal of the anti-union laws ... British employment laws make it easier and cheaper to sack workers than on the Continent. I will campaign to stop the scandal of British workers being the cannon fodder of Europe.&quot;

He later served as one of the two Joint-General Secretaries of Unite, which was formed after a merger between the TGWU and Amicus. He stepped down from this role in January 2011.

==&quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper==
At the 2009 Labour Party Conference, Woodley tore up a copy of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper as he made a speech. This was following the paper&#x27;s announcement that they would be supporting the Conservative Party at the subsequent general election, having backed the winning Labour Party at the previous three elections.

On tearing up the paper, he said:

:&quot;In Liverpool, we learnt a long time ago what to do [tear the paper]. I suggest the rest of the country does the same thing.&quot;

This was a reference to &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s controversial reporting of the Hillsborough Disaster 20 years earlier, which had caused widespread public outrage, particularly in Liverpool, as the disaster claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans, who mostly lived in or near the city. Many people on Merseyside still refuse to buy the newspaper and a number of newsagents still refuse to stock it.

==Personal life==
Woodley is also the President of Football Conference North side Vauxhall Motors F.C. despite being a childhood supporter of Everton FC. He lives in Ellesmere Port. He married Janet Timmis and they have a son (born September 1990).

<text>Vladimir Kosma Zworykin (1888/1889July 29, 1982) was a Russian-American inventor, engineer, and pioneer of television technology. Zworykin invented a television transmitting and receiving system employing cathode-ray tubes. He played a role in the practical development of television from the early thirties, including charge storage-type tubes, infrared image tubes and the electron microscope.

==Early life and education==
Vladimir Zworykin was born in Murom, Russia, in 1888 or 1889, to the family of a prosperous merchants. He had a relatively calm upbringing, and he rarely saw his father except on religious holidays.

He studied at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, under Boris Rosing. He helped Rosing with experimental work on television in the basement of Rosing&#x27;s private lab at the School of Artillery of Saint Petersburg. They worked on the problem of &quot;electrical telescopy,&quot; something Zworykin had never heard of before. At this time, electrical telescopy (or television as it was later called) was just a dream. Zworykin did not know that others had been studying the idea since the 1880s, or that Professor Rosing had been working on it in secret since 1902 and had made excellent progress. Rosing had filed his first patent on a television system in 1907, featuring a very early cathode-ray tube as a receiver, and a mechanical device as a transmitter. Its demonstration in 1911, based on an improved design, was the world&#x27;s first demonstration of TV of any kind.

Zworykin married Tatiana Vasilieva in 1916, they had two daughters (the couple separated in the early 1930s).

== Career ==
Zworykin graduated in 1912. He then studied X-rays under professor Paul Langevin in Paris. During World War I, Zworykin was enlisted and served in the Russian Signal Corps. He then worked testing radio equipment that was being produced for the Russian Army. Zworykin left Russia for the United States in 1918 during the Russian Civil War. He left through Siberia, travelling north on the River Ob to the Arctic Ocean as part of an expedition led by Russian scientist Innokenty P. Tolmachev, eventually arriving in the U.S. at the end of 1918. He returned to Omsk, then capital of Admiral Kolchak&#x27;s government in 1919, via Vladivostok, then to the United States again on official duties from the Omsk government. These duties ended with the collapse of the White movement in Siberia at the death of Kolchak. Zworykin then decided to remain permanently in the United States.

Once in the U.S., Zworykin found work at the Westinghouse laboratories in Pittsburgh where he eventually had an opportunity to engage in television experiments. 

Zworykin applied for a television patent in the U.S. in 1923. He summarized the resulting invention in two patent applications. The first, entitled &quot;Television Systems&quot;, was filed on December 29, 1923, and was followed by a second application in 1925 of essentially the same content, but with minor changes and the addition of a Paget-type RGB raster screen for color transmission and reception. He was awarded a patent for the 1925 application in 1928, and two patents for the 1923 application that was divided in 1931, although the equipment described was never successfully demonstrated. Zworykin described cathode-ray tubes as both transmitter and receiver. The operation, whose basic thrust was to &quot;prevent&quot; the emission of electrons between scansion cycles, was reminiscent of A. A. Campbell Swinton&#x27;s proposal published in &quot;Nature&quot; in June 1908.

The demonstration given (sometime in late 1925 or early 1926) by Zworykin was far from a success with the Westinghouse management, even though it showed the possibilities inherent in a system based on the cathode-ray tube. He was told by management to &quot;devote his time to more practical endeavours,&quot; yet continued his efforts to perfect his system. 

As attested by his doctoral dissertation of 1926, earning him a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, his experiments were directed at improving the output of photoelectric cells. There were, however, limits to how far one could go along these lines, and so, in 1929, Zworykin returned to vibrating mirrors and facsimile transmission, filing patents describing these. At this time, however, he was also experimenting with an improved cathode ray receiving tube, filing a patent application for this in November 1929, and introducing the new receiver that he named the &quot;kinescope&quot;, reading a paper two days later at a convention of the Institute of Radio Engineers.

Having developed the prototype of the receiver by December, Zworykin met David Sarnoff, who eventually hired him and put him in charge of television development for the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) at its factories and laboratories in Camden, New Jersey.

The move to the RCA&#x27;s Camden laboratories occurred in the spring of 1930, and the difficult task of developing a transmitter could begin. There was an in-house evaluation in mid-1930, where the kinescope performed well (but with only 60 lines definition), and the transmitter was still of a mechanical type. A &quot;breakthrough&quot; would come when the Zworykin team decided to develop a new type of cathode ray transmitter, one described in the French and British patents of 1928 priority by the Hungarian inventor Kálmán Tihanyi whom the company had approached in July 1930, after the publication of his patents in England and France. This was a curious design, one where the scanning electron beam would strike the photoelectric cell from the same side where the optical image was cast. Even more importantly, it was a system characterized by an operation based on an entirely new principle, the principle of the accumulation and storage of charges during the entire time between two scansions by the cathode-ray beam.

According to Albert Abramson, Zworykin&#x27;s experiments started in April 1931, and after the achievement of the first promising experimental transmitters, on October 23, 1931, it was decided that the new camera tube would be named the iconoscope. Zworykin first presented his iconoscope to RCA in 1932. He continued work on it, and
&quot;[t]he image iconoscope, presented in 1934, was a result of a collaboration between Zworykin and RCA&#x27;s licensee Telefunken. ... In 1935 the Reichspost started the public broadcastings using this tube and applying a 180 lines system.&quot;

RCA filed an interference suit against rival television scientist Philo Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin&#x27;s 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth&#x27;s design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image dissector to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years with Sarnoff finally agreeing to pay Farnsworth royalties. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his original application in 1931, receiving a patent in 1935, while a second one was eventually issued in 1938 by the Court of Appeals on a non-Farnsworth-related interference case, and over the objection of the Patent Office.

==Later life==
Zworykin married for a second time in 1951. His wife was Katherine Polevitzky (1888–1985), a Russian-born professor of bacteriology at the University of Pennsylvania. It was the second marriage for both. The ceremony was in Burlington, New Jersey. A photographic record of his marriage and worldwide tour can be viewed online.
He retired in 1954.

New frontiers in medical engineering and biological engineering appealed to him, and he became a founder and first president of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering. The Federation continues to honor outstanding research engineering with a &quot;Zworykin Award&quot;, the prize being travelling funds to the award&#x27;s presentation at a World Congress.

==Death==
Zworykin died on July 29, 1982, in Princeton, New Jersey. His wife Katherine died on February 18, 1985.

==Honors==

Throughout his steady rise in rank, Zworykin remained involved in the many important developments of RCA and received several outstanding honours, including, in 1934, the Morris Liebmann Memorial Prize from the Institute of Radio Engineers.

In 1941, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal from The Franklin Institute in 1947.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1948.

He was named honorary vice president of RCA in 1954.

In 1966, the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was a member, awarded him the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the instruments of science, engineering, and television and for his stimulation of the application of engineering to medicine.

In 1967, Zworykin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

He was founder-president of the International Federation for Medical Electronics and Biological Engineering, a recipient of the Faraday Medal from Great Britain (1965), and a member of the U.S. National Hall of Fame from 1977.

He received the first Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 1980.

From 1952 to 1986, the IEEE made awards to worthy engineers in the name of Vladimir K. Zworykin. More recently the &quot;Zworykin Award&quot; has been bestowed by the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

The most complete list of Zworykin&#x27;s awards can be found online at historyTV.net .

==Legacy==
Zworykin was inducted into the New Jersey Inventor&#x27;s Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Additionally, Tektronix in Beaverton, Oregon has named a street on its campus after Zworykin.

In 1995 University of Illinois Press published &quot;Zworykin, Pioneer of Television&quot; by Albert Abramson.

In 2010 Leonid Parfyonov produced a documentary film &quot;Zvorykin-Muromets&quot; about Zworykin.

Zworykin is listed in the Russian-American Chamber of Fame of Congress of Russian Americans, which is dedicated to Russian immigrants who made outstanding contributions to American science or culture.

<text>Robinson College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1977, it is one of the newest Oxbridge colleges and is unique in having been intended, from its inception, for both undergraduate and graduate students of both sexes.

The College was founded through a significant donation from the businessman and philanthropist, Sir David Robinson. In 1981 Robinson College was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II with both undergraduate and graduate students in attendance.

== History ==

The College was founded after David Robinson offered the University £17 million to establish a new college in Cambridge. Robinson later gave his College another £1 million on the occasion of its official opening. The first graduate students and fellows joined the College in 1977. Undergraduates (20 of them) were first admitted in 1979, but significant numbers only began arriving the following year. Robinson was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in May 1981.

While Robinson embraces many Cambridge traditions, such as Formal Hall, a chapel and porters&#x27; lodge, it avoids others: for example, it allows its students to walk on the grass in the College gardens. In general, the College has a reputation for being slightly less formal and traditional than other Cambridge Colleges.

==Buildings and grounds==
Designed by the Scottish architectural firm Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia, Robinson&#x27;s main buildings are distinctive for the use of handmade red bricks in their construction. In November 2022, Historic England announced that the College had been awarded Grade II* listed status. In November 2008, the college was included in the &quot;50 most inspiring buildings in Britain&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Of particular note is the chapel, which contains stained-glass windows designed by John Piper and houses a renowned Frobenius organ. The oak-panelled dining hall seats 300 for formal dining and the library is remarkable for its use of woodwork, for which it was awarded the Carpenter’s Award for 1981.

The College is located a ten-minute walk west of the city centre, behind the University Library, near the science buildings in West Cambridge and the arts faculties on the university&#x27;s Sidgwick Site. It stands on a wooded site of historical and horticultural interest. The College Gardens are a fusion of ten pre-existing gardens which date back to late Victorian and early Edwardian times and are crossed by the Bin Brook stream, which once supplied water to the Medieval Hospital of St John (now St John&#x27;s College).

Within its grounds are Thorneycreek House and Cottage (built in 1895), the Crausaz Wordsworth Building and the Maria Björnson outdoor theatre. Robinson owns a number of houses on Adams Road and Sylvester Road adjoining the main college site, which it uses for student accommodation.

The main entrance to the college is via a drawbridge-like ramp which is accessible to wheelchair users, and there are also some special facilities for those with physical or visual disabilities.

The Needham Research Institute is also located within the College grounds.

===Conferences===
As one of Cambridge&#x27;s most important conference centres, Robinson hosts conferences when undergraduate students are absent.

==Student life==
Students of the college are represented by the Robinson College Students&#x27; Association, or RCSA, headed by a President, with members of the college elected to the RCSA committee every year. Politically, Robinson is generally seen as liberal. Robinson has supplied a large number of Green Officers to the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union in recent years and in 2008 was judged the most environmentally friendly college in Cambridge.

Like other colleges, Robinson provides its students with recreational facilities such as a JCR, MCR, TV room, art room, café and bar. As a result of its other role as a conference centre, the college is equipped with two auditoria that are available for student use during term; the smaller one being frequently used by the college&#x27;s film society and the larger by the &quot;Brickhouse Theatre Company&quot; (dramatic society). There is also a purpose-built party room that hosts college &quot;bops&quot; and other entertainment. Musical talents are catered for by a music room, CD library and chapel.

There are also several sports teams, covering most major sports: everything from water polo and cricket to rowing and rugby union. Robinson has become successful in hockey, winning the Cambridge colleges league and colleges Varsity match against Oriel College, Oxford, in 2009–2010, in addition to becoming mixed cuppers champions by beating Churchill College, Cambridge.

===College arms===
The arms of the College are described as follows: &quot;&#x27;Azure in base two Bars wavy Argent over all a Pegasus rampant Or gorged with a Crown rayonny Gules&quot;.&#x27;

===College grace===
The Latin grace is read before the start of formal hall.

&lt;br&gt;&quot;Lord, bless us and your gifts, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&quot;

<text>This is a table of selected pistol/submachine gun and rifle/machine gun cartridges by common name. Data values are the highest found for the cartridge, and might not occur in the same load (e.g. the highest muzzle energy might not be in the same load as the highest muzzle velocity, since the bullet weights can differ between loads).
== Legend ==
* Factory loadings. Number of manufacturers producing complete cartridges - e.g. Norma, RWS, Hornady, Winchester, Federal, Remington, Sellier &amp; Bellot, Prvi Partizan. May be none for obsolete and wildcat cartridges.
* H/R: Handgun (H) or rifle (R) - dominant usage of the cartridge (although several dual-purpose cartridges exist)
* Size: Metric size - may not be official
* MV: Muzzle velocity, in feet-per-second
* ME: Muzzle energy, in foot-pounds
* P: Momentum, in pound (force) (lbf) times seconds. A guide to the recoil from the cartridge, and an indicator of bullet penetration potential. The .30-06 Springfield (at 2.064 lbf-s) is considered the upper limit for tolerable recoil for inexperienced rifle shooters.
* Chg: Propellant charge, in grains
* Dia: Bullet diameter, in inches
* BC: Ballistic coefficient, G1 model
* L: Case length (mm)

<text>Cambridge University Library is the main research library of the University of Cambridge. It is the largest of over 100 libraries within the university. The library is a major scholarly resource for members of the University of Cambridge and external researchers. It is often referred to within the university as the UL. Thirty-three faculty and departmental libraries are associated with the University Library for the purpose of central governance and administration, forming &quot;Cambridge University Libraries&quot;.

Cambridge University Library is one of six legal deposit libraries under UK law. It holds about 9 million items (including maps and sheet music) and, through legal deposit, purchase and donation it receives around 100,000 items every year. The University Library is unique among the legal deposit libraries in keeping a large proportion of its material on open access and in allowing some categories of reader to borrow from its collections.

Its original location was the Old Schools near the Senate House until it outgrew the space there. A new library building was constructed in the 1930s. The library took over the site of a former military hospital on the western side of Cambridge city centre, now between Robinson College and the Memorial Court of Clare College. The current building, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, opened in 1934. The librarian, Jessica Gardner, is the second woman to hold this office.

== History ==
===The first library===

By the middle of the 14th century, the University of Cambridge owned a collection of books. These would have been kept in chests along with other valuables, rather than in a library building as would be recognised today.

A common university library can be traced to the beginning of the 15th century, with the first direct reference to a &#x27;library&#x27;. In March 1416, the will of William Loring was proved, which bequeathed three volumes to the library thus: &quot;&quot;Item volo quod omnes libri mei juris civilis remaneant in communi libraria scolarium universitatis Cantebrigg&#x27; in perpetuum&quot;.&quot; In the second decade of the 15th century, the library found a home on the newly built Old Schools site.

The earliest catalogue is dated , at which time there were 122 volumes in the library. The second earliest surviving catalogue was drawn up in 1473, and records 330 volumes. During the English Reformation, while there does not seem to be evidence of widespread destruction of books, as there was at Oxford, some books were certainly destroyed, and there were very few donations. King&#x27;s College received only one bequest between 1528 and 1568. From the 16th century, the library received generous donations or bequests of books and growth was considerably increased once the privilege of legal deposit had been granted. In 1648 the House of Commons ordered funds for the library.

The library&#x27;s space was greatly extended with the building of the Cockerell Building on Senate House Passage in 1837–42.

===The new library===
Following an initiative by A. F. Scholfield (librarian from 1923 to 1949), it was decided to build a larger facility. The site selected comprised the joint cricket field of King&#x27;s and Clare Colleges. During the First World War, a large part of the site had been requisitioned by the War Office to create the 1st Eastern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. The hospital had 1,700 beds at its height and treated some 70,000 casualties between 1914 and 1919.

The new University Library building was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, who also designed the neighbouring Clare Memorial Court (part of Clare College). It was constructed between 1931 and 1934. It is a Grade II listed building. Inside are a number of 17th and 18th century bookcases including those designed for the old University Library by James Essex in 1731–34. The funds for the new library were raised by colleges and from private donors. The American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller provided the largest part of the funds for the library&#x27;s construction. Sensing that it needed a grander entrance, Rockefeller persuaded the architect to add the distinctive front-facing tower. The tower can be seen for several miles around Cambridge. The bronze main entrance and the aluminium bronze screens to the reading room were made by H. H. Martyn &amp; Co.. 

The building bears a resemblance to Scott&#x27;s industrial architecture, including Bankside Power Station (now Tate Modern). The library tower stands tall, shorter than the top of St John&#x27;s College Chapel and taller than the peak of King&#x27;s College Chapel. Supposedly, in opening the building, Neville Chamberlain referred to it as &quot;this magnificent erection&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, pornographic material is not stored in the tower.

The library has been extended several times through ground annexes and underground extensions which allowed for new legal deposit documents to be stored. The main building houses the Japanese and Chinese collections in the Aoi Pavilion, an extension donated by Tadao Aoi and opened in 1998.

The University Library has also built a large storage facility in Ely which has more than 100 kilometres of shelving for future legal deposit books and periodicals. Work on a £17.1 million off-site facility to house the growing collection finished in 2018 and provides Cambridge University with one of the largest library storage buildings in the world.

== Legal deposit library ==
Cambridge University Library is one of the six legal deposit libraries under UK law, the others being the British Library, the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford, and the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Although the Irish Free State left the UK in 1922, Trinity College Dublin remains a UK deposit library and the UK libraries reciprocally retain deposit rights for Irish publications. As a legal deposit library, the University Library is entitled to claim without charge a copy of all books, journals, printed maps and music published in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This has contributed to the library&#x27;s large holdings of over seven million books and 1.5 million periodicals. Between 800 and 1200 books a week are received through legal deposit.

From 6 April 2013, legal deposit also covers material published digitally and online, so that the Legal Deposit libraries can provide a national archive of the UK&#x27;s non-print published material, such as websites, blogs and ejournals. Significant digitisation efforts continue as more manuscripts and early-modern books are acquired and scanned by the University of Cambridge.
== Access ==
The library is open to all members of the University of Cambridge. As is traditional among British university libraries, postgraduates and academics from other UK universities are allowed reference-only access to the library&#x27;s collection, and members of the public may apply for access to use the Library for reference if their research requires access to materials held there. Students and academics from other libraries and institutions must submit a request for access before using the facilities in Cambridge.

The library is unique among the UK&#x27;s legal deposit libraries in keeping a large proportion of its books on open access and in allowing some categories of reader (for example Cambridge academics, postgraduates and undergraduates) to borrow from its collection. It has a Tea Room in which meals, snacks and beverages are available. The library regularly puts on exhibitions, free to the public, and featuring items from its collections.

== Janus ==
In 2002, the library began a special project termed Janus (after the Roman god) to provide a single point of networked access to catalogues of archives and manuscript collections held throughout Cambridge. This is a major development for the Cambridge Universities Libraries, especially because Cambridge is home to more than 100 libraries and research institutes, each with their own mandate and organisational structure. A widening number of participating repositories, both University and non-University, are working together to provide comprehensive coverage of archives in the city and surrounding area. While it was running, Janus could be accessed by students and members of university both online and in-person.

At the beginning of March 2021, Janus was decommissioned and replaced by ArchiveSearch, an index of archives and finding aids for most of the archives in the city of Cambridge, including
* Cambridge University Libraries
* University faculties and museums
* The majority of the colleges of the University

== Historical Printing Room ==
 In addition to archives for some major figures in the history of typography and printing (Stanley Morison, Frances Meynell, etc), the Library hosts the Historical Printing Room.

In the early 1970s, Philip Gaskell as the Librarian of Trinity College set up a bibliographical teaching press similar to those at the Bodleian, University College London, and other institutions. The idea was to permit students to experience the historical process of letterpress printing themselves so they could better understand early book structure and the activities necessary to produce books. Classes began in 1974 and have continued to the present day.

Equipment in the HPR include Philip Gaskell&#x27;s own Albion iron hand press, a small etching press, paper moulds made for William Morris, and other equipment donated or loaned by Cambridge University Press. Research at the HPR is supported by significant archives at the CUL, including the Broxbourne collection of type specimens, the Chapbooks collection, and extensive archives of eminent printers.

== Digitisation project ==
In June 2010, Cambridge University announced that a £1.5 million donation would allow them to start digitising some of the collections in the University Library and eventually provide access to them free of charge over the Internet via the Cambridge Digital Library website. Initially the project will focus on two collections called &quot;The Foundations of Faith&quot; and &quot;The Foundations of Science&quot;, which includes writings by Isaac Newton and his contemporaries, as well as documents from the Library&#x27;s archives of Christian, Islamic and Jewish texts.

==Friends of the Cambridge University Library==
The Friends of the Cambridge University Library was established by a group of individuals, organisations and private donors who are committed to supporting the growth and development of the library. Members of the Friends regularly raise funds for future construction projects and archival restoration efforts, as well as the acquisition and purchase of rare books or manuscripts. Membership in the group is open to all alumni and members of the public interested in the preservation of knowledge and literature. Special events and tours are organised to recognise the contribution of the membership. The Friends of the Cambridge University Library has raised more than £150,000 through regular and special donations over the past five years.

== Staff ==

The official office of Librarian of the university was not established until 1577, when William James was appointed Librarian. The first set of regulations &quot;for the Office of keeping the Library&quot; were then formed in 1582. Little is known of the administration before the late sixteenth century. Before 1577, the University Chaplain had overall responsibility of the Library among other duties. Sixteen potential Chaplain-Librarians have been identified.

In 1721 the post of Principal Librarian (Protobibliothecarius) was created for Conyers Middleton &quot;as a mark of sympathy with him in his opposition to Richard Bentley&quot;. In 1828 this post was merged with that of Librarian (Bibliothecarius).

Various scholars have held the position. Abraham Wheelocke was librarian of the &quot;Public Library&quot; at Cambridge University, and was also Reader in Anglo-Saxon in the 17th century. Augustus Theodore Bartholomew was a librarian at Cambridge University for over 25 years. The classicist A. F. Scholfield was Librarian from 1923 to 1949. More recent University Librarians have included Eric Bertrand Ceadel, F. W. Ratcliffe (1980–94), Peter Fox (1994–2009) and Anne Jarvis (2009–16). Other notable members of staff include the bibliographer Henry Bradshaw and the Uranian poet Charles Edward Sayle, author of a history of the library.

The current librarian is Jessica Gardner. She joined the library in April 2017, becoming the 36th University Librarian.

== Exhibitions ==
The main University Library hosts exhibitions in its purpose-built Milstein Exhibition Centre. These change approximately every six to eight months and are open to all. Recent exhibitions have highlighted Cambridge&#x27;s significant collection of documents from the Cairo Genizah, the landscape and geology of the English Fenlands, and the architectural history of the Cambridge University. The exhibitions are sponsored by the Cambridge University Library and are organised by the team of librarians and leading academics in the field. Entry to the exhibitions is always free and open to the general public.

== Special collections ==
As part of its collection of more than 8,000,000 volumes, the library contains a wealth of printed and manuscript material from earlier times. This includes:

*A copy of the Gutenberg Bible from 1455, the earliest European example of a book produced using movable type.
*Library of Lord Acton, Catholic historian and Regius Professor of Modern History in 1885–1902. The extensive library (around 60 000 volumes) collected by Lord Acton for research was bequeathed to the University Library on his death. The collection contains books from the 15th to 19th centuries, with emphasis on European history and church history. Many of the books contain annotations in Lord Acton&#x27;s own hand.
*An archive of Charles Darwin&#x27;s correspondence and books from his working library (including copies of his own works). In November 2020, the library announced that two of Darwin&#x27;s notebooks had been lost, probably stolen, around December 2000. They were returned anonymously in 2022.
*The Hanson collection, containing important books on navigation and shipbuilding, as well as maritime atlases, some dating from the 16th century.
*The Bradshaw collection, containing more than 14 000 books relating to Ireland, printed in Ireland, or written by Irish authors. This is one of the most important collections of its kind in the world. The collection was formed by Henry Bradshaw, d. 1886. At present, the emphasis is on books printed in Ireland before 1850.
*The library of the typographer Stanley Morison, who had close links with Cambridge University Press.
*&quot;The Royal Library&quot;, an important collection of more than 30 000 books assembled by John Moore (1646–1714), Bishop of Ely. The collection was bequeathed to the University Library by George I in 1715, hence the name.
*The library of the Royal Commonwealth Society, containing books, periodicals, pamphlets, photographs and manuscripts relating to the British Empire and the Commonwealth.
*South Asian, Southeast Asian and Tibetan collections. 
*The Bible Society library and the library of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK).
*The Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection, a store of 140 000 manuscripts and manuscript fragments, mainly in Hebrew and Arabic, from the Ben Ezra synagogue in Cairo.
*Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, an important codex of the New Testament dating from the fifth century, written both in Greek and Latin. The Greek text is unique, with many interpolations found nowhere else. It was given to the University of Cambridge by the Protestant scholar Theodore Beza, friend and successor of Calvin; hence the name.
*Codex Zacynthius, a Greek New Testament codex dated paleographically to the 6th century CE.
*The Cambridge Songs (&quot;Carmina Cantabrigiensia&quot;), a collection of Goliardic medieval Latin poems, preserved on ten leaves of the Codex Cantabrigiensis.
*E.G. Browne&#x27;s collection of around 480 codices in Arabic, Persian and Turkish.
*Several composer archives: William Alwyn, Arthur Bliss, Roberto Gerhard, Peter Tranchell.
*Papers of Isaac Newton, Lord Kelvin, Ernest Rutherford, George Gabriel Stokes, Joseph Needham, G. E. Moore and Siegfried Sassoon, among others.
*Archives of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
*Material and archives of the University of Cambridge, from probates and graces to records of various student societies.
*Around 1.5 million maps.
