<text>Image Comics is an independent American comic book publisher and is the third largest direct market comic book and graphic novel publisher in the industry by market share. Its best-known publications include &quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;The Maxx&quot;, &quot;Savage Dragon&quot;, &quot;Bone&quot;, &quot;Saga&quot;, &quot;Radiant Black&quot; and &quot;Stray Dogs&quot;.

It was founded in 1992 by several high-profile illustrators as a venue for creator-owned properties, in which comics creators could publish material of their own creation without giving up the copyrights to those properties. Normally this is not the case in the work-for-hire-dominated American comics industry, where the legal author is a publisher, such as Marvel Comics or DC Comics, and the creator is an employee of that publisher. Its output was originally dominated by superhero and fantasy titles from the studios of the founding Image partners, but now includes comics in many genres by numerous independent creators.

==History==
===Founding===
In the early 1990s, artists Todd McFarlane, Rob Liefeld, and Jim Lee broke successive modern sales records at Marvel Comics with &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #1, &quot;X-Force&quot; #1, and &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 respectively. However, the creators became discontented. Liefeld worried that their success actually made their positions at Marvel precarious. &quot;We had become too big for the system,&quot; he said in 2000. &quot;Marvel didn&#x27;t want a star system.&quot; McFarlane and Lee, on the other hand, felt undervalued at Marvel, where they were not paid when their art was reused for merchandise such as t-shirts.

Malibu Comics agreed to publish a creator-owned title by Liefeld in 1991. In July that year he announced plans to publish an independent comic called &quot;Youngblood&quot; and in September advertised a title called &quot;The Executioners&quot; to be published by &quot;Image Comics.&quot; Although Liefeld shelved plans for &quot;The Executioners&quot; after Marvel threatened to both sue him and fire him from &quot;X-Force&quot; (the characters later appeared in &quot;Youngblood&quot; and their own title as &quot;The Berzerkers&quot;), the incident only further motivated him to pursue independent publishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executioners/Berzerkers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Liefeld soon invited &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; artist Erik Larsen, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; artist Jim Valentino, and McFarlane to join Image Comics. McFarlane then recruited Jim Lee at the Sotheby&#x27;s auction in New York in December 1991. &quot;Wolverine&quot; artist Marc Silvestri, who was also in town for the event, was also invited. Lee invited &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; artist Whilce Portacio shortly after. These seven creators became the original founding partners of Image Comics.

Image&#x27;s organizing charter had two key provisions:
* Image would not own any creator&#x27;s work; the creator would. Image itself would own no intellectual property except the company trademarks: its name and its logo.
* No Image partner would interfere—creatively or financially—with any other partner&#x27;s work.

===Early years===
The founders&#x27; initial titles were produced under the Image name, but published through Malibu Comics, which provided administrative, production, distribution and marketing support.

The first Image comic published was Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 in April 1992. Pre-orders for the book reached 930,000 copies, beating the previous record for both the top selling creator-owned comic and top selling independent comic of all time. The second Image title, McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot; #1, debuted with a print run of 1.7 million copies in May 1992. Larsen&#x27;s &quot;The Savage Dragon&quot;, Lee&#x27;s &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot;, Valentino&#x27;s &quot;ShadowHawk&quot;, and Silvestri&#x27;s &quot;CyberForce&quot; followed, all with strong sales to comic shops.

Within a few months, Malibu had almost 10% of the North American comics market share thanks to Image, briefly exceeding that of industry giant DC Comics. In early 1993 Image left Malibu and established itself as an independent company, hiring Tony Lobito as full-time publisher. Image became the first publishing company to challenge Marvel and DC&#x27;s dominance since the establishment of the direct market.

Portacio was the only founder not to deliver the first issue of his own series in 1992. Initially, Portacio was reported to be working on a title called Huntsman with Chris Claremont, but opted instead to create his own title called &quot;Wetworks&quot; (the Huntsman character later appeared in issues of &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot; and &quot;CyberForce&quot; written by Claremont). However, work on the series was significantly delayed due to the death of Portacio&#x27;s sister and he decided to resign as an Image partner. In 2022, former &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; artist Dale Keown said that he was approached in 1992 about taking Portacio&#x27;s place, but declined because his criminal record made it difficult to travel outside his home country of Canada. Keown still became the first non-founder to publish a creator-owned title with Image. The first issue of his series &quot;Pitt&quot; sold more than one million copies to comic shops. It was originally scheduled for November 1992 but shipped several months late.

Image continued to expand in 1993 with new titles from both founders, such as Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;Bloodstrike&quot; and Lee&#x27;s &quot;StormWatch&quot;, and non-founders, including Sam Kieth&#x27;s &quot;The Maxx&quot;, Larry Stroman&#x27;s &quot;Tribe&quot;, Keith Giffen&#x27;s &quot;Trencher&quot;, and Mike Grell&#x27;s &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot;, and &quot;1963&quot; by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and Rick Vietch.&quot;Tribe&quot; became the largest-selling African-American-created comic, with more than one million copies sold to comic shops. Moore went on to work on several Image series, including &quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot;, &quot;The Maxx&quot;, and &quot;Supreme&quot;.

Also in 1993, Image and Valiant Comics began publishing the inter-company crossover &quot;Deathmate&quot;, which comics historian Jason Sacks described it as the first major comic universe crossover since the Marvel/DC crossover &quot;The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans&quot; was published in 1982.

Some of the founders&#x27; studios came to resemble separate publishers, each with several ongoing series set in a shared universe. The use of freelancers to write or illustrate series that were owned by the Image partners led to criticism that some of them had reproduced the very system they had rebelled against, but with them in charge instead of a corporation.

Many Image series quickly fell behind their intended publishing schedule (See &quot;Controversies&quot; below). In response, retailers cut orders to reduce their risk. In August 1993, Image cut back its line, citing lateness and a desire to focus on books by the founders. The company announced it had canceled &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot;, &quot;Stupid&quot;, &quot;Trencher&quot;, and &quot;Tribe&quot; and that several mini-series including &quot;1963&quot; and &quot;Pitt&quot; would not become ongoing series. Moore&#x27;s &quot;Enemies of Mankind&quot; and Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Big Guy&quot; were &quot;indefinitely postponed.&quot;

In late 1993, Image hired Larry Marder, an independent cartoonist and former marketer for Chicago comics retail chain Moondog, to act as &quot;executive director&quot; for the publisher, ranking above Lobito and reporting directly to the partners. McFarlane told &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; that the founders had ignored Lobito&#x27;s advice in the past, even when he was correct, because they didn&#x27;t have confidence in his guidance due to his age and relative inexperience.

Despite the scaleback in 1993, Image continued to publish creator-owned comics by a variety of creators. Though many Image titles sold more than 500,000 copies per issue in 1992 and 1993, by mid-1994 only the top-selling titles reached 250,000 in sales. Marder determined that Image needed to publish at least 30 comic books per month to stay in business. &quot;And if the partners did not provide those books, I had to get those books wherever I could find them,&quot; Marder explained in 2007. Titles added in the mid-1990s included &quot;Hellshock&quot; by Jae Lee, &quot;Groo&quot; by Sergio Aragonés, &quot;Bone&quot; by Jeff Smith, &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; by Colleen Doran, and &quot;Astro City&quot; by Kurt Busiek, Brent Anderson and Alex Ross. In 1996, Lee founded a new sub-imprint called Homage Comics under his WildStorm Studios label. Described as a &quot;home for creator-owned material as well as a safe haven from an increasingly challenging comic book market,&quot; the initial line-up consisted of &quot;Astro City&quot;, Terry Moore&#x27;s previously self-published &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot;, and a new title called &quot;Leave it to Chance&quot; by James Robinson and Paul Smith.

The Image founders also continued to produce new top-selling series, such as &quot;Gen13&quot; from WildStorm Studios in 1994, and &quot;Witchblade&quot; and &quot;The Darkness&quot; from Silvestri&#x27;s Top Cow Productions in 1995 and 1996 respectively. In 1998, WildStorm launched the commercially successful Cliffhanger sub-imprint to showcase created owned titles from a new generation of popular artists, starting with Humberto Ramos, J. Scott Campbell, Joe Madureira.

===Speculative bubble burst===

After a peak in early 1993, the comics market experienced a steep downturn as the speculative bubble burst. Around 20% of all comic book stores went out of business in 1993, industry analyst Mel Thompson estimated, compared to the typical attrition rate of around 10% in prior years. Many comics industry professionals blamed speculators for the market downturn, but many retailers cited Image&#x27;s erratic publishing record as a key cause of fiscal strain for stores.

Every single Image comic scheduled to ship in the first quarter of 1993 shipped late. In April 1993, only 15.3% of the company&#x27;s titles shipped on time, compared with 90.1% shipped on time by DC, 79.2% by Marvel, and 100% by Valiant. Some titles ended up shipping out of sequence. For example, the first issue of Liefeld&#x27;s on-going &quot;Brigade&quot; series shipped before the concluding issue of the &quot;Brigade&quot; limited series, and &quot;Spawn&quot; #21 shipped before issues #19 and #20. &quot;Deathmate Red,&quot; Liefeld&#x27;s portion of the inter-company crossover with Valiant Comics, became emblematic of Image&#x27;s problems. The book shipped four months late, well after the release of the series epilogue.

Retailers typically order comics two months in advance, on a non-returnable basis. Late books create cash flow issues for retailers, and in many cases, fans lost interest in late books by the time they shipped. Retailers estimated that late shipping could affect sales by as much as 60%, according to &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. Late books also make it harder for retailers to plan purchases, because they have to order the next issues in a series before they see how well the earlier issues sold. &quot;When books start shipping late, you end up ordering four, five, six issues before you see sales, and that&#x27;s where the greater danger is,&quot; Hanley&#x27;s Universe owner Jim Hanley told &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; in 1994.

Todd McFarlane told &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; that the blame for the market collapse should not be pinned entirely on Image. He argued that the company shared responsibility with other publishers, distributors, and retailers alike, saying that Image shipping books on time wouldn&#x27;t &quot;stop retailers from being stupid.&quot; In a &quot;Comics Retailer&quot; interview, McFarlane blamed the industry downturn on greed, saying he hoped that retailers who over-ordered popular titles, including Spawn, went bankrupt.

Based on public orders and shipping data, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; and Thompson concluded that because Image titles accounted for such a large percentage of both late books and dollars spent, the company was more culpable for the situation than the Image partners were willing to admit.

In 2007, comics journalist George Khoury wrote that Marvel&#x27;s decision to distribute its product exclusively through its own distribution subsidiary beginning in 1995 had a bigger long-term impact on the comics industry than Image&#x27;s business practices. Diamond Distributors founder Steve Geppi told Khoury that Image helped expand the market for comic books, and Mile High Comics proprietor Chuck Rozanski pointed to the return of Superman less than six months after the Death of Superman, as the moment the speculative bubble burst. Khoury concluded that everyone in the industry was to blame for the comics market crash, including publishers, speculators, readers, retailers, creators, and editors.

&quot;Many consider Deathmate the comic book that singlehandedly put an end to the industry&#x27;s prosperous times and the biggest reason why so many comic book stores closed its doors for good,&quot; comics historian Jason Sacks wrote in 2018. &quot;In truth, there was plenty of blame to go around.&quot;

===Partial break-up===
There were tensions between the Image Comics founders from the very beginning, according to Liefeld, as the founders competed with each other for sales and talent. Liefeld founded his own separate company, Maximum Press, in late 1994 largely in response to those tensions and a realization that he wouldn&#x27;t always be a part of Image, he told CBR in 2001. At the time Maximum Press was announced, he had described it as an imprint for non-superhero titles, such as the science fantasy &quot;Warchild&quot;.

Liefeld proposed a merger between his Extreme Studios imprint and Silvestri&#x27;s Top Cow imprint in 1996, according to Matt Hawkins, who worked for Liefeld&#x27;s studios from 1993 until 1998 and has been president of Silvestri&#x27;s Top Cow Productions since 1998. Hawkins said that when Liefeld realized that Silvestri was going to reject his offer, he decided instead to try to recruit some of Top Cow&#x27;s artists, including &quot;Witchblade&quot; artist Mike Turner. At one point Hawkins called Turner about working on an &quot;Avengelyne&quot; project for Maximum Press, but Silvestri took the phone and yelled at Hawkins.

Meanwhile, Liefeld moved some of his titles from Image Comics to Maximum Press, escalating tensions within the company. In the summer of 1996, shortly after the incident with Turner and Hawkins, Silvestri announced that he would leave Image Comics, citing irreconcilable differences with a then-unnamed Image partner.

Liefeld resigned from Image Comics in September 1996 shortly before a vote to force him out of the company. Silvestri reversed his plans to leave Image shortly after.

Liefeld filed suit against Image in October 1997 for wrongful termination and breach of contract for money he claimed was owed to him. Image countersued, claiming Liefeld had misused Image funds and staff resources for his Maximum Press titles and failed to repay an overpayment made by the company. The suits were settled in February 1997. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Marder and Valentino claimed Liefeld repaid the company the money he owed.

Liefeld later reconciled with the Image partners and returned to the company as a creator, as opposed to partner, in 2007.

Jim Lee sold WildStorm and its characters to DC Comics in 1998, citing a desire to exchange his responsibilities as a publisher for the opportunity to do more creative work.

===Diversification===

Image continued to branch out, adding titles such as Brian Michael Bendis&#x27;s &quot;Jinx&quot; and Matt Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Mage&quot; to the company&#x27;s line-up in 1997, while Valentino&#x27;s Shadowline imprint published more than 12 black and white titles, including his own &quot;A Touch of Silver&quot;, James A. Owen&#x27;s &quot;Starchild&quot;, Zander Cannon&#x27;s &quot;The Replacement God&quot;, Mike Baron&#x27;s &quot;The Badger&quot;, and Michael Avon Oeming&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;. Creators paid a flat fee of $2,000 to Image and $500 to Shadowline for administrative costs and kept all other proceeds from their sales, as well as all intellectual property rights.

After Marder left Image in 1999 to help run McFarlane Toys, Valentino was named the company&#x27;s publisher. He later said he saw his time as publisher as an extension of what he had been doing with Shadowline. He is often credited for making Image Comics into the diverse publisher that it is seen as today. Sacks wrote that by the end of 1999, Image had bolstered its reputation &quot;as the place to find the highest quality creator-owned material.&quot;

In the early 2000s, a number of imprints not owned by the Image partners began publishing licensed material through Image. Devil&#x27;s Due launched a new &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; series via Image in 2001, MVCreations launched a new &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; series in 2002, Udon Entertainment began publishing a series based on the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game franchise in 2003, and the imprint DB Productions began publishing an adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot;, also in 2003.

Image Comics hired Eric Stephenson, who had worked as an editor and writer for Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios in the early days of Image, as marketing director in 2002. In 2003, Image published Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore&#x27;s zombie comic &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, which went on to become one of the top-selling comics on the market. Valentino originally rejected the title, fearing the premise was too familiar. Kirkman lied and said he planned to reveal that the aliens were behind the zombies, a premise Stephenson found interesting enough to encourage Valentino to accept. Kirkman later admitted that he never planned to include aliens in the comic.

Other titles published during Valentino&#x27;s tenure include Kirkman and Cory Walker&#x27;s &quot;Invincible&quot;; Bendis&#x27;s &quot;Powers&quot;; Garth Ennis, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Amanda Conner&#x27;s &quot;The Pro&quot;; Jay Faerber&#x27;s Noble Causes, and Warren Ellis and Chris Weston&#x27;s &quot;Ministry of Space&quot;.

Image&#x27;s market share declined in the mid-2000s as the imprints Devil&#x27;s Due, Dreamwave Productions, MVCreations, Udon Entertainment, and DB Productions departed the company and Dark Horse Comics surpassed Image to become the third largest comic book publisher. Larsen took over as publisher in 2004, intending to publish more mainstream comics. Valentino returned to running the Shadowline imprint. Titles launched during Larsen&#x27;s tenure include Ellis and Ben Templesmith&#x27;s &quot;Fell&quot;; Casey and Tom Scioli&#x27;s &quot;Godland&quot;; Richard Starkings&#x27;s &quot;Elephantmen&quot;; Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie&#x27;s &quot;Phonogram&quot;; and &quot;The Sword&quot; by the Luna Brothers.

In 2007, Liefeld returned to Image as a creator, as opposed to partner, to publish a new &quot;Youngblood&quot; series written by Joe Casey with art by Derec Donovan and Val Staples. Liefeld credited Kirkman for bringing him back to Image.

Larsen stepped down as publisher to focus more on &quot;The Savage Dragon&quot; in July 2008 and Stephenson was promoted to the position.

===Eric Stephenson era===

In 2008, shortly after Stephenson&#x27;s appointment, Image added Kirkman as the company&#x27;s first new partner since its founding. Stephenson cited Kirkman&#x27;s commitment to publishing through Image and his strong vision as reasons for the decision. In 2010, Kirkman founded his own imprint called Skybound.

Under Stephenson, Image began to greatly expand both the types of comics it publishes and the types of creators drawn to the publisher, beginning a period of critical acclaim. An influx of Marvel- and DC-associated creators began publishing creator-owned work with them. &quot;The Beat&quot; named Stephenson the Comics Industry Person of the Year in 2012 for what editor-in-chief Heidi MacDonald described as Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;creative revitalization&quot; of Image. MacDonald cited the publication of &quot;Saga&quot; and other new titles from popular creators like Grant Morrison, Jonathan Hickman and Ed Brubaker, along with &quot;homegrown hits&quot; from Image like &quot;Chew&quot;, &quot;Mornings Glories&quot;, and &quot;Thief of Thieves&quot; and Stephenson&#x27;s own &quot;Nowhere Men&quot; among his accomplishments. &quot;Saga&quot; creator Brian K. Vaughan explained that while he loved the other companies he had worked with, he wanted to maintain 100% control over the series to ensure there would be no content restrictions or interference and Image may have been the only publisher that still offered a fully creator-owned contract.

Image&#x27;s sales grew significantly during this period to a market share of around 10% in 2015. Image was voted Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27; Publisher of the Year three years in a row between 2013 and 2015. By the company&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2017, the majority of titles Image published in a given month were not affiliated with the founding partners. Meanwhile, McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot; and related titles, his McFarlane Toys line, Silvestri&#x27;s Top Cow imprint and Kirkman&#x27;s various series remained a substantial segment of Image&#x27;s total sales. , McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot; and Larsen&#x27;s &quot;Savage Dragon&quot; were the longest-running creator-owned titles published by Image, with over 300 and 250 issues, respectively.

The company&#x27;s headquarters moved from Berkeley, California to Portland, Oregon in 2017. The following year, Stephenson became an Image partner, board member, and chief creative officer. Prior to Berkeley, its headquarters was located first in Anaheim, California and then in Oakland, California.

=== Staff unionization ===
In November 2021, members of the editorial, production, sales and accounting staff formed Comic Book Workers United (CBWU), a trade union affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. The union published nine goals, including salary and workload transparency, improving staff morale, and improving career mobility. Image did not voluntarily recognize the union. 

The unionization drive was met with praise from many industry professionals. However, the union&#x27;s ninth goal of establishing &quot;a collective voting option to immediately cancel publication of any title whose creator(s) have been found to have engaged in abuse, sexual assault, racism and xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, ableism, etc.” proved controversial. Vice reported that this goal was &quot;read as a demand for a censorious panel to ensure that upcoming comics adhere to diktats of political correctness.&quot; CBWU told Vice that the request was not an effort to dictate the content of Image publications, but to create a process to ensure a safe working environment.

The union was certified by a vote in January 2022, becoming the first of its kind in the American comics industry. Prior to the vote, most Image comics, apart from those published by Todd McFarlane Studios, included the names of Image staffers in the credits. After the vote, those names were removed from titles published under Valentino&#x27;s Shadowline imprint. CBWU filed suit against Image Comics in February 2022, alleging retaliation against union members and interference with bargaining efforts.

CBWU ratified their first union contract with Image Comics in March 2023. The union filed an additional lawsuit against Image Comics in May 2023, alleging further &quot;anti-union discrimination.&quot;

<text>Wildstorm Productions (stylized as WildStorm) is an American comic book imprint. Originally founded as an independent company established by Jim Lee under the name &quot;Aegis Entertainment&quot; and expanded in subsequent years by other creators, Wildstorm became a publishing imprint of DC Comics in 1998. Until it was shut down in 2010, the Wildstorm imprint remained editorially separate from DC Comics, with its main studio located in California. The imprint took its name from a portmanteau of the titles of the Jim Lee comic series &quot;WildC.A.T.S.&quot; and &quot;Stormwatch&quot;.

Its main fictional universe, the Wildstorm Universe, featured costumed heroes. Wildstorm maintained a number of its core titles from its early period, and continued to publish material expanding its core universe. Its main titles included &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot;, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, &quot;Gen13&quot;, &quot;Wetworks&quot;, and &quot;The Authority&quot;; it also produced single-character-oriented series like &quot;Deathblow&quot; and &quot;Midnighter&quot;, and published secondary titles like &quot;Welcome to Tranquility&quot;.

Wildstorm also published creator-owned material, and licensed properties from other companies, covering a wide variety of genres. Its creator-owned titles included &quot;Red Menace&quot;, &quot;A God Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, while its licensed titles included &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot;, the &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; game, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and the &quot;God of War&quot; video game series.

DC shut down the Wildstorm imprint in December 2010. In September 2011, the company relaunched its entire superhero line with a rebooted continuity in an initiative known as The New 52, which included Wildstorm characters incorporated into that continuity with its long-standing DC characters.

In February 2017 Wildstorm was revived as a standalone universe with &quot;The Wild Storm&quot;, by writer Warren Ellis. However, the characters were reintroduced to DC continuity in 2021.

==History==
===Image Comics (1992–1997)===
Wildstorm, founded by Jim Lee and Brandon Choi, was one of the founding studios that formed Image Comics in 1992. Image grew out of Homage Studios and was founded by artists Whilce Portacio, Jim Lee, Erik Larsen, Rob Liefeld, Todd McFarlane, Marc Silvestri, and Jim Valentino in San Diego, California. All but Portacio decided to become full partners in the new firm. At the time, Lee and Portacio were recognized for their work on various X-Men titles at Marvel Comics.

In late 1992, penciller Marc Silvestri joined the studio to work on the first issue of &quot;Cyberforce&quot;. Although he worked at the studio, his projects would debut as the work of a new Image &quot;partner studio&quot; firm named Top Cow. Silvestri continued to work out of Wildstorm&#x27;s studio for about two years. Although WildStorm considered attracting talent, such as John Romita Jr., from the &quot;Big Two&quot;, (Marvel and DC), Lee decided to find new talent instead.

Lee&#x27;s talent search yielded Brett Booth in 1992, and J. Scott Campbell in 1993. Apart from McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot;, Wildstorm produced the most consistently, commercially successful comics from Image. These included Lee&#x27;s own titles &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; and the teen-hero title &quot;Gen13&quot;, illustrated by J. Scott Campbell. Like many other Image titles, some of the WildStorm titles suffered from inconsistent completion and shipping, resulting in &quot;monthly&quot; comics coming out every few months. This era produced a number of titles of varying popularity including &quot;Gen13&quot;, &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, &quot;Deathblow&quot;, &quot;Cybernary&quot;, and Whilce Portacio&#x27;s &quot;Wetworks&quot;.

In late 1993, Lee launched Wildstorm Productions as a sub-imprint of Image. He explained: &quot;During the startup of Image Comics, I incorporated my business activities under the name Aegis Entertainment. As Aegis grew and the marketplace changed, I decided a new name would more accurately define the nature of the titles we produce&quot;. In conjunction with the name change, former DC editor Bill Kaplan was brought in to oversee production and scheduling, in an effort to combat the studio&#x27;s problems with erratic publication schedules.

His attempts to get the studio&#x27;s characters into other media proved disappointing. A Saturday morning cartoon series of &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; lasted only a single season (1994–1995), while a full-length animated version of &quot;Gen13&quot; was produced but never released in the United States. Disney had acquired the domestic distribution rights, but shelved the product. Paramount had international distribution rights, and later released the film only in a few foreign markets. Toys from both titles were less successful than those made by Todd McFarlane, partly due to poor marketing and partly because the McFarlane toys were targeted at a more mature audience. However, they had a big success copying Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;&quot; with their introduction of the card game, &quot;&quot; produced between 1995 - 1997, which was later spun off into a crossover set of cards with Marvel. The crossover was the swan song for the Wildstorm game as Marvel&#x27;s merchandising clout succeeded in pushing Wildstorm&#x27;s out of the spotlight. Although the timing was right for their card game, they were too early by a year with a Pog game which used the WildC.A.T.s characters they released in 1993.

In 1995, Wildstorm created an imprint called Homage Comics, centered on more writer-driven books. The imprint started with Kurt Busiek&#x27;s &quot;Astro City&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Leave It to Chance&quot; (with Paul Smith), and Terry Moore&#x27;s &quot;Strangers In Paradise&quot;. Subsequently, the imprint featured works by Sam Kieth, including &quot;The Maxx&quot;, &quot;Zero Girl&quot; and &quot;Four Women&quot;, three of Warren Ellis&#x27; pop-comics mini-series, &quot;Mek&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, and &quot;Reload&quot;, and Jeff Mariotte&#x27;s weird western &quot;Desperadoes&quot;.

In 1997, Cliffhanger debuted a line of creator-owned comic books which included such popular works as: J. Scott Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Danger Girl&quot;, Joe Madureira&#x27;s &quot;Battle Chasers&quot;, Humberto Ramos&#x27; &quot;Crimson&quot; and &quot;Out There&quot;, Joe Kelly and Chris Bachalo&#x27;s &quot;Steampunk&quot;, Kurt Busiek and Carlos Pacheco&#x27;s &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;, Busiek&#x27;s Astro City and Warren Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Two-Step&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Storm Warning&quot;.

1997 also saw a revamp of all the Wildstorm Universe titles, including comic-books by writers such as: Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, Adam Warren, Sean Phillips, and Joe Casey. After this revamp the new &quot;Wildcats&quot; series, &quot;Stormwatch&quot; and &quot;DV8&quot; took the places of the most popular and most commercially successful comics of the Wildstorm Universe. Wildstorm also made a presentation to Lucasfilm Ltd. in an attempt to obtain a license for the lucrative Star Wars license, but lost to the incumbent Dark Horse Comics.

===DC Comics first run (1998–2010)===

Due to declining sales across the U.S. comics industry, and his view that his role as publisher and growing family demands interfered with his role as an artist, Lee left Image Comics and sold WildStorm to DC Comics in late 1998, enabling him to focus once again on art. The deal went into effect in January 1999. DC hailed the decision as one that would &quot;strengthen both WildStorm&#x27;s ability to expand its editorial goals and diversifying DC&#x27;s output&quot;. WildStorm was editorially separate from DC Comics, and the two companies maintained offices on opposite coasts: Wildstorm in California, and DC in New York City. DC&#x27;s acquisition of WildStorm allowed their respective universes to co-exist, and characters from either universe could appear in the titles of either imprint.

In 1999, WildStorm launched several new titles, including &quot;The Authority&quot;, a dark and violent superhero comic whose characters fought dirty and had little regard for the rights and lives of their opponents; their only goal was to make the world a better place. Warren Ellis created &quot;The Authority&quot; as a successor to &quot;Stormwatch&quot;. He wrote its first twelve issues before handing the series over to Mark Millar. &quot;The Authority&quot; fused Silver Age superhero concepts with 1990s cynicism. In the 2004 Wildstorm crossover, &quot;Coup d&#x27;etat&quot;, the Authority takes control of the United States. Ellis and artist John Cassaday created &quot;Planetary&quot;, about &quot;explorers of the strange&quot;, an experiment that merged pop culture, comic book history and literary characters.

WildStorm launched a new imprint titled America&#x27;s Best Comics as a showcase for Alan Moore. The line includes the titles &quot;Promethea&quot;, &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Stories&quot;, &quot;Tom Strong&quot; and &quot;Top 10&quot;.

The studio launched &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; in 2001 as an experiment. By this time, WildStorm had become largely a &quot;mature readers&quot; imprint. Joe Casey continued writing &quot;Wildcats&quot;, retitling it &quot;Wildcats 3.0&quot; to reflect the shift in tone. The new version was penciled by Dustin Nguyen with inks by Richard Friend. &quot;Gen13&quot; was relaunched with a new first issue, written by X-Men&#x27;s Chris Claremont. A &quot;Gen13&quot; spinoff, &quot;21 Down&quot;, was written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. After the &quot;Point Blank&quot; mini-series, Ed Brubaker developed the same themes into the critically acclaimed &quot;Sleeper&quot;, set in the WildStorm universe.

In 2001 Warren Ellis began &quot;Global Frequency&quot;. The rights for &quot;Global Frequency&quot; were bought by Warner Bros. in 2004 and a pilot for a TV series for the WB Network was made. The pilot never aired and was not picked up as a series, although the pilot was later leaked on the internet. &quot;Stormwatch&quot; was relaunched as &quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot;, about a team of normal soldiers who combat rogue superheroes.

Robbie Morrison wrote a one-shot featuring the &quot;Authority&quot; characters, titled &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; (2003). It was serialized as a back-up story in the &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; titles. A new ongoing &quot;Authority&quot; series began the storyline of the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; crossover, which ran through &quot;Authority&quot;, &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot; and &quot;Wildcats 3.0.&quot;

Two &quot;Winter Special&quot; anthologies also came out. Most of the line, except &quot;Sleeper&quot;, were canceled two years after their introduction.

In 2004, WildStorm revamped its array of sub-imprints. The core titles were grouped into the &quot;WildStorm Universe&quot; imprint, the creator-owned properties became the &quot;WildStorm Signature Series&quot; imprint, and all the licensed properties remained under the &quot;WildStorm&quot; imprint.

Following &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, WildStorm published fewer WildStorm Universe titles, including &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Wildcats: Nemesis&quot;; &quot;Majestic&quot; was based on a character that had appeared in DC Comics Superman titles. In August 2006, WildStorm simplified its &quot;brand&quot; by returning all content to a single WildStorm imprint, and discarding the &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Signature Series&quot; imprints. In 2007, the WildStorm fictional universe became &quot;Earth-50&quot;, part of the DC Comics Multiverse.

In April 2008, Ben Abernathy announced that the events of &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; would segue into &quot;&quot;, a post-apocalyptic direction for the line. In July of the same year, Christos Gage and Neil Googe published a new &quot;WildCats: World&#x27;s End&quot; #1. There followed, in August 2008, a new &quot;Authority: World&#x27;s End&quot; #1 by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning with art by Simon Coleby, &quot;Gen13&quot; #21 by Scott Beatty with art by Mike Huddleson, and &quot;Stormwatch: PHD&quot; #13 by Ian Edginton with art by Leandro Fernández and Francisco Paronzini.

That same year, DC releaseld the crossover limited series DC/Wildstorm: DreamWar one of the earliest times where DC and WildStorm characters would appear together. The six-issue comic book limited series was written by Keith Giffen, drawn by Lee Garbett, and published by DC Comics.

The &quot;Stormwatch: PHD&quot; title ended in November 2009. The remaining series each received another creative-team shake-up as 2010 began: February&#x27;s &quot;The Authority&quot; #18 by Marc Bernardin and Adam Freeman with art by Al Barrionuevo, &quot;Wildcats&quot; #19 by Adam Beechen with art by Tim Seeley and Ryan Winn, and April&#x27;s &quot;Gen13&quot; #35 by Phil Hester and art by Cruddie Torian.

WildStorm varied its publishing with licensed properties, such as: &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, and &quot;God of War&quot;. WildStorm has also published original graphic novels from writers Kevin J. Anderson, John Ridley and David Brin.

The imprint was shut down in December 2010, with &quot;Wildcats&quot; (vol. 5) #30 as its last issue, although DC Comics announced that the characters would reappear some time in the future.

DC Comics relaunched its DC Universe imprint in September 2011, which included the integration of the WildStorm characters into the DC Universe. The initial wave of relaunched titles included: &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Grifter&quot; solo series, a revived &quot;Stormwatch&quot; title featuring Jack Hawksmoor, Midnighter, Apollo, the Engineer, and Jenny Quantum, and a revived version of Team 7 with non-WildStorm characters Deathstroke, Amanda Waller and Black Canary. The &quot;Teen Titans&quot; spin-off title &quot;The Ravagers&quot; featured Caitlin Fairchild and Warblade as part of the cast, while &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; villain Helspont appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #7 and #8, Grunge appeared in &quot;Superboy&quot; #8, Zealot appeared in &quot;Deathstroke&quot; #9, and Spartan appeared in &quot;Team 7&quot; #5. Midnighter was a recurring character in &quot;Grayson&quot;, before spinning off into his own ongoing series. Midnighter and Apollo also appeared in a 6-issue miniseries, &quot;Midnighter and Apollo&quot;.

===DC Comics revival (2017–present)===
On February 16, 2017, Wildstorm was officially revived with &quot;The Wild Storm #1&quot; by Warren Ellis and Jon Davis-Hunt, a 24 issue series that re-imagined the Wildstorm Universe. On October 11, 2017, Wildstorm launched a second series under &quot;The Wild Storm&quot; banner with the 12 issue mini-series &quot;The Wild Storm: Michael Cray&quot; by Bryan Hill. Following the conclusion of &quot;The Wild Storm&quot; DC Comics announced that a new &quot;Wildcats&quot; six issue mini-series was to debut August 28, 2019, again penned by Ellis with art by Ramon Villalobos, but was cancelled in 2019.

Grifter, Apollo, and The Midnighter appeared in the alternate future timeline series &quot;Future State: Dark Detective&quot; in 2021. The Wildstorm characters were then officially reintroduced into DC Universe continuity later that year in &quot;Batman: Urban Legends&quot; #5 and &quot;Superman and The Authority&quot;. The new Authority team then appeared as supporting characters in the Superman crossover story arc Warworld Saga.

A 12 issue &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot; series by Matthew Rosenberg and Stephen Segovia ran from 2022 to 2023. The 2023 series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; features WildC.A.T.S member Zealot, and the new &quot;Outsiders&quot; series relaunches the Wildstorm title &quot;Planetary&quot; with a new version of the character The Drummer as well as the Authority&#x27;s sentient home The Carrier. The 2023 DC Black Label mini-series &quot;Waller vs. Wildstorm&quot; featured Wildstorm characters such as Team 7 and Stormwatch.

In 2023, James Gunn of DC Studios announced that a film based on &quot;The Authority&quot; was in development and would help form the basis of the new DCU. In November 2023, María Gabriela De Faría was cast to play The Engineer, a member of The Authority, in the forthcoming &quot;Superman&quot; film ahead of &quot;The Authority&quot; film.

<text>Tom Strong is an American comic book series created by writer Alan Moore and artist Chris Sprouse, initially published bi-monthly by America&#x27;s Best Comics, an imprint of DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm division. Tom Strong, the title character, is a &quot;science hero&quot;, with a wife, Dhalua, and a daughter, Tesla, both with enhanced physical and mental abilities and longevity. He lives in a building called The Stronghold in Millennium City. He is also helped by Pneuman, a steam-powered robot, and King Solomon, a gorilla with human characteristics. His greatest foe is tuxedo-clad &quot;science villain&quot; Paul Saveen. The series explores many different timelines and universes, which are a nod to different comic genres. The primary characters are tributes to and spoofs of early pulp heroes.

Spin-offs include &quot;Tom Strong&#x27;s Terrific Tales&quot;, &quot;Terra Obscura&quot;, and the one-shot &quot;The Many Worlds of Tesla Strong&quot;. A limited series titled &quot;Tom Strong and the Planet of Peril&quot; was published in 2013 by Vertigo.

Tom Strong appears in &quot;The Terrifics&quot;, a DC Comics series about a group of the same name formed by Mr. Terrific, Metamorpho, Plastic Man and Phantom Girl.

==Fictional character biography==
Tom is reared in a high-gravity chamber and given an intensive education by his eccentric scientist parents on the fictional West Indian island of Attabar Teru. His upbringing, plus ingesting a root used by the natives of the island for health and long life, makes him nearly physically and mentally perfect. Though born at the dawn of the 20th century, by the year 2000 he looks as if he is only in his 40s.

Tom Strong frequently has adventures alongside his younger self. There is also a parallel cartoon universe where a talking bunny is a version of Tom Strong, as well as a Western universe, and even &quot;Tom Teen&quot;, where characters are similar to those from Archie Comics.

==Powers and abilities==
Tom Strong has super-strength and is an inventive genius. Strong maintains his physical health and longevity through the regular consumption of a mysterious herb called Goloka Root. He is an explorer with vast personal wealth and has contributed greatly to the technology available in Millennium City.

* The &quot;ABC Preview&quot; was polybagged with Wizard magazine and this story (with art by Chris Sprouse) is the actual first appearance of Tom Strong and King Solomon, albeit in a one-page cameo.
* Tom Strong also makes an appearance in &quot;The Many Worlds of Tesla Strong&quot;, a 64-page story written by Peter Hogan with various artists (the above stories are collected in the &quot;America&#x27;s Best Comics&quot; trade-paperback).
* Promethea also has an appearance from Tom Strong, which is recounted from Strong&#x27;s perspective in issue #36.
* &quot;Tomorrow Stories Special&quot; #2 includes an &quot;America&#x27;s Best&quot; story, &quot;The Lethal Luck of the Magister Ludi&quot;.

* Tom Strong&#x27;s name is mentioned in &quot;Top 10: The Forty-Niners&quot; during an old World War II video as one of &#x27;America&#x27;s Science Heroes&#x27; who joined in the war effort to fight the Nazis.
* Tom Strong is featured as a recurring guest-star in the DC Comics series, &quot;The Terrifics&quot; (2018-2020).

==&quot;Tom Strong&#x27;s Terrific Tales&quot;==
Tom Strong&#x27;s Terrific Tales was an anthology spin-off from the parent title. It usually featured three regular stories in each issue:
* One story would usually focus on Tom Strong, or on one of his supporting cast, and be either experimental or humorous in tone.
* Another would be a &quot;Young Tom Strong&quot; tale (set during Strong&#x27;s formative years on Attabar Teru, and illustrated by Alan Weiss).
* A &quot;Jonni Future&quot; story (by Steve Moore and Art Adams) would often round out the issue.
The series ran for twelve issues, and would be sporadically published over the space of a couple of years. Stories of note include:
* A silent story in which Tesla steals the keys to the Hyper-Saucer and parties on another planet (art by Jaime Hernandez; appeared in issue #1)
* King Solomon in a solo adventure (by Leah Moore and Sergio Aragonés; appeared in issue #5)
* A prose history of Millennium City, with illustrations by Mike Kaluta (appeared in issue #9)
* Another silent story, with art by Peter Kuper (appeared in issue #10)
* A collaboration between Alan Moore and Peter Bagge, which recasts the Strong family in a milieu not unlike the one used by Bagge in his &quot;Buddy Bradley&quot; stories. This was printed in the final issue (#12), and features appearances by characters resembling Dick Tracy, Fred Flintstone and the Kool-Aid Man.

<doc id="237972" wikidata="Q457015" url="?curid=237972" title="Melinda Gebbie">
<text>Melinda Gebbie (born 1947) is an American comics artist and writer, known for her participation in the underground comix movement. She is also known for creating the controversial work &quot;Fresca Zizis&quot; and her contributions to &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix,&quot; as well as her work with her husband Alan Moore on the three-volume graphic novel &quot;Lost Girls&quot; and the &quot;Tomorrow Stories&quot; anthology series.

== Personal life ==
Melinda Gebbie was born in San Francisco. She became interested in comics in 1973, when she met writer/artist Lee Marrs at a publishers&#x27; fair. In 1984 Gebbie married Adam Cornford, a poet from California; their marriage was short-lived. Their marriage is believed to have been an inspiration for his poetry collection &quot;Animations&quot;. She married Alan Moore in 2007.

==Career==
Melinda Gebbie contributed her first comic strip to &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; #3, the inceptive all-women anthology published by Last Gasp. She wrote and drew short stories for &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; and many other anthologies, including &quot;Tits &amp; Clits Comix&quot;, &quot;Wet Satin&quot;, and &quot;Anarchy Comics&quot;. In 1977 she completed her own solo comic book, &quot;Fresca Zizis,&quot; which was later banned in Britain in 1985 for obscenity, and still is to this day.

In 1984, she moved to England to work on the animated film adaptation of Raymond Briggs&#x27; &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;. Following this, she worked in a variety of illustration and office jobs and continued making short stories for anthologies such as &quot;Strip AIDS&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. In the early 1990s, Alan Moore and Gebbie began collaborating on &quot;Lost Girls&quot;, a story in which the female protagonists of &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; meet and share sexual stories and experiences. Moore wrote the story, and Gebbie illustrated it. The story was finished in 2006. Meanwhile, she and Moore created Cobweb, a mysterious heroine who appeared in twelve issues of the Moore-written anthology &quot;Tomorrow Stories&quot; between 1999 and 2002.

=== Feminism in the Underground Comix Movement ===
Hilary Chute claims that the underground comix movement was parallel to second-wave feminism because it gave women comic artists the ability to establish work that was political and freely explore and publish their artistic expression. Autobiographical comics were popular among the underground comix industry due to groups of people being underrepresented in the mainstream comics industry. Although they were not completely autobiographical, comics like &quot;Tits &amp; Clits, Wimmen&#x27;s Comix,&quot; and &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; contained many stores that touched on the comic artists&#x27; personal experiences. Their stories discussed topics that were not represented in the male-dominated mainstream and underground comix, because it addressed women&#x27;s point of view on sex, masturbation, abuse, coming out, and menstruation. Many of the male anthologies created in the underground kept women from collaborating with them, which prompted the creation of all-girl collaborated comics like &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; and &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot;. Although the series of publication was not consistent, &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; published 17 issues from 1972 to 1992.

=== Fresca Zizis (Last Gasp, 1977) ===
In 1977, Melinda Gebbie produced her first solo work, &quot;Fresca Zizis&quot;. The title means &quot;fresh cocks&quot; in southern Italy dialect. During the 1980s, her comic book was banned in Britain for obscenity due to its pornographic illustrations. &quot;Fresca Zizis&quot; is semi-autobiographical and includes Gebbie&#x27;s past experiences with childhood abuse and sex, as well as portraits and stories of fellow cartoonist friends such as Trina Robbins and Lee Marrs. Gebbie describes that it &quot;deals with the cruelty of lovers, the excesses of youth, and the states of depression and dreams - a warning and a comfort to those who venture out too deep.&quot; When Gebbie was put on trial to defend the &#x27;obscenity&#x27; in her work, she explained that the illustrations from the comic book come from her own experiences and argued that the people who put her through those experiences should be seen as obscene rather than her work, which is portrayed in her comic called &#x27;Public Enemy&#x27; in &quot;Anarchy Comics&quot; issue #4.

=== Lost Girls (Top Shelf, 2006) ===
The graphic novel &quot;Lost Girls&quot; was illustrated by Gebbie and written by her husband Alan Moore. It took Gebbie 16 years to illustrate the comic due to the layering techniques used to create the shimmering, children&#x27;s book-like effect, which was done by her use of water colors and 12-14 layers of colored pencils. &quot;Lost Girls&quot; follows the story of three young girls that come from popular fiction; Alice from &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, Dorothy from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and Wendy from &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;. The three female protagonists meet at an Austrian hotel and share with each other their past sexual fantasies and experiences in flashbacks, while also meeting others who are staying at the hotel and having sex with them. The stories of each female protagonist&#x27;s sexual experience is integrated within their original narratives from popular fiction. Due to the Coroners and Justice Act, many comic artists thought the book would be banned in the UK because of its depictions of child pornography, however, it is still sold in the UK.

<text>Gangrene is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply. The feet and hands are most commonly affected. If the gangrene is caused by an infectious agent, it may present with a fever or sepsis.

Symptoms may include:

* a change in skin color to red or black
* numbness
* swelling
* pain
* skin breakdown
* coolness

Common risk factors include, but are not limited to, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, smoking, major trauma, alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, frostbite, influenza, dengue fever, malaria, chickenpox, plague, hypernatremia, radiation injuries, meningococcal disease, Group B streptococcal infection and Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome.

It can be classified as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangrene, internal gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis. The diagnosis of gangrene is based on history and physical examination and supported by tests such as medical imaging.

Main classifications:

* Dry Gangrene: A type of coagulative necrosis that is caused by lack of blood supply leading to ischemia and death of the tissue.
* Wet Gangrene: A type of liquefactive necrosis where the death of tissue due to lack of blood supply simultaneously occurring with a bacterial infection.
* Gas Gangrene: A type of liquefactive necrosis where the superimposed bacterial infection is caused by gas-producing bacteria such as some of the Clostridia.

Treatment may involve surgery to remove the dead tissue, antibiotics to treat any infection, and efforts to address the underlying cause. Surgical efforts may include debridement, amputation, or the use of maggot therapy. Efforts to treat the underlying cause may include operative procedures such as bypass surgery or endovascular interventions such as stenting or angioplasty. In certain cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful. How commonly the condition occurs is unknown.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of gangrene derives from the Latin word and from the Greek (γάγγραινα), which means &quot;putrefaction of tissues&quot;.

== Pathogenesis ==
Healthy cells maintain a balance called homeostasis, constantly adjusting to various stressors and stimuli from their environment. When a cell can&#x27;t adapt properly to these changes, it suffers a reversible injury. However, if the cell can&#x27;t return to its normal state and continues to be exposed to stress or damage, the injury becomes irreversible. This can eventually lead to cell death, either through necrosis (a pathological process) or apoptosis (often a normal, physiological process).

Necrosis is indeed an unregulated form of cell death, unlike apoptosis, which is a more controlled, programmed process. When tissues undergo necrosis, they swell, rupture, and release their contents, which can trigger inflammation and further tissue damage. When a large area of tissue is affected by necrosis, it can lead to gangrene. Gangrene itself happens when the tissue loses blood flow and becomes deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Without proper blood supply, cells in the affected area start dying, leading to decay. There are different types of gangrene, including dry, wet, and gas gangrene, depending on the underlying cause and the conditions of the tissue.

==Signs and symptoms==
=== Dry Gangrene ===

* Color Change: The affected area turns brown, then darkens to a black or purplish color.
* Dryness: The skin becomes dry and shriveled.
* Coldness: The affected area may feel cold to the touch.
* Loss of Sensation: Numbness or a loss of feeling in the affected area.
* Odor: Typically no odor, as there is no infection involved, but the tissue itself is dead.

=== Wet Gangrene ===

* Swelling: The affected area may become swollen and puffy.
* Foul Smell: A very distinct, unpleasant, and foul odor due to bacterial infection.
* Redness: The skin over the affected tissue may become red, inflamed, and hot.
* Pain: Severe pain in the affected area, which may eventually subside as the tissue dies.
* Blisters: Large, fluid-filled blisters may form over the tissue.
* Pus: The tissue may discharge pus if infected.
* Fever: Systemic symptoms such as fever may occur as the infection spreads.

=== Gas Gangrene ===

* Severe Pain: Sudden and severe pain at the site of infection.
* Gas Crepitus: A crackling sound or sensation under the skin, caused by gas bubbles produced by the infecting bacteria.
* Darkening of Skin: The skin may turn dark, often with a greenish or black tint.
* Swelling: Rapid swelling in the affected area, often with a rapid progression of tissue necrosis.
* Systemic Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia (increased heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and shock due to the spread of infection.
* Foul Odor: A distinctive, often sweet or rotten smell due to the gas produced by bacteria.

== Causes ==
Gangrene is caused by a critically insufficient blood supply (e.g., peripheral vascular disease) or infection. It is associated with diabetes and long-term tobacco smoking.

===Dry gangrene===
Dry gangrene is a form of coagulative necrosis that develops in ischemic tissue, where the blood supply is inadequate to keep tissue viable. It is not a disease itself, but a symptom of other diseases. The term &quot;dry&quot; is used only when referring to a limb or to the gut (in other locations, this same type of necrosis is called an infarction, such as myocardial infarction). Dry gangrene is often due to peripheral artery disease, but can be due to acute limb ischemia. As a result, people with atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, diabetes and smokers commonly have dry gangrene. The limited oxygen in the ischemic limb limits putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive. The affected part is dry, shrunken, and dark reddish-black. The line of separation usually brings about complete separation, with eventual falling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removed surgically, a process called autoamputation.

Dry gangrene is the result of chronic ischemia without infection. If ischemia is detected early, when ischemic wounds rather than gangrene are present, the process can be treated by revascularization (via vascular bypass or angioplasty). However, once gangrene has developed, the affected tissues are not salvageable. Because dry gangrene is not accompanied by infection, it is not as as gas gangrene or wet gangrene, both of which have a risk of sepsis. Over time, dry gangrene may develop into wet gangrene if an infection develops in the dead tissues.

Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, thus for dry gangrene, but also a risk factor for wet gangrene, particularly in patients with poorly controlled blood sugar levels, as elevated serum glucose creates a favorable environment for bacterial infection.

===Wet gangrene===

Wet, or infected, gangrene is characterized by thriving bacteria and has a poor prognosis (compared to dry gangrene) due to sepsis resulting from the free communication between infected fluid and circulatory fluid. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by saprogenic microorganisms (&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; or &quot;Bacillus fusiformis&quot;, for example), which cause tissue to swell and emit a foul odor. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood, which promotes the rapid growth of bacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbed, causing systemic manifestation of sepsis and finally death. The affected part is edematous, soft, putrid, rotten, and dark.

Because of the high mortality associated with infected gangrene (about 80% without treatment and 20% with treatment), an emergency salvage amputation, such as a guillotine amputation, is often needed to limit systemic effects of the infection. Such an amputation can be converted to a formal amputation, such as a below- or above-knee amputation.

===Gas gangrene===

Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produces gas within tissues. It can be caused by &quot;Clostridium&quot;, most commonly alpha toxin-producing &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, or various nonclostridial species. Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by the bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissue in the vicinity. Because of its ability to quickly spread to surrounding tissues, gas gangrene should be treated as a medical emergency.

Gas gangrene is caused by bacterial exotoxin-producing clostridial species, which are mostly found in soil, and other anaerobes such as &quot;Bacteroides&quot; and anaerobic streptococci. These environmental bacteria may enter the muscle through a wound and subsequently proliferate in necrotic tissue and secrete powerful toxins that destroy nearby tissue, generating gas at the same time. A gas composition of 5.9% hydrogen, 3.4% carbon dioxide, 74.5% nitrogen, and 16.1% oxygen was reported in one clinical case.

Gas gangrene can cause necrosis, gas production, and sepsis. Progression to toxemia and shock is often very rapid.

===Other types===
* Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection that spreads deep into the body along tissue planes. It is categorized into four subtypes, with the first two being the most common. Type 1 requires an infection with an anaerobe and a species in the Enterobacteriaceae family, while type 2 is characterized by infection with &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, a Gram-positive cocci bacteria, and thus is also known as hemolytic streptococcal gangrene.
* Noma is a gangrene of the face most often found in Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.
* Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis that usually affects the genitals and groin.
* Venous limb gangrene may be caused by Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.
* Severe mesenteric ischemia may result in gangrene of the small intestine.
* Severe ischemic colitis may result in gangrene of the large intestine.

==Treatment==
Treatment varies based on the severity and type of gangrene.

===Lifestyle===
Exercises like walking and massage therapy may be beneficial. It is also recommended to discontinue smoking, as this helps prevent further damage to the blood vessel walls and supports better blood flow. For patients experiencing claudication, exercise training programs that progressively increase in intensity are encouraged to promote blood flow to the lower extremities. Additional measures to prevent ischemic gangrene, particularly in cases of critical limb ischemia, include proper foot care—such as wearing well-fitting, protective shoes—and avoiding tight clothing that can restrict blood flow. For diabetic patients, adherence to their treatment plan is crucial, which includes consistent use of medication, a balanced diet to manage blood sugar levels, and daily foot inspections to monitor for wounds.

===Medication===

Medications may include pain management, medications that promote circulation in the circulatory system and antibiotics. Since gangrene is associated with periodic pain caused by too little blood flow, pain management is important so patients can continue doing exercises that promote circulation. Pain management medications can include opioids and opioid-like analgesics. Since gangrene is a result of ischemia, circulatory system management is important. These medications can include antiplatelet drug, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytics. Prevention and management of ischemic gangrene also includes maintaining normal blood pressure through use of anti-hypertensive medications such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. To prevent further blockage of blood vessels, treatment of co-morbid hypercholesterolemia through lipid-lowering medications such as statins is recommended. Pentoxifylline is a medication that is described to improve blood flow and tissue oxygenation, although its efficacy is unknown it has shown to boost excercise duration.

As infection is often associated with gangrene, antibiotics are often a critical component of its treatment. The life-threatening nature of gangrene requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics in an inpatient setting. Antibiotics alone are not effective because they may not penetrate infected tissues sufficiently. Antibiotic treatment of gas gangrene, except for C. &quot;tertium&quot; infections which is treated with vancomycin or metronidazole intravenously, is typically penicillin and clindamycin for about two weeks. For consideration, there has been noted resistance of clindamycin in C. &quot;perfringens&quot; infections in different parts of the world. In order to provide the most optimal treatment plan, microbiology susceptibility testing would provide additional information for the clinician in terms what antibiotics would work the best.

===Surgery===

Surgical removal of all dead tissue, however, is the mainstay of treatment for gangrene. Surgical inspection, blood cultures (to rule out bacteremia) and gram-staining for histopathologic examination is indicated of any patients suspected to have gas gangrene regardless of cause. Often, gangrene is associated with underlying infection, thus the gangrenous tissue must be debrided to hinder the spread of the associated infection. Delayed closure of wounds after debridement ensures that the site is clear of any infection. The extent of surgical debridement needed depends on the extent of the gangrene and may be limited to the removal of a finger, toe, or ear, but in severe cases may involve a limb amputation. Ischemic disease of the legs is the most common reason for amputations. In about a quarter of these cases, the other side requires amputation in the next three years.

Dead tissue alone does not require debridement, and in some cases, such as dry gangrene, the affected part falls off (autoamputates), making surgical removal unnecessary. Waiting for autoamputation, however, may cause health complications as well as decreased quality of life.

After the gangrene is treated with debridement and antibiotics, the underlying cause can be treated. In the case of gangrene due to critical limb ischemia, revascularization can be performed to treat the underlying peripheral underlateral artery disease. To prevent complications of gangrene from critical limb ischemia, revascularization procedures can be utilized for severely symptomatic patients that are refractory to medications. Angioplasty should be considered if severe blockage in lower leg vessels (tibial and peroneal artery) leads to gangrene. Additional revascularization procedures that are performed endovascularly include stenting and atherectomies to remove blockage. Surgical interventions available include different types of femoral bypass (such as femoral-popliteal, femoral-femoral, axillo-femoral, etc.) or aortoiliac endarterectomy, both aimed at restoring blood flow to the tissues of the lower extremities.

===Other===
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatment is used to treat gas gangrene. It increases pressure and oxygen content to allow blood to carry more oxygen to inhibit anaerobic organism growth and reproduction. Hyperbaric oxygen as a monotherapy is controversial in its lack of efficacy, surgery and antibiotic administrations remains to be the mainstay of treatment for gas gangrene. However, hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be utilized as an adjunctive treatment and may provide some benefit.

Regenerative medical treatments and stem-cell therapies have successfully altered gangrene and ulcer prognosis.

== Prognosis ==

=== Gas Gangrene ===
The prognosis of such a rapidly progressive disease requires timely diagnosis with prompt surgical debridement and administration of antibiotics. Gas gangrene that involves trunk or visceral organs compared to the extremities are typically harder to treat due to its locations making debridement difficult. If gas gangrene is left untreated, then it can progress to bacteremia and progress to death. Mortality rates are particularly high for patients that present with shock and those that present with spontaneous gas gangrene infected with C. &quot;septicum&quot;.

==History==

As early as 1028, flies and maggots were commonly used to treat chronic wounds or ulcers to prevent or arrest necrotic spread, as some species of maggots consume only dead flesh, leaving nearby living tissue unaffected. This practice largely died out after the introduction of antibiotics to the range of treatments for wounds. In recent times, however, maggot therapy has regained some credibility and is sometimes employed with great efficacy in cases of chronic tissue necrosis.

The French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully contracted gangrene in January 1687 when, while conducting a performance of his &quot;Te Deum&quot;, he stabbed his own toe with his pointed staff (which was used as a baton). The disease spread to his leg, but the composer refused to have his toe amputated, which eventually led to his death in March of that year.

French King Louis XIV died of gangrene in his leg on 1 September 1715, four days prior to his 77th birthday.

Sebald Justinus Brugmans, Professor at Leyden University, from 1795 on Director of the Medical Bureau of the Batavian Republic, and inspector-general of the French Imperial Military Health-Service in 1811, became a leading expert in the fight against hospital-gangrene and its prevention. He wrote a treatise on gangrene in 1814 in which he meticulously analyzed and explained the causes of this dreadful disease, which he was convinced was contagious. He completed his entry with a thorough evaluation of all possible and well experienced sanitary regulations. His work was very well received and was instrumental in convincing most later authors that gangrene was a contagious disease.

John M. Trombold wrote: &quot;Middleton Goldsmith, a surgeon in the Union Army during the American Civil War, meticulously studied hospital gangrene and developed a revolutionary treatment regimen. The cumulative Civil War hospital gangrene mortality was 45%. Goldsmith&#x27;s method, which he applied to over 330 cases, yielded a mortality under 3%.&quot; Goldsmith advocated the use of debridement and topical and injected bromide solutions on infected wounds to reduce the incidence and virulence of &quot;poisoned miasma&quot;. Copies of his book were issued to Union surgeons to encourage the use of his methods.

<doc id="237980" wikidata="Q598030" url="?curid=237980" title="George Caleb Bingham">
<text>George Caleb Bingham (March 20, 1811 – July 7, 1879) was an American artist, soldier and politician known in his lifetime as &quot;the Missouri Artist&quot;. Initially a Whig, he was elected as a delegate to the Missouri legislature before the American Civil War where he fought against the extension of slavery westward. During that war, although born in Virginia, Bingham was dedicated to the Union cause and became captain of a volunteer company which helped keep the state from joining the Confederacy, and then served four years as Missouri&#x27;s Treasurer. During his final years, Bingham held several offices in Kansas City, while also serving as Missouri&#x27;s Adjutant General. His paintings of American frontier life along the Missouri River exemplify the Luminist style.

==Early life and education==
Born on a farm in Augusta County, Virginia, George Caleb Bingham was the second of seven children that Mary Amend (1789–1851) bore with her husband Henry Vest Bingham (1784–1823). Upon their marriage, Mary&#x27;s father Matthias Amend gave the Binghams ownership of the family mill, land, and several slaves with the agreement that Matthias could live with the family for the rest of his life. Henry Bingham offered the land and mill as surety for a friend&#x27;s debt and, when the friend died in 1818, all was lost. In 1819, the Bingham family (including grandfather Amend) moved to Franklin, Missouri, on the Missouri River near the state&#x27;s center as well as the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe Trail, &quot;where the land was said to be bountiful, fertile and cheap.&quot;

George Bingham was initially educated by his mother, and self-taught as an artist. His sole childhood exposure to a working artist was as a nine-year-old boy, when famed American portraitist Chester Harding visited Franklin looking for business, having recently sketched Daniel Boone in Warren County, Missouri (Boone&#x27;s sons owned a salt spring and manufactured salt in Howard County). George assisted Harding during his brief stay, an experience that left a powerful impression.
On December 23, 1823, Bingham&#x27;s father Henry, who had initially opened a tavern in Franklin and in 1821 become the judge of the Howard County Court, died of malaria at the age of thirty-eight. His investment in a tobacco venture had failed, and debts forced the sale of the home in Franklin. The young sons barely kept their small farm in nearby Saline County afloat, in part with the help of their father&#x27;s brother John, who had moved to the area and donated half the land which became Arrow Rock. Mary Bingham opened a school for girls on the farmstead. George, then twelve, worked as the school janitor, and later received some art tutoring when the school hired Mattie Wood as an art teacher.

At age sixteen, the young Bingham was apprenticed to cabinet maker Jesse Green in nearby Boonville in Cooper County. After Green moved away (a major flood of the Missouri River having destroyed much of Franklin and other riverside towns in 1827), Bingham apprenticed with another cabinet maker, Justinian Williams. Both tradesmen were Methodist ministers. While under their tutelage, Bingham studied religious texts, preached at camp meetings and thought about becoming a minister in his Baptist Church (in which he would remain active throughout his life). He also considered becoming a lawyer. His elder brother Matthias Bingham would travel to Texas to fight for its independence in 1836, and remain in Mexico until his death in 1861, becoming a large landowner in the process but never marrying.

By age nineteen, Bingham was painting portraits for $20.00 apiece, often completing the works in a single day. He found clients in Howard and Saline counties and nearby areas. Though his painting abilities were still developing, he impressed his patrons by strong draftsmanship as well as his native ability to capture his subject&#x27;s likeness, and he was able to support himself by this work by 1833. Soon Bingham was ready to travel to St. Louis to ply his trade, but contracted measles. The illness left him weak and permanently bald.

By 1838, Bingham had established a studio in St. Louis, the state&#x27;s major city (Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River and nearer his home, was the state capital), and was beginning to make a name as a portrait artist. Several prominent local citizens visited his studio for portraits, including the lawyer James S. Rollins of Columbia, Missouri, who became a lifelong friend as well as a powerful politician in the state. While Bingham frequently worked in St. Louis, he kept his principal residence in Arrow Rock for years.

Bingham then decided to try formal education in the east, and moved with his young wife to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he spent three years studying art at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, including a trip to New York City to visit the National Academy of Design exhibition. Bingham then spent nearly five years in Washington, D.C., where he painted portraits of various politicians, including former president John Quincy Adams, who had become a member of Congress and famous abolitionist.

==Marriage and family==

In 1836, the year Missouri expanded with the Platte Purchase of former Native American territory (thus violating the Missouri Compromise of 1820 which had led to the state&#x27;s creation), 25-year-old Bingham married 18-year-old Sarah Elizabeth Hutchison (1818–1848), who bore him four children before her death. From 1837 to 1845 they lived in Arrow Rock in Saline County, where their house has been designated a National Historic Landmark. She died in 1848 at the age of twenty-nine. Bingham&#x27;s mother Mary helped him raise his children before she died in 1851.

Bingham married twice more, first to Eliza K. Thomas. After several years, she was confined to a mental asylum, where she died in 1876. He next married the widow Martha Lykins, a Kansas City community activist respected for her work among orphans (despite her Confederate activism years earlier), but their marriage lasted less than a year before Bingham died (Martha Lykins Bingham died in 1890).

==Career in St. Louis==
Bingham returned with his family to St. Louis permanently in 1845. Despite—or because of—his commercial success through the American Art Union based in New York (which distributed engravings of his &quot;Jolly Flatboatmen&quot; to 10,000 subscribers in 1847 and would purchase and distribute several more paintings in the next seven years), Bingham ran for election as a Whig to the Missouri House of Representatives the following year. He appeared to have won in 1846 by 3 votes, but lost in a recount. In a reprise of the election in 1848, Bingham won the seat by a decisive margin, becoming one of the few artists to serve in elected political office. He actively opposed the pro-slavery &quot;Jackson resolutions&quot; in 1849, although their proponent was also a resident of Saline County. He would also represent Missouri&#x27;s eighth district at the Whig National Convention in June 1852. Bingham&#x27;s political interests would be reflected in his vivid paintings of frontier political life.

In 1856, two years after the tumultuous creation of the Kansas Territory, Bingham traveled to Europe for an extensive tour with his second wife Eliza and youngest daughter. First they stayed in Paris for several months, where Bingham fulfilled a long-cherished desire and studied the Old Masters at the Louvre Museum, likely his chief reason for going abroad. They went on to Düsseldorf, Germany, where they lived until 1859, taking part in the Düsseldorf school of painting. Bingham lived and worked among the American and German artists of the art colony, among whom was the German-American Emanuel Leutze, the most prominent historical painter in the United States. (&quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; was then his most famous work.) Leutze was unusual for living in both countries and had an open studio in Düsseldorf, where he welcomed Bingham as a friend and already successful artist. While in Germany, Bingham worked on important commissions from the Missouri State Legislature of Presidents Washington and Jefferson (later destroyed by fire), as well as independent paintings.

==American Civil War==
Bingham returned to America after the death of his wife&#x27;s father in 1859. He continued to travel throughout Missouri seeking commissions, and again became involved in politics. In the 1860 election, Missourians had elected his one-time opponent, Democrat Claiborne Fox Jackson, governor in part because Jackson declared himself anti-secession. Abraham Lincoln had also been elected president and secession talk abounded. Upon taking office, Governor Jackson opened communications with Confederates, including Jefferson Davis, and sent the state national guard&#x27;s artillery pieces down the Mississippi River for Confederate service. Bingham, as a dedicated Union man, raised troops to oppose Jackson and his appointed ally, Major General Sterling Price, and was commissioned as a captain. Union forces routed the Confederates at Boonville on June 17 and again on September 13, 1861. Between those battles, the Missouri Convention met and almost unanimously declared itself against secession, then declared the governor&#x27;s position vacant and on July 28 elected Hamilton Gamble governor to replace Jackson. Jackson refused to accept his deposition, instead declaring Missouri a &quot;Free Republic&quot; on August 5 and traveling to Richmond, Virginia, to confer with Confederate officials.

In September 1861, Governor Gamble appointed Bingham State Treasurer of Missouri, and he served honestly and competently throughout the war. In 1863 Bingham vociferously opposed as inhumane Union General Ewing&#x27;s Order No. 11, which ordered the depopulation of Cass, Bates and Jackson Counties and part of Vernon County in western Missouri to limit support for Confederate partisans. Bingham believed many of the atrocities on the Kansas–Missouri border were in fact committed by pro-Union &quot;Jayhawkers&quot; with Ewing&#x27;s connivance. The order backfired by exacerbating resentments against occupying troops even by Union sympathizers (and later became the subject of a painting shown herein). Boonville also would be briefly occupied by Confederate troops on October 11, 1863, and again on October 11, 1864. Meanwhile, Bingham also continued to paint more portraits, which had always been his &quot;bread and butter&quot; work.

==Postwar career==

Although the Whig Party was nearly defunct by the time Bingham returned to Missouri, Bingham also returned to politics, and he would later align with the Democratic Party. He continued to stay involved in politics in the post-Civil War years through political appointments. In 1874, he was appointed president of Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, and appointed the first chief of police there. In 1875, the governor appointed Bingham as Adjutant-General of Missouri, so thereafter he was often referred to as &quot;General Bingham&quot;.

Toward the end of his life, although quite ill, Bingham was appointed the first Professor of Art at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, which his friend Major Rollins and the Rollins family helped found. He met with only a few students before his death; among them was Amanda Austin.

==Death, legacy and honors==

Bingham died on July 7, 1879, in Kansas City, Missouri. He was survived by his wife of less than a year, as well as his son by his second wife, (James) Rollins Bingham (1861–1910), who became a lawyer in Independence, Missouri. George Caleb Bingham was buried at Kansas City&#x27;s Union Cemetery.

The following year, Rollins Bingham hauled his father&#x27;s &quot;Order No. 11&quot; to Ohio and displayed it while opposing the gubernatorial run of its issuer, Gen. Thomas Ewing, Jr. (who lost the narrow race). Litigation concerning his late brother&#x27;s estate in Mexico would drag on for years, and upon his wife&#x27;s death, many of Bingham&#x27;s works would be sold and the proceeds funded the Confederate Veterans Home despite Bingham&#x27;s Union sympathies, although after her death her charitable work among orphans would continue under the auspices of the Little Sisters of the Poor.

As an artist, Bingham&#x27;s reputation languished by the turn of the century, but increased in 1933, long after his death. Fellow Missouri artist Thomas Hart Benton (great-grandnephew of the Missouri Senator and slaveowner whose refusal to support extending slavery westward in 1849 impacted both his and Bingham&#x27;s political careers) acknowledged Bingham, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought his early AAU work, &quot;Fur Traders Descending the Missouri&quot; described below. In 1934, the St. Louis Art Museum held a retrospective exhibition of his work, and others noticed his depictions of ordinary people from the middle of the previous century. However, by 1963, his gravestone had become defaced as that historic area of Kansas City deteriorated. Although activists restored Bingham&#x27;s former home in Arrow Rock as the George Caleb Bingham House (which ultimately was designated a National Historic Landmark), their plans to rebury him near his father, first wife and other kin were thwarted; Kansas City instead decided to fix its historic but decrepit cemetery.

By the time of his bicentennial in 2011, Bingham was considered one of the greatest American painters of the 19th century. That year the &quot;George Caleb Bingham Catalogue Raisonné Supplement Of Paintings &amp; Drawings&quot;—directed and edited by Bingham scholar Fred R. Kline—announced the authentication of ten recently discovered paintings by Bingham. As of June 2015, a total of twenty-three (23) newly discovered paintings by Bingham have been authenticated and are listed with the GCBCRS.

Honors also include:
* The University of Missouri has named the George Caleb Bingham Art Gallery in his honor.
* George Caleb Bingham Junior High School, in Kansas City, Missouri (no longer in operation), was named for him.
* George Caleb Bingham Middle School (Formerly George Caleb Bingham 7th Grade Center) in the Independence Public School District in Independence, Missouri, was named after him because he served on the Independence Public School District Board Of Education.

==Major works==

===&quot;Fur Traders Descending the Missouri&quot;===

One of Bingham&#x27;s most famous paintings, this work is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Painted around 1845 in the style called luminism by some historians of American art, it was originally entitled, &quot;French Trader, Half-breed Son&quot;. The American Art Union thought the title potentially controversial and renamed it when it was first exhibited. It reflected the reality of fur trappers and traders frequently marrying Native American women in their territories; in Canada the ethnic Métis people have been recognized by the government as a distinct group with status similar to First Nations. The painting is haunting for its evocation of an era in American history—note, in particular, the liberty cap worn by the older man. A bear cub seated at the end of the boat is secured by a chain.

===&quot;The Election Series&quot;===
Bingham&#x27;s &quot;Election Series&quot; comprises three paintings: &quot;The County Election&quot;, &quot;Stump Speaking&quot;, and &quot;The Verdict of the People&quot;. Bingham intended for the Election Series to reach a national audience rather than Missourians alone. To spread his idea of free people and free institutions, Bingham exhibited his paintings in Washington and urged the Library Committee of Congress to purchase them so American leaders could view them. When the Library Committee of Congress decided to not purchase his trio, he lent the paintings to the Mercantile Library Association in St. Louis.

====&quot;The County Election&quot;====

The first painting made for the Election Series shows the voting process in Missouri. &quot;The County Election&quot; depicts a variety of people from several different social classes, such as young boys playing a game, two men talking about the election happening around them, and a mass of men walking up the stairs to vote.
A banner shows the words, &quot;The Will of the People[,] The Supreme Law&quot;, a credo that had great meaning for Bingham. He believed that people had a right to share their ideas; he also believed that he lost his seat in legislature in 1846 due to the improper following of the people&#x27;s will. A mill in the background of the painting provided both a local detail and a reference to a Whig candidate who used a mill as a political symbol. The cedar barrels are evocative of a different Whig candidate who used cedar barrels as his political symbol. In his first painting of &quot;The County Election&quot;, Bingham showed two men flipping a coin beneath a judge. The two people represent ex-governor Marmaduke&#x27;s bet that he had placed on the election of Bingham versus his opponent, Erasmus Sappington (allegedly the man in the tall hat soliciting votes is Erasmus Sappington). Bingham also purposefully kept the scene outside to represent universal suffrage, one of his beliefs. The openness of the setting shows that politics should happen in the open rather than behind the curtains of the government. The idea of universal suffrage agrees with Bingham&#x27;s ideas of the will of the people: every white man should have the right to vote because the will of the people should be the supreme law. Allegedly Bingham is the man sitting on the courthouse steps

Though many people understood and supported the principles portrayed by Bingham, some believed that Bingham did not correctly portray his beliefs. A critic complained that the painting made a mockery of American principles by including details such as the drunkard voting in the foreground. The critic claimed that because Bingham had shown drinking and gambling as part of the election process, he was defaming the political process.

The reference to Marmaduke in &quot;The County Election&quot; was only relative to Missouri, so in order to generalize the message of the painting to the nation, Bingham removed the two men tossing a coin in the print version. In the corner of the original painting a newspaper title reads, &quot;The Missouri Republican&quot;; Bingham requested that the man who replicated his painting change the title to &quot;The National Intelligencer&quot; so that the painting would generalize to a larger audience.

====&quot;Stump Speaking&quot;====
In the second painting of the trio, &quot;Stump Speaking&quot;, a politician persuades Missourians to vote in his favor. Depicted are three figures that stand out because of their startling bright white clothing: the &quot;Stump Speaker&quot;, the &quot;Outstanding Citizen&quot; (the sitting man opposite of the speaker), and the &quot;Small Businessman&quot; (the young child in middle of the painting). Before the creation of the painting, Bingham had made preliminary sketches of the three aforementioned people, who represented Bingham&#x27;s belief of the past, present, and future of American politics. The &quot;Outstanding Citizen&quot;, as Bingham&#x27;s sketch refers to him, represents the past as the man&#x27;s sharp edges and fine clothes show how he is unwilling to bend his beliefs and instead works among the people. His sharp edges contrast with the softer curves of the &quot;Stump Speaker&quot;, the character that represents the present of American politics. The &quot;Stump Speaker&quot; appears to be swaying the assembled crowd by bending to the people&#x27;s desires, shown by the curving arm that is outstretched to the audience. The &quot;Small Businessman&quot; represents the future. That child shows how people are starting to focus more on their money, as the child is, and less on the politics, parallel to how the child is detached from the debate surrounding him. The three people represent &quot;the Jeffersonian past, of statesmen and gentlemen farmers; the Jacksonian present, of demagogues, party hacks, and gullible citizens; and a materialistic future of isolated citizens with no common public life at all.&quot;

Within Bingham&#x27;s painting &quot;Stump Speaking&quot;, he creates a scene that has both a national message and a local message; some of the people portrayed in the paintings resemble local Missouri politicians. Behind the speaker sits a man resembling Bingham&#x27;s self-portrait taking notes about the speech, waiting for his turn to speak. The &quot;Stump Speaker&quot; resembled Sappington, who was Bingham&#x27;s opponent in his previous elections, and the person sitting next to Bingham resembles the ex-governor of Missouri, Meredith Marmaduke.
The &quot;Outstanding Citizen&quot; is Claiborne Fox Jackson (who was the Confererate Governor of Missouri)

====&quot;The Verdict of the People&quot;====

The last painting of Bingham&#x27;s Election Series, &quot;The Verdict of the People&quot;, tells the end of the story represented in the series. Within this painting, Bingham hid several political motives and ideas similar to the rest of the Election Series. Completed in 1854, the work covered issues of slavery, temperance, and a representative government, subjects that had gone from a local to a national level. During the early 1850s, the temperance movement grew and more states were abolishing alcohol. A book by Herman Humphrey, titled &quot;Parallel between Intemperance and Slavery&quot;, associated the cause of anti-slavery to that of temperance. Bingham showed his view on intemperance and slavery by painting a banner that said, &quot;Freedom for Virtue[,] Restriction for Vice.&quot; The banner referred to temperance by saying that the vice and alcohol would need to be restricted for the people to be free. The banner then references Bingham&#x27;s ideas of slavery by using the connection of the temperance movement and the anti-slavery movement to show that Bingham thought negatively about slavery and shared that view with intemperance.

==Bingham Bicentennial 2011==
The &quot;George Caleb Bingham Catalogue Raisonné Supplement Of Paintings &amp; Drawings&quot; was begun in 2005, directed and edited by art historian Fred R. Kline with initial advisory board members Paul Nagel and William Kloss. At the Bingham Bicentennial, ten newly discovered paintings were announced by the GCBCRS; as of June 2015, the GCBCRS has added 23 paintings to Bingham&#x27;s body of work. The paintings exhibited, catalogued, and illustrated online include: &quot;Horse Thief&quot; (a political allegory posing the question of U.S. Constitutional law versus Vigilantism in the Western regions of the U.S.), &quot;Baiting the Hook&quot; (Bingham&#x27;s first river genre), &quot;Young Fisherman, Hudson River Palisades&quot; (Bingham&#x27;s only known Hudson River painting); and portraits including &quot;Colin Dunlop &amp; His Dog&quot;, &quot;Lewis Allen Dicken Crenshaw&quot;, &quot;Fanny Smith Crenshaw&quot;, &quot;Frederick Moss Prewitt&quot;, &quot;Civil War Lt. Col. Levi Pritchard&quot; (Bingham&#x27;s largest portrait at 80 inches high), &quot;Charles Chilton&quot;, &quot;Samuel Chilton&quot;, &quot;Thomas B. Hudson&quot;, &quot;Missouri Steamboat Capt. Joseph Kinney&quot; and &quot;Martha Lykins&quot;, a previously unidentified woman who has now been recognized as Bingham&#x27;s third wife, painted years before their marriage.

The GCBCRS is built upon and continues E. Maurice Bloch&#x27;s authoritative George Caleb Bingham Catalogue Raisonné of paintings and drawings, begun in the 1940s, which includes Bingham&#x27;s known paintings up to 1986 (Bloch died in 1989). All 23 paintings authenticated by the GCBCRS Committee were unknown to Bloch. Nearly all Bingham&#x27;s over 500 recorded paintings (460 are portraits) are unsigned, including famous ones such as &quot;Fur Traders Descending the Missouri&quot;, &quot;The Emigration of Daniel Boone&quot;, and &quot;The County Election&quot;. Bingham neglected record keeping and signing, allowing scores of paintings to remain unidentified. The GCBCRS is sponsored by Rachael Cozad Fine Art in Kansas City with publication in book form planned for the near future.

<text>Pamela Stephenson, Lady Connolly (born 4 December 1949) is a New Zealand-born psychologist, writer, actress and comedian. She moved with her family to Australia in 1953 and studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). After playing several stage and television roles, Stephenson emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1976.

Stephenson appeared in British television shows, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;New Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Professionals&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; before her breakthrough role alongside Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones in the satirical sketch show &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (1979–1982). In 1981, for her part in that series, Stephenson was shortlisted for BAFTAs in the Actress and Light Entertainment performance categories. She appeared in the films &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981) and &quot;SupermanIII&quot; (1983), and from 1984 to 1985, she was cast in season 10 of the American comedy-sketch television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Stephenson co-founded the protest group Parents for Safe Food, which successfully campaigned for a UK ban on the possibly carcinogenic plant growth regulator Alar being sprayed on apples and pears for human consumption. Since a career-change to clinical psychology and obtaining a doctorate, Stephenson has written several books, including two about her husband Billy Connolly. She has presented a psychology themed interview show called &quot;Shrink Rap&quot; (2007), and has written &quot;Head Case: Treat Yourself to Better Mental Health&quot; (2009) and &quot;Sex Life: How Our Sexual Encounters and Experiences Define Who We Are&quot; (2011). Since 2007, Stephenson has written a sexual-advice column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She was a finalist in the eighth series of the BBC television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2010. Her autobiography &quot;The Varnished Untruth&quot; was published in 2012.

==Early life==
Pamela Stephenson was born on 4 December 1949 in Takapuna, Auckland, New Zealand. In 1953, she moved to Australia with her scientist parents and her two sisters. She attended Boronia Park Primary School, Sydney, and then Sydney Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School, Darlinghurst. According to Stephenson&#x27;s autobiography, she was raped at age 16 by a 35-year-old heroin addict and contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI). She concealed the incident but when her parents learnt of her infection, they expelled her from the family home; according to Stephenson: &quot;I remember the feeling well, because I still experience it every time someone rejects me, even in some relatively small way&quot;. Stephenson studied at the University of New South Wales but soon switched to the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney.

==Performing career==
===Early career===
After graduating from NIDA in 1970, Edgar Metcalfe employed Stephenson on a six-month contract for the National Theatre Company, and she performed in six plays at The Playhouse Theatre, Perth, in 1971. Meanwhile, she appeared with Chips Rafferty in the short film &quot;Willy Willy&quot; (1970 or 1971). Subsequent theatre roles included a part in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; and June in the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;. Stephenson also appeared in the television programmes &quot;Division 4&quot;, &quot;Homicide&quot; and &quot;Matlock Police&quot;. She then starred in the film &quot;Private Collection&quot; (1973). Stephenson starred as Elsie in the ABC-TV production of the opera &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1972). From 1972 to 1973, she played Julie King in the Australian television series &quot;Ryan&quot; and in 1974, she played Josephine in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC) production of Malcolm Williamson&#x27;s opera &quot;The Violins of Saint-Jacques&quot;.

In 1976, Stephenson moved to the UK, where she worked in film and television; her roles included Michelle Osgood in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Catacombs of the Moon&quot; (1976); Wendy in &quot;New Avengers&quot; episode &quot;Angels of Death&quot; (1977); and a supporting role in &quot;Man from the South&quot;, the inaugural episode of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1979). Stephenson played three roles in the British crime-action television series &quot;The Professionals&quot; in 1978. According to media scholar Leon Hunt, a scene in which Stephenson plays a nurse from the inside of whose blouse one of the leads retrieves a live hand-grenade epitomises the programme. She also played a nurse in &quot;Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1977).

Among Stephenson&#x27;s first appearances in the UK was a live, on-stage role in &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; with leads Rik Mayall, Peter Richardson and Alexei Sayle at Raymond Revuebar in Soho. This was not a happy experience; according to an interview she gave in 2014: &quot;Doing stand-up was like a war with everyone playing this game of &#x27;I can be funnier than you&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;===

Stephenson gained prominence with her part in the UK sketch-comedy television show &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (1979–1982) alongside Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones. It was a satirical sketch show, influenced by the surreal humour of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. In &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic British TV&quot;, Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote Stephenson &quot;took up the punk ethic of outraging the audience with directness&quot;, and that &quot;most critics were united in their praise of Atkinson and Stephenson&quot;. Stephenson caricatured newsreaders Angela Rippon and Jan Leeming in the show. In one sketch, she parodied musician Kate Bush with a song called &quot;Oh England, My Leotard&quot;, which references Bush&#x27;s song &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot; and is musically similar to &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;. Bush&#x27;s biographer Graeme Thomson said the spoof has &quot;clever and very funny&quot; elements.

In one &quot;Not the&quot; &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; sketch that became famous, Stephenson played a car-rental receptionist who, when asked by a customer if he can use an American Express card, she replies: &quot;That will do nicely, sir, and would you like to rub my tits, too?&quot;, and unbuttons her blouse. The sketch satirises the slogan &quot;That&#x27;ll do nicely, sir&quot; the American Express company used in its advertising. According to a 2007 editorial in &quot;Art Monthly&quot;, this sketch &quot;perfectly captured the &#x27;greed is good&#x27; spirit of the 80s, the legacy of which is still being felt&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Simon Hoggart said the sketch is &quot;[not] exactly subversive&quot;.

&quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was awarded the Golden Rose for innovation at the 1980 Montreux Festival. It won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1981, and Stephenson was shortlisted in the performance categories Actress and Light Entertainment performance. Spin-offs from the show included books, record albums, and the stage show &quot;Not in Front of the Audience&quot;. Stephenson made a comedy-sketch television pilot called &quot;Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket&quot;, which was not taken up.

===1980s and 1990s===
Stephenson acted in Mel Brooks&#x27; comedy film &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981); she later said she found it a dull experience due the lack of influence she had over the production. In 1982, she starred in the West End production of Joseph Papp&#x27;s version of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; critic Irving Wardle wrote Stephenson &quot;reveals unsuspected coloratura powers as Mabel, but the part wastes her comic gift&quot;.

Stephenson appeared in the music video for Landscape&#x27;s single &quot;Norman Bates&quot; (1981); the video is a pastiche of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s movie &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) with Stephenson in the Janet Leigh role. Also in 1981, Stephenson appeared in performances of Clive James&#x27;s 2,000-line poem &quot;Charles Charming&#x27;s Challenges On The Pathway To The Throne&quot;, which he wrote in expectation of Prince Charles announcing his engagement. The poem was performed for a two-week run in London starting in June, with James, Stephenson and Russell Davies, and was and released as an album. The following year, Stephenson released a four-track double single; the tracks were written by Richard James Burgess and one featured Gary Kemp on guitar. Several regional newspapers poorly reviewed the single. Stephenson was the subject of an episode of &quot;Behind the Scenes with...&quot; (1981), a BBC1 series about the creative process. David Williams of &quot;Daily Post&quot; said the programme &quot;tarnished her image a little&quot;. In 1982, Stephenson was a guest on BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

Director Richard Lester called Stephenson for a part in &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983) on the basis of her performances in &quot;Not The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Her character was Lorelei Ambrosia, the Kant-reading girlfriend of the film&#x27;s antagonist Ross Webster. In the opening sequence, Ambrosia is the foil for a series of sight gags that reference Lester&#x27;s &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965); the character also has a love scene with Superman at the top of the Statue of Liberty. Joe Baltake of the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; rated Stephenson&#x27;s performance in the film as &quot;excellent&quot; and Steve Jensen highlighted praised her performance in &quot;The Berkeley Gazette&quot; but Colin Greenland of &quot;Imagine&quot; said she was &quot;completely wasted in a part which would have been too dumb for Goldie Hawn&quot;. Stephenson starred alongside John Gielgud and Robert Hays in &quot;Scandalous&quot; (1984), which Rob Cohen directed; critic Ben McCann said the film is &quot;notable only for wasting the talents of all concerned&quot;. Also in 1984, Stephenson appeared in the comedy horror film &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot;, which according to Barry Forshaw&#x27;s negative review in &quot;Starburst&quot; is a &quot;shameful waste of talented performers like Pamela Stephenson&quot;. Stephenson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; (1984) received mixed reviews; Andrew Yule, in his biography of the director Lester, praised &quot;a deft appearance by the wonderfully funny, ridiculously underrated Pamela Stephenson&quot; but in 1989, Jon Casimir wrote: &quot;As sure an indicator of imminent mediocrity as any, Pamela Stephenson is cast as a supporting actress&quot;.

In 1984–1985, Stephenson was cast in the 10th season of the American comedy sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL), making her the show&#x27;s second—and only female—cast member to be born outside North America, joining Tony Rosato, and , the show&#x27;s only New-Zealander cast member. Her characters on the show included Billy Idol and Cyndi Lauper. In a retrospective article about SNL in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob Sheffield described Stephenson as &quot;a bright spot in a weak season&quot;. In the UK in 1986, Stephenson hosted an episode of the television show &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. The same year, Stephenson appeared in the television drama &quot;Lost Empires&quot;; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critic Charles Clover called her was one of the positives in a dull series. In 1987, Stephenson appeared in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; with many other celebrities. She had leading parts in the black comedy film &quot;Those Dear Departed&quot; (1987) and the critically-panned and commercially unsuccessful film &quot;Les Patterson Saves the World&quot; (1987). She toured the one-woman theatre shows &quot;Naughty Night Nurses Without Panties Down Under&quot; (1985) and &quot;Scandalous Behaviour&quot; (1987).

Authors Mike Lepine and Mark Leigh, who had worked with Adrian Edmondson on the 1986 comedy book &quot;How to Be a Complete Bastard&quot;, approached Stephenson to collaborate on a companion volume &quot;How to Be a Complete Bitch&quot;, which was published in 1987. &quot;How to Be a Complete Bitch&quot; became a top-ten bestseller in the UK and sold over 300,000 copies by October that year. Stephenson told Candida Baker of &quot;The Age&quot; she was pleased the book was described as &quot;sexist, violent and crude&quot;. The book spawned an eponymous board game.

Stephenson made her radio acting debut in the BBC Radio 4 play &quot;The Spectre of Ernie Pike&quot; (1989). She presented &quot;Move Over Darling&quot; (1990), a series of five BBC television programmes about the role of women at work and at home; the show had an all-female editorial team with Janet Street-Porter as executive producer. In 1993, Stephenson hosted the Australian lifestyle programme &quot;Sex&quot;, which &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s critic criticised as being &quot;prurient&quot;.

==Psychology and writing==
According to her autobiography, after some years of consideration and having met all of her goals in comedy, Stephenson decided to switch to a career in psychology. In the early 1990s, after studying at Antioch University in the United States, Stephenson qualified as a clinical psychologist. In 1996, she obtained a doctorate in clinical psychology from the California Graduate Institute and set up a private practice. Her doctoral thesis topic was the &quot;intra-psychic experience of fame&quot;. With an interest in sex therapy, she co-founded the Los Angeles Sexuality Centre and became an adjunct professor at the California Graduate Institute. Stephenson&#x27;s research included an investigation into the lives of transgender people in Samoa, Tonga and India.

In 2002, Stephenson published &quot;Billy&quot;, a biography of her husband Billy Connolly, which &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; considered &quot;balances wifely affection with professional analysis&quot;. It was a best-seller in Britain. Two years later, she released &quot;Bravemouth&quot;, a diary-style book focusing on Connolly in the year following his sixtieth birthday. Robbie Hudson of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;insubstantial&quot; and &quot;syrupy&quot;, while &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; felt that, like the earlier book, it contained &quot;incisive revelations&quot;.

Starting in 2004, Stephenson took a year-long sailing voyage that followed a route Robert Louis Stevenson had taken; she wrote about the experience in &quot;Treasure Islands: Sailing the South Seas in the Wake of Fanny and Robert Louis Stevenson&quot; (2005). &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described the book as &quot;earnest and endearing&quot;, and said the illustrations &quot;help make this a dreamy, empowering retirement fantasy&quot;. The following year, Connolly travelled on her family&#x27;s boat to follow the South Pacific route her great-great-grandfather Samuel &quot;Salty Sam&quot; Stephenson took. The journey was documented in a four-part series shown on Sky Television and in her book &quot;Murder or Mutiny: Mystery, piracy and adventure in the Spice Islands&quot; (2006).

&quot;Shrink Rap&quot;, in which Stephenson conducted psychology-based interviews with celebrities including Salman Rushdie, Carrie Fisher and Robin Williams premiered on More4 in 2007. Her book &quot;Head Case: Treat Yourself to Better Mental Health&quot; was published that year, and was followed by &quot;Sex Life: How Our Sexual Encounters and Experiences Define Who We Are&quot; in 2011. Since 2007, Stephenson has written a weekly advice column called &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which she responds to reader-submitted sexual issues and scenarios. At a time when celebrities were being engaged to write advice columns, Stephenson was unusual in having a relevant qualification. Starting in 2009, she also wrote a relationships-advice column called &quot;Love Matters&quot; for &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. In 2009, she received an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University in recognition of &quot;her achievement in the field of human sexuality where she has made a marked, sustained and international contribution&quot;.

Stephenson competed in the eighth series of the BBC1 television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2010), in which she was partnered by James Jordan. They reached the final and finished third, and Stephenson returned to the show for the 2016 Christmas Special. Stephenson was a guest on the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Private Passions&quot; in 2010, where her music choices included pieces by Vincenzo Bellini, Erik Satie and Claude Debussy.

Her autobiography &quot;The Varnished Untruth: My Story&quot; was published in 2012. Lee Randall of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; described it as &quot;compelling and emotion-churning&quot;, and Jane Wheatley of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said there is plenty of &quot;humour and vivid anecdote&quot;, and that &quot;the real heft of this book and its leitmotif is Stephenson&#x27;s childhood experience of being rejected by her parents; a legacy that dogs her life to this day&quot;.

Stephenson formed a dance company with Brazilian lambazouk dancer Braz Dos Santos, and wrote and produced a dance-drama stage production called &quot;Brazouka&quot;. Harley Medcalf was lead producer and Arlene Phillips directed. The biographical show told the story of Dos Santos, who performed in the show, and his dancing. It premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2014 and toured South Africa and Australia until January 2015.

During a lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic of the early 2020s, Stephenson wrote &quot;Bum Farto – The Musical&quot; about the 1970s Florida fire chief Joseph &quot;Bum&quot; Farto. On the podcast Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend, Sarah Silverman revealed in 2023 that Pamela Stephenson was her therapist.

==Politics and activism==
At the 1987 United Kingdom general election, Stephenson was a candidate for the Blancmange Throwers Party in the parliamentary constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead; her campaign pledges included &quot;free blancmanges for pensioners and the unemployed&quot;. She finished with 328 votes, the fewest of all of the candidates.

Stephenson co-founded the pressure group Parents for Safe Food group after becoming concerned about the spraying of the plant-growth-regulating chemical daminozide (also known as &quot;Alar&quot;), which is believed to be carcinogenic, on apples and pears for human consumption. In 1989, she led a group of celebrity mothers who went to 10 Downing Street to hand in a petition calling for a ban on the use of daminozide that was addressed to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Use of the chemical to spray fruit was banned in the UK later that year; news sources attributed the ban to Stephenson&#x27;s group&#x27;s campaign. In 2010, Stephenson travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with the international medical-aid charity Medical Emergency Relief International (Merlin) to meet survivors of sexual-and-gender-based violence against women.

==Personal life==
In 1978, after filming an episode of &quot;Hazell&quot; with its star Nicholas Ball, Stephenson and Ball married. Stephenson converted to Buddhism in 1979, shortly before she joined the cast of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Stephenson left Ball to start a relationship with Billy Connolly, and she and Ball divorced in 1984. Connolly and Stephenson first met in 1979, when they filmed a sketch for &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and had lunch together. The following year, Stephenson and Connolly met again backstage at one of Connolly&#x27;s shows. The pair lived together for ten years before they married in Fiji on 20 December 1989; Stephenson was &quot;given away&quot; by the comedian Barry Humphries. The couple have three daughters together.

Stephenson and Connolly moved to Los Angeles in 1991, and later alternated between homes in New York and Scotland. In 2002, on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Devout Sceptics&quot;, Stephenson told Bel Mooney through Buddhism, &quot;I could at last feel I had begun life as a wonderful piece of creation, that a person doesn&#x27;t have to struggle every day to overcome darkness and sin&quot;.

Connolly was knighted in 2017, meaning Stephenson can formally style herself as Lady Connolly. As of September 2022, the couple lived in Key West, Florida.

<doc id="237992" wikidata="Q1546589" url="?curid=237992" title="Griff Rhys Jones">
<text>Griffith Rhys Jones (born 16 November 1953) is a Welsh actor, comedian, writer and television presenter. He starred in a number of television series with his comedy partner, Mel Smith. He and Smith came to national attention in the 1980s for their work in the BBC television comedy sketch shows &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;.

From 2008 to 2018, Jones presented the television bloopers show &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; for ITV, having replaced Denis Norden and being succeeded in 2018 by David Walliams.

==Early life and education==
Jones was born on 16 November 1953 in Cardiff, the son of Gwynneth Margaret (née Jones) and Elwyn Rhys Jones, a medical doctor. His family moved due to his father&#x27;s occupation to West Sussex when Jones was six months old. Jones attended Conifers Primary School in Midhurst, West Sussex, before his family moved to Epping, Essex. He attended a junior school in Epping, Essex, and Brentwood School, also in Essex.

After a short spell working as a petrol pump attendant, Jones gained a gap year job on the P&amp;O ship &quot;Uganda&quot;, working for a company organising school trips. In his autobiography, &quot;Semi-Detached&quot;, he describes how he was charged with helping to look after 600 Canadian schoolgirls, followed by a similar number of younger Scottish schoolchildren, and refers to the experience as being like &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s at sea&quot;. 

Jones initially read History, later changing to English, at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating with a 2:1.

==Career==
After Cambridge, Rhys Jones then joined BBC Radio Light Entertainment as a trainee producer, with his responsibilities including the satirical show &quot;Week Ending&quot; and &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;. He also appeared in 1974 in the Comedy series &quot;Oh no it isn&#x27;t !&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

Rhys Jones came in as a producer of Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s show &quot;The Atkinson People&quot; with Frankie Howerd, Clive Anderson and Rory McGrath, for the BBC and appeared twice on &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;

Rhys Jones filled in several minor roles in the first series of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, and was brought in as a regular cast member from the second series onwards, replacing Chris Langham. Rhys Jones says that the reason he got the part was not due to his appearance in the initial shows, or his talent, but because producer John Lloyd was dating his sister at the time. Rhys Jones became a regular from the commissioned second series.

Rhys Jones was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1984 for Best Comedy Performance in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; and in 1994 for Best Comedy Performance for his performance in &quot;An Absolute Turkey&quot;. He also played Toad in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; at the National Theatre in 1990, as well as several other theatre roles including Fagin in &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Harpagon in &quot;The Miser&quot;. at the Garrick Theatre. He provided the voices on the series of short cartoons &quot;Funnybones&quot;.

Rhys Jones has continued his acting career, being cast in &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; as well as starring in Russell T Davies&#x27; drama series &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; on ITV. &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; returned with Rhys Jones as the new presenter, taking over from Denis Norden. The first programme with Rhys Jones as host aired in 2008.

In January 2012, Rhys Jones returned to BBC sketch comedy &quot;The Ones&quot; alongside the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Tom Hollander and Larry Lamb, for one of a three-episode series in which comedy legends take to the stage for a mix of stand-up and sketches.

===Partnership with Mel Smith===
After &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, Mel Smith and Rhys Jones teamed up in 1984, and they appeared in the comedy sketch series &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;. (the show&#x27;s title being a pun on the American television series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;). After the first series, the two men appeared in Mike Hodges&#x27; science fiction comedy movie &quot;Morons from Outer Space&quot;. and then in 1989, the London Weekend Television production &quot;Wilt&quot;. Dressed as bobbies, in July 1985 Smith and Rhys Jones introduced Queen on stage at Live Aid.

Smith and Rhys Jones were reunited in March 2005, for a Comic Relief sketch. which led to a revival of their previous television series in &quot;The Smith and Jones Sketchbook&quot;. Their final television appearance together was a Head To Head routine for the special of 2012 &quot;The One Griff Rhys-Jones&quot;.

With Smith, he co-founded the television production company Talkback Productions, now part of RTL Group and later in 2005, he established the production company Modern Television. When Smith died in the summer of 2013, Rhys Jones wrote a piece about his comedy partner in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, saying it was &quot;sheer bliss&quot; to perform with Smith.

===Production companies===
In 1981, Rhys Jones along with Mel Smith founded Talkback, a production company which produced many British comedy series, including &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, &quot;QI&quot; and &quot;Big Train&quot;. 

In 2005, Rhys Jones created his own production company Modern Television, which has since made several productions with Rhys Jones as presenter and executive producer. 

In May 2014, Rhys Jones was executive producer on his production company&#x27;s debut BBC drama &quot;A Poet in New York&quot; starring Tom Hollander as Dylan Thomas.

===Documentaries===
Rhys Jones has developed a career as a television presenter, beginning as the co-host on several Comic Relief programmes. He presented &quot;Bookworm&quot; from 1994 to 2000, was the presenter of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Restoration&quot; programme and has undertaken fundraising work for the Hackney Empire theatre conservation project.

Since 2006, Rhys Jones has appeared in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; series, alongside Dara Ó Briain and Rory McGrath. The series has included the trio rowing the River Thames, as in the 1889 novel, sailing from London to the Isle of Wight for a sailing boat race, borrowing numerous vessels to make their way from Plymouth to the Isles of Scilly.

In later adventures, the three men took to the Irish Canals and Rivers on a trip from Dublin to Limerick (Dara&#x27;s Greyhound Snip Nua also tagged along for the trip), went to Scotland, and sailed along the Balkan coast ending up in Venice for a gondola race. His documentary series &quot;Mountain&quot;, for which he climbed 15 British peaks during 2006, was broadcast on BBC One 29 July–26 August 2007. Rhys Jones visited his mother&#x27;s home town in Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf for an episode of the BBC One series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast on 20 September 2007. In the episode, he detailed early memories and stories of his grandparents&#x27; fruit and vegetable shop on the high street and his mother&#x27;s childhood concert performances at Trerhondda Chapel. He presented a documentary series with 5 episodes &quot;A Pembrokeshire Farm&quot; which was broadcast on BBC4 in July/August 2007. Two years later he presented another 5 episode documentary series &quot;Return to a Pembrokeshire Farm&quot; which was broadcast on BBC4 in September/ October 2009. Both series concerned the renovation of a farm in Pembrokeshire which Rhys Jones had purchased intending to restore them.

===Writing===
Rhys Jones has written or co-written many of the programmes he has appeared in, and many spin-off books. In 2002, he began writing a book called &quot;To the Baltic with Bob&quot;, describing his adventures on the high seas with his sailing friend Bob, as they make their way to Saint Petersburg, port by port.The book was published in 2003, with Rhys Jones saying of the experience: &quot;As a child, you go out and play and you lose all track of time and space. It&#x27;s harder and harder to attain that blissful state of absorption as you get older. I did a six-month sailing trip to St Petersburg with some mates just to get it back.&quot;

His early life has been captured in his autobiography, &quot;Semi-Detached&quot;, published in 2006 by Penguin Books. His book to accompany the BBC One series &quot;Mountain&quot; was published in July 2007.

===Other work===
From 1999 to 2001, Rhys Jones featured in television adverts for the Vauxhall range of cars, as a &quot;boffin&quot;. In April 2001, he was dismissed by Vauxhall, after an embarrassing advert for the Vauxhall VX220. He officially signed the deal in May 1999.

Rhys Jones provided the voice-over for Brentwood School&#x27;s 450th anniversary DVD, reading a script written by fellow Old Brentwoodian Jonathan Ruffle.

Rhys Jones became President of The Victorian Society in February 2018, in succession to Asa Briggs, following a period as vice president from 2009, and has participated in media campaigns for the society. Since 2007, he has been a Vice-President of the River Stour Trust, a registered charity led by volunteers who are dedicated to the restoration and conservation of the River Stour Navigation for the benefit and enjoyment of the public.

In June 2008, it was announced that Rhys Jones was to become the President of Civic Voice, the nationwide charity that campaigns for better places in the built and green environment.

In August 2014, Rhys Jones was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Personal life==
Rhys Jones met his wife, Jo, a graphic designer, while working at the BBC. He described their first meeting by saying: &quot;The day we met, I was semi-naked and she was throwing water over me.&quot; The couple have two children and live between homes in London (previously in Islington, now in a Grade I listed house in London&#x27;s Fitzrovia in the West End) and Holbrook in Suffolk. Rhys Jones owned &quot;Undina&quot;, the , fifty-year-old wooden sailing yacht which was used in &quot;Three Men in Another Boat&quot;; he spent £500,000 on her restoration and in 2013 stated she was for sale for £195,000, &quot;probably less&quot;.

Around 2011, he bought a 1948 wooden yacht, &quot;Argyll&quot;, which he races at regattas, including the Fastnet Race. He and Jo are keen gardeners, and he discussed their extensive garden in an October 2015 episode of &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;, part of which was filmed there.

A former heavy drinker, Rhys Jones is a teetotaller: &quot;I don&#x27;t drink so going to a party can become very tedious. By about 11 o&#x27;clock, everybody goes to another planet and you&#x27;re not there with them, so I tend to avoid that sort of thing.&quot; He started running as a leisure pursuit in his early forties. In 2008, he presented two programmes called &quot;Losing It&quot; which were shown on BBC Two, in which he discussed his own problems with anger management.

An active conservationist, Rhys Jones is the president of Civic Voice, the national organisation representing Britain&#x27;s civic societies. He also owns a small herd of alpacas.

A resident of East Anglia, Rhys Jones was awarded an honorary degree by the University of East Anglia in 2002.

He was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Glamorgan, the University of Essex and an honorary D.Litt from Anglia Ruskin University. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, the Royal Society of Arts, and an Honorary Fellow of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 2009 he was honoured by his father&#x27;s former university, the University of Wales College of Medicine (now part of Cardiff University).

Rhys Jones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to the National Civic Society Movement, charity and entertainment.

<text>Christopher Langham (born 14 April 1949) is an English writer, actor, and comedian. He is known for playing the cabinet minister Hugh Abbot in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, and as presenter Roy Mallard in &quot;People Like Us&quot;, first on BBC Radio 4 and later on its transfer to television on BBC Two, where Mallard is almost entirely an unseen character. He subsequently created several spoof advertisements in the same vein. He also played similar unseen interviewers in an episode of the television series &quot;Happy Families&quot; and in the film &quot;The Big Tease&quot;. He is also known for his roles in the television series &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;Help&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, and as the gatehouse guard in &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot;. In 2006, he won BAFTA awards for &quot;The Thick of It&quot; and &quot;Help&quot;.

On 2 August 2007, Langham was found guilty of 15 charges of downloading and possessing level 5 child sexual abuse images and videos. Langham was jailed for ten months, which was later reduced to six months on appeal. He was made to sign the sex offenders&#x27; register and was banned from working with children for ten years.

== Early life and education==
Langham is the son of theatre director Michael Langham and actress Helen Burns. He was born in London and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, an independent school for boys in Barnes in West London, followed by the University of Bristol, where he studied English and Drama, before dropping out, after suffering a nervous breakdown when his parents split up.

== Early breakthrough and career ==

Langham began performing comedy and writing for Spike Milligan. One of his earliest breaks was as the sole British writer for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. He also appeared as the &quot;special guest star&quot; in the 19th episode of the final season, when the scheduled guest, Richard Pryor, was unable to make it to the recording; a script was hastily written in which &quot;Chris the Delivery Boy&quot; stood in for an absent celebrity. He received two awards from the Writers Guild of America for his work on &quot;The Muppet Show.&quot; He also made a brief appearance as a police driver in &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; in 1976, opposite Peter Sellers. In 1976 also was the inception, at the Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool, of the nine-hour stage play &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, which Langham co-wrote with Ken Campbell. In 1977, the production transferred to the Cottesloe Theatre, London, where he took the part of George Dorn, giving a performance which Peter Hall found &quot;extremely impressive&quot;.

Langham was part of the original cast for the pilot for &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in 1979, written by Richard Curtis. Even after the original pilot was pulled from the schedules, Langham was retained for the first full series, billed equally with the then-unknown Mel Smith, Pamela Stephenson, and Rowan Atkinson. The first series did not rate as well as hoped, however, and Langham was felt to be &quot;too independent a spirit.&quot; Langham took a part in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; as a centurion, a film which generated controversy for its satire of Christianity, resulting in a televised debate between John Cleese, Michael Palin, Malcolm Muggeridge, and Mervyn Stockwood over whether the film is blasphemous. Curtis had written a skit that parodied this debate itself. Langham was upset at the inclusion of the sketch, which gave the team and producer John Lloyd the excuse for his replacement by support player Griff Rhys Jones. Langham did not learn of the switch until the last day of filming, when he heard the crew discussing the second series. The show only achieved cult status during its later series, and in subsequent compilation repeats, most of Langham&#x27;s contributions have been cut, giving the impression that he was never a main cast member.

Langham went on to appear on Smith and Jones&#x27; own programme, &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;, playing an ineffectual panel-show host. This character apparently inspired John Morton to create the character of Roy Mallard, who was later to feature in his show &quot;People Like Us&quot;; Mallard was played both on radio and (offscreen) on television by Langham. Langham also played a fly-on-the-wall documentary interviewer very similar to Roy Mallard in &quot;Happy Families&quot; in 1985.

Also in 1979, Langham played Arthur Dent in the first professional stage version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, directed by Ken Campbell. He later returned to &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;, appearing as Prak in Above The Title Productions&#x27; &quot;Tertiary Phase&quot; radio series in 2004.

Langham narrated the 1984 radio series &quot;The History of Rock with Chris Langham&quot;, in which Langham gave a comedic and somewhat fictitious account of the history of rock music. On 14 November 1985, Langham appeared as the narrator/reporter in &quot;Roxanne&quot;, episode five of the BBC situation comedy &quot;Happy Families&quot;, written by Ben Elton. In 1992, he appeared in the film &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot;.

In addition to several one-man shows, Langham counts among his stage credits &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, in which he played Thénardier in 1996; &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, for which he received an Olivier nomination; &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, &quot;The Nerd&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. He created the comic role of the Assassin in &quot;Blondel&quot; (co-starring Paul Nicholas; by Tim Rice and Stephen Oliver), and appears on the original cast album.

== Later career ==

Langham wrote the BBC One sitcom &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, in which he appeared alongside Caroline Quentin and Amanda Holden. In 2002, he wrote and starred in &quot;Bradford in My Dreams&quot;, an adaptation of a short story by Lawrence Block for the BBC Three series Spine Chillers. On Radio 4, he narrated the series &quot;The Rapid Eye Movement&quot;, which starred Martin Freeman as Chester Beatty, in whose head the entire series took place. In 2003, he directed the BBC TV comedy series &quot;Posh Nosh.&quot;

In 2003 and 2005, respectively, he portrayed authors George Orwell and John Wyndham in the BBC docudrama &quot;George Orwell – A Life in Pictures&quot; and the BBC Four documentary &quot;John Wyndham: the Invisible Man of Science Fiction&quot;. He also appeared in the radio magazine satire &quot;The Sunday Format&quot;.

He starred alongside co-writer Paul Whitehouse in &quot;Help&quot; on BBC Two in 2005, where he also appeared in the Armando Iannucci comedy &quot;The Thick of It&quot; in the same year. Langham was named Best Comedy Actor in the 2005 British Comedy Awards and won the 2006 BAFTA Best Comedy Performance award for his role in &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. In November 2005, Langham wrote and starred in ITV pilot &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot;.

He was a frequent guest on &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot;. He was part of the writing team for &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;, in which he occasionally appeared as a civil servant discussing things with Bremner&#x27;s Tony Blair. Langham has appeared as a panelist on the Radio 4 show &quot;Armando Iannucci&#x27;s Charm Offensive.&quot;

== Arrest and conviction ==

On 29 November 2005, Langham was arrested by Kent Police in connection with Operation Ore, a British police operation into credit-card customers paying to access indecent and abusive images of children on the internet. The arrest was first reported in the press on 16 December 2005, in response to which Langham&#x27;s lawyer read a statement in which he said that he was innocent and pointed out that he had not been charged. On 11 May 2006, he was charged with 15 counts of downloading indecent images of children.

The trial took place at Maidstone Crown Court during July and August 2007. Part of Langham&#x27;s defence to these charges in court was that they were research on a peeping tom character &quot;Pedro&quot; for a television comedy. Langham&#x27;s former &quot;Help&quot; co-star/writer Paul Whitehouse confirmed that the character was referred to as a &quot;peeping tom&quot; who was prone to highly dubious sexual behaviour. Whitehouse stated that the character was not intended to be a paedophile, nor was he personally aware of Langham obtaining such material for the development of the programme&#x27;s script. The prosecutor, Richard Barraclough QC, asked Whitehouse, &quot;Did Mr Langham ever discuss with you that he was undertaking any research for the shows?&quot; &quot;Not to my knowledge, no,&quot; Whitehouse replied. Langham also said in court that he was the victim of child sexual abuse and this caused him to look for images; Barraclough called this &quot;pseudo-psychobabble&quot; and the judge dismissed its legality as a defence.
Langham had paid with his credit card for access to a site entitled &quot;European Lolita Sex&quot; in 1999. On the evening that the public was made aware of the scope of Operation Ore, Langham had contacted police to report his &quot;concern&quot; about spam emails, with links to paedophile sites, which he said he was receiving. The prosecution said that he had contacted police because he had &quot;panicked&quot; and &quot;wanted to give the impression of being a good citizen&quot;.

During his trial, he was also accused of having sex with an under-age girl in upmarket hotels, his West End dressing room, his car, and his home. The accuser claimed this had started when she was 14 years old. Langham denied the charges and claimed he had only had sex with her when she was 18. He was found not guilty of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of buggery between January 1996 and April 2000.

On 2 August 2007, Langham was convicted on charges of downloading child sexual abuse images and videos. He was sentenced to ten months in prison and was placed on the sexual offenders register for ten years. Before sentencing, the judge said that &quot;some of the children viewed are clearly prepubescent... The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK, with some serious sexual offences against her&quot;.

He was released on 14 November 2007, after his sentence was reduced to six months on appeal. Dame Heather Steel, who gave the decision, said that the court viewed Langham&#x27;s explanation that he viewed the child sexual abuse images for research as &quot;highly improbable&quot;, but could not reject it, although he was still guilty of encouraging &quot;despicable acts&quot; through downloading the images of child sexual abuse. On his release, Langham stated, &quot;My life has been ruined, but my conscience is clear&quot; and complained that the media &quot;completely ignored&quot; the court&#x27;s &quot;acceptance based upon all the evidence and expert opinion that I have no sexual interest in children&quot;. After the trial Detective Superintendent Paul Fotheringham of Kent Police told journalists, &quot;Langham doesn’t like the label, but I am satisfied that he is a paedophile&quot;.

== Career after release ==

A few days after his release from prison in 2008, Langham was interviewed by celebrity psychologist Pamela Connolly, with whom he had worked on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, for her UK television series &quot;Shrink Rap&quot;, where he claimed being abused as an eight-year-old child, events which he said led to his trial and conviction. The interview was broadcast on More4 on 15 January 2008. Langham was also invited to make a speech in front of the Oxford Union on 29 May 2008, but the invitation was then withdrawn.

Following his arrest, Langham said his life had &quot;completely fallen apart&quot;. &quot;Offers of work have almost entirely disappeared, at a time when I was looking forward to something of a golden year&quot;. In a later interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 2011, Langham stated that many people had suggested to him that he should work again, but no one wanted to employ him.

In 2011, in his first screen appearance after his release, he was cast as the lead in &quot;Black Pond&quot;, a low-budget British film directed by Tom Kingsley and Will Sharpe. The Kino Digital cinema in Hawkhurst had a screening of the film on 11 December 2011. Afterwards, Langham, who lived nearby, held a brief question-and-answer session to help promote the film.

In 2012, he appeared with Billy Murray, Leslie Grantham, and Crissy Rock in Richard John Taylor&#x27;s drama film &quot;Acceptance&quot;.

He had a small, non-speaking and uncredited role as a doctor, alongside Karl Johnson, in Armando Ianucci&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot;, which also features Paul Whitehouse.

Langham&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; episode was not made available on Disney+ when the series was added to the streaming service in 2021. Disney stated that most missing episodes and segments were due to music-rights issues, but refused to comment on Langham in particular.

== Personal life ==
Langham&#x27;s first marriage, to actress/singer Sue Jones-Davies, produced three children, but broke up on his own admission due to his alcoholism. Langham had two children by his second wife, director Christine Cartwright. As of 2011, Langham lived with his wife and two children in Cranbrook, Kent.

Langham sought counselling for alcohol and cocaine addiction, and was still undergoing therapy once a week as of 2006. He used his experiences to co-write the BBC2 series &quot;Help&quot;, in which he portrayed a psychotherapist, with friend Paul Whitehouse, and played a counsellor in sitcom &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;.

<text>Stay on These Roads is the third studio album by Norwegian band A-ha, released on 3 May 1988 by Warner Bros. Records. Six singles were released from the album.

==Recording==
A Synclavier, Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, Yamaha DX-7, Roland D-50, and Roland Juno-60 or Roland Juno-106 synthesizers were used in the recording of this album, as was a Yamaha RX-5 drum machine.

==Release and reception==

The album peaked at number 148 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was another big hit by A-ha internationally, selling over 4 million copies worldwide. &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot; achieved Platinum status in Brazil and Gold in the UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany and Double Platinum status in France. It reached number two in the European top-100 albums sales chart.

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic said &quot;in the U.K., the album became the group&#x27;s third straight to peak at number two, though it charted for a shorter period than the first two albums, and there were four Top 25 hits—the title track, &#x27;The Blood That Moves the Body,&#x27; &#x27;Touchy!,&#x27; and &#x27;You Are the One&#x27;.&quot; Also included was a re-recording of A-ha&#x27;s 1987 theme from the James Bond movie &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, which, in its single version, was a U.K. number five that missed the U.S. charts. In the positive review of the &quot;NME&quot;, David Quantick writes : &quot;Life is sad and so is Pal Waaktaar. Pal, writer or co-writer of all these songs, seems over-run by melancholy. His lyrics are about crying, going away and yearning, and even the happier songs seem riddled with resignation rather than out-and-out pop joy&quot;.

Lead single &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot;, number one in Norway, was a hit across Europe, including top-five showings in the UK, France, Austria and Ireland and top-ten chartings in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot; includes three more hit singles, &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot;, &quot;Touchy!&quot; and &quot;You Are the One&quot;, though a final single, &quot;There&#x27;s Never a Forever Thing&quot;, was released only in Brazil.

==Biography and fighting career==

===Muay Thai===

Samart Thipthamai was born December 5, 1962 in Chacherngsao, Thailand. 

He began training Muay Thai at 10 years old after being introduced by his older brother, Manus Thipthamai. His The First Muay Thai teacher of Payakaroon was Yodtong Senanan (Kru Tui) who taught both brothers. His first fight name was Lotus. After he fought about a dozen fights, he came to Bangkok to fight at Lumpinee Stadium in 1978.

He possessed an extremely high ring IQ, with lightning quick reflexes, and excellent ring vision. He also fought using creative techniques that were effective and unpredictable, even against elite competition in the 80s and 90s (dubbed the Golden Age of Muay Thai). There were contests where Payakaroon was pushed past the brink of exhaustion, and still gave his opponents the fight of their lives. Even in the period where he was more concerned about his music and acting career, he defeated some of the greatest fighters of his generation.

===Boxing===

In 1982, he turned to boxing where he fought from a southpaw stance. In 1986, he won a WBC junior featherweight title with a surprise KO over rock-chinned Lupe Pintor in the fifth round and defended against the respected Juan Meza before being stopped by undefeated Australian Jeff Fenech. He made a comeback in the 1990s and challenged unsuccessfully for another world title.

Payakaroon was named &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s Progress of the Year fighter for 1986. He now teaches Muay Thai and Boxing in Thailand.

His first name, Samart, translates to &quot;Capable&quot; in Thai and his last name, &quot;Payakaroon,&quot; translates to &quot;Dawn of the Tiger.&quot; This, in addition with his handsome appearance earned him the nickname &quot;Jade-faced Tiger.&quot;

<text>Augsburg University is a private university in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It was founded in 1869 as a Norwegian-American Lutheran seminary known as Augsburg Seminarium. Today, the university enrolls approximately 2,400 undergraduate and 700 graduate students.

==History==
Norwegian Lutherans founded Augsburg as a seminary. It was named after the Augsburg Confession of 1530, the primary confession of faith presented by Lutherans in Augsburg, Germany, and contained in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; of 1580. Augsburg Seminarium opened in September 1869, in Marshall, Wisconsin. Three years later, it moved to Minneapolis, changing its name to The Norwegian Danish Evangelical Lutheran Augsburg Seminary to reflect the name of the church body that sponsored the school. Undergraduate classes began in the fall of 1874, with the first class graduating in 1879. In 1892, the school&#x27;s name was shortened to Augsburg Seminary. In 1893, reacting to what it deemed overly hierarchical elements in the Norwegian church, Augsburg leaders organized the &quot;Friends of Augsburg&quot;, which by 1897 had coalesced to form a new Lutheran denomination, the Lutheran Free Church, a body that flourished for 70 years. During its early years the college and seminary served men only; women were first admitted in 1921. To further expand its mission, a high school level Augsburg Academy was provided on the campus. It closed in 1933.

Augsburg Seminary remained the school&#x27;s name until 1942, when it was officially changed and expanded to Augsburg College and Theological Seminary, a name that had been informally used since the 1910s. When the Lutheran Free Church merged with the much larger American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1963, Augsburg Seminary merged with the ALC&#x27;s Luther Theological Seminary, later renamed Luther Seminary. The name of the remaining undergraduate college became Augsburg College. In 2017, the name of the school officially became Augsburg University.

August Weenaas was Augsburg&#x27;s first president (1869–1876). Weenaas recruited two teachers from Norway—Sven Oftedal and Georg Sverdrup. These three men clearly articulated Augsburg&#x27;s mission: to educate Norwegian Lutherans to minister to immigrants and to provide such &quot;college&quot; studies as would prepare students for theological study.

In 1874, they proposed a three-part plan: first, train ministerial candidates; second, prepare future theological students; third, educate the farmer, worker, and businessman. The statement stressed that a good education is also practical. Augsburg&#x27;s next two presidents also emphatically rejected ivory tower concepts of education. This commitment to church and community has led to Augsburg&#x27;s theme of over 130 years: Education for Service.


This seminarian focus began to change after World War I. In 1911, George Sverdrup Jr. became president. He worked to develop college departments with an appeal to a broader range of students than just those intending to be ministers. In 1937, Augsburg elected Bernhard Christensen, an erudite and scholarly teacher, to be president (1938–1962). His involvement in ecumenical and civic circles made Augsburg a more visible part of church and city life. After World War II, Augsburg leaders made vigorous efforts to expand and improve academic offerings. By mid-century, the undergraduate college had become a larger part of the institution than the seminary and received the most attention.

As a result, Augsburg steadily added departments essential to a liberal arts college, offering a modern college program based on general education requirements and elective majors. Augsburg aims to reflect the commitment and dedication of its founders, who believed &quot;an Augsburg education should be preparation for service in community and church&quot; [by] &quot;Providing an education grounded in vocational calling, that provides students both the theoretical learning and the practical experience to succeed in a global, diverse world.&quot;

==Campus==

===Residence halls===
Urness Hall is the first-year building. It has nine floors of traditional-style residence hall rooms (plus two other floors), with one coed floor. Each floor is led by a resident advisor (RA). Mortensen Hall (known as Mort) is connected to the Urness Hall lobby and has 13 floors of apartment-style housing (eight apartments on every floor). It is the tallest building on campus. Mortensen Hall is named for Gerda Mortensen, Dean of Women at Augsburg University from 1923 to 1964. Anderson Hall is a four-story building with four different styles of housing: single-person suites, four-person apartments, eight-person townhomes (two floors), and 15-person floorhouses. Martin Luther Residence Hall (also known as Luther Hall) was built in 1999 using state funding. It was originally named New Hall because there was no major contributor to name the hall for. It got its current name on October 1, 2007, when the completion of the Oren Gateway Center made the old name misleading. Luther Hall has studios and two-bedroom and four-bedroom apartments. The apartments all consist of single- or double-person rooms and have a full kitchen. The Oren Gateway Center is a substance-free residence hall and houses students in the StepUP program and other students who choose sober living. It has rooms for 106 students and also contains six classrooms and an art gallery.

==Student life==

===Campus organizations===
Augsburg&#x27;s student body totals approximately 3,100 students from 36 states, more than 28 foreign countries, and 24 tribal nations/reservations. The on-campus diversity is enhanced by Augsburg&#x27;s location in Cedar-Riverside, the Twin Cities&#x27; most culturally diverse neighborhood, which has the nation&#x27;s largest concentration of Somali immigrants.

Augsburg students have opportunities for involvement in more than 70 clubs and organizations, including student academic societies, publications, student government, Multicultural Life student groups, on-campus radio station, religious/spiritual groups, and more.

====Queer Pride Alliance====
Known as &quot;Queer and Straight In Unity&quot; (QSU) until 2014, and originally incorporated as &quot;BAGLS&quot; in 1988, Queer Pride Alliance (QPA) is Augsburg&#x27;s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual support group. After the hostile campus environment towards LGBTQIA individuals culminated in several anti-LGBTQIA incidents in 2003, students occupied administrative offices to protest the university&#x27;s lack of action. In response, Augsburg established the GLBTQIA Student Services office (today known as the LGBTQIA Student Services office), which became the primary point of contact and support for QSU and the LGBTQIA student body. QPA is advised by the director of the LGBTQIA Student Services office, which jointly provides the campus community with workshops, performances, weekly group meetings, and speakers, as well as exposing students to the wider Midwestern LGBTQIA rights movement by sponsoring retreats and trips to conferences. Today, Augsburg is certified Reconciling in Christ by ReconcilingWorks, which means that in accordance with its theological values, it welcomes and actively affirms &quot;all people in regard to their gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation&quot;.
===Centers of Commitment===
Augsburg houses four Centers of Commitment that provide student services, academic opportunities, and co-curricular programming:
* The Clair and Gladys Strommen Center for Meaningful Work
* The Bernhard Christensen Center for Vocation
* The Center for Global Education and Experience
* The Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship

A fifth center, Interfaith at Augsburg, was established in 2019 to promote interreligious leadership on campus and nationally.

<text>The Rescuers Down Under is a 1990 American animated adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977). In &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, Bernard and Bianca travel to the Australian Outback to save a young boy named Cody from a villainous poacher who wants to capture an endangered golden eagle for money. Directed by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel from a screenplay by Jim Cox, Karey Kirkpatrick, Byron Simpson, and Joe Ranft, the film features the voices of Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor (in her final film role), John Candy, and George C. Scott.

By the mid-1980s, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; had become one of Disney&#x27;s most successful animated releases. Under the new management of Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, a feature-length sequel was approved, making it the first animated film sequel theatrically released by the studio. Following their duties on &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), animators Butoy and Gabriel were recruited to direct the sequel. Research trips to Australia provided inspiration for the background designs. The film would also mark the full use of the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), becoming the first feature film to be completely created digitally. The software allowed for artists to digitally ink-and-paint the animators&#x27; drawings, and then composite the digital cels over the scanned background art.

&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was released to theaters on November 16, 1990, to positive reviews from critics, but it went on to become a box-office bomb and garnered $47.4 million worldwide.

== Plot ==

In the Outback, a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends Marahute, a rare golden eagle, who shows Cody her nest and eggs and gives him one of her feathers. Cody later falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local poacher who killed Marahute&#x27;s mate and is wanted by the Australian Rangers, while rescuing a mouse who was the bait in the trap. Realizing Cody has Marahute&#x27;s feather and must know her location, McLeach kidnaps the boy and throws his backpack to a float of crocodiles. The Rangers find it and believe that Cody has been eaten.

The rescued mouse hurries to an RAS outpost shortly after Cody&#x27;s capture to inform the operator of the kidnapping, from which a telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in New York City. Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS&#x27; elite field agents, are assigned to the mission, interrupting Bernard&#x27;s attempts to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the albatross, who aided them before, but discover that he is no longer in service and his brother Wilbur has taken over for him. Despite the harsh winter conditions in the city, he agrees to fly them to Australia as he disapproves of child abduction. There, they meet Jake, a hopping mouse who is the RAS&#x27; local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and flirts with her, much to Bernard&#x27;s dismay. He serves as their &quot;tour guide&quot; and protector in search of the boy. Wilbur accidentally bends his spinal column out of shape trying to help them, so Jake sends him to the hospital (an old ambulance). Wilbur refuses to undergo surgery (due to the doctor planning to use dangerous tools, such as a chainsaw), but his back is straightened as he fights to escape the medical mice. He flies off in search of his friends.

At McLeach&#x27;s hideout, Cody refuses to divulge Marahute&#x27;s whereabouts. Realizing that protecting Marahute&#x27;s eggs is Cody&#x27;s weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking someone else killed Marahute and releases him, knowing that Cody will go to her nest. Cody does and McLeach soon captures Marahute along with Cody, Jake, and Bianca. Bernard manages to hide Marahute&#x27;s eggs from McLeach&#x27;s pet goanna, Joanna.

McLeach takes his captives to Crocodile Falls, a huge waterfall at the end of the river he threw Cody&#x27;s backpack into. He ties Cody up and hangs him over the float of crocodiles, intent on feeding Cody to them to eliminate him as a witness. Bernard, riding a razorback pig he tamed using a horse whispering technique he learned from Jake, arrives and disables McLeach&#x27;s vehicle before he can succeed. McLeach then attempts to shoot the rope holding Cody above the water, but Bernard tricks Joanna into crashing into McLeach, sending both of them into the water. The crocodiles turn their attention to McLeach and Joanna; behind them, Cody falls into the water as the damaged rope breaks. As Joanna flees to the bank, McLeach fends off and taunts the crocodiles, forgetting about the waterfall until it is too late. He desperately attempts to swim to shore, but is washed over the waterfall to his death. Bernard dives into the water and holds Cody long enough for Jake and Bianca to free Marahute, allowing the eagle to save Cody and Bernard just as they go over the waterfall.

Bernard, desperate to prevent any further interruptions, finally proposes to Bianca; she immediately accepts, while Jake salutes him with new-found respect. Safe at last, the group departs for Cody&#x27;s home. Meanwhile, Wilbur is protecting Marahute&#x27;s eggs; they hatch, and one of the eaglets bites him, to his dismay.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
By 1984, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; had become one of Disney&#x27;s most successful recent animated films, earning $41 million in worldwide box office rentals. Under the new studio management of then-CEO Michael Eisner and studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, it was decided that a sequel should be produced. Writing began in 1986 and it was determined the film would be set in Australia, due to the success of &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), which had enhanced the appeal of Australian culture to a mainstream American audience.

When &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988) was nearly complete, Peter Schneider, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, asked supervising animator Mike Gabriel if he would consider directing. At the time, Gabriel declined the offer, stating, &quot;Well, after watching George [Scribner], it doesn&#x27;t look like it would be much fun.&quot; A few months later, Schneider called Gabriel into his office, and asked him if he would direct &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, to which Gabriel accepted. After animating the character Tito on &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, which was met with praise from general audiences, Hendel Butoy was added as the film&#x27;s co-director. Meanwhile, Schneider recruited Thomas Schumacher, who had worked at the Mark Taper Forum, to serve as producer on the film.

As the film&#x27;s producer, Schumacher selected storyboard artist Joe Ranft to serve as story supervisor, believing he had the &quot;ability to change and transform through excellence of idea&quot;. Throughout the storyboarding process, Ranft constantly bolstered the creative morale of his crew, but he rarely drew storyboard sequences himself. Ranft also had creative disagreements with the studio&#x27;s management and marketing executives, including one where he and the story team advocated for an Aboriginal Australian child actor to voice Cody. According to storyboard artist Brenda Chapman, Katzenberg overrode this idea, casting &quot;a little white blonde kid&quot; and giving Cody a matching design.

Because of the rising popularity of Australian-themed action films, and with Americans becoming more environmentally conscious, the filmmakers decided to abandon the musical format from the original film. They had decided that the placement of songs would slow down the pacing for the new film. Instead, they decided to market it as the studio&#x27;s first action-adventure film, with Butoy and Gabriel taking inspiration from live-action films by Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and David Lean. It would also be the studio&#x27;s first animated film since &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) to have an animal rights and environmental message. In December 1988, original cast members Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor were confirmed to be reprising their roles. However, Jim Jordan, who had voiced Orville in the original film, died earlier that same year in April following a fall at his home. In acknowledgment of Jordan&#x27;s death, Roy E. Disney suggested that the character of Wilbur be written as Orville&#x27;s brother, to serve as his replacement. Intentionally, the names were in reference to the Wright brothers.

=== Animation and design ===
Members of the production team, including art director Maurice Hunt and six of his animators, spent several days in Australia to study settings and animals found in the Australian Outback to observe, take photographs, and draw sketches to properly illustrate the Outback on film. They ventured through the Uluru, Katherine Gorge, and the Kakadu national parks, the inspiration for Hunt&#x27;s initial designs emphasizing the spectrum of scale between the sweeping vistas and the film&#x27;s protagonists.

Serving as the supervising animator on the eagle character Marahute, Glen Keane studied six eagles residing at the Peregrine Fund in Boise, Idaho, as well as a stuffed American eagle loaned from the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History and an eagle skeleton. To animate the eagle, Keane and his animation crew enlarged the bird, shrank its head, elongated its neck and wings, and puffed out its chest. Additionally, Keane had to slow the bird&#x27;s wing movements to about 25–30 percent of an eagle&#x27;s flight speed. Because of the excessive details on Marahute, who carried 200 feathers, the character appeared for only seven minutes altogether, during the opening and ending sequences.

Furthermore, in order to have the film finished on time, Schumacher enlisted the support of Disney-MGM Studios, which was originally envisioned to produce independent cartoon shorts and featurettes. On their first assignment on a Disney animated feature film, 70 artists contributed ten minutes of screen time, including supervising animator Mark Henn. As one of the film&#x27;s ten supervising animators, Henn animated several scenes of Bernard, Miss Bianca, and Percival C. McLeach. For the mice characters, Henn studied the mannerisms of Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor during voice recording sessions, and looked to George C. Scott&#x27;s performance in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) for inspiration while animating McLeach. To create believable realism for the Australian animals, additional animators traveled to the San Diego Zoo to observe kangaroos, kookaburras, and snakes, while an iguana from Walt Disney World&#x27;s Discovery Island was brought into the studio for the animators drawing Joanna.

&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; is notable for Disney as its first traditionally animated film using only the new computerized CAPS process. CAPS (Computer Animation Production System) was a computer-based production system used for digital ink and paint and compositing, allowing for more efficient and sophisticated post-production of the Disney animated films and making the traditional practice of hand-painting cels obsolete. The animators&#x27; drawings and the background paintings were scanned into computer systems instead, where the animation drawings were inked and painted by digital artists. The drawings were later composited with the scanned backgrounds in software to allow for digital compositing like camera positioning, camera movements, multiplane effects, and other camera techniques. Those digital files would then be recorded onto film stock.

The film also uses CGI elements throughout, such as the field of flowers in the opening sequence, McLeach&#x27;s truck, and perspective shots of Wilbur flying above Sydney Opera House and New York City. The CAPS project was the first of Disney&#x27;s collaborations with computer graphics company Pixar, which would eventually become a feature animation production studio making computer-generated animated films for Disney before being acquired in 2006. As a result, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was the first animated film for which the entire final film elements were assembled and completed within a digital environment, as well as the first fully digital feature film. However, the film&#x27;s marketing approach did not call attention to the use of the CAPS process.

== Music ==

The score for the film was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton. Unlike the vast majority of Disney animated features, the film had no songs written for it (although &quot;Message Montage&quot; includes a quotation from &quot;Rescue Aid Society&quot; by Sammy Fain, Carol Connors, and Ayn Robbins, the only musical reference to the first film). This was the second Disney film not to include any original songs, the first one being &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;.

The score received positive critical reception, with critics singling out &quot;Cody&#x27;s Flight&quot; for its sense of majesty, excitement, and freedom. AllMusic gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 stars.

In 2002, Walt Disney Records reissued the album on compact disc, including the Shelby Flint songs &quot;The Journey&quot;, &quot;Someone&#x27;s Waiting for You&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot; (from &quot;The Rescuers&quot;). In 2016, Intrada Records released the complete Broughton score, including material (in italics) not used in the movie.

== Release ==
During the film&#x27;s theatrical release, the film was released as a double feature with the new Mickey Mouse short film &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was released in the Walt Disney Classics video series on September 17, 1991, while &quot;The Rescuers&quot; was released on VHS a year later on September 18, 1992. Unlike the original film, however, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was not included in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line. Both home video releases went into moratorium on April 30, 1993. In its original release, the VHS edition sold 5.2 million units in the United States, generating $72.8 million in revenue.

Launching in January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video began the Gold Classic Collection, with &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; re-issued on VHS and DVD on August 1, 2000. The DVD contained the film in its 1.66:1 aspect ratio enhanced for 16:9 television sets and 4.0 surround sound, and was accompanied with special features, including a storybook and trivia as well as an &quot;Animals of the Outback&quot; activity booklet.

&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was released alongside &quot;The Rescuers&quot; on Blu-ray in a &quot;2-Movie Collection&quot; on August 21, 2012, to commemorate the first film&#x27;s 35th anniversary in the United States.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
During its opening weekend, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; grossed $3.5 million, ranking fourth, after &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Rocky V&quot;, and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;. As a result, Katzenberg decided to recall the film&#x27;s television advertising. The film eventually earned $27.9 million in the United States and $47.4 million worldwide, becoming a box-office bomb. In 1991, it was the fourth highest-grossing film in Germany, with admissions of 3.1 million.

=== Critical reaction ===
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; has an approval rating of , based on reviews, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; achieves moments of genuine wonder while adding Outback flavor to its charmingly modest story, making for a sequel that outdoes the original.&quot; 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, &quot;Animation can give us the glory of sights and experiences that are impossible in the real world, and one of those sights, in &#x27;The Rescuers Down Under,&#x27; is of a little boy clinging to the back of a soaring eagle. The flight sequence and many of the other action scenes in this new Disney animated feature create an exhilaration and freedom that are liberating. And the rest of the story is fun, too.&quot; Likewise giving it three stars out of four, Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; summarized the film as a &quot;bold, rousing but sometimes needlessly intense Disney animated feature&quot; where &quot;good fun is provided by a goofy albatross (voiced by John Candy), one in a long line of silly Disney birds&quot;. Janet Maslin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the animation and the action sequences, though she remained critical of the storyline, labeling it &quot;a trifle dark and un-involving for very small children&quot;; Maslin acknowledged that its &quot;slightly more grown-up, adventurous approach may be the reason it does not include the expected musical interludes, but they would have been welcome&quot;. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; felt the film carried &quot;such a mediocre story that adults may duck&quot;, but nevertheless wrote that &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; &quot;boasts reasonably solid production values and fine character voices&quot;.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film as &quot;a gorgeously drawn myth made for plucky children and very brave mice.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; gave it two stars out of four, saying, &quot;[This] slick, lively and enjoyable animated feature [is] an improvement on the original.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, saying, &quot;Three years in the making, it was obviously conceived during the height of this country&#x27;s fascination with Australia, brought on by Paul Hogan&#x27;s fabulously successful &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986). By 1990, the mania had long since subsided, and this film&#x27;s Australian setting did nothing to enhance its box office appeal. Further, the film doesn&#x27;t make particularly imaginative use of the location. Take away the accents and the obligatory kangaroos and koalas, and the story could have taken place anywhere.&quot;

In a 2013 review, Josh Spiegel wrote: &quot;&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; is not the great undiscovered Disney movie, mind you. The film was done in by bad contextual timing and poor scheduling and marketing, and fans of animation would likely enjoy it for its somewhat large scope and setpieces. However, this is just a decent movie, one that feels as tiny as its leads.&quot; Conversely, Ellen MacKay of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars, writing, &quot;A rare sequel that improves on the original&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
== Legacy ==
The film is considered to be a part of the Disney Renaissance, a period of time which Disney returned to producing commercially and/or critically successful animated films. Like other Disney animated characters, the characters of the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Along with other Disney characters, the main characters of the film have cameo appearances in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

<text>Lucky Records is the name of several different record labels.

== Lucky Records – Tokyo ==
Lucky Records of the 1930s was a record label based in Tokyo, Japan, which specialized in issuing American popular music to the Japanese audience.

Lucky was founded in November 1934 by the Lucky Record Co. Tokyo, owned by the Saito Shoten cotton importing business. It made arrangements with the American Record Corporation to issue material from ARC labels in Japan. Its most successful imports were the recordings of Bing Crosby. Many of the other Lucky Records issues are surprisingly eclectic, including recordings by Eddie Condon, Red Allen, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington, but also rural southern blues records otherwise unissued outside of the United States in the era (and in the US mostly restricted to labels catering to the African American market). Lucky issues also included accordion bands, Hawaiian music, calypso music and Argentine tangos. It is unclear if this material was specifically selected, or if some was simply chosen at random by someone at either Lucky or ARC.
== Lucky Records – Los Angeles ==
Lucky Records of the 1950s was a Los Angeles–based label run by John Dolphin.

== Lucky Records – Bootlegs ==
Lucky Records of the 1960s and 1970s was a bootleg label, issuing recordings of live performances of noted rock &amp; roll artists (including Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan) on vinyl records.

== Lucky Records – Seattle ==
Lucky Records of the 1990s, described by one website as &quot;Canadian surf and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;, is based in Seattle, Washington, US.

<doc id="238019" wikidata="Q81063" url="?curid=238019" title="Snowshoe hare">
<text>The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), also called the varying hare or snowshoe rabbit, is a species of hare found in North America. It has the name &quot;snowshoe&quot; because of the large size of its hind feet. The animal&#x27;s feet prevent it from sinking into the snow when it hops and walks. Its feet also have fur on the soles to protect it from freezing temperatures.

For camouflage, its fur turns white during the winter and rusty brown during the summer. Its flanks are white year-round. The snowshoe hare is also distinguishable by the black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears. Its ears are shorter than those of most other hares.

In summer, it feeds on plants such as grass, ferns, and leaves; in winter, it eats twigs, the bark from trees, and plants and, similar to the Arctic hare, has been known to occasionally eat dead animals. It can sometimes be seen feeding in small groups. This animal is mainly active at night and does not hibernate. The snowshoe hare may have up to four litters in a year, which average three to eight young. Males compete for females, and females may breed with several males.

A major predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. Historical records of animals caught by fur hunters over hundreds of years show the lynx and hare numbers rising and falling in a cycle, which has made the hare known to biology students worldwide as a case study of the relationship between numbers of predators and their prey.

== Taxonomy and distribution ==
Snowshoe hares occur from Newfoundland to Alaska; south in the Sierra Nevada to central California; in the Rocky Mountains to southern Utah and northern New Mexico; and in the Appalachian Mountains to West Virginia. Populations in its southern range, such as in Ohio, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia have been extirpated. Locations of subspecies are as follows:

*&quot;Lepus americanus americanus&quot; (Erxleben) – Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Montana, and North Dakota
*&quot;L. a. cascadensis&quot; (Nelson) – British Columbia and Washington
*&quot;L. a. columbiensis&quot; (Rhoads) – British Columbia, Alberta, and Washington
*&quot;L. a. dalli&quot; (Merriam) – Mackenzie District, British Columbia, Alaska, Yukon
*&quot;L. a. klamathensis&quot; (Merriam) – Oregon and California
*&quot;L. a. oregonus&quot; (Orr) – Oregon
*&quot;L. a. pallidus&quot; (Cowan) – British Columbia
*&quot;L. a. phaeonotus&quot; (J. A. Allen) – Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota
*&quot;L. a. pineus&quot; (Dalquest) – British Columbia, Idaho, and Washington
*&quot;L. a. seclusus&quot; (Baker and Hankins) – Wyoming
*&quot;L. a. struthopus&quot; (Bangs) – Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Maine
*&quot;L. a. tahoensis&quot; (Orr) – California, western Nevada
*&quot;L. a. virginianus&quot; (Harlan) – Ontario, Quebec, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania
*&quot;L. a. washingtonii&quot; (Baird) – British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon

==Description==
The snowshoe hare&#x27;s fur is rusty brown in the spring and summer, and white in the winter. It also always has a gray underbelly, and black on the tips and edges of its ears and tail. It has very large hind feet, and dense fur on their soles. The snowshoe hare&#x27;s ears are not as long as some other species of hares&#x27; ears. In the winter, it turns a bright white to blend in with the snow.

Snowshoe hares range in length from 413 to 518 mm (16.3 to 20.4 in), of which 39 to 52 mm (1.5 to 2.0 in) are tail. The hind foot, long and broad, measures 117 to 147 mm (4.6 to 5.8 in) in length. The ears are 62 to 70 mm (2.4 to 2.8 in) from notch to tip. Snowshoe hares usually weigh between 1.43 and 1.55 kg (3.15 to 3.42 lb). Males are slightly smaller than females, as is typical for leporids. In the summer, the coat is a grizzled rusty or grayish brown, with a blackish middorsal line, buffy flanks and a white belly. The face and legs are cinnamon brown. The ears are brownish with black tips and white or creamy borders. During the winter, the fur is almost entirely white, except for black eyelids and the blackened tips on the ears. The soles of the feet are densely furred, with stiff hairs (forming the snowshoe) on the hind feet.

Snowshoe hares are primarily found in areas with dense plant coverage such as boreal forests, upper montane forests and wetlands, though are occasionally seen in more open areas like agricultural land.

In Utah, snowshoe hares used Gambel oak (&quot;Quercus gambelli&quot;) in the northern portion of the Gambel oak range. In the Southwest, the southernmost populations of snowshoe hares occur in
the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, New Mexico, in subalpine scrub: narrow bands of shrubby and prostrate conifers at and just below timberline that are usually composed of Engelmann spruce, bristlecone pine, limber pine, and juniper.

In Minnesota, snowshoe hares are found in uplands and wetlands. In New England, snowshoe hares favor second-growth forests.

== Reproduction and leverets ==

Like all leporids, snowshoe hares are crepuscular and nocturnal. They are shy and secretive and spend most of the day in shallow depressions, called forms, scraped out under clumps of ferns, brush thickets, and downed piles of timber. They occasionally use the large burrows of mountain beavers (&quot;Aplodontia rufa&quot;) as forms. Diurnal activity level increases during the breeding season. Juveniles are usually more active and less cautious than adults.

Snowshoe hares are active year-round. The breeding season for hares is stimulated by new vegetation and varies with latitude, location, and yearly events (such as weather conditions and phase of snowshoe hare population cycle). Breeding generally begins in late December to January and lasts until July or August . In northwestern Oregon, male peak breeding activity (as determined by testes weight) occurs in May and is at the minimum in November. In Ontario, the peak is in May and in Newfoundland, the peak is in June. Female estrus begins in March in Newfoundland, Alberta, and Maine, and in early April in Michigan and Colorado. First litters of the year are born from mid-April to May.
The gestation period is 35 to 40 days; most studies report 37 days as the average length of gestation. Litters average three to five leverets depending on latitude, elevation, and phase of population cycle, ranging from one to seven. Deep snow-pack increases the amount of upper-branch browse available to snowshoe hares in winter, and therefore has a positive relationship with the nutritional status of breeding adults. Litters are usually smaller
in the southern sections of their range since there is less snow. Newborns are fully furred, open-eyed, and mobile. They leave the natal form within a short time after birth, often within 24 hours. After leaving the birthplace, siblings stay near each other during the day, gathering once each evening to nurse. Weaning occurs at 25 to 28 days except for the last litter of the season, which may nurse for two months or longer.

Female snowshoe hares can become pregnant anytime after the 35th day of gestation. The second litter can therefore be conceived before the first litter is born (snowshoe hares have twin uteri). Pregnancy rates ranged from 78 to 100% for females during the period of first litter production, 82 to 100% for second litters, and for the periods of third and fourth litters pregnancy rates vary with population cycle. In Newfoundland, the average number of litters per female per year ranged from 2.9 to 3.5, and in Alberta the range was from 2.7 to 3.3. The number of litters per year varies with phase of population cycle (see below). In Alberta the average number of litters per year was almost 3 just after a population peak and 4 just after the population low. Females normally first breed as 1-year-olds. Juvenile breeding is rare and has only been observed in females from the first litter of the year and only in years immediately following a low point in the population cycle.

In Yukon, 30-day survival of radio-tagged leverets was 46%, 15%, and 43% for the first, second, and third litters of the year, respectively. There were no differences in mortality in plots with food added. The main proximate cause of mortality was predation by small mammals, including red squirrels (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) and Arctic ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus parryii&quot;). Littermates tended to live or die together more often than by chance. Individual survival was negatively related to litter size and positively related to body size at birth. Litter size is negatively correlated with body size at birth.

== Population cycles ==
Northern populations of snowshoe hares undergo cycles that range from seven to 17 years between population peaks. The average time between peaks is approximately 10 years. The period of abundance usually lasts for two to five years, followed by a population decline to lower numbers or local scarcity. Areas of great abundance tend to be scattered. Populations do not peak simultaneously in all areas, although a great deal of synchronicity occurs in northern latitudes. From 1931 to 1948, the cycle was synchronized within one or two years over most of Canada and Alaska, despite differences in predators and food supplies. In central Alberta, low snowshoe hare density occurred in 1965, with 42 to 74 snowshoe hares per 100 acres (40 ha). The population peak occurred in November 1970 with 2,830 to 5,660 snowshoe hares per 100 acres (40 ha). In the southern parts of its range, snowshoe hare populations do not fluctuate radically.

Exclosure experiments in Alberta indicated browsing by snowshoe hares during population peaks has the greatest impact on palatable species, thus further reducing the amount of available foods. In this study, insufficient nutritious young browse was available to sustain the number of snowshoe hares present in the peak years (1971 and 1972) in winter.

The hare&#x27;s fluctuating numbers are modelled by the Lotka–Volterra equations.

== Preferred habitat ==
Major variables in habitat quality include average visual obstruction and browse biomass. Snowshoe hares prefer young forests with abundant understories. The presence of cover is the primary determinant of habitat quality, and is more significant than food availability or species composition. Species composition does, however, influence population density; dense softwood understories support greater snowshoe hare density than hardwoods because of cover quality. In Maine, female snowshoe hares were observed to be more common on sites with less cover but more nutritious forage; males tended to be found on sites with heavier cover.
Winter browse availability depends on height of understory brush and winter snow depth; saplings with narrow stem diameters are required for winter browse in heavy snow.

In northern regions, snowshoe hares occupy conifer and mixed forests in all stages of succession, but early successional forests foster peak abundance. Deciduous forests are usually occupied only in early stages of succession. In New England, snowshoe hares preferred second-growth deciduous, coniferous, and mixed woods with dense brushy understories; they appear to prefer shrubby old-field areas, early- to mid-successional burns, shrub-swamps, bogs, and upper montane krumholz vegetation. In Maine, snowshoe hares were more active in clearcut areas than in partially cut or uncut areas. Sapling densities were highest on 12- to 15-year-old plots; these plots were used more than younger stands. In northern Utah, they occupied all the later stages of succession on quaking aspen and spruce-fir, but were not observed in meadows. In Alberta, snowshoe hares use upland shrub-sapling stages of regenerating aspens (either postfire or postharvest). In British Columbia overstocked juvenile lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;) stands formed optimal snowshoe hare habitat.

In western Washington, most unburned, burned, or scarified clearcuts will normally be fully occupied by snowshoe hares within four to five years, as vegetation becomes dense. In older stands (more than 25 years), stem density begins to decline and cover for snowshoe hares decreases. However, in north-central Washington, they may not
colonize clearcuts until six or seven years, and it may take 20 to 25 years for their density to reach maximum. Winter snowshoe hare pellet counts were highest in 20-year-old lodgepole pine stands, lower in older lodgepole stands, and lowest in spruce-dominated stands. In western Oregon, snowshoe hares were abundant only in early successional stages, including stable brushfields. In west-central Oregon, an old-growth Douglas-fir forest was clearcut and monitored through 10 years of succession. A few snowshoe hares were noted in adjacent virgin forest plots; they represented widely scattered, sparse populations. One snowshoe hare was observed on the disturbed plot 2.5 years after it had been clearcut and burned; at this stage, ground cover was similar to that of the uncut forest. By 9 years after disturbance, snowshoe hare density had increased markedly.
In western Washington, snowshoe hares routinely used steep slopes where cover was adequate; most studies, however, suggest they tend to prefer gentle slopes. Moonlight increases snowshoe hare vulnerability to predation, particularly in winter. They tend to avoid open areas during bright phases of the moon and during bright periods of a single night. Their activity usually shifts from coniferous understories in winter to hardwood understories in summer.

Vegetative structure plays an important role in the size of snowshoe hare home ranges. Snowshoe hares wander up to 5 miles (8 km) when food is scarce. In Montana home ranges are smaller in brushy woods than in open woods. In Colorado and Utah, the average home range of both sexes was 20 acres (8.1 ha). On the Island of Montreal in Quebec, the average daily range for both sexes was 4 acres (1.6 ha) in old-field mixed woods. In Montana, the home range averaged 25 acres (10 ha) for males and 19 acres (7.6 ha) for females. In Oregon the average snowshoe hare home range was 14.6 acres (5.9 ha).

== Cover requirements ==

Snowshoe hares require dense, brushy, usually coniferous cover; thermal and escape cover are especially important for young hares. Low brush provides hiding, escape, and thermal cover. Heavy cover 10 feet (3 m) above ground provides protection from avian predators, and heavy cover 3.3 feet (1 m) tall provides cover from terrestrial predators. Overwinter survival increases with increased cover. A wide variety of habitat types are used if cover is available. Base visibility in good snowshoe hare habitat ranges from 2% at 16.5 feet (5 m) distance to 0% at 66 feet (20 m). Travel cover is slightly more open, ranging from 14.7% visibility at 16.5 feet (5 m) to 2.6% at 66 feet (20 m). Areas with horizontal vegetation density of 40 to 100% at 50 feet (15 m) are adequate snowshoe hare habitat in Utah.

== Food habits ==

Snowshoe hares eat a variety of plant materials. Forage type varies with season. Succulent green vegetation is consumed when available from spring to fall; after the first frost, buds, twigs, evergreen needles, and bark form the bulk of snowshoe hare diets until spring greenup. Snowshoe hares typically feed at night and follow well-worn forest paths to feed on various plants and trees.

=== Winter ===

Snowshoe hares prefer branches, twigs, and small stems up to 0.25 inch (6.3 mm) diameter; larger stems are sometimes used in winter. In Yukon, they normally eat fast-growing birches and willows, and avoid spruce. At high densities, however, the apical shoots of small spruce are eaten. The snowshoe hare winter diet is dominated by bog birch (&quot;Betula glandulosa&quot;), which is preferred but not always available. Greyleaf willow (&quot;Salix glauca&quot;) is eaten most often when bog birch is not available. Buffaloberry (&quot;Shepherdia canadensis&quot;) is the fourth most common diet item. White spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) is eaten, but not preferred. In Alaska, spruce, willows, and alders comprise 75% of snowshoe hare diets; spruce needles make up nearly 40% of the diet. In northwestern Oregon, winter foods include needles and tender bark of Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, and western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;); leaves and green twigs of salal; buds, twigs, and bark of willows; and green herbs. In north-central Washington, willows and birches are not plentiful; snowshoe hares browse the tips of lodgepole pine seedlings. In Utah, winter foods include Douglas-fir, willows, snowberry (&quot;Symphoricarpos&quot; spp.), maples, and serviceberry (&quot;Amelanchier&quot; spp.). In Minnesota, aspens, willows, hazelnut (&quot;Corylus&quot; spp.), ferns (&quot;Pteridophyta&quot; spp.), birches, alders, sumacs (&quot;Rhus&quot; spp.), and strawberries (&quot;Fragaria&quot; spp.) are winter foods. Winter foods in New York include eastern white pine, red pine (&quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;), white spruce, paper birch, and aspens. In Ontario, sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), striped maple (&quot;A. pensylvanicum&quot;), red maple, other deciduous species, northern white-cedar (&quot;T. occidentalis&quot;), balsam fir, beaked hazelnut (&quot;C. cornuta&quot;), and buffaloberry were heavily barked. In New Brunswick, snowshoe hares consumed northern white-cedar, spruces, American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), balsam fir, mountain maple (&quot;A. spicatum&quot;), and many other species of browse. In Newfoundland, paper birch is preferred. Further details on regional food preferences are summarized in &quot;Snowshoe hare and allies&quot;:

Recent studies show that Snowshoe hares also eat meat including flesh from their own species.

=== Spring, summer and autumn ===

In Alaska, snowshoe hares consume new leaves of blueberries (&quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp.), new shoots of field horsetails (&quot;Equisetum arvense&quot;), and fireweed (&quot;Epilobium angustifolium&quot;) in spring.
Grasses are not a major item due to low availability associated with sites that have adequate cover. In summer, leaves of willows, black spruce, birches, and bog Labrador tea (&quot;Ledum groenlandicum&quot;) are also consumed. Black spruce is the most heavily used and the most common species in the area. Pen trials suggest black spruce is not actually preferred. Roses (&quot;Rosa&quot; spp.) were preferred, but a minor dietary item, as they were not common in the study area. In northwest Oregon, summer foods include grasses, clovers (&quot;Trifolium&quot; spp.), other forbs, and some woody plants, including Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, and young leaves and twigs of salal. In Minnesota, aspens, willows, grasses, birches, alders, sumacs, and strawberries are consumed when green. In Ontario, summer diets consist of clovers, grasses, and forbs.

== Predators ==

The snowshoe hare is a major prey item for a number of predators. Its foremost predator is the Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;), but other predators include bobcats (&quot;L. rufus&quot;), fishers (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), American martens (&quot;Martes americana&quot;), Pacific martens, (&quot;M. caurina&quot;), long-tailed weasels (&quot;Neogale frenata&quot;), minks (&quot;N. vison&quot;), foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot; and &quot;Urocyon&quot; spp.), coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), domestic dogs (&quot;C. familiaris&quot;), domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), spotted owls (&quot;S. occidentalis&quot;), other owls, red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), other hawks (&quot;Buteonidae&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chryseatos&quot;), as well as corvids. Other predators include black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;). In Glacier National Park snowshoe hares are a prey item of Rocky Mountain wolves (&quot;Canis lupus irremotus&quot;).

== Vulnerability to climate change ==
The habitat for some snowshoe hares has changed dramatically, leaving some habitats without snow for longer periods than previously. Some hares have adapted and stay brown all winter. Others, however, continue to turn white in winter. These hares are at an increased risk of being hunted and killed because they are no longer camouflaged. Many people in the scientific community believe that snowshoe hare populations are at risk of crashing unless interbreeding speeds up the process of evolution to year-round brown. Other species who rely on the hare as part of their diet are also at risk.

<text>ThrustSSC, Thrust SSC or Thrust SuperSonic Car is a British jet car developed by Richard Noble, Glynne Bowsher, Ron Ayers, and Jeremy Bliss. Thrust SSC holds the world land speed record, set on 15 October 1997, and driven by Andy Green, when it achieved a speed of and it became the first and only land vehicle to officially break the sound barrier.

Alongside Thrust2, Thrust SSC was displayed in the &quot;Spirit of Speed Gallery&quot; of the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. As part of the Museum&#x27;s redevelopment project both cars were relocated by specialist haulier to the new Biffa Award Land Speed Record Gallery which opened in 2015.

The car is long and wide and has a curb weight of 10.6 tons. It had a reported thrust of 223 kN (approximately 50,000 pounds force) at some operating condition. Jet engines are not designed to operate at peak airspeed while still in ground effect; a proper estimate would need to take this into account.

==Details==
The jet was driven by Royal Air Force fighter pilot Wing Commander Andy Green in the Black Rock Desert in the US state of Nevada. It was powered by two afterburning Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines, as used in the British version of the F-4 Phantom II jet fighter. The twin engines developed a net thrust of 223 kN (50,000 lbf) at the measured record speed of 341 metres per second, burning around 18 litres/second (4.0 Imperial gallons/s or 4.8 US gallons/s) of fuel. This was about .

After the record was set, the World Motor Sport Council released the following message: 
:The World Motor Sport Council homologated the new world land speed records set by the team ThrustSSC of Richard Noble, driver Andy Green, on 15 October 1997 at Black Rock Desert, Nevada (USA). This is the first time in history that a land vehicle has exceeded the speed of sound. The new records are as follows:
:*Flying mile     
:*Flying kilometre 
:In setting the record, the sound barrier was broken in both the north and south runs.
::::Paris, 11 November 1997.

The complete run history is available.

==Legacy==
In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of . The date of Andy Green&#x27;s record came exactly a half century and one day after Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with the Bell X-1
research rocket plane on 14 October 1947.

Both Thrust SSC and Thrust2 are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. Visitors can ride a 4D motion simulator depicting a computer-generated animation of the record-breaking run from the perspective of Green.

Several teams are competing to break the record, including the Bloodhound LSR project, launched in 2008, and previously the North American Eagle Project, from 2004 until the project&#x27;s abandonment after a fatal crash in 2019.

== Richard NobleOrange-Intel dispute ==
In June 2012, a television advertisement for the Orange &quot;San Diego&quot; mobile phone, containing an Intel processor, was broadcast on British television and featured a fast car in computer generated imagery. Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of Thrust SSC and thus these companies had used his intellectual property without permission, putting the future of the Bloodhound LSR project in doubt. The Advertising Standards Authority rejected the Bloodhound team&#x27;s complaint, claiming that intellectual property disputes were not in its remit. According to BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Intel and Orange responded that their production team had researched different styles of &quot;superfast vehicles&quot; and developed their own Orange-branded land speed car, and that the advertisement and phone were not connected to Noble or Bloodhound LSR.

<doc id="238025" wikidata="Q332628" url="?curid=238025" title="Lake Nyos">
<text>Lake Nyos ( ) is a crater lake in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, located about northwest of Yaoundé, the capital. Nyos is a deep lake high on the flank of an inactive volcano in the Oku volcanic plain along the Cameroon line of volcanic activity. A volcanic dam impounds the lake waters.

A pocket of magma lies beneath the lake and leaks carbon dioxide () into the water, changing it into carbonic acid. Nyos is one of only three lakes known to be saturated with carbon dioxide in this way, and therefore prone to limnic eruptions (the others being Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, and Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda).

In 1986, possibly as the result of a landslide, Lake Nyos suddenly emitted a large cloud of, which suffocated 1,746 people and 3,500 livestock in nearby towns and villages, the most notable one being Chah, which was abandoned after the incident. The limnic eruption not only devastated human and livestock populations but also had a profound impact on the diverse aquatic life, including tilapia, crabs, snails, and frogs, leading to a significant loss of biodiversity in and around the lake.

Though not completely unprecedented, it was the first known large-scale asphyxiation caused by a natural event. To prevent a recurrence, a degassing tube that siphons water from the bottom layers to the top, allowing the carbon dioxide to leak in safe quantities, was installed in 2001. Two additional tubes were installed in 2011.

Today, the lake also poses a threat because its natural wall is weakening. A geological tremor could cause this natural levee to give way, allowing water to rush into downstream villages all the way into Nigeria and allowing large amounts of carbon dioxide to escape.

==Geography==

Lake Nyos lies within the Oku Volcanic Field, located near the northern boundary of the Cameroon Volcanic Line, a zone of volcanoes and other tectonic activity that extends southwest to the Mt. Cameroon stratovolcano. The field consists of volcanic maars and basaltic scoria cones.

==Formation and geologic history==
Lake Nyos is located south of the dirt road from Wum, about to the west, to Nkambé in the east. Villages along the road in the vicinity of the lake include Cha, Nyos, Munji, Djingbe, and Subum. The lake is from the Nigerian border to the north, and lies on the northern slopes of the Massif du Mbam, drained by streams running north, then northwest, to the Katsina-Ala River in Nigeria which is part of the Benue River basin.

Lake Nyos fills a roughly circular maar in the Oku Volcanic Field, an explosion crater caused when a lava flow interacted violently with groundwater. The maar is believed to have formed in an eruption a maximum of 12,000 years ago, and is 1,800 m (5,900 ft) across and 208 m (682 ft) deep. The area has been volcanically active for millions of years—after South America and Africa were split apart by plate tectonics about 110 million years ago, West Africa also experienced rifting, although to a lesser degree. The rift is known as the Mbéré Rift Valley, and crustal extension has allowed magma to reach the surface along a line extending through Cameroon. Mount Cameroon also lies on this fault line. Lake Nyos is surrounded by old lava flows and pyroclastic deposits.

Although Nyos is situated within an extinct volcano, magma still exists beneath it. Approximately directly below the lake resides a pool of magma, which releases carbon dioxide and other gases; the gases then travel upward through the earth. The fumes then dissolve in the natural springs encircling the lake, ultimately rising to the surface of the water and leaching into the lake. But with advanced in technology now there are machinery placed at the bottom of the lake to remove the gases, so as to make the inhabitants of the area free from danger. 

The lake waters are held in place by a natural dam composed of volcanic rock. At its narrowest point, the wall measures high and wide.

==Gas saturation==
Lake Nyos is one of only three lakes in the world known to be saturated with carbon dioxide—the others are Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, and Lake Kivu on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. A magma chamber beneath the region is an abundant source of carbon dioxide, which seeps up through the lake bed, charging the waters of Lake Nyos with an estimated 90 million tonnes of .

Lake Nyos is thermally stratified, with layers of warm, less dense water near the surface floating on the colder, denser water layers near the lake&#x27;s bottom. Over long periods, carbon dioxide gas seeping into the cold water at the lake&#x27;s bottom is dissolved in great amounts.

Most of the time, the lake is stable and the remains in solution in the lower layers. However, over time, the water becomes supersaturated, and if an event such as an earthquake or landslide occurs, large amounts of may suddenly come out of solution.

===1986 disaster===

Although a sudden outgassing of had occurred at Lake Monoun in 1984, a similar threat from Lake Nyos was not anticipated. However, on August 21, 1986, a limnic eruption occurred at Lake Nyos, triggering the sudden release of about 100,000–300,000 tons (some sources state as much as 1.6 million tonnes) of . This gas cloud rose at nearly and spilled over the northern lip of the lake into a valley running roughly east–west from Cha to Subum. It then rushed down two valleys branching off to the north, displacing all of the air and suffocating 1,746 people within of the lake, mostly rural villagers, as well as 3,500 livestock. The villages most affected were Cha, Nyos, and Subum.
Scientists concluded from evidence that a fountain of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake. The huge amount of water rising suddenly caused much turbulence in the water, spawning a wave of at least that would scour the shore of one side.

It is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing. Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake. A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Others still believe there was a small earthquake, but as witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster, this hypothesis is unlikely. Whatever the cause, the event resulted in the rapid mixing of the supersaturated deep water with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored to effervesce out of solution.

It is believed that about of gas was released. The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to iron-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a metre and trees near the lake were knocked down.
===Degassing===
The scale of the 1986 disaster led to much study on how a recurrence could be prevented. Estimates of the rate of carbon dioxide entering the lake suggested that outgassings could occur every 10–30 years, though a recent study shows that release of water from the lake, caused by erosion of the natural barrier that keeps in the lake&#x27;s water, could in turn reduce pressure on the lake&#x27;s carbon dioxide and cause a gas escape much sooner.

Several researchers independently proposed the installation of degassing columns from rafts in the lake. These use a pump to initially lift water from the bottom of the lake, heavily saturated with , until the loss of pressure begins releasing the gas from the diphasic fluid, at which point the process becomes self-powered. In 1992 at Monoun, and in 1995 at Nyos, a French team directed by Michel Halbwachs demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In 2001, the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance funded a permanent installation at Nyos.

In 2011, two additional pipes were installed by Michel Halbwachs and his French-Cameroonian team to assure the complete degassing of Lake Nyos.
Following the disaster, scientists investigated other African lakes to see if a similar phenomenon could happen elsewhere. Lake Kivu, 2,000 times larger than Lake Nyos, was also found to be supersaturated, and geologists found evidence for outgassing events around the lake about every thousand years. The eruption of nearby Mount Nyiragongo in 2002 sent lava flowing into the lake, raising fears that a gas eruption could be triggered, but it was not, as the flow of lava stopped well before it got near the bottom layers of the lake, where the gas is maintained in solution by the water pressure.

==Weakening dam==
In 2005, Isaac Njilah, a geologist at the University of Yaoundé, suggested that the natural dam of volcanic rock that keeps in the lake&#x27;s waters could collapse in the near future. Erosion has worn the dam away, causing holes and pockets to develop in the dam&#x27;s upper layer, and water already passes through the lower section. Meanwhile, landslides have reduced dam strength on the outside. Seismic activity caused by the lake&#x27;s volcanic foundation could thus cause the lake wall to give way, resulting in up to 50 million m3 (1.8 billion ft3) of water flooding downhill into areas of the Northwest Province and the Nigerian states of Taraba and Benue.

The Cameroonian government, speaking through Gregory Tanyi-Leke of the Institute of Mining and Geological Research, acknowledges the weakening wall, but denies that it presents any immediate threat. A United Nations team led by Olaf Van Duin and Nisa Nurmohamed of the Netherlands&#x27; Ministry of Transport and Public Works inspected the dam over three days in September 2005, and confirmed that the natural lip had weakened. Van Duin believed that the dam would breach within the next 10 to 20 years.

One possible means of averting such a catastrophe would be to strengthen the lake wall, though this would take much time and money. Engineers could also introduce a channel to allow excess water to drain; if the water level were lowered by about , the pressure on the wall would be reduced significantly.

==Return of population==
Despite the risks from carbon dioxide and collapse of the lake&#x27;s retaining wall, the area is being resettled. Settlers cite the wish to return to ancestral lands (although some are newcomers) and the great fertility of the land as reasons for their return.

<text>Death by crushing or pressing is a method of execution that has a history during which the techniques used varied greatly from place to place, generally involving placing heavy weights upon a person with the intent to kill.

==Crushing by elephant==
A common method of death throughout South and Southeast Asia for over 4,000 years was crushing by elephants. The Sasanians, Romans, and Carthaginians also used this method on occasion.

==Ancient Rome==
In the early history of ancient Rome Tarpeia was a Roman maiden who betrayed the city of Rome to the Sabines in exchange for what she thought would be a reward of jewelry. She was instead crushed to death and her body cast from the Tarpeian Rock, which now bears her name.

==Crushing in pre-Columbian America==
Crushing is also reported from pre-Columbian America, notably in the Aztec Empire.

==Crushing under Mongol rule==
Due to religious beliefs, it was at times viewed as better to execute prisoners without the shedding of blood. The means with which it could occur would vary.

==Crushing under common law==
Peine forte et dure (Law French for &quot;forceful and hard punishment&quot;) was a method of torture formerly used in the common law legal system, in which a defendant who refused to plead (&quot;stood mute&quot;) would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or as the weight of the stones on the chest became too great for the condemned to breathe, fatal suffocation would occur.

The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own jurisdiction. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court. Since a criminal justice system that tried and punished only those who volunteered for trial and punishment was practically unworkable, this was the means chosen to coerce them.

Many defendants charged with capital offences nonetheless refused to plead, since thereby they would escape forfeiture of property and their heirs would still inherit their estate; but if defendants pleaded guilty and were executed their heirs would inherit nothing, their property escheating to the Crown. &quot;Peine forte et dure&quot; was abolished in Great Britain in 1772, and the last known use of the practice was in 1741. In 1772 refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty. This was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty. Today in all common-law jurisdictions standing mute is treated by the courts as equivalent to a plea of not guilty.

The elaborate procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness in an oft-quoted description: &quot;he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ...&quot;

&quot;Pressing to death&quot; might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London says the following about the English practice:
The most famous case in the United Kingdom was that of Roman Catholic martyr St Margaret Clitherow, who, in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence, was pressed to death on March 25, 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic priests in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least . Several hardened criminals, including William Spigott (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted half an hour under before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under , and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.

The only death by &quot;peine forte et dure&quot; in American history was that of Giles Corey, who was pressed to death on September 19, 1692, during the Salem witch trials, after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were &quot;More weight&quot;, and he was thought to be dead as the weight was applied.

In medieval Europe the slow crushing of body parts in screw-operated ‘bone vises’ of iron was a common method of torture, and a tremendous variety of cruel instruments was used to savagely crush the head, knee, hand and, most commonly, either the thumb or the naked foot. Such instruments were finely threaded and variously provided with spiked inner surfaces or heated red-hot before their application to the limb to be tortured.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Peine forte et dure&quot; is referred to in Arthur Miller&#x27;s political drama &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1953), where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead &quot;aye or nay&quot; to the charge of witchcraft. In the 1996 film version of this play, the screenplay also written by Arthur Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

In the 1970 American made-for-television supernatural horror film &quot;Crowhaven Farm&quot;, directed by Walter Grauman and starring Hope Lange, Paul Burke and John Carradine, a coven uses crushing to torture Lange&#x27;s character after she inherits a haunted Massachusetts farm house.

In &quot;The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope&quot; one of the flashback victims Joseph Lambert is subjected to the peine forte et dure method of crushing, therefore becoming the ‘crushed demon’ that stalks his reincarnation, John, later in the game.

In the 2017 BBC One series &quot;Gunpowder&quot; the public execution by crushing of the fictional Lady Dorothy Dibdale (based on Margaret Clitherow) is shown in graphic detail.

<text>Counterintelligence (counter-intelligence) or counterespionage (counter-espionage) is any activity aimed at protecting an agency&#x27;s intelligence program from an opposition&#x27;s intelligence service. It includes gathering information and conducting activities to prevent espionage, sabotage, assassinations or other intelligence activities conducted by, for, or on behalf of foreign powers, organizations or persons.

Many countries will have multiple organizations focusing on a different aspect of counterintelligence, such as domestic, international, and counter-terrorism. Some states will formalize it as part of the police structure, such as the United States&#x27; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Others will establish independent bodies, such as the United Kingdom&#x27;s MI5, others have both intelligence and counterintelligence grouped under the same agency, like the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

== History ==

Modern tactics of espionage and dedicated government intelligence agencies developed over the course of the late-19th century. A key background to this development was the Great Game – the strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire throughout Central Asia between 1830 and 1895. To counter Russian ambitions in the region and the potential threat it posed to the British position in India, the Indian Civil Service built up a system of surveillance, intelligence and counterintelligence. The existence of this shadowy conflict was popularized in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s famous spy book, &quot;Kim&quot; (1901), where he portrayed the Great Game (a phrase Kipling popularized) as an espionage and intelligence conflict that &quot;never ceases, day or night&quot;.

The establishment of dedicated intelligence and counterintelligence organizations had much to do with the colonial rivalries between the major European powers and to the accelerating development of military technology. As espionage became more widely used, it became imperative to expand the role of existing police and internal security forces into a role of detecting and countering foreign spies. The &quot;Evidenzbureau&quot; (founded in the Austrian Empire in 1850) had the role from the late-19th century of countering the actions of the Pan-Slavist movement operating out of Serbia.

After the fallout from the Dreyfus affair of 1894–1906 in France, responsibility for French military counter-espionage passed in 1899 to the Sûreté générale—an agency originally responsible for order enforcement and public safety—and overseen by the Ministry of the Interior.
The Okhrana initially formed in 1880 to combat political terrorism and left-wing revolutionary activity throughout the Russian Empire, was also tasked with countering enemy espionage. Its main concern was the activities of revolutionaries, who often worked and plotted subversive actions from abroad. It set up a branch in Paris, run by Pyotr Rachkovsky, to monitor their activities. The agency used many methods to achieve its goals, including covert operations, undercover agents, and &quot;perlustration&quot;—the interception and reading of private correspondence. The Okhrana became notorious for its use of agents provocateurs, who often succeeded in penetrating the activities of revolutionary groups – including the Bolsheviks.

Integrated counterintelligence agencies run directly by governments were also established. The British government founded the Secret Service Bureau in 1909 as the first independent and interdepartmental agency fully in control over all government counterintelligence activities.

Due to intense lobbying from William Melville and after he obtained German mobilization plans and proof of their financial support to the Boers, the British government authorized the formation of a new intelligence section in the War Office, MO3 (subsequently redesignated MO5) headed by Melville, in 1903. Working under-cover from a flat in London, Melville ran both counterintelligence and foreign intelligence operations, capitalizing on the knowledge and foreign contacts he had accumulated during his years running Special Branch.

Due to its success, the Government Committee on Intelligence, with support from Richard Haldane and Winston Churchill, established the Secret Service Bureau in 1909 as a joint initiative of the Admiralty, the War Office and the Foreign Office to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the Imperial German government. Its first director was Captain Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming alias &quot;C&quot;. The Secret Service Bureau was split into a foreign and counter-intelligence domestic service in 1910. The latter, headed by Sir Vernon Kell, originally aimed at calming public fears of large-scale German espionage. As the Service was not authorized with police powers, Kell liaised extensively with the Special Branch of Scotland Yard (headed by Basil Thomson), and succeeded in disrupting the work of Indian revolutionaries collaborating with the Germans during the war. Instead of a system whereby rival departments and military services would work on their own priorities with little to no consultation or cooperation with each other, the newly established Secret Intelligence Service was interdepartmental, and submitted its intelligence reports to all relevant government departments. For the first time, governments had access to peacetime, centralized independent intelligence and counterintelligence bureaucracy with indexed registries and defined procedures, as opposed to the more &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods used previously.

In Soviet East Germany, offensive counterespionage methods were targeted against civilians and were referred to as decomposition methods. They were used to debilitate individuals and groups for the purposes of stopping political dissent and culturally incorrect actions. Decomposition methods were used extensively and became the main form of Stasi repression in the 1970&#x27;s and up until the collapse of the state in 1990. They were also used in the Soviet Union more widely including as support for repeated acts of intellectual property theft.

== Categories ==
Collective counterintelligence is gaining information about an opponent&#x27;s intelligence collection capabilities whose aim is at an entity.

Defensive counterintelligence is thwarting efforts by hostile intelligence services to penetrate the service.

Offensive counterintelligence is having identified an opponent&#x27;s efforts against the system, trying to manipulate these attacks by either &quot;turning&quot; the opponent&#x27;s agents into double agents or feeding them false information to report.

==Counterintelligence, counterterror, and government==
Many governments organize counterintelligence agencies separately and distinct from their intelligence collection services. In most countries the counterintelligence mission is spread over multiple organizations, though one usually predominates. There is usually a domestic counterintelligence service, usually part of a larger law enforcement organization such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

The United Kingdom has the separate Security Service, also known as MI5, which does not have direct police powers but works closely with law enforcement especially Special Branch that can carry out arrests, do searches with a warrant, etc.

The Russian Federation&#x27;s major domestic security organization is the FSB, which principally came from the Second Chief Directorate and Third Chief Directorate of the USSR&#x27;s KGB.

Canada separates the functions of general defensive counterintelligence (&quot;contre-ingérence&quot;), security intelligence (the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence), law enforcement intelligence, and offensive counterintelligence.

Military organizations have their own counterintelligence forces, capable of conducting protective operations both at home and when deployed abroad. Depending on the country, there can be various mixtures of civilian and military in foreign operations. For example, while offensive counterintelligence is a mission of the US CIA&#x27;s National Clandestine Service, defensive counterintelligence is a mission of the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), Department of State, who work on protective security for personnel and information processed abroad at US Embassies and Consulates.

The term counter-espionage is really specific to countering HUMINT, but, since virtually all offensive counterintelligence involves exploiting human sources, the term &quot;offensive counterintelligence&quot; is used here to avoid some ambiguous phrasing.

Other countries also deal with the proper organization of defenses against Foreign Intelligence Services (FIS), often with separate services with no common authority below the head of government.

France, for example, builds its domestic counterterror in a law enforcement framework. In France, a senior anti-terror magistrate is in charge of defense against terrorism. French magistrates have multiple functions that overlap US and UK functions of investigators, prosecutors, and judges. An anti-terror magistrate may call upon France&#x27;s domestic intelligence service &quot;Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure&quot; (DGSI), which may work with the &quot;Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure&quot; (DGSE), foreign intelligence service.

Spain gives its Interior Ministry, with military support, the leadership in domestic counterterrorism. For international threats, the National Intelligence Center (CNI) has responsibility. CNI, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, is staffed principally by which is subordinated directly to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office. After the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings, the national investigation found problems between the Interior Ministry and CNI, and, as a result, the National Anti-Terrorism Coordination Center was created. Spain&#x27;s 3/11 Commission called for this center to do operational coordination as well as information collection and dissemination. The military has organic counterintelligence to meet specific military needs.

== Counterintelligence missions ==
Frank Wisner, a well-known CIA operations executive said of the autobiography of Director of Central Intelligence Allen W. Dulles, that Dulles &quot;disposes of the popular misconception that counterintelligence is essentially a negative and responsive activity, that it moves only or chiefly in reaction to situations thrust upon it and in counter to initiatives mounted by the opposition.&quot; Rather, he sees that it can be most effective, both in information gathering and protecting friendly intelligence services, when it creatively but vigorously attacks the &quot;structure and personnel of hostile intelligence services.&quot; Today&#x27;s counterintelligence missions have broadened from the time when the threat was restricted to the foreign intelligence services (FIS) under the control of nation-states. Threats have broadened to include threats from non-national or trans-national groups, including internal insurgents, organized crime, and transnational based groups (often called &quot;terrorists&quot;, but that is limiting). Still, the FIS term remains the usual way of referring to the threat against which counterintelligence protects.

In modern practice, several missions are associated with counterintelligence from the national to the field level.
* Defensive analysis is the practice of looking for vulnerabilities in one&#x27;s own organization, and, with due regard for risk versus benefit, closing the discovered holes.
* Offensive counterespionage is the set of techniques that at least neutralizes discovered FIS personnel and arrests them or, in the case of diplomats, expels them by declaring them persona non grata. Beyond that minimum, it exploits FIS personnel to gain intelligence for one&#x27;s own side, or actively manipulates the FIS personnel to damage the hostile FIS organization.
* Counterintelligence force protection source operations (CFSO) are human source operations, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national-level coverage in protecting a field station or force from terrorism and espionage.

Counterintelligence is part of intelligence cycle security, which, in turn, is part of intelligence cycle management. A variety of security disciplines also fall under intelligence security management and complement counterintelligence, including:
* Physical security
* Personnel security
* Communications security (COMSEC)
* Informations system security (INFOSEC)
* security classification
* Operations security (OPSEC)

The disciplines involved in &quot;positive security,&quot; measures by which one&#x27;s own society collects information on its actual or potential security, complement security. For example, when communications intelligence identifies a particular radio transmitter as one used only by a particular country, detecting that transmitter inside one&#x27;s own country suggests the presence of a spy that counterintelligence should target. In particular, counterintelligence has a significant relationship with the collection discipline of HUMINT and at least some relationship with the others. Counterintelligence can both produce information and protect it.

All US departments and agencies with intelligence functions are responsible for their own security abroad, except those that fall under Chief of Mission authority.

Governments try to protect three things:
*Their personnel
*Their installations
*Their operations

In many governments, the responsibility for protecting these things is split. Historically, the CIA assigned responsibility for protecting its personnel and operations to its Office of Security, while it assigned the security of operations to multiple groups within the Directorate of Operations: the counterintelligence staff and the area (or functional) unit, such as Soviet Russia Division. At one point, the counterintelligence unit operated quite autonomously, under the direction of James Jesus Angleton. Later, operational divisions had subordinate counterintelligence branches, as well as a smaller central counterintelligence staff. Aldrich Ames was in the Counterintelligence Branch of Europe Division, where he was responsible for directing the analysis of Soviet intelligence operations. US military services have had a similar and even more complex split.

This kind of division clearly requires close coordination, and this in fact occurs on a daily basis. The interdependence of the US counterintelligence community is also manifest in its relationships with liaison services. The counterintelligence community cannot cut off these relationships because of concern about security, but experience has shown that it must calculate the risks involved.

On the other side of the CI coin, counterespionage has one purpose that transcends all others in importance: penetration. The emphasis which the KGB places on penetration is evident in the cases already discussed from the defensive or security viewpoint. The best security system in the world cannot provide an adequate defense against it because the technique involves people. The only way to be sure that an enemy has been contained is to know his plans in advance and in detail.

In the British service, the cases of the Cambridge Five, and the later suspicions about MI5 chief Sir Roger Hollis caused great internal dissension. Clearly, the British were penetrated by Philby, but it has never been determined, in any public forum, if there were other serious penetrations. In the US service, there was also significant disruption over the contradictory accusations about moles from defectors Anatoliy Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko, and their respective supporters in CIA and the British Security Service (MI5). Golitsyn was generally believed by Angleton. George Kisevalter, the CIA operations officer that was the CIA side of the joint US-UK handling of Oleg Penkovsky, did not believe Angleton&#x27;s theory that Nosenko was a KGB plant. Nosenko had exposed John Vassall, a KGB asset principally in the British Admiralty, but there were arguments Vassall was a KGB sacrifice to protect other operations, including Nosenko and a possibly more valuable source on the Royal Navy.

=== Defensive counterintelligence ===
Defensive counterintelligence starts by looking for places in one&#x27;s own organization that could easily be exploited by foreign intelligence services (FIS). FIS is an established term of art in the counterintelligence community, and, in today&#x27;s world, &quot;foreign&quot; is shorthand for &quot;opposing.&quot; Opposition might indeed be a country, but it could be a transnational group or an internal insurgent group. Operations against a FIS might be against one&#x27;s own nation, or another friendly nation. The range of actions that might be done to support a friendly government can include a wide range of functions, certainly including military or counterintelligence activities, but also humanitarian aid and aid to development (&quot;nation building&quot;).

Terminology here is still emerging, and &quot;transnational group&quot; could include not only terrorist groups but also transnational criminal organization. Transnational criminal organizations include the drug trade, money laundering, extortion targeted against computer or communications systems, smuggling, etc.

&quot;Insurgent&quot; could be a group opposing a recognized government by criminal or military means, as well as conducting clandestine intelligence and covert operations against the government in question, which could be one&#x27;s own or a friendly one.

Counterintelligence and counterterrorism analyses provide strategic assessments of foreign intelligence and terrorist groups and prepare tactical options for ongoing operations and investigations. Counterespionage may involve proactive acts against foreign intelligence services, such as double agents, deception, or recruiting foreign intelligence officers. While clandestine HUMINT sources can give the greatest insight into the adversary&#x27;s thinking, they may also be most vulnerable to the adversary&#x27;s attacks on one&#x27;s own organization. Before trusting an enemy agent, remember that such people started out as being trusted by their own countries and may still be loyal to that country.

=== Offensive counterintelligence operations ===
Wisner emphasized his own, and Dulles&#x27;, views that the best defense against foreign attacks on, or infiltration of, intelligence services is active measures against those hostile services. This is often called counterespionage: measures taken to detect enemy espionage or physical attacks against friendly intelligence services, prevent damage and information loss, and, where possible, to turn the attempt back against its originator. Counterespionage goes beyond being reactive and actively tries to subvert hostile intelligence service, by recruiting agents in the foreign service, by discrediting personnel actually loyal to their own service, and taking away resources that would be useful to the hostile service. All of these actions apply to non-national threats as well as to national organizations.

If the hostile action is in one&#x27;s own country or in a friendly one with co-operating police, the hostile agents may be arrested, or, if diplomats, declared persona non grata. From the perspective of one&#x27;s own intelligence service, exploiting the situation to the advantage of one&#x27;s side is usually preferable to arrest or actions that might result in the death of the threat. The intelligence priority sometimes comes into conflict with the instincts of one&#x27;s own law enforcement organizations, especially when the foreign threat combines foreign personnel with citizens of one&#x27;s country.

In some circumstances, arrest may be a first step in which the prisoner is given the choice of co-operating or facing severe consequence up to and including a death sentence for espionage. Co-operation may consist of telling all one knows about the other service but preferably actively assisting in deceptive actions against the hostile service.

=== Counterintelligence protection of intelligence services ===
Defensive counterintelligence specifically for intelligence services involves risk assessment of their culture, sources, methods and resources. Risk management must constantly reflect those assessments, since effective intelligence operations are often risk-taking. Even while taking calculated risks, the services need to mitigate risk with appropriate countermeasures.

FIS are especially able to explore open societies and, in that environment, have been able to subvert insiders in the intelligence community. Offensive counterespionage is the most powerful tool for finding penetrators and neutralizing them, but it is not the only tool. Understanding what leads individuals to turn on their own side is the focus of Project Slammer. Without undue violations of personal privacy, systems can be developed to spot anomalous behavior, especially in the use of information systems.

Decision makers require intelligence free from hostile control or manipulation. Since every intelligence discipline is subject to manipulation by our adversaries, validating the reliability of intelligence from all collection platforms is essential. Accordingly, each counterintelligence organization will validate the reliability of sources and methods that relate to the counterintelligence mission in accordance with common standards. For other mission areas, the USIC will examine collection, analysis, dissemination practices, and other intelligence activities and will recommend improvements, best practices, and common standards.

Intelligence is vulnerable not only to external but also to internal threats. Subversion, treason, and leaks expose vulnerabilities, governmental and commercial secrets, and intelligence sources and methods. The insider threat has been a source of extraordinary damage to US national security, as with Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and Edward Lee Howard, all of whom had access to major clandestine activities. Had an electronic system to detect anomalies in browsing through counterintelligence files been in place, Robert Hanssen&#x27;s searches for suspicion of activities of his Soviet (and later Russian) paymasters might have surfaced early. Anomalies might simply show that an especially-creative analyst has a trained intuition possible connections and is trying to research them.

Adding the new tools and techniques to [national arsenals], the counterintelligence community will seek to manipulate foreign spies, conduct aggressive investigations, make arrests and,
where foreign officials are involved, expel them for engaging in practices inconsistent
with their diplomatic status or exploit them as an unwitting channel for deception, or turn them into witting double agents. &quot;Witting&quot; is a term of intelligence art that indicates that one is not only aware of a fact or piece of information but also aware of its connection to intelligence activities.

Victor Suvorov, the pseudonym of a former Soviet military intelligence (GRU) officer, makes the point that a defecting HUMINT officer is a special threat to walk-in or other volunteer assets of the country that he is leaving. Volunteers who are &quot;warmly welcomed&quot; do not take into consideration the fact that they are despised by hostile intelligence agents.
=== Counterintelligence force protection source operations ===
Attacks against military, diplomatic, and related facilities are a very real threat, as demonstrated by the 1983 attacks against French and US peacekeepers in Beirut, the 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, 1998 attacks on Colombian bases and on U.S. embassies (and local buildings) in Kenya and Tanzania the 2000 attack on the &quot;USS Cole&quot;, and many others. The U.S. military force protection measures are the set of actions taken against military personnel and family members, resources, facilities and critical information, and most countries have a similar doctrine for protecting those facilities and conserving the potential of the forces. Force protection is defined to be a defense against deliberate attack, not accidents or natural disasters.

Counterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations (CFSO) are human source operations, normally clandestine in nature, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national level coverage, as well as satisfying the combatant commander&#x27;s intelligence requirements. Military police and other patrols that mingle with local people may indeed be valuable HUMINT sources for counterintelligence awareness, but are not themselves likely to be CFSOs. Gleghorn distinguishes between the protection of national intelligence services, and the intelligence needed to provide combatant commands with the information they need for force protection. There are other HUMINT sources, such as military reconnaissance patrols that avoid mixing with foreign personnel, that indeed may provide HUMINT, but not HUMINT especially relevant to counterintelligence. Active countermeasures, whether for force protection, protection of intelligence services, or protection of national security interests, are apt to involve HUMINT disciplines, for the purpose of detecting FIS agents, involving screening and debriefing of non-tasked human sources, also called casual or incidental sources. such as:
* walk-ins and write-ins (individuals who volunteer information)
* unwitting sources (any individual providing useful information to counterintelligence, who in the process of divulging such information may not know they are aiding an investigation)
* defectors and enemy prisoners of war (EPW)
* refugee populations and expatriates
* interviewees (individuals contacted in the course of an investigation)
* official liaison sources.

Force protection, for forces deployed in host countries, occupation duty, and even at home, may not be supported sufficiently by a national-level counterterrorism organization alone. In a country, colocating FPCI personnel, of all services, with military assistance and advisory units, allows agents to build relationships with host nation law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get to know the local environments, and improve their language skills. FPCI needs a legal domestic capability to deal with domestic terrorism threats.

As an example of terrorist planning cycles, the Khobar Towers attack shows the need for long-term FPCI. &quot;The Hizballah operatives believed to have conducted this attack began intelligence collection and planning activities in 1993. They recognized American military personnel were billeted at Khobar Towers in the fall of 1994 and began surveillance of the facility, and continued to plan, in June 1995. In March 1996, Saudi Arabian border guards arrested a Hizballah member attempting plastic explosive into the country, leading to the arrest of two more Hizballah members. Hizballah leaders recruited replacements for those arrested, and continued planning for the attack.&quot;

==Defensive counterintelligence operations==

In U.S. doctrine, although not necessarily that of other countries, CI is now seen as primarily a counter to FIS HUMINT. In the 1995 US Army counterintelligence manual, CI had a broader scope against the various intelligence collection disciplines. Some of the overarching CI tasks are described as
:#Developing, maintaining, and disseminating multidiscipline threat data and intelligence files on organizations, locations, and individuals of CI interest. This includes insurgent and terrorist infrastructure and individuals who can assist in the CI mission.
:#Educating personnel in all fields of security. A component of this is the multidiscipline threat briefing. Briefings can and should be tailored, both in scope and classification level. Briefings could then be used to familiarize supported commands with the nature of the multidiscipline threat posed against the command or activity.

More recent US joint intelligence doctrine restricts its primary scope to counter-HUMINT, which usually includes counter-terror. It is not always clear, under this doctrine, who is responsible for all intelligence collection threats against a military or other resource. The full scope of US military counterintelligence doctrine has been moved to a classified publication, Joint Publication (JP) 2-01.2, &quot;Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Support to Joint Operations&quot;.

More specific countermeasures against intelligence collection disciplines are listed below
===Counter-HUMINT===
Counter-HUMINT deals with both the detection of hostile HUMINT sources within an organization, or the detection of individuals likely to become hostile HUMINT sources, as a mole or double agent. There is an additional category relevant to the broad spectrum of counterintelligence: why one becomes a terrorist. 

The acronym MICE:
: Money
: Ideology
: Compromise (or coercion)
: Ego
describes the most common reasons people break trust and disclose classified materials, reveal operations to hostile services, or join terrorist groups. It makes sense, therefore, to monitor trusted personnel for risks in these areas, such as financial stress, extreme political views, potential vulnerabilities for blackmail, and excessive need for approval or intolerance of criticism. With luck, problems in an employee can be caught early, assistance can be provided to correct them, and not only is espionage avoided, but a useful employee retained.

Sometimes, the preventive and neutralization tasks overlap, as in the case of Earl Edwin Pitts. Pitts had been an FBI agent who had sold secret information to the Soviets, and, after the fall of the USSR, to the Russians. He was caught by an FBI false flag sting, in which FBI agents, posing as Russian FSB agents, came to Pitts with an offer to &quot;reactivate&quot; him. His activities seemed motivated by both money and ego over perceived bad treatment when he was an FBI agent. His sentence required him to tell the FBI all he knew of foreign agents. Ironically, he told them of suspicious actions by Robert Hanssen, which were not taken seriously at the time.

==== Motivations for information and operations disclosure ====

To go beyond slogans, Project Slammer was an effort of the Intelligence Community Staff, under the Director of Central Intelligence, to come up with characteristics of an individual likely to commit espionage against the United States.
It &quot;examines espionage by interviewing and psychologically assessing actual espionage subjects. Additionally, persons knowledgeable of subjects are contacted to better understand the subjects&#x27; private lives and how they are perceived by others while conducting espionage.&quot;

According to a press report about Project Slammer and Congressional oversight of counterespionage, one fairly basic function is observing one&#x27;s own personnel for behavior that either suggests that they could be targets for foreign HUMINT, or may already have been subverted. News reports indicate that in hindsight, red flags were flying but not noticed. In several major penetrations of US services, such as Aldrich Ames, the Walker ring or Robert Hanssen, the individual showed patterns of spending inconsistent with their salary. Some people with changed spending may have a perfectly good reason, such as an inheritance or even winning the lottery, but such patterns should not be ignored.

Personnel in sensitive positions, who have difficulty getting along with peers, may become risks for being compromised with an approach based on ego. William Kampiles, a low-level worker in the CIA Watch Center, sold, for a small sum, the critical operations manual on the KH-11 reconnaissance satellite. To an interviewer, Kampiles suggested that if someone had noted his &quot;problem&quot;—constant conflicts with supervisors and co-workers—and brought in outside counseling, he might not have stolen the KH-11 manual.

By 1997, the Project Slammer work was being presented at public meetings of the Security Policy Advisory Board. While a funding cut caused the loss of impetus in the mid-nineties, there are research data used throughout the security community. They emphasize the 

===Counter-SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)===

Military and security organizations will provide secure communications, and may monitor less secure systems, such as commercial telephones or general Internet connections, to detect inappropriate information being passed through them. Education on the need to use secure communications, and instruction on using them properly so that they do not become vulnerable to specialized technical interception.

===Counter-IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)===
The basic methods of countering IMINT are to know when the opponent will use imaging against one&#x27;s own side, and interfering with the taking of images. In some situations, especially in free societies, it must be accepted that public buildings may always be subject to photography or other techniques.

Countermeasures include putting visual shielding over sensitive targets or camouflaging them. When countering such threats as imaging satellites, awareness of the orbits can guide security personnel to stop an activity, or perhaps cover the sensitive parts, when the satellite is overhead. This also applies to imaging on aircraft and UAVs, although the more direct expedient of shooting them down, or attacking their launch and support area, is an option in wartime.

===Counter-OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)===
While the concept well precedes the recognition of a discipline of OSINT, the idea of censorship of material directly relevant to national security is a basic OSINT defense. In democratic societies, even in wartime, censorship must be watched carefully lest it violate reasonable freedom of the press, but the balance is set differently in different countries and at different times.

The United Kingdom is generally considered to have a very free press, but there is the DA-Notice, formerly D-notice system. Many British journalists find that the system is used fairly, but there will always be arguments. In the specific context of counterintelligence, note that Peter Wright, a former senior member of the Security Service who left their service without his pension, moved to Australia before publishing his book Spycatcher. While much of the book was reasonable commentary, it revealed some specific and sensitive techniques, such as Operation RAFTER, a means of detecting the existence and setting of radio receivers.

===Counter-MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence)===
MASINT is mentioned here for completeness, but the discipline contains so varied a range of technologies that a type-by-type strategy is beyond the current scope. One example, however, can draw on the Operation RAFTER technique revealed in Wright&#x27;s book. With the knowledge that Radiofrequency MASINT was being used to pick up an internal frequency in radio receivers, it would be possible to design a shielded receiver that would not radiate the signal that RAFTER monitored.

==Theory of offensive counterintelligence==
Offensive techniques in current counterintelligence doctrine are principally directed against human sources, so counterespionage can be considered a synonym for offensive counterintelligence. At the heart of exploitation operations is the objective to degrade the effectiveness of an adversary&#x27;s intelligence service or a terrorist organization. Offensive counterespionage (and counterterrorism) is done one of two ways, either by manipulating the adversary (FIS or terrorist) in some manner or by disrupting the adversary&#x27;s normal operations.

Defensive counterintelligence operations that succeed in breaking up a clandestine network by arresting the persons involved or by exposing their actions demonstrate that disruption is quite measurable and effective against FIS if the right actions are taken. If defensive counterintelligence stops terrorist attacks, it has succeeded.

Offensive counterintelligence seeks to damage the long-term capability of the adversary. If it can lead a national adversary into putting large resources into protecting from a nonexistent threat, or if it can lead terrorists to assume that all of their &quot;sleeper&quot; agents in a country have become unreliable and must be replaced (and possibly killed as security risks), there is a greater level of success than can be seen from defensive operations alone, To carry out offensive counterintelligence, however, the service must do more than detect; it must manipulate persons associated with the adversary.

The Canadian Department of National Defence makes some useful logical distinctions in its Directive on its
National Counter-Intelligence Unit. The terminology is not the same as used by other services, but the distinctions are useful:
:#&quot;Counter-intelligence (&quot;contre-ingérence&quot;) means activities concerned with identifying and counteracting threats to the security of DND employees, CF members, and DND and CF property and information, that are posed by hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.&quot; This corresponds to defensive counterintelligence in other services.
:#&quot;Security intelligence (&quot;renseignement de sécurité&quot;) means intelligence on the identity, capabilities and intentions of hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.&quot; This does &quot;not&quot; (&quot;emphasis added&quot;) correspond directly to offensive counterintelligence, but is the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence.
:#The duties of the Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit include &quot;identifying, investigating and countering threats to the security of the DND and the CF from espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, and other criminal activity; identifying, investigating and countering the actual or possible compromise of highly classified or special DND or CF material; conducting CI security investigations, operations and security briefings and debriefings to counter threats to, or to preserve, the security of DND and CF interests.&quot; This mandate is a good statement of a mandate to conduct offensive counterintelligence.

DND further makes the useful clarification,
&quot;The security intelligence process &quot;should not be confused with&quot; the liaison conducted by members of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) for the purpose of &quot;obtaining criminal intelligence,&quot; as the collection of this type of information is within their mandate.&quot;

Manipulating an intelligence professional, himself trained in counterintelligence, is no easy task, unless he is already predisposed toward the opposing side. Any effort that does not start with a sympathetic person will take a long-term commitment, and creative thinking to overcome the defenses of someone who knows he is a counterintelligence target and also knows counterintelligence techniques.

Terrorists on the other hand, although they engage in deception as a function of security appear to be more prone to manipulation or deception by a well-placed adversary than are foreign intelligence services. This is in part due to the fact that many terrorist groups, whose members &quot;often mistrust and fight among each other, disagree, and vary in conviction.&quot;, are not as internally cohesive as foreign intelligence services, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to both deception and manipulation.

<doc id="238031" wikidata="Q7205686" url="?curid=238031" title="Pluto Saves the Ship">
<text>&quot;Pluto Saves the Ship&quot; is a 51-page black-and-white comic book story scripted by writers Carl Barks, Jack Hannah and Nick George from a plot devised possibly by a publisher, and drawn by Disney animation layout artist Bruce Bushman. It was originally printed in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Large Feature Comics&quot; #7 in July 1942, and is one of the first American Disney comics ever made that was not reprinted from newspaper comic strips. It is Barks&#x27; first comic book work, and Pluto&#x27;s first comic book adventure. This was followed in October 1942 by &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;, the Disney characters&#x27; first entry in Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; anthology series.

In the story, Pluto foils Nazi saboteurs on a Navy cruiser. Barks said later that &quot;it was only a one-shot special designed to take advantage of the wartime jitters.&quot;

Barks wrote the story with Jack Hannah and Nick George, fellow animators at the Disney Studio. The story was partly inspired by two Pluto cartoons that Barks worked on, &quot;Bone Trouble&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Army Mascot&quot; (1942).

Barks only produced two stories that took place in the Mickey Mouse universe; the other is &quot;The Riddle of the Red Hat&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #79, published August 1945).

&quot;Pluto Saves the Ship&quot; has been reprinted in many European countries over the last few decades. The only time it&#x27;s been reprinted in English was in &quot;The Carl Barks Library&quot; black and white hardcover collection, in 1988. It has not yet been revealed whether the story will be included in the Fantagraphics Books collection &quot;The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library&quot;.

<doc id="238033" wikidata="Q3587621" url="?curid=238033" title="Electrocution">
<text>Electrocution is death or severe injury caused by electric shock from electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from &quot;electro&quot; and &quot;execution&quot;, but it is also used for accidental death.

The term &quot;electrocution&quot; was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred to only electrical execution and not other electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word &quot;electrocution&quot; eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.

== Origins ==
In the Netherlands, in 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek&#x27;s lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from human-made electricity. By the mid-19th century high-voltage electrical systems came into use to power arc lighting for theatrical stage lighting and lighthouses leading to the first recorded accidental death in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France, touched a 250-volt wire.

The spread of arc light–based street lighting systems (which at the time ran at a voltage above 3,000 volts) after 1880 led to many people dying from coming in contact with these high-voltage lines, a strange new phenomenon which seemed to kill instantaneously without leaving a mark on the victim. This would lead to execution by electricity in the electric chair in the early 1890s as an official method of capital punishment in the U.S. state of New York, thought to be a more humane alternative to hanging. After an 1881 death in Buffalo, New York, caused by a high-voltage arc lighting system, Alfred P. Southwick sought to develop this phenomenon into a way to execute condemned criminals. Southwick, a dentist, based his device on the dental chair.

The next nine years saw a promotion by Southwick, the New York state Gerry commission (which included Southwick) recommending execution by electricity, a June 4, 1888 law making it the state form of execution on January 2, 1889, and a further state committee of doctors and lawyers to finalize the details of the method used.

The adoption of the electric chair became mixed up in the &quot;war of currents&quot; between Thomas Edison&#x27;s direct current system and industrialist George Westinghouse&#x27;s alternating current system in 1889 when noted anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown became a consultant to the committee. Brown pushed, with the assistance and sometimes collusion of Edison Electric and Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, for the successful adoption of alternating current to power the chair, an attempt to portray AC as a public menace and the &quot;executioners&#x27; current&quot;.

=== Etymology ===

In May 1889 the state of New York sentenced its first criminal, a street merchant and convicted murderer named William Kemmler, to be executed in their new form of capital punishment. Tabloid newspapers, trying to describe this new form of electrical execution, started settling on &quot;electrocution,&quot; a portmanteau word derived from &quot;electro&quot; and &quot;execution&quot;. 

It was not the only choice of word people were considering. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial column noted words such as &quot;&quot;Westinghouse&quot;d&quot; (after the Westinghouse Electric alternating current equipment that was to be used), &quot;&quot;Gerry&quot;cide&quot; (after Elbridge Thomas Gerry, who headed the New York death penalty commission that suggested adopting the electric chair), and &quot;&quot;Brown&quot;ed&quot; (after anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown). Thomas Edison preferred the words &quot;dynamort&quot;, &quot;ampermort&quot; and &quot;electromort&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; hated the word electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by &quot;pretentious ignoramuses&quot;.

== Medical aspects ==

Electrocutions are relatively rare, causing about 1000 fatalities in the United States each year, with about 150 additional cases attributed to lightning. Fish &amp; Geddes state: &quot;Contact with 20 mA of low-frequency electrical current through the chest can be fatal&quot;. The threshold electrical current RMS magnitude required to trigger cardiac arrest is well studied. The mechanism of cardiac arrest is typically ventricular fibrillation as opposed to ventricular asystole. Ventricular fibrillation prevents effective pumping of blood through the vascular system resulting in death, if not quickly reverted to a more effective cardiac rhythm.

Three elements are required for an electrocution to occur: (a) a charged electrical source, (b) a current pathway through the victim, (c) a ground. The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ.

Death can occur from any shock that carries enough sustained current through a vital organ or tissue. When an electric current flows through the brain or spinal cord, death due to asphyxiation may occur as a result of interference with the central nervous system&#x27;s control of respiration, or through direct paralysis of the chest muscles. Low currents (70–700 mA) usually trigger fibrillation in the heart, which is reversible via defibrillator but is nearly always fatal without intervention. Currents as low as 30 mA AC or 300–500 mA DC applied to the body surface can cause fibrillation. Large currents (&gt; 1 A) cause permanent damage via burns and cellular damage.

==Suicide==
Electrocution is an uncommon form of suicide.

In Nazi concentration camps, prisoners commonly committed suicide by throwing themselves at the wire electric fences, colloquially known as &quot;going to the wire.&quot;

<text>Anne Shirley is a fictional character introduced in the 1908 novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; by L. M. Montgomery. Shirley is featured throughout the classic book series, which revolves around her life and family in 19th and 20th-century Prince Edward Island, in Canada.

==Conception==

During the conception of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York&#x27;s &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot; and put on the wall of her bedroom, as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her &quot;youthful idealism and spirituality.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==

===Anne&#x27;s early life===
Anne Shirley was born in the fictional town of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia to schoolteachers Walter and Bertha Shirley (née Willis). No specific birthdate is given, but references in later works suggest her date of birth is 5 March 1865. Anne was orphaned as an infant of three months, when her parents died of typhoid fever. Without any other relations, Anne was taken in by the Shirleys&#x27; housekeeper, Mrs. Thomas. After the death of her husband, Mr. Thomas, Anne lived with the troubled Hammond family for some years and was treated as little more than a servant until Mr. Hammond died, whereupon Mrs. Hammond divided her children amongst relatives and Anne was sent to the orphanage at Hopetown. She considered herself as &quot;cursed&quot; by twins — Mrs. Hammond had three sets of twins whom Anne helped raise.

===Arrival at Green Gables, Avonlea===
At the age of 11, Anne was taken from the Hopetown orphanage to the neighbouring province of Prince Edward Island, which she regarded as her true home ever after. Unfortunately, she arrived by mistake — her sponsors, the siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, wanted to adopt a boy to help them on their farm, but the neighbour with whom they had sent the message was certain they had requested a girl instead. Matthew quickly became fascinated by the girl&#x27;s good-hearted spirit, charming enthusiasm, and lively imagination, and wanted her to stay at Green Gables from the very first. Marilla&#x27;s reaction was to send her back to the orphanage, but she was eventually won over by Anne&#x27;s quirky &quot;joie de vivre&quot; — and by the fact that another woman, much harder than herself, was set to take Anne should Marilla decline to keep her. The American scholar Joseph Brennan noted that for Anne &quot;all things are alive&quot;, as she imagines trees by the roadside welcoming her to Green Gables while a leaning plum tree makes her think that it is offering a veil just for her. Anne at one point says &quot;Maples are such social things&quot; and likes Lover&#x27;s Lane because &quot;...you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.&quot;

Anne has great powers of imagination, fed by books of poetry and romance, and a passion for &quot;romantic&quot; and beautiful names and places. When she sees a road lined with apple trees in bloom, she falls silent for a moment before naming the road the &quot;White Way of Delight&quot;; when spying a pond at the Barry homestead, she christens it the &quot;Lake of Shining Waters.&quot; Anne had been starved of love at the orphanages she has lived at, and for her, Green Gables is the only true home she has ever known. Anne&#x27;s imaginative nature matches well with her passionate, warm side, full of bubbly optimism and enthusiasm. Her impulsive nature leads her into all sorts of &quot;scrapes&quot;, and she alternates between being carried away with enthusiasm and being in the &quot;depths of despair&quot;. One scholar Elizabeth Watson has observed a recurring theme, noting Anne&#x27;s observations of sunsets mirror her own development. Under the White Way of Delight, Anne watches the sun set which is to her a glory where &quot;a painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle&quot;. By the end of the novel, when Anne watches the sun set, it set across a backdrop of &quot;flowers of quiet happiness&quot;, as Anne is slowly falling in love with Gilbert.

Anne initially made a poor impression on the townsfolk of Avonlea with an outburst at the Cuthberts&#x27; neighbour, the outspoken gossip Mrs. Rachel Lynde, but this was amended by an equally impassioned apology. Anne soon became &#x27;bosom friends&#x27; with a girl from a neighbouring farm, Diana Barry. Together with Matthew, Diana is Anne&#x27;s &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. The friendship was disrupted by the temporary enmity of Diana&#x27;s mother, after Anne mistakenly made Diana drunk with Marilla&#x27;s homemade currant wine, mistaking it for raspberry cordial. Anne was soon restored to Mrs. Barry&#x27;s good graces by saving the life of Diana&#x27;s little sister, Minnie May. Minnie May had an attack of the croup, which Anne was able to cure with a bottle of ipecac and knowledge acquired while caring for the numerous Hammond twins. Throughout her childhood, Anne continued to find herself in similar &quot;scrapes&quot;, often through mistakes and misunderstandings, and no fault of her own. At one point Anne &quot;admires to the point of nuttiness&quot; an amethyst brooch, which she is falsely accused of stealing, a crime she has to confess to in order to attend a picnic. Anne tends to define herself in opposition to older people via humour, and forges a relationship with Marilla Cuthbert via humour. The dreamy and imaginative Anne asks that Marilla call her &quot;Cordelia&quot; and &quot;Geraldine&quot; as Anne likes to imagine herself as somebody that she is not.

Anne also formed a complex relationship with Gilbert Blythe, who was two years older than Anne but studying at her level, having had his schooling interrupted when his father became ill. On their first meeting as schoolmates, Gilbert teased Anne with the nickname &quot;Carrots&quot;. Anne, perceiving it as a personal insult due to sensitivity over her hair colour, became so angry that she broke her slate over his head. When her teacher punished her by making her stand in front of the class, and then later punishes her for tardiness by making her sit with &quot;the boys&quot;, specifically Gilbert Blythe, Anne forms a long-lasting hatred of Gilbert Blythe. Anne tells Diana that &quot;Gilbert Blythe has hurt me &quot;excruciatingly&quot;&quot;. Throughout &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, Gilbert repeatedly displays admiration for Anne, but she coldly rebuffs him. Her grudge persisted even after he saved her from a near-disastrous reenactment of Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot; when her leaky boat sank into the pond. After this almost fatal accident, Gilbert pleaded with Anne to become his friend but she hesitated and refused, although she soon came to regret it. For the rest of their school years in Avonlea, they competed as intellectual rivals for the top of the class, although the competition was entirely good-natured on Gilbert&#x27;s side. However, Anne forms the &quot;Story Club&quot; at the age of 13, which she tells the story of two girls named Cordelia and Geraldine (both of which were aliases she had adopted earlier) who both love Bertram - a variant of Gilbert. The story ends with Cordelia pushing Geraldine into a river to drown with Bertram, which suggests subconsciously Anne is attracted to Gilbert. Near the end, Anne and Gilbert walk together to Green Gables, where Gilbert only-jokingly says: &quot;You&#x27;ve thwarted destiny long enough.&quot; At the end of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, Anne looks out of her window admiring Avonlea as an &quot;ideal world of dreams&quot;, through she sees a &quot;bend in the road&quot; thanks to Gilbert. Mrs. Lynde at the beginning of the book was the self-important busybody of Avonlea who dominated the community; at the end, the book hints that Anne will play the same role, but only much better in the years to come.

===Avonlea schoolteacher years===
Immediately after graduating from Avonlea&#x27;s public school, Anne and Gilbert both went to Queen&#x27;s Academy in Charlottetown, which trained them for teaching and university studies. They split the most prestigious prizes between themselves, and remained &quot;enemies&quot; all through their studies at Queen&#x27;s. Anne&#x27;s grades, especially in English, won her a scholarship to Redmond College, but Matthew&#x27;s death and Marilla&#x27;s failing eyesight near the end of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; led Anne to defer her enrollment at Redmond so that she could stay to help at Green Gables. Gilbert had been appointed as the Avonlea schoolteacher for the following year, but as an act of kindness, he instead took the position at White Sands School and gave the Avonlea position to Anne. She thanked him for the sacrifice and they made amends, becoming friends at last after five years of intense rivalry. Anne reads some poetry by Virgil, but abandons the book as the beauty of sun-kissed summer day and her coming career as a teacher inspire a sense of happiness and unity with nature.

In &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, Marilla decided to take in her cousin&#x27;s twin children, Davy and Dora (continuing Anne&#x27;s &quot;curse of twins&quot;). However, Anne took to them, especially Davy, immediately. Anne learns to manage the twins via a mixture of good humour and understanding. Besides teaching, Anne joins the Village Improvement Society that works to demolish ugly abandoned houses, repaint the village and plant a garden at the crossroads. The mean-spirited neighbour Mr. Harrison attacks Anne as a &quot;red-headed snippet&quot; who sits around &quot;reading yellow-covered novels&quot;. When a famous author Mrs. Morgan visits Avonlea, Anne greets her with a nose turned red owing to her mistakes in applying the wrong skin lotion as Anne goes to absurd lengths to be prepared to meet the world-famous Mrs. Morgan, which results in chaos, though all works out well in the end. Meeting Mrs. Morgan inspires Anne to try writing, where trapped in an abandoned hen-house, she writes out a dialogue between flowers and the birds in the garden. Another scrape occurs at her school, where Anne forces a student to throw a package into the school stove, unaware that the offending package were firecrackers. The following year, Rachel Lynde&#x27;s husband Thomas died and Rachel moved in with Marilla at Green Gables, leaving Anne free to continue her education at Redmond College (based on Dalhousie College) in Kingsport, Nova Scotia. Anne was pleased because Gilbert would also be going to Redmond the following year. After the wedding of her friend Miss Lavendar, Anne first realized that there was a possibility that Gilbert felt more for her than friendship, and &quot;The page of girlhood had been turned, as by an unseen finger, and the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery, its pain and gladness.&quot; Anne once again walks with Gilbert while the narrator notes, &quot;Behind them the little stone house brooded among the shadows. It was lonely but not forsaken. It had not yet done with dreams and laughter and joy of life&quot;.

===Redmond College===
In &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;, Anne&#x27;s academic and social life blossom at Redmond. Anne says at the beginning &quot;I&#x27;m going to study and grow and learn about things&quot;. Anne visits the house where she was born, in Bolingbroke, and ponders deeply how her mother died young, but at least knew the joys of love. During her time at Redmond, Anne writes two stories, one of which is rejected, but turned by Diana into a successful story, and another which is dismissed because it has no plot. Anne&#x27;s story &quot;Averil&#x27;s Atonement&quot; is edited by Diana into a successful story that sells well, but Anne sees the final published version as a travesty that mangles her artistic vision. Seeking poetical inspiration, Anne spends her time alone on Victoria Island (significantly named after the queen-empress whose empire stretched around the world), Anne withdraws into her own world of fantasies amid a landscape &quot;curtained with fine-spun, moonlit gloom, while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and water&quot;.

At the beginning of the novel, Anne and Gilbert, looking forward to a &quot;splendid four years at Redmond,&quot; wander around to the Haunted Wood to taste the &quot;delicious apples&quot; where &quot;under tawny skin was white, white flesh, faintly veined with red; and besides their own proper apple taste, they had a certain wild, delightful tang&quot;. The Canadian scholar Elizabeth Waterson noted the &quot;erotic&quot; overtones to the scene of the apple tasting in the Haunted Wood, as sign of Anne&#x27;s attraction to Gilbert of which she herself is not entirely aware. Anne&#x27;s favourite hangout is Patty&#x27;s Place, where she and her three best friends spent their evenings by a fireplace with three cats, two china dogs and a pot full of chrysanthemums that light up &quot;through the golden gloom like creamy moons&quot;.

Gilbert, who has always loved Anne, proposes to her, but she rejects him; at that time, Anne&#x27;s vision of love is rooted deeply in sentimental fantasies and she does not recognize her closeness to Gilbert as love. Anne calls Gilbert&#x27;s marriage proposal &quot;grotesque or horrible&quot;. She believes that she will fall in love with her &quot;prince,&quot; who would fit her childhood ideal of &quot;tall, dark, and handsome&quot;. Feeling deeply disappointed, Gilbert distances himself from Anne. Anne &quot;haughtily&quot; refuses Charlie Sloane&#x27;s offer of marriage. Anne later welcomes the courtship of the darkly handsome Roy Gardner whom she meets one rainy afternoon in the November of her junior year. After about a year and a half of courtship, he proposes in the park where they met, but Anne ends their relationship instead, realizing that she does not truly love him and he does not belong in her life. Anne reacts &quot;wildly,&quot; &quot;miserably,&quot; and &quot;desperately&quot; to his proposal. Anne quotes from a poem by Tennyson: &quot;Love in sequel works with Fate, and draws the veil from hidden worth&quot;.

After graduating from Redmond College with a B.A., Anne, now 22, returns to Avonlea and finds that life has moved on— her childhood friend Jane married a millionaire, and her best friend Diana Barry (now Diana Wright) has given birth to her firstborn. Anne still does not believe she is in love with Gilbert, but she is disappointed at the end of their friendship, and confused over her reaction to gossip that he is in love with Christine Stuart, a fellow Redmond student.

===Engagement to Gilbert===
Upon her return to Avonlea after staying with her friends Paul, Stephen, and Lavendar Irving at Echo Lodge, Anne learns that Gilbert is deathly ill with typhoid fever. Anne holds vigil in her room at Green Gables the night Gilbert&#x27;s fever breaks, realizing that she had always loved Gilbert only when faced with the prospect of losing him. Once Gilbert recovers from his illness, he proposes again to Anne, and she accepts. Gilbert offers her an autumnal fantasy &quot;of a home with a hearth-fire in it, a cat and a dog, the footsteps of friends -- and you!&quot;. It is explained that Christine had been engaged to someone else all along and Gilbert was only being friendly, having been asked by Christine&#x27;s brother to watch over her. Anne&#x27;s friend Phil Blake had written Gilbert, telling him to &quot;try again,&quot; and he rapidly recovered in order to take that advice. Anne and Gilbert once again walk in the &quot;haunted woods&quot; as &quot;king and queen in the bridal realm of love&quot;.

Their engagement lasts for three years. Her engagement ring is noted to be a circlet of pearls rather than a diamond, a stone which Anne said always disappointed her because it wasn&#x27;t the lovely purple she had dreamed of. Anne takes a job as a principal at Prince Edward Island&#x27;s second-largest town, Summerside, while Gilbert completes his three-year medical school course. During this time, Anne interacts with various eccentrics at both work and around the town. Significantly, Anne rises up to become the principal of the Summerside school, making her an equal with Gilbert. As both principal and a teacher, Anne has to deal with the difficult vice-principal Katherine Brooke, who goes out of her way to be rude to her. Brooke openly envies Anne&#x27;s ability to have a &quot;jolie vie,&quot; and tries to drag her down at every chance. A mature Anne has now risen above her youthful &quot;scrapes&quot; and is motivated by a desire to help others, realizing that Brooke&#x27;s nastiness is due to her own low self-esteem, and helps her find a job that suits her better than teaching.

===Marriage and motherhood===
Anne and Gilbert finally marry at Green Gables, the house Anne grew up in, and move to the village of Four Winds, P.E.I. There, they take up residence in a small house Anne dubs the &quot;House of Dreams&quot;, and Gilbert takes over his uncle&#x27;s medical practice in the nearby town of Glen St. Mary. Anne praises her &quot;house of dreams&quot; as &quot;like a creamy seashell stranded on the harbour shore&quot;, which is surrounded by fir trees &quot;enfolding secrets&quot; while the lane leading to the house is full of blossoming trees.The house looks up to a harbour on one side and a shining brook in the valley below. Anne&#x27;s major problem at the House of Dreams is helping her neighbour Leslie Moore, whose husband was left with brain damage after an accident, and who is as emotionally damaged as her husband is brain-damaged.

Anne&#x27;s first two children (one of whom dies in infancy) are born in the House of Dreams, before Anne and Gilbert and their growing family reluctantly move to larger quarters. In a moment of theological reflection, Anne questions if the death of her child is the &quot;will of God&quot;, using phrases exploring the theodical question of death and pain in a universe presided by a just God that are identical to those Montgomery used in her diary after her second son was stillborn. After Anne&#x27;s loss, she and Leslie bond as the two women share their stories of pain as they &quot;talk it out&quot;, leading them to hold hands and declare: &quot;We are both women—and friends forever&quot;. Anne and Gilbert live the rest of their lives in Glen St. Mary, in a large house they name Ingleside. They have a total of seven children between approximately 1895-1900: Joyce (or &quot;Joy&quot;) (who dies very soon after her birth at the House of Dreams), James Matthew (&quot;Jem&quot;), Walter Cuthbert, twin girls Anne (&quot;Nan&quot;) and Diana (&quot;Di&quot;), Shirley (the youngest son), and Bertha Marilla (&quot;Rilla&quot;). Anne is quite ill after the births of both Joyce and Shirley, but recovers both times. A major problem for Anne emerges when Gilbert&#x27;s obnoxious Aunt Mary Maria visits and refuses to leave, tormenting Anne in various ways.

Anne&#x27;s children enjoy a happy, even idyllic childhood, spending much of their time playing and adventuring in a nearby hollow they name Rainbow Valley. Anne is a permissive mother who is never harsh on her children and does not object when they play hide-and-seek with the new minister&#x27;s children in the cemetery. When a friend objects, Anne replies: &quot;Why did they ever build that manse beside the graveyard in the first place?&quot;. Anne&#x27;s children are often bullied by nasty children, requiring their mother to provide much consolation. When Shirley reads about the theory of a Jocasta complex in one of Gilbert&#x27;s medical journals together with a warning about mothers kissing their children, she says: &quot;A man of course! No woman would ever write anything so silly and wicked&quot;. At one point, Anne tries to resume her writing career, publishing a very poetical obituary for a neighbour that is mocked as an &quot;obitchery&quot; by an ignorant, rude newspaper editor, though it is well received by everyone else. Anne herself has a comfortable life, with a live-in maid (Susan Baker) who effectively runs the household and is also Shirley&#x27;s primary caregiver after Anne falls ill giving birth to him. Upon recovering, Anne says: &quot;I find I go on living&quot;. After Anne recovers, she is involved in various ladies&#x27; committees in town, and travels to Europe with Gilbert for an extended tour of the European continent at one point, circa 1906.

But the spectre of World War I in 1914 changes things, and all three Blythe boys (as well as the fiancés of Nan and Rilla) eventually volunteer to fight in the war. The Blythe family, which follows the war closely, soon becomes familiar with far-away places such as Calais, Mons, Lodz, Ypres, Belgrade, Amiens, Prezemysl, Gallipoli, Antwerp and Kut al Amara. The sensitive and poetic Walter, the second of Anne&#x27;s sons to volunteer, is killed at Courcelette in 1916. Jem is listed as missing at the war&#x27;s conclusion, but after an agonizing five months, eventually emerges alive, having escaped from a POW camp. Montgomery knew John McCrae, the author of the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, and she modelled Walter partly on him.

===Anne the grandmother===
Anne&#x27;s final appearance occurs in the collection &quot;The Blythes Are Quoted&quot;. In this work, which is somewhat darker in tone than the previous &quot;Anne&quot; books, we see brief glimpses of Anne in a number of short stories that are primarily about other inhabitants of Glen St. Mary, and are set from the pre-World War I era through to the beginning of World War II. The book also features a number of poems, which are separately credited to Anne and her son Walter (plus one that was started by Walter and completed by Anne after his death).

We last see an older and wiser Anne, now in her mid-seventies, in the early days of World War II. &quot;Mrs. Dr. Blythe&quot;, as she is often referred to, is a well-known, oft-discussed figure in Glen St. Mary, who is loved by some, though other residents express small-minded jealousy or envy of both Anne and her family. While Anne has mellowed from the days of her youth, she and Gilbert still engage in sly, good-natured teasing of each other. She has continued to indulge in her love of matchmaking, and also writes poetry. She is still married to Gilbert and is now a grandmother to at least five, three of whom are old enough to be enlist to fight in the war: Jem&#x27;s sons Jem Jr. and Walter Jr., and Rilla&#x27;s son Gilbert. Also mentioned are Nan&#x27;s daughter Diana, Rilla&#x27;s daughter Rilla, and a granddaughter named &quot;Anne Blythe&quot;, who might be either Jem or Shirley&#x27;s child.

Though Anne gives up writing short stories shortly after becoming a mother, she continues to write poems throughout her life. These poems are regularly shared with the rest of the family, who offer comments, criticism and encouragement. Anne&#x27;s later work expressed deep difficulties with coming to terms with Walter&#x27;s demise, and with the idea of war; several characters comment that neither Anne nor Gilbert were ever quite the same after Walter&#x27;s death. Still, the couple are utterly devoted to each other and their family, and as the saga concludes, circa 1940, the Blythes remain pillars of their community who have enjoyed a 50-year marriage.

==Literary appearances==
After &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1908), Anne is the central character of subsequent novels by Montgomery: 
&quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; (1909), &quot;Anne of the Island&quot; (1915), &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot; (1917), &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; (1936; UK title &quot;Anne of Windy Willows&quot;), and &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot; (1939). Other books in the Anne series include &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot; (1919), which focuses on Anne&#x27;s children during their childhood, and &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; (1921), which focuses on Anne&#x27;s youngest daughter during World War I.

Anne also appears and is mentioned in &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot; and &quot;Further Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;, though the bulk of the stories in these volumes are about other characters. In &quot;The Blythes Are Quoted&quot; (published in an abridged format as &quot;The Road to Yesterday&quot; and in a restored, unabridged edition in 2009), Anne is a peripheral character as a grandmother with several grandchildren, at least three of whom are preparing to enlist in the Canadian army during the opening days of World War II. These were among the last stories Montgomery wrote before her death in 1942.

Anne Shirley also appears in Budge Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Before Green Gables&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; authorized by the heirs of L.M. Montgomery. Based on background information from the original series, the book tells of the first 11 years of Anne Shirley&#x27;s childhood, beginning with the brief happiness of Bertha and Walter Shirley&#x27;s marriage before their early deaths.

==Film and television==
Anne Shirley has been portrayed by many actresses in numerous film, television, radio, and theatrical versions since 1919. She was played by Mary Miles Minter in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1919) a silent film directed by William Desmond Taylor and released by Paramount Pictures. The film was heavily panned by Montgomery, who dismissed the Americanization of the story. Dawn O&#x27;Day starred in the subsequent RKO remake, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1934), which garnered such commercial success that O&#x27;Day became permanently billed as Anne Shirley in the 1940 sequel and her future works.

On television, Toby Tarnow starred in a musical adaption of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1956) which aired on CBC Television. The BBC serial &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1972) and its sequel, &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; (1975), featured Kim Braden as the titular character. Megan Follows starred in the television film &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1985), directed by Kevin Sullivan and produced by the CBC. Follows reprised her role in &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel&quot; (1987) and &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story&quot; (2000). The series garnered critical acclaim, its accolades including a Peabody Award and Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program.

Both Hannah Endicott-Douglas and Barbara Hershey starred &quot;Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning&quot; (2008), also directed by Sullivan. Ella Ballentine portrayed Anne in &quot;L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s Anne of Green Gables&quot; (2016) and its two sequels, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Good Stars&quot; (2017) and &quot;Anne of Green Gables: Fire &amp; Dew&quot; (2017) which aired on YTV. Amybeth McNulty starred in the CBC/Netflix episodic drama &quot;Anne with an E&quot; (2017–2019), which garnered the Canadian Screen Award for Best Dramatic Series twice, and won McNulty the accolade for Best Lead Actress.

==Reception and legacy==

Lennie Goodings, a publisher for Virago Press, chose Anne as her favourite fictional character, stating, &quot;The feisty, funny and above all unabashedly passionate Anne of Green Gables...[she] faces the world with absolutely nothing but the sheer force of her personality. I love her.&quot; Actress Christina Hendricks cites the character as the reason for dyeing her naturally blonde hair red since the age of 10.

The British scholar Faye Hammill observed that such is the popularity of Shirley that she has overshadowed her creator, L.M. Montgomery, as license plates in Prince Edward Island bear the slogan &quot;P.E.I Home of Anne of Green Gables&quot; rather than &quot;P.E.I Birthplace of L.M Montgomery&quot;. 

The actress Mary Miles Minter, who played Shirley in the 1919 film adaption of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, later had her career ruined when the film director William Desmond Taylor was murdered in 1922, and her name came up as a suspect, though she was never charged. When Minter attempted a comeback as an advice columnist later in the 1920s, she used the pen-name Anne Shirley in an attempt to restore her wholesome image, which had been ruined by the Taylor murder scandal. 

The actress Dawn O&#x27;Day, who played Shirley in the 1934 film adaption of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, liked the character so much she legally changed her name to Anne Shirley. 

Montgomery during her youth had experiences of what she called &quot;the flash&quot;-moments of quiet contemplation of the beauty of nature when she was walking alone that gave her emotional ecstasy and what she regarded as the awareness of a higher spiritual power running through nature and her. Despite Montgomery&#x27;s claim that Shirley was not autobiographical, the moments when Shirley experienced moments of a mystical communion with nature are almost word for word the same as Montgomery&#x27;s descriptions of &quot;the flash&quot; in her diary. 

Much of the appeal of the Anne books was due to increased urbanization and industrialization in the early 20th century, which led many people to look back nostalgically to a romanticized rural idyll when people still lived the &quot;simple life&quot;, which was precisely how publishers marketed the Anne books at the time. In Canada itself, many intellectuals tended to see modernity as a threatening phenomenon, and in turn linked the more unpleasant aspects of modernity to the United States, which was viewed at the time as a rapacious, bullying nation intent upon devouring its neighbours. Much of the appeal of the character of Anne to Canadian critics at the time was as a symbol of the wholesome, friendly quality of Canadian life, where people still retained traditional values, unlike American writers with their obsession with violence and sex in stories set in a depersonalized urban environment. Hammill observed that when some of the younger Canadian writers in the 1920s-30s attempted to ape American writers with unpleasant &quot;realistic&quot; stories focusing on sex and violence in the cities, they were denounced by the critics for their &quot;American&quot; stories with the obvious implication that such stories were not &quot;Canadian&quot;. As urbanization gathered pace in the early 20th century, &quot;regional literature&quot; depicting life in rural regions gained popularity in the English-speaking world, and in the United States, Canadian literature was seen as a type of &quot;regional literature&quot; as Canada with its vast tracts of forests and farmland together with its British heritage, where the people were proud to be part of the British empire, which gave Canada a rather quaint image in the United States as a backward, rustic place, where the traditional values lived on. Having won their independence in the Revolutionary War, for Americans in the early 20th century it was almost incomprehensible that people in English-Canada should want to be part of the British empire, which gave Canada the image of a very conservative society in the United States in this era. Given these views of Canada, many Americans were inclined to share the Canadian view of Shirley as an iconic symbol of Canada.

Brennan wrote the &quot;Anne&quot; books are determinedly Anglo-Canadian as French-Canadians hardly ever appear in the books. Brennan wrote: &quot;Anne&#x27;s dreams knew more of Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot; than of the rich culture of New France, of its &quot;voyageurs&quot;, its &quot;habitants&quot;, of heroines such as Maria Chapdelaine who appeared in Canadian letters (thanks to a young wander from France) when Montgomery&#x27;s Anne had already firmly settled in home and motherhood. Avonlea was not Péribonka. Yet an artist in words-and Montgomery was that-should not be held at fault for silence about a culture so unlike her own&quot;. Brennan noted that the &quot;Anne&quot; books reflected the &quot;quiet conservative society&quot; that was Prince Edward Island in the Victorian age with the characters being Protestants of English and/or Scottish extraction, and Anne supporting the Conservatives &quot;simply because her beloved Matthew voted Conservative&quot;.

In 1912, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was translated into Polish and published in a pirate edition in Warsaw with the book being credited to &quot;Anne Montgomery&quot;. The book was extremely popular in Poland and during the Second World War; the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (AK) resistance group issued editions of the book to remind its members what they were fighting for. Even through there is nothing about Poland in the &quot;Anne&quot; books, the AK still saw her as a symbol of the humanist values that they were defending. For a time, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was banned in Communist Poland, and the book circulated in samizdat editions, as Anne was seen as a symbol of individualism and an unwillingness to submit to authority, making her a popular heroine for those struggling against the Communist dictatorship. The Canadian scholar Mary Henley Rubio mentioned when visiting Warsaw in 1984, where she saw a version of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; being performed in a local theatre, and that when the audience learned she was from Canada, she found herself mobbed by the audience who all wanted her autograph as she came from the same land as their beloved Anne.

&quot;Akage no An&quot; (Red Haired Anne), as Shirley is known in Japan, is an extremely popular cultural icon in that country. From the time of the Meiji Restoration until 1945, the Japanese educational system (which was run jointly by the Army and Navy ministries) was designed to indoctrinate the students into &quot;Bushido&quot; (&quot;the way of the warrior&quot;), the fierce warrior code of the Samurai, as the purpose of schools in Japan at the time was to train the boys to be soldiers. The Japanese educational system unabashedly glorified war as the highest form of human activity, and taught the idea that the Emperor of Japan was a living god; the boys being taught it was the greatest honour to die for the Emperor, while the girls were taught it was the greatest honour to have sons to die for the Emperor. Alongside the militarism of the educational system went a mood of marked xenophobia and outright racism, with Japanese teachers during World War II telling their students that the Anglo-American &quot;white devils&quot; were cannibals whose favourite food was Asians. As part of the educational reforms during the American occupation (1945–52), it was decided that Japanese students needed something somewhat less militaristic and xenophobic to read than texts glorifying &quot;Bushido&quot; and &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was made mandatory reading in Japanese schools in 1952. Additionally, as part of the educational reforms in Japan, there was an effort to reduce the previous rampant xenophobia that characterized Japanese teaching until 1945, and it was felt the wholesome, lovable character of Anne Shirley would provide Japanese students with an example of how people in the West were not &quot;white devils&quot; as their government had told them during the war. As there were many orphans left over from World War II in 1952 Japan, the character of Shirley instantly caught on in Japan, and she has been one of the most loved characters in Japan since that time. Much of the appeal of &quot;Akage no An&quot; lies in her ability to rise above any situation due to her pluck and her willingness to challenge &quot;that most formidable of Japanese dragons, the bossy older matron.&quot;

Shirley is so popular in Japan that there is a school called The Anne Academy in Fukuoka, which teaches girls how to speak English with a Maritime accent, while in Okayama there is The School of Green Gables, a nursing school that teaches young women how to behave like Shirley. Hanako Muraoka, the Japanese woman who translated &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; into Japanese, has become a celebrity in her own right solely for translating the book, and in 2014 NHK aired a television mini-series titled &quot;Hanako to Anne&quot; about Muraoka&#x27;s life and her struggle to get &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; translated and published in Japan. Muraoka read &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; in 1939 and started translating the book the same year, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1952 that her translation of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was finally published in Japan. &quot;Hanako to Anne,&quot; which aired in 2014, was a great rating success, getting an average of 22% viewership in the Kanto region (the most populous part of Japan), and caused a doubling of Japanese tourists to Prince Edward Island. The series, which starred Yuriko Yoshitaka as Muraoka, suggested that there were many parallels between Muraoka&#x27;s life and Anne&#x27;s, and thus was a sort of retelling of Anne&#x27;s life in the late Meiji, Taishō and early Shōwa periods of Japanese history. In 1993, a theme park called Canadian World opened in Hokkaido whose most popular attraction was a reproduction of Green Gables. In 2010, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; wrote: &quot;It could almost be declared that Anne&#x27;s true home isn&#x27;t rural Prince Edward Island any more. It&#x27;s Japan, where Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s tale of Anne and her pigtailed innocence remains so popular that it has become ingrained in the national consciousness since the book&#x27;s original Japanese translation as &quot;Red-Haired Anne&quot; in 1952.&quot; In 2014, the Japanese diplomat Eiji Yamamoto told a journalist from the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;: &quot;Even though she&#x27;s an orphan, Anne is a free spirit, she says anything she wants. In the years after World War II, the Japanese people were poor. There were many orphans. And people had lost hope. They were anxious. Anne is an optimist. She helped people get courage.&quot;

The Canadian scholar Janice Kulyk Keefer noted the character of Shirley as depicted in film and television is sanitised compared to the book, writing:

Death, the bloody laws of nature, the tyranny of adults, violence-all poison the sweetness of ... Arcadia. And yet the idyllic vision is undercut by what we might call call &#x27;meta-idylls&#x27;, realized through the forces of magic, fantasy, mass-cultural cliche and language itself. Together, &#x27;menace&#x27; and &#x27;meta-idyll&#x27; produce subversive subtexts to each idyll.

In 2019, Canadian publishing company Bradan Press crowdfunded &quot;Anna Ruadh&quot;, a Scottish-Gaelic translation of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. It was released in 2020.

<text>Ingria (; ; ; ) is a historical region including, and adjacent to, what is now the city of Saint Petersburg in northwestern Russia. The region lies along the southeastern shore of the Gulf of Finland, bordered by Lake Ladoga on the Karelian Isthmus in the north and by the Narva river on the current international border with Estonia in the west. The earliest known inhabitants of the region were indigenous Finnic peoples, primarily the ancestors of modern Izhorians and Votians, who converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity during the late Middle Ages. They were later joined by the Ingrian Finns, descendants of 17th century Lutheran Finnish immigrants. At that time, Ingria, the Karelian Isthmus, Estonia, and what is now Finland were all part of the Kingdom of Sweden.

Ingria as a whole never formed a separate state; however, North Ingria was an independent state for just under two years in 1919–1920. The inhabitants of Ingria cannot be said to have comprised a distinct nation, since the population is made up of several different ethnic groups, despite the Soviet Union recognizing Ingrian as a nationality. The indigenous peoples of Ingria, like the Votians and Izhorians, are today close to extinction, together with their languages. This notwithstanding, many people still recognize and attempt to preserve their Ingrian heritage.

Historic Ingria covers approximately the same area as the Gatchinsky, Kingiseppsky, Kirovsky, Lomonosovsky, Tosnensky, Volosovsky and Vsevolozhsky districts of modern Leningrad Oblast as well as the city of Saint Petersburg.

The names of the region are:

==History==

In the Viking era (late Iron Age), from the 750s onwards, Ladoga served as a bridgehead on the Varangian trade route to Eastern Europe. A Varangian aristocracy developed that would ultimately rule over Novgorod and Kievan Rus&#x27;. In the 860s, the warring Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled under Vadim the Bold, but later asked the Varangians under Rurik to return and to put an end to the recurring conflicts between them.

The Swedes referred to the ancient Novgorodian land of Vod people as &quot;Ingermanland&quot;, Latinized to &quot;Ingria&quot;. The origin of the name is uncertain, but there are several possible explanations. One explanation is that the name comes from the River Inger, a southern tributary of the Neva River. Another explanation is based on the Norwegian Eymund&#x27;s saga, which tells the story of the Swedish princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter, who married Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev in 1019. According to the saga, she received Ladoga and the surrounding lands as a wedding gift from Yaroslav, and the region came to be known as &quot;Ingegerd’s land&quot;, or &quot;Ingermanland&quot;. The lands were administered by Swedish jarls, such as Ragnvald Ulfsson, under the sovereignty of the Novgorod Republic.

In the 12th century, Western Ingria was absorbed by the Novgorod Republic. There followed centuries of frequent wars, chiefly between Novgorod and Sweden, and occasionally involving Denmark and Teutonic Knights as well. The Teutonic Knights established a stronghold in the town of Narva, followed by the Russian castle Ivangorod on the opposite side of the Narva River in 1492.

With the consolidation of the Kievan Rus and the expansion of the Republic of Novgorod north, the indigenous Ingrians became Eastern Orthodox. Ingria became a province of Sweden in the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617 that ended the Ingrian War, fought between Sweden and Russia. After the Swedish conquest of the area in 1617 the Ingrian Finns, descendants of 17th-century Lutheran emigrants from present-day Finland, became the majority in Ingria.
In 1710, following a Russian conquest, Ingria was designated as the Province of St. Petersburg.

In the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, Sweden formally ceded Ingria to Russia.

In 1927 the Soviet authorities designated the area as Leningrad Province. Deportations of the Ingrian Finns started in late 1920s, and Russification was nearly complete by the 1940s.

In the modern era, Ingria forms the northwestern anchor of Russia—its &quot;window&quot; on the Baltic Sea—with Saint Petersburg as its centre.

==Swedish Ingria==
Although Sweden and Novgorod had fought for the Ingrian lands more or less since the Great Schism of 1054, the first actual attempt to establish Swedish dominion in Ingria appears to date from the early 14th century, when Sweden first founded the settlement of Viborg in Karelia and then the fortress Landskrona (built in 1299 or 1300) at the confluence of the Ohta and Neva rivers. However, Novgorod re-conquered Landskrona in 1301 and destroyed it. Ingria eventually became a Swedish dominion in the 1580s, but the Treaty of Teusina (1595) returned it to Russia in 1595. Russia in its turn ceded Ingria to Sweden in the Treaty of Stolbova (1617) after the Ingrian War of 1610–1617. Sweden&#x27;s interest in the territory was mainly strategic: the area served as a buffer zone against Russian attacks on the Karelian Isthmus and on present-day Finland, then the eastern half of the Swedish realm; and Russian Baltic trade had to pass through Swedish territory. The townships of Ivangorod, Jama (now Kingisepp), Caporie (now Koporye) and Nöteborg (now Shlisselburg) became the centres of the four Ingrian counties (slottslän), and consisted of citadels, in the vicinity of which were small boroughs called &quot;hakelverk&quot; – before the wars of the 1650s mainly inhabited by Russian townspeople. The degree to which Ingria became the destination for Swedish deportees has often been exaggerated.

Ingria remained sparsely populated. In 1664 the total population amounted to 15,000. Swedish attempts to introduce Lutheranism, which accelerated after an initial period of relative religious tolerance,
met with repugnance on the part of the majority of the Orthodox peasantry, who were obliged to attend Lutheran services; converts were promised grants and tax reductions, but Lutheran gains were mostly due to voluntary resettlements by Finns from Savonia and Finnish Karelia (mostly from Äyräpää).
The proportion of Lutheran Finns in Ingria (Ingrian Finns) comprised 41.1% in 1656, 53.2% in 1661, 55.2% in 1666, 56.9% in 1671 and 73.8% in 1695, the remainder being Russians, Izhorians and Votes. Ingermanland was to a considerable extent enfiefed to noble military and state officials, who brought their own Lutheran servants and workmen. However, a small number of Russian Orthodox churches remained in use until the very end of the Swedish dominion, and the forceful conversion of ethnic Russian Orthodox forbidden by law.

Nyen became the main trading centre of Ingria, especially after Ivangorod dwindled, and in 1642 it was made the administrative centre of the province. In 1656 a Russian attack badly damaged the town, and the administrative centre moved to Narva.

==Russian Ingria==
In the early 18th century the area was reconquered by Russia in the Great Northern War after having been in Swedish possession for about 100 years. Near the location of the Swedish town Nyen, close to the Neva river&#x27;s estuary at the Gulf of Finland, the new Russian capital Saint Petersburg was founded in 1703.

Peter the Great raised Ingria to the status of a duchy with Prince Menshikov as its first (and last) duke. In 1708, Ingria was designated a governorate (Ingermanland Governorate in 1708–1710, Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710–1914, Petrograd Governorate in 1914–1924, Leningrad Governorate in 1924–1927).

In 1870, printing started of the first Finnish-language newspaper in Ingria, &quot;Pietarin Sanomat&quot;. Before that Ingria received newspapers mostly from Viborg. The first public library was opened in 1850 in Tyrö. The largest of the libraries, situated in Skuoritsa, had more than 2,000 volumes in the second half of the 19th century. In 1899 the first song festival in Ingria was held in Puutosti (Skuoritsa).

By 1897 (year of the Russian Empire Census) the number of Ingrian Finns had grown to 130,413, and by 1917 it had exceeded 140,000 (45,000 in Northern Ingria, 52,000 in Central (Eastern) Ingria and 30,000 in Western Ingria, the rest in Petrograd).

From 1868 Estonians began to migrate to Ingria as well. In 1897 the number of
Estonians inhabiting the Saint Petersburg Governorate reached 64,116 (12,238 of them in Saint Petersburg itself); by 1926 it had increased to 66,333 (15,847 of them in Leningrad).

As to Izhorians, in 1834 there were 17,800 of them, in 1897—21,000, in 1926—26,137. About 1000 Ingrians lived in the area ceded to Estonia under the Peace Treaty of Tartu (1920).

==Estonian Ingria==

Under the Russian-Estonian Peace Treaty of Tartu of 1920, a small part of West Ingria became part of the Republic of Estonia. In contrast to other parts of Ingria, Finnish culture blossomed in this area, known as . This was to a large extent due to the work of Leander Reijo (also Reijonen or Reiju) from on the new border between Estonia and the Soviet Union, who was called &quot;The King of Ingria&quot; by the Finnish press. Finnish schools and a Finnish newspaper were started. A church was built in in 1920 and by 1928 the parish had 1,300 people.

In 1945, after the Second World War, Estonian Ingria, then in the Soviet Union, was transferred to the Russian SFSR and incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast. Since Estonia reclaimed its independence in 1991, this territory has been disputed. As Russia does not recognize the Treaty of Tartu, the area currently remains under Russian control.

==Soviet Ingria==
After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the Republic of North Ingria () declared its independence from Russia with the support of Finland and with the aim of incorporation into Finland. It ruled parts of Ingria from 1919 until 1920. With the Russian-Finnish Peace Treaty of Tartu it was re-integrated into Russia, but enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy.

At its height in the 1920s, there were about 300 Finnish language schools and 10 Finnish language newspapers in Ingria.

The First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926 recorded 114,831 Leningrad Finns, as Ingrian Finns were called. The 1926 census also showed that the Russian population of central Ingria outnumbered the Finnic peoples living there, but Ingrian Finns formed the majority in the districts along the Finnish border.

In the early 1930s the Izhorian language was taught in the schools of the Soikinsky Peninsula and the area around the mouth of the Luga River.

In 1928 collectivization of agriculture started in Ingria. To facilitate it, in 1929–1931, 18,000 people (4320 families), kulaks (independent peasants) from North Ingria, were deported to East Karelia, the Kola Peninsula as well as Kazakhstan and Central Asia.

The situation for the Ingrian Finns deteriorated further when in the fall of 1934 the Forbidden Border Zone along the western border of the Soviet Union was established, where entrance was forbidden without special permission issued by the NKVD. It was officially only 7.5 km (5 miles) deep initially, but along the Estonian border it extended to as much as 90 km (60 miles). The zone was to be free of Finnic and some other peoples, who were considered politically unreliable. On 25 March 1935, Genrikh Yagoda authorized a large-scale deportation targeting Estonian, Latvian and Finnish kulaks and lishentsy residing in the border regions near Leningrad. About 7,000 people (2,000 families) were deported from Ingria to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and the Ural region. In May and June 1936 the entire Finnish population of the parishes of Valkeasaari, Lempaala, Vuole and Miikkulainen near the Finnish border, 20,000 people, were resettled to the areas around Cherepovets and Siberia in the next wave of deportations. In Ingria they were replaced with people from other parts of the Soviet Union, mostly Russians but also Ukrainians and Tatars.

In 1937 Lutheran churches and Finnish and Izhorian schools in Ingria were closed down and publications and radio broadcasting in Finnish and Izhorian were suspended.

Both Ingrian Finnish and Izhorian populations all but disappeared from Ingria during the Soviet period. 63,000 fled to Finland during World War II, and were required back by Stalin after the war. Most became victims of Soviet population transfers and many were executed as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. The remainder, including some post-Stalin returnees (it was not until 1956 that some of the deported were allowed to return to their villages), were outnumbered by Russian immigration.

The 1959 census recorded 1,062 Izhorians; in 1979 that number had fallen to 748, only 315 of them around the mouth of the Luga River and on the Soikinsky Peninsula. According to the Soviet census of 1989, there were 829 Izhorians, 449 of them in Russia (including other parts of the country) and 228 in Estonia.

==After the dissolution of the Soviet Union==

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, surviving Ingrian Finns and their Russified descendants have been allowed to emigrate to Finland. This has led to the birth of a sizable Russophone minority in Finland.

<doc id="238042" wikidata="Q2527392" url="?curid=238042" title="End-to-end principle">
<text>The end-to-end principle is a design principle in computer networking that requires application-specific features (such as reliability and security) to be implemented in the communicating end nodes of the network, instead of in the network itself. Intermediary nodes (such as gateways and routers) that exist to establish the network may still implement these features to improve efficiency but do not guarantee end-to-end functionality.

The essence of what would later be called the end-to-end principle was contained in the work of Donald Davies on packet-switched networks in the 1960s. Louis Pouzin pioneered the use of the end-to-end strategy in the CYCLADES network in the 1970s. The principle was first articulated explicitly in 1981 by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark. The meaning of the end-to-end principle has been continuously reinterpreted ever since its initial articulation. Also, noteworthy formulations of the end-to-end principle can be found before the seminal 1981 Saltzer, Reed, and Clark paper.

A basic premise of the principle is that the payoffs from adding certain features required by the end application to the communication subsystem quickly diminish. The end hosts have to implement these functions for correctness. Implementing a specific function incurs some resource penalties regardless of whether the function is used or not, and implementing a specific function &quot;in the network&quot; adds these penalties to all clients, whether they need the function or not.

==Concept==

The fundamental notion behind the end-to-end principle is that for two processes communicating with each other via some communication means, the &quot;reliability&quot; obtained from that means cannot be expected to be perfectly aligned with the reliability requirements of the processes. In particular, meeting or exceeding very high-reliability requirements of communicating processes separated by networks of nontrivial size is more costly than obtaining the required degree of reliability by positive end-to-end acknowledgments and retransmissions (referred to as PAR or ARQ). Put differently, it is far easier to obtain reliability beyond a certain margin by mechanisms in the &quot;end hosts&quot; of a network rather than in the &quot;intermediary nodes&quot;, especially when the latter are beyond the control of, and not accountable to, the former. Positive end-to-end acknowledgments with infinite retries can obtain arbitrarily high reliability from any network with a higher than zero probability of successfully transmitting data from one end to another.

The end-to-end principle does not extend to functions beyond end-to-end error control and correction, and security. E.g., no straightforward end-to-end arguments can be made for communication parameters such as latency and throughput. In a 2001 paper, Blumenthal and Clark note: &quot;[F]rom the beginning, the end-to-end arguments revolved around requirements that could be implemented correctly at the endpoints; if implementation inside the network is the only way to accomplish the requirement, then an end-to-end argument isn&#x27;t appropriate in the first place.&quot;

The end-to-end principle is closely related, and sometimes seen as a direct precursor, to the principle of net neutrality.

==History==
In the 1960s, Paul Baran and Donald Davies, in their pre-ARPANET elaborations of networking, made comments about reliability. Baran&#x27;s 1964 paper states: &quot;Reliability and raw error rates are secondary. The network must be built with the expectation of heavy damage anyway. Powerful error removal methods exist.&quot; Going further, Davies captured the essence of the end-to-end principle; in his 1967 paper, he stated that users of the network will provide themselves with error control: &quot;It is thought that all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control and that without difficulty this could be made to show up a missing packet. Because of this, loss of packets, if it is sufficiently rare, can be tolerated.&quot;

The ARPANET was the first large-scale general-purpose packet switching network implementing several of the concepts previously articulated by Baran and Davies.

Davies built a local-area network with a single packet switch and worked on the simulation of wide-area datagram networks. Building on these ideas, and seeking to improve on the implementation in the ARPANET, Louis Pouzin&#x27;s CYCLADES network was the first to implement datagrams in a wide-area network and make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself. Concepts implemented in this network feature in TCP/IP architecture.

==Applications==
===ARPANET===
The ARPANET demonstrated several important aspects of the end-to-end principle.
;Packet switching pushes some logical functions toward the communication endpoints
:If the basic premise of a distributed network is packet switching, then functions such as reordering and duplicate detection inevitably have to be implemented at the logical endpoints of such a network. Consequently, the ARPANET featured two distinct levels of functionality:
:# a lower level concerned with transporting data packets between neighboring network nodes (called Interface Message Processors or IMPs), and
:# a higher level concerned with various end-to-end aspects of the data transmission.
:Dave Clark, one of the authors of the end-to-end principle paper, concludes: &quot;The discovery of packets is not a consequence of the end-to-end argument. It is the success of packets that make the end-to-end argument relevant.&quot;

;No arbitrarily reliable data transfer without end-to-end acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms
: The ARPANET was designed to provide reliable data transport between any two endpoints of the network much like a simple I/O channel between a computer and a nearby peripheral device. In order to remedy any potential failures of packet transmission normal ARPANET messages were handed from one node to the next node with a positive acknowledgment and retransmission scheme; after a successful handover they were then discarded, no source-to-destination re-transmission in case of packet loss was catered for. However, in spite of significant efforts, perfect reliability as envisaged in the initial ARPANET specification turned out to be impossible to providea reality that became increasingly obvious once the ARPANET grew well beyond its initial four-node topology. The ARPANET thus provided a strong case for the inherent limits of network-based hop-by-hop reliability mechanisms in pursuit of true end-to-end reliability.

;Trade-off between reliability, latency, and throughput
: The pursuit of perfect reliability may hurt other relevant parameters of a data transmissionmost importantly latency and throughput. This is particularly important for applications that value predictable throughput and low latency over reliabilitythe classic example being interactive real-time voice applications. This use case was catered for in the ARPANET by providing a raw message service that dispensed with various reliability measures so as to provide faster and lower latency data transmission service to the end hosts.

===TCP/IP===
Internet Protocol (IP) is a connectionless datagram service with no delivery guarantees. On the Internet, IP is used for nearly all communications. End-to-end acknowledgment and retransmission is the responsibility of the connection-oriented Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which sits on top of IP. The functional split between IP and TCP exemplifies the proper application of the end-to-end principle to transport protocol design.

===File transfer===
An example of the end-to-end principle is that of an arbitrarily reliable file transfer between two endpoints in a distributed network of a varying, nontrivial size: The only way two endpoints can obtain a completely reliable transfer is by transmitting and acknowledging a checksum for the entire data stream; in such a setting, lesser checksum and acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) protocols are justified only for the purpose of optimizing performancethey are useful to the vast majority of clients, but are not enough to fulfill the reliability requirement of this particular application. A thorough checksum is hence best done at the endpoints, and the network maintains a relatively low level of complexity and reasonable performance for all clients.

==Limitations==
The most important limitation of the end-to-end principle is that its basic premise, placing functions in the application endpoints rather than in the intermediary nodes, is not trivial to implement. 

An example of the limitations of the end-to-end principle exists in mobile devices with mobile IPv6. Pushing service-specific complexity to the endpoints can cause issues with mobile devices if the device has unreliable access to network channels.

Further problems can be seen with a decrease in network transparency from the addition of network address translation (NAT), which IPv4 relies on to combat address exhaustion. With the introduction of IPv6, users once again have unique identifiers, allowing for true end-to-end connectivity. Unique identifiers may be based on a physical address, or can be generated randomly by the host.

The end-to-end principle advocates pushing coordination-related functionality ever higher, ultimately into the application layer. The premise is that application-level information enables flexible coordination between the application endpoints and yields better performance because the coordination would be exactly what is needed. This leads to the idea of modeling each application via its own application-specific protocol that supports the desired coordination between its endpoints while assuming only a simple lower-layer communication service. Broadly, this idea is known as application semantics (meaning).

Multiagent systems offers approaches based on application semantics that enable conveniently implementing distributed applications without requiring message ordering and delivery guarantees from the underlying communication services. A basic idea in these approaches is to model the coordination between application endpoints via an information protocol and then implement the endpoints (agents) based on the protocol. Information protocols can be enacted over lossy, unordered communication services. A middleware based on information protocols and the associated programming model abstracts away message receptions from the underlying network and enables endpoint programmers to focus on the business logic for sending messages.

<doc id="238043" wikidata="Q32858" url="?curid=238043" title="Votic language">
<text>Votic or Votian (, ) , is a Finnic language spoken by the Votes of Ingria, belonging to the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages. Votic is spoken only in Krakolye (now part of Ust-Luga) and Luzhitsy, two villages in Kingiseppsky District in Leningrad Oblast, Russia. In the 2020–2021 Russian census, 21 people claimed to speak Votic natively, which is an increase from 4 in 2010. Arvo Survo also estimated that around 100 people have knowledge of the language to some degree.
== History ==
Votic is one of numerous Finnic varieties known from Ingria. Votic shares some similarities with and has acquired loanwords from the adjacent Ingrian language, but also has deep-reaching similarities with Estonian to the west, which is considered its closest relative. Some linguists, including Tiit-Rein Viitso and Paul Alvre, have claimed that Votic evolved specifically from northeastern dialects of ancient Estonian. Votic regardless exhibits several features that indicate its distinction from Estonian (both innovations such as the palatalisation of velar consonants and a more developed system of cases, and retentions such as vowel harmony). According to Estonian linguist Paul Ariste, Votic was distinct from other Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, as early as the 6th century AD and has evolved independently ever since.

Isoglosses setting Votic apart from the other Finnic languages include:
* Loss of initial *h
* Palatalization of *k to before front vowels. This was a relatively late innovation, not found in Kreevin Votic or Kukkuzi Votic.
* Lenition of the clusters *ps, *ks to 
* Lenition of the cluster *st to geminate 

Features shared with Estonian and the other southern Finnic languages include:
* Loss of word-final *n
* Shortening of vowels before *h
* Introduction of from backing of *e before a back vowel
* Development of *o to in certain words (particularly frequent in Votic)
* Loss of after a sonorant (clusters *lh *nh *rh)

In the 19th century, Votic was already declining in favour of Russian (there were around 1,000 speakers of the language by the start of World War I). After the Bolshevik Revolution, under Lenin, Votic had a brief revival period, with the language being taught at local schools and the first-ever grammar of Votic (Jõgõperä/Krakolye dialect) being published. But after Joseph Stalin came into power, the language began to decline. World War II had a devastating effect on the Votic language, with the number of speakers considerably decreased as a result of military offensives, deliberate destruction of villages by Nazi troops, forced migration to the Klooga concentration camp in Estonia and to Finland under the Nazi government, and the Stalinist policy of &quot;dispersion&quot; immediately after the war against the families whose members had been sent to Finland under the Nazi government. Since then, the Votes have largely concealed their Votic identity, pretending to be Russians in the predominantly Russian environment. But they continued to use the language at home and when talking to family members and relatives. After the death of Stalin, the Votes were no longer mistreated and many of those who had been sent away returned to their villages. But the language had considerably declined and the number of bilingual speakers increased. Because Votic was stigmatised as a language of &quot;uneducated villagers&quot;, Votic speakers avoided using it in public and Votic children were discouraged from using it even at home because, in the opinion of some local school teachers, it prevented them from learning to speak and write in Russian properly. Thus, in the second half of the 20th century there emerged a generation of young ethnic Votes whose first language was Russian and who understood Votic but were unable to speak it.

== Education ==
There have been multiple attempts in Votic language education. In 1995–1998, Votic language courses were held in St. Petersburg, which were organized by Mehmet Muslimov. These courses were attended by about 30 people. In 2003–2004, courses were held again, and these were also organized by Muslimov. Muslimov has also made Votic self-study material available on the internet. During 2010–2015, there were Votic courses established, which were attended by around 10 people. There are also Votic events where studying material for Votic is given to people. In 2015, a Votic study book called &quot;Vad&#x27;d&#x27;a sõnakopittõja&quot; was published by Heinike Heinsoo and Nikita Djačkov. There have also been a few lessons organized by T.F. Prokopenko for little children in a school in a Votic village.

== Dialects ==
Three definite dialect groups of Votic are known:
*Votic
**Western, the areas around the mouth of the Luga River
**Eastern, in villages around Koporye
**Krevinian, areas around the city of Bauska, Latvia
The Western dialect area can be further divided into the Central dialects (spoken around the village of Kattila) and the Lower Luga dialects.

Of these, only the Lower Luga dialect is still spoken.

In 1848 it was estimated that of a total of 5,298 speakers of Votic, 3,453 (65%) spoke the western dialect, 1,695 (35%) spoke the eastern and 150 (3%) spoke the dialect of Kukkuzi. Kreevin had 12–15 speakers in 1810, the last records of Kreevin speakers are from 1846. The Kreevin dialect was spoken in an enclave in Latvia by descendants of Votic prisoners of war who were brought to the Bauska area of Latvia in the 15th century by the Teutonic order. The last known speaker of the eastern dialect died in 1960, in the village of &quot;Icäpäivä&quot; (Itsipino).
A fourth dialect of Votic has often been claimed as well: the traditional language variety of the village of Kukkuzi. It shows a mix of features of Votic and neighboring Ingrian, and some linguists, e.g. Arvo Laanest have claimed that it is actually rather a dialect of Ingrian. The vocabulary and phonology of the dialect are largely Ingrian-based, but it shares some grammatical features with the main Votic dialects, probably representing a former Votic substratum. In particular, all phonological features that Votic shares specifically with Estonian (e.g. the presence of the vowel &quot;õ&quot;) are absent from the dialect. The Kukkuzi dialect has been declared to be dead since the 1970s, although three speakers have still been located in 2006.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Votic has 10 vowel qualities, all of which can be long or short; represented in the following chart. The vowels /ɨ/ and /ɨː/ are found only in loanwords. The Votic ⟨õ⟩ /ɤ/ , however, is impressionistically a bit higher than the Estonian ⟨õ⟩, with the rest of the vowel inventory generally corresponding to the ones found in Estonian.

In some central dialects, the long mid vowels have been diphthongized to , as in Finnish. Thus, &quot;tee&quot; &#x27;road&#x27; is pronounced as &quot;tie&quot;. Votic also has a large inventory of diphthongs.

Votic has a system of vowel harmony, rather similar to Finnish in its overall behavior: the vowels are divided in three groups, &quot;front-harmonic&quot;, &quot;back-harmonic&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot;. Words may generally not contain both front-harmonic and back-harmonic vowels; but both groups can combine with neutral vowels. The front-harmonic vowels are &quot;ä e ö ü&quot;; the corresponding back-harmonic vowels are &quot;a õ o u&quot;. Unlike Finnish, Votic only has a single neutral vowel, &quot;i&quot;.

However, there are some exceptions with the behavior of &quot;o ö&quot;. Some suffixes including the vowel &quot;o&quot; do not harmonize (the occurrence of &quot;ö&quot; in non-initial syllables is generally a result of Finnish or Ingrian loan words), and similarly onomatopoetic words and loanwords are not necessarily subject to rules of vowel harmony.

===Consonants===
Notes:
* occurs only in eastern Votic, as a weak-grade counterpart to .
* Palatalised consonants are rare and normally allophonic, occurring automatically before or before a consonant that in turn is followed by . Phonemic palatalised consonants occur mostly as the result of a former following , usually as geminates. In other environments they are almost entirely found in loanwords, primarily from Russian. In some words in certain dialects, a palatalised consonant may become phonemic by the loss of the following vowel, such as &quot;esimein&quot; &gt; &quot;eśmein&quot;.
* is affricated to in Kukkuzi Votic.
* only occurs in complementary distribution with .
* mainly as a result of loanwords from Russian, Ingrian, and Finnish dialects, or as an allophone of .

Nearly all Votic consonants may occur as geminates. Also, Votic also has a system of consonant gradation, which is discussed in further detail in the consonant gradation article, although a large amount of alternations involve voicing alternations. Two important differences in Votic phonetics as compared to Estonian and Finnish is that the sounds and are actually fully fricatives, unlike Estonian and Finnish, in which they are approximants. Also, one possible allophone of is , &quot;ühsi&quot; is thus pronounced as IPA: .

The lateral has a velarized allophone when occurring adjacent to back vowels.

Voicing is not contrastive word-finally. Instead a type of sandhi occurs: voiceless are realized before words beginning with a voiceless consonant, voiced before voiced consonants (or vowels). Before a pause, the realization is voiceless lenis, ; the stops are here similar to the Estonian &quot;b d g&quot;. Thus:
* pre-pausal: &quot;thief&quot;
* before a voiceless consonant: &quot;a thief comes&quot;
* before a voiced consonant: &quot;a thief takes&quot;

== Orthography ==
In the 1920s, the Votic linguist Dmitri Tsvetkov wrote a Votic grammar using a modified Cyrillic alphabet. The current Votic alphabet was created by Mehmet Muslimov in 2004:
A peculiarity of Muslimov&#x27;s orthography is using &quot;c&quot; for (this phoneme comes mostly from palatalization of historical , compare Votic &quot;ceeli&quot; &#x27;language&#x27;, &quot;cülä&quot; &#x27;village&#x27; with Finnish &quot;kieli, kylä&quot;). Some publications use &quot;tš&quot; or &quot;č&quot; instead.

One may find different orthographies for Votic in descriptive work. Some use a modified Cyrillic alphabet, and others a Latin one. The transcriptions based on Latin have many similarities with those used in closely related Finnic languages, such as the use of &quot;č&quot; for . At least a couple of ways exist for indicating long vowels in Votic; placing a macron over the vowel (such as &quot;ā&quot;) as in Latvian, or as in written Estonian and Finnish, doubling the vowel (&quot;aa&quot;). Geminate consonants are generally represented with two characters. The representation of central vowels varies. In some cases the practice is to use &quot;e̮&quot; according to the standards of Uralic transcription, while in other cases the letter &quot;õ&quot; is used, as in Estonian.

== Grammar ==

Votic is an agglutinating language much like the other Finnic languages.

<text>The Izhorians (; ; ; ) are a Finnic indigenous people native to Ingria. Small numbers can still be found in the western part of Ingria, between the Narva and Neva rivers in northwestern Russia. Although in English oftentimes sharing a common name with the Ingrian Finns, these two groups are distinct from one another.

== History ==

The history of the Izhorians is bound to the history of Ingria. It is supposed that shortly after 1000 AD the Izhorians moved from Karelia to the west and south-west. In 1478, the Novgorod Republic, where Ingrians had settled, was united with the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and some of the Izhorians were transferred to the east. The establishment of St Petersburg in 1703 had a great influence on Izhorian culture. World War II had the biggest impact on Izhorians, as devastating battles (such as the Siege of Leningrad) took place on their territory.

In 1848, P. von Köppen counted 17,800 Izhorians, and by 1926 there were 26,137 Izhorians in the Russian SFSR. In the 1959 census, however, only 1,100 Izhorians were counted in the USSR. In 1989, 820 self-designated Izhorians, 302 of whom were speakers of the Ingrian language were registered. 449 Izhorians lived in the territory of the USSR. According to the 2002 Russian Census, there were 327 Izhorians in Russia, of whom 177 lived in Leningrad oblast and 53 in St Petersburg. There were also 812 Izhorians in Ukraine according to Ukrainian Census (2001) (more than in Russian Federation and Estonia altogether) and a further 358 Izhorians in Estonia.
== Language ==
Their language, close to Karelian, is used primarily by members of the older generation. Izhorian (also called Ingrian), along with Finnish, Ludic, Karelian and Vepsian, belongs to the Northern Finnic group of the Uralic languages.

In 1932–1937, a Latin-based orthography for the Izhorian language existed, taught in schools of the Soikinsky Peninsula and the area around the mouth of the Luga River. Several textbooks were published including a grammar of the language in 1936. However, in 1937 the Izhorian written language was abolished.

== Religion ==
The Izhorians and the Votes are generally Eastern Orthodox, while the other Baltic Finns inhabitanting Ingria, the Ingrian Finns, are generally Lutheran. Some pre-Christian traditions exist also.

== Genetics ==
According to a 2024 study, the most common paternal haplogroup of the Izhorians is N1c, especially its subgroup N3a4. The haplogroup N is typical for Finno-Ugric peoples. Their other haplogroups include I1 and R1a. In terms of autosomal DNA, Izhorians resemble other Baltic Finns, particularly Ingrian Finns and Votians, and can be distinguished from the Slavic Russians.

<text>Regaining Unconsciousness is an EP by NOFX, released prior to the release of &quot;The War on Errorism&quot;. &quot;Regaining Unconsciousness&quot; was the name of a song that appeared on &quot;The War on Errorism&quot;, although that song did not appear on this EP.

All tracks appeared on &quot;The War on Errorism&quot; except for &quot;Hardcore &#x27;84&quot; and &quot;Commercial,&#x27; which was a mock commercial for &quot;War on Errorism&quot;.

The lyrics to Regaining Unconsciousness show strong similarities to the poem First they came ... by Martin Niemöller, written in 1946 about the rise of Nazism.

<doc id="238062" wikidata="Q1165928" url="?curid=238062" title="Lich">
<text>In fantasy fiction, a lich (; from the Old English , meaning &quot;corpse&quot;. Related to modern German &quot;leiche&quot; or modern Dutch &quot;lijk&quot;, both meaning &#x27;corpse&#x27;) is a type of undead creature.

Various works of fantasy fiction, such as Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Empire of the Necromancers&quot; (1932), had used &quot;lich&quot; as a general term for any corpse, animated or inanimate, before the term&#x27;s specific use in fantasy role-playing games. The more recent use of the term &quot;lich&quot; for a specific type of undead creature originates from the 1976 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game booklet &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, written by Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz.

Often such a creature is the result of a willful transformation, as a powerful wizard skilled in necromancy who seeks eternal life uses rare substances in a magical ritual to become undead. Unlike zombies, which are often depicted as mindless, liches are revenants, retaining their previous intelligence and magical abilities. Liches are often depicted as holding power over lesser mindless undead soldiers and servants.

A lich&#x27;s most often depicted distinguishing feature from other undead in fantasy fiction is the method of achieving immortality; liches give up their souls to form &quot;soul-artifacts&quot; (called a &quot;soul gem&quot; or &quot;phylactery&quot; in other fantasy works), the source of their magic and immortality. Many liches take precautions to hide and/or safeguard one or more soul-artifacts that anchor a part of a lich&#x27;s soul to the material world. If the corporeal body of a lich is killed, that portion of the lich&#x27;s soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being reconstituted or resurrected in the near future. However, if all of the lich&#x27;s soul-artifacts are destroyed, then the lich&#x27;s only anchor in the material world would be the corporeal body, whereupon destruction will cause permanent death.

==Historical background==

&quot;Lich&quot; is an archaic English word for &quot;corpse&quot;; the gate at the lowest end of the cemetery where the coffin and funerary procession usually entered was commonly referred to as the lich gate. This gate was quite often covered by a small roof where part of the funerary service could be carried out.

==In literature==

The literary lich developed from monsters found in earlier classic sword and sorcery fiction, which is filled with powerful sorcerers who use their magic to triumph over death. Many of Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s short stories feature powerful wizards whose magic enables them to return from the dead. Several stories by Robert E. Howard, such as the novella &quot;Skull-Face&quot; (1929) and the short story &quot;Scarlet Tears&quot;, feature undying sorcerers who retain a semblance of life through mystical means, their bodies reduced to shriveled husks with which they manage to maintain inhuman mobility and active thought. 

The term &quot;lich&quot;, used as an archaic word for corpse (or body), is commonly used in these stories. Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s tale of possession &quot;&quot; features the word in its introduction, referring to a corpse. H. P. Lovecraft also used the word in &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (published 1937) where the narrator refers to the corpse of his friend possessed by a sorcerer. Liches are sometimes depicted using a magical device called a &quot;phylactery&quot; to anchor their souls to the physical world so that if their body is destroyed they can rise again over and over, as long as the phylactery remains intact. Other imagery surrounding demiliches, in particular that of a jeweled skull, is drawn from the early Fritz Leiber story &quot;Thieves&#x27; House&quot;. 

Gary Gygax, one of the co-creators of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, said that he based the description of a lich included in the game on the short story &quot;The Sword of the Sorcerer&quot; (1969) by Gardner Fox.

==In popular culture==

===In print===
* Acererak is the final boss of the classic &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; adventure module &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;; Acererak was also featured as the guardian of the Copper Key in the book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; by Ernest Cline.
* In the webcomic &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot;, the main villain Xykon is a lich.
*In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, the main antagonist Voldemort commands armies of undead inferi and uses magical devices called horcruxes to store fragments of his soul in order to allow him to resurrect himself in the event that his body dies.

===Film and television===
* In the &quot;Adventure Time&quot; television series, the main antagonist is an evil, powerful undead being known simply as &quot;The Lich&quot;. He describes himself as an ancient, cosmic being who is the manifestation of the inevitable death of all things.

===Tabletop===

* In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, a lich is a spellcaster who seeks to defy death by magical means.
*Liches also appear in other fantasy settings that draw upon &quot;D&amp;D&quot; for inspiration, such as:
**&quot;13th Age&quot;
**&quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;
**&quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;

===Video games===
* Liches are prominent in the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series of video games, appearing primarily as enemies, but also as playable characters in several installments. They are equally prevalent in the spin-off series &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;, where they appear in most installments as recruitable creatures, but also as heroes. One of the most prolific liches in New World Computing&#x27;s old continuity was Sandro, appearing in many titles and referenced in many more. The primary antagonist of &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III: Restoration of Erathia&quot; is also a lich: the former king of Erathia raised by necromancers.
* The &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series of video games includes several liches, as powerful but optional boss fights.
* &quot;Warcraft III&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King&quot; features the continent of Northrend, the realm of the eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. Arthas Menethil, also known as the Lich King, one of the most prominent antagonists in &quot;Warcraft&quot; lore, appears as a raid boss in the &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; expansion, as well as a playable character in the crossover video game &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;.
* In the &quot;Dota&quot; series of video games, Lich is one of the playable heroes.
* In &quot;League of Legends&quot;, the champion Karthus embraced the gift of death and became a lich.
* In the video game &quot;Enter the Gungeon&quot;, a lich is the final boss located in Bullet Hell.

<doc id="238071" wikidata="Q826670" url="?curid=238071" title="Lar Gand">
<text>Lar Gand, known mainly as Mon-El (and alternatively as Valor and M&#x27;Onel), is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the Legion of Super-Heroes, Superboy, and Superman. The character has been reinterpreted over the years, but in all versions serves as a hero with abilities similar to those of Superman, sometimes serving as a substitute for him.

Mon-El appears in the second season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Chris Wood. Additionally, Superman X, a character loosely based on Mon-El, appears in the animated series &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, voiced by Yuri Lowenthal.

==Publication history==
A precursor to the Lar Gand character appeared in the story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Big Brother&quot;, in &quot;Superman&quot; #80 (February 1953). He was named Halk Kar, and had a logo-less costume almost identical to Superman&#x27;s, but with the red and blue colors reversed. He was created by Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino.

Lar Gand first appeared in &quot;Superboy&quot; #89 and was created by Robert Bernstein and George Papp.

==Fictional character biography==
===Halk Kar===
Halk Kar crash-lands on Earth in a rocketship and is rescued by Superman, who discovers that Halk Kar suffers from amnesia. Discovering that Halk Kar has a note from Jor-El (Superman&#x27;s father) mentioning his son, Superman assumes that Halk Kar must not only be from his own planet Krypton, but he must be a son of Jor-El and thus also his own older brother.

Superman quickly realizes that Halk Kar is less powerful than he is and – instead of subjecting him to embarrassment over the fact that he may be weaker than his younger brother – opts to use his own powers to cover for Halk Kar&#x27;s deficiencies. This plan backfires, as Halk Kar begins to assume a superior attitude to Superman and even begins to make romantic advances on Superman&#x27;s girlfriend, Lois Lane.

Finally, Halk Kar recovers his memory, and explains that he is from the planet Thoron, which is in the same star system as Krypton. Years ago, while on a pioneer voyage into space, he landed on Krypton with his damaged rocketship. There he met Jor-El, who explained that Krypton&#x27;s destruction was imminent and repaired Halk Kar&#x27;s rocketship, sending him away with the note which had a map from Krypton to Earth on it. Krypton exploded shortly afterward, causing Halk Kar to be put into suspended animation until he drifted to Earth to meet Superman, the grown-up son of Jor-El referred to in the note. Halk Kar returns to Thoron in his repaired rocketship, leaving Superman with the experience of briefly having had a brother.

===Mon-El===
The Halk Kar plot was reused in &quot;Superboy&quot; #89 (June 1961), in a story set during Superman&#x27;s career as Superboy, one that simply disregarded the history outlined in the original (a practice common at the time). The character&#x27;s name was changed to Lar Gand, his homeworld was changed to Daxam, and he was made younger to roughly match Superboy&#x27;s age. He was an explorer who had landed on Krypton, where Jor-El warned him of the planet&#x27;s imminent destruction and gave him a map to Earth. He suffered amnesia upon landing on Earth, where he met Superboy. As he gained powers like Superboy, the hero concluded that he was a long-lost brother, and named him Mon-El: &quot;Mon&quot; because he landed on Earth on a Monday, and &quot;El&quot; for Superboy&#x27;s own Kryptonian family name (although in 1964, Bob Rozakis wrote a letter to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; in which he pointed out the existence of the alloy monel &quot;which had characteristics similar to the hero of the same name&quot;). He adopted a human secret identity (Bob Cobb) to integrate into Superboy&#x27;s hometown of Smallville.

The character was then shown to be immune to kryptonite, which is radioactively poisonous to all Kryptonians. Believing that Mon-El has been deceiving him, Superboy tries to trick him with a fake kryptonite meteor made of lead, which turns out to be Mon-El&#x27;s weakness. Furthermore, exposure to lead is irreversibly fatal to Daxamites, which Mon-El explains, having regained his memory. Guilt-ridden over inadvertently poisoning him, Superboy saves his life by sending him to the extradimensional Phantom Zone, where he would be able to observe things happening in the outside world, but as a phantom would not age and his lead poisoning would not progress.

This provided for a means to use the character in contemporary stories set in the 30th century with the Legion of Super-Heroes. In these stories, Legion member Saturn Girl creates a temporary antidote to his lead poisoning, allowing him to be released from the Phantom Zone for brief periods of time, and he is considered an honorary Legionnaire. Brainiac 5 later creates a long-term antidote (which still requires periodic ingestion), and he becomes a full member. During his long career, he is written as one of the Legion&#x27;s three most-powerful members along with Superboy and Ultra Boy, and serves two terms as leader. Mon-El apparently dies after failing to take a dose of Brainiac 5&#x27;s anti-lead serum in a timely fashion. Eltro Gand, a distant descendant of his older brother, sacrificed his life force to restore Mon-El to life. After a long romantic relationship, he and fellow Legionnaire Shadow Lass marry.

The &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot removed Superman&#x27;s adventures as Superboy from the character&#x27;s history. Mon-El&#x27;s character history remained unchanged, however, with his encounter with Superboy said to have taken place in a &quot;pocket universe&quot; created by the Time Trapper, a mysterious being living at the end of the universe.

Severely injured and dependent on life-support equipment during a battle with the Time Trapper after Superboy&#x27;s death, Mon-El dies during the Magic Wars which destroys much of the technology throughout the United Planets. The Time Trapper later revives him, hoping to use his body to preserve himself, but Mon-El kills him to prevent the Trapper from further manipulating events throughout history. This erases Superboy&#x27;s pocket universe and alters the timeline. The Trapper&#x27;s role and powers are usurped by his underling Glorith, and Lar Gand is recast as Valor.

===Valor===

In the new &quot;Glorithverse&quot; reality, Lar Gand replaced the non-existent Superboy as the Legion&#x27;s inspiration. As detailed in the story &quot;The Legend of Valor&quot; (&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4) Annual #2, 1991), Lar Gand would enjoy a heroic career in the 20th century as Valor, stopping a second Dominator-led invasion of Earth, freeing thousands of humans who had been experimented on by the Dominators and seeding them on a series of worlds between Dominion space and Earth as a &quot;buffer zone&quot; to prevent future invasions. These colonists had gained metahuman powers due to the experiments and would (by the time of the Legion), evolve into many of the worlds that would join the United Planets. After completing this task and an indefinite number of other 20th-century ventures, he would be placed in the Bgztl Buffer Zone by the time sorceress Glorith, to be rescued by the Legion in the 30th century. None of these events had otherwise been depicted in comics about the 20th century.

In his new history, Lar Gand was inspired by his father&#x27;s sacrifice in the crossover story &quot;Invasion!&quot; to become a hero. He briefly joins L.E.G.I.O.N., where Vril Dox II cures his lead poisoning. He plays a significant part in the &quot;&quot; crossover, in which Superman gives him the name &quot;Valor&quot;. A solo series &quot;Valor&quot; about the character lasted for 23 issues, beginning with Lar as an adventurous young man exploring the universe in a spaceship with the artificial intelligence Babbage, encountering various aliens and civilizations. After #12 however, things became complex.

Glorith had continued altering the timeline, inadvertently recreating the original Time Trapper in the process. Travelling back to when Lar Gand was a young man in another attempt to win his affection, she accidentally caused his death. Attempting to undo the damage this caused history, she called forth a duplicate Valor to take his other self&#x27;s place, &quot;patched&quot; into the 20th century timeline by Waverider. He was tasked with completing Valor&#x27;s legendary feats such as stopping the Dominators&#x27; second invasion of Earth and seeding the U.P. worlds so that 30th century history would play out as it was supposed to transpire. However, history was playing out much earlier than it was supposed to which led to some changes in Valor&#x27;s exploits. This was one of the many destabilizations of the timestream that eventually led to the 1994 &quot;Zero Hour&quot; storyline, and the &quot;Legion Reboot&quot;.

===M&#x27;Onel===

The character appeared again following the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; reboot, in &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #17. He was amnesiac, but had vague memories of his time with L.E.G.I.O.N. and the events of his own series. He was found by the loan shark of Superboy&#x27;s agent and was tricked into fighting Superboy as the whole battle was being recorded for the purpose of betting on the winner. When Superboy saw that Valor was sick after he started to become weakened and more disoriented as a result of Vril Dox&#x27;s anti-lead serum wearing off, Superboy placed him in the &quot;Stasis Zone&quot; (the Phantom Zone by another name), where he was trapped for a thousand years before being released by the Legion and a time-traveling Superboy, and injected with Brainiac 5&#x27;s improved version of his ancestor&#x27;s serum. To avoid the religious fervor his return would cause, the Legion kept secret the fact this new Legionnaire was the legendary Valor. He took the name M&#x27;Onel, which Legion founder R. J. Brande claimed to be Martian for &quot;He Who Wanders&quot;.

M&#x27;Onel would become a key player in the following &quot;The Legion&quot; comic book series. With the rest of the Legionnaires, M&#x27;Onel is lost when Superboy (Kon-El) and the Teen Titans lose the Persuader&#x27;s axe while trying to return to their own time. M&#x27;Onel attempts to hold the Legionnaires in a human chain, but is sucked into a vortex. Shikari is the only one who escapes when she is pulled free by the temporal currents. She arrives in a changed future, leading into the threeboot Legion of Super-Heroes comics.

Resulting from the 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, time and space once again were realigned and altered, this incarnation of Mon-El and his exploits were thought to have been erased from the timeline. In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; #2, this version of Mon-El resurfaced as well as his post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; Legion teammates.

===2004 &quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity===
The character was introduced again following another reboot of Legion history in 2004. In &quot;Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; #23 (December 2006), Saturn Girl senses a telepathic call for help, which turns out to be Mon-El in the Phantom Zone, suffering from 1,000 years of sensory deprivation and dying from lead poisoning. He is confused as to who put him in the Phantom Zone, but remembers the &quot;S&quot; symbol and attacks Supergirl. Brainiac 5 makes an anti-toxin for the lead poisoning using kryptonite, but this wears off, requiring him to be returned to the Phantom Zone. &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; reveals that this future is not the future of New Earth but instead the future of Earth-Prime. The full actual past of this version of Mon-El is unknown, however he claimed to have known Supergirl and Superman in the past.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===

In conjunction with the crossover &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the nature of Daxam, and thus Mon-El, was heavily retconned. He became the remote descendant of a male human and Bal Gand, a female Daxamite who visited Earth during the height of the Maya culture. She returned to Daxam, rather than let her child be born as an apparent demigod on Earth, but programmed her spaceship to return him to Earth if Daxamite xenophobia made that necessary. Generations later, her descendant Lar Gand gives in to his suppressed instinct to escape the increasingly isolated Daxam and travel the stars, and is brought by his ancestor&#x27;s ship to its pre-programmed destination: Earth, the Central American continent.

February 2007&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #10, gave a revised version of how Clark Kent met the character. It closely matches the 1960 story, but amnesiac Mon-El is poisoned when Clark tries to test whether he is Kryptonian using kryptonite, and the protective lead casing for the meteor both poisons him and restores his memories. He recalls that upon arriving at Earth, a sunspot storm ruptured his fuel cells, causing him to crash (and explaining how his ship missed Central America by thousands of miles, crash-landing in Smallville instead) and lose his memory. Clark again uses a portal to the Phantom Zone to put Mon-El in stasis until his lead poisoning can be cured.

In &quot;Superman&quot; #685 (April 2009), Superman releases Mon-El from the Phantom Zone to save him from its collapse. Mon-El is cured of his lead poisoning by a cure left anonymously for him by the Legion. In the 21st century, he adopts the human alias of Clark&#x27;s cousin &quot;Jonathan Kent&quot; from London, and acts as protector of Metropolis while Superman joins the off-Earth settlement of New Krypton, populated by refugees from the planet&#x27;s destruction.

He briefly joins the Metropolis Science Police, until he is captured by Sam Lane&#x27;s Project 7734, who fake his death at the hand of Flamebird and Nightwing. Mon-El manages to escape, but ends up stranded in the Forlorn Dimension, helping Captain Atom to get free from the clutches of Mirabai, the evil queen of the Forlorn and Sam Lane&#x27;s chief ally.

Following his escape, Mon-El returns to Metropolis wearing a modified version of his red and blue costume (similar to the costume of the Golden Age Halk-Kar) complete with a Superman S-Shield over his left chest. He assists the Science Police in capturing Parasite. Mon-El also attempts to apprehend Bizarro, only to turn back after he escapes to Bizarro World. Upon returning home, Mon-El asks Superboy to reprogram Kelex, the android at the Fortress of Solitude, to repair the starship he came to Earth in. He also enters into a sexual relationship with Billi Harper, the Guardian&#x27;s grandniece.

Following a battle with Atomic Skull, Mon-El was invited to join the new Justice League of America at the invitation of Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi). After helping to save New Krypton and seeding the UP worlds in accordance with time-loop instructions from the Legion, Mon-El, now near death having become immune to the lead poisoning antidote, is returned to the recreated Phantom Zone by Superman and Chameleon, where he remains until rescued by the Legion in 1,000 years. Whether his long isolation has caused memory loss or he is carefully avoiding a time paradox by never mentioning his 21st century adventures is unknown. In the final issue of &quot;War of the Supermen&quot;, it is revealed that Billi is pregnant, presumably with Mon-El&#x27;s child.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; Legion===

The events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; restore a close analogue of the pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; story arc in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, and in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Mon-El is included in their number. In the latter story, it was revealed that Mon-El was banished back into the Phantom Zone by Earth Man.

In the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; miniseries, which follows after &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, Mon-El is rescued from the Phantom Zone by his teammates. Upon leaving the Zone, Mon-El once again suffers the effects of lead poisoning, but as in the past, is inoculated with an antidote created by Brainiac 5. He and Shadow Lass are then sent on a mission to Oa to recruit the immortal Sodam Yat (the last Guardian of the Universe) into the war against Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains. Mon-El forms a bond with the reluctant Yat as both a fellow Daxamite and as one who has outlived family and friends.

Later on, he is chosen to become a Green Lantern by Dyogene. Before leaving, he told Shadow Lass that even though he is a GL, the Legion, Earth and his friends will always be his family.

===The New 52===
In The New 52, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, Gand appears as the field leader of the Legion of Super-Heroes. It is further revealed that this version, as the entire Legion, is possibly the original one from before the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event as they are even aware of these reality-altering events.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Mon-El is erased from existence when Doctor Manhattan alters the timeline. However, he is restored when Superman convinces Manhattan to undo his actions.

===The New Golden Age===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Mon-El is among the Legionnaires who arrive in the present and confront the Justice Society over their decision to recruit Legionnaire, a young, heroic incarnation of Mordru.

A separate, contemporary character named Mon-El appears in &quot;DC All In&quot; as the Phantom King, the leader of the Phantom Zone.

==Powers and abilities==
Generally, the abilities of Lar Gand and other Daxamites are similar to those of Superman and other natives of the planet Krypton (super-strength; speed; flight; x-ray vision, heat vision, microscopic and telescopic vision powers; invulnerability; and super hearing). However, he is vulnerable to the inert element lead, rather than the radioactive element Kryptonite.

==In other media==
=== Television ===

* Elements of Lar Gand are incorporated in a clone of Superman named Kell-El / Superman X, who appears in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006), voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. According to series producer James Tucker, Superman X was created to fill Mon-El&#x27;s role due to Warner Bros. executives believing the latter to be too similar to Superman.
* Mon-El appears in TV series set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Chris Wood.
** Primarily appearing in &quot;Supergirl&quot;, this version is a prince and son of Lar Gand (portrayed by Kevin Sorbo) and Rhea (portrayed by Teri Hatcher), though he initially believed that he was the prince&#x27;s bodyguard. Introduced in the second season, Mon-El crash-lands on Earth and enters a coma sometime prior to the series. Upon awaking in the present, he battles Supergirl due in part to an ancient feud between Krypton and Daxam until she reveals that Daxam was destroyed alongside Krypton. After the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO) release Mon-El into Supergirl&#x27;s custody, she helps him integrate into Earth&#x27;s society and use his powers for good. He adopts the alias Mike Matthews and eventually becomes a bartender at an alien bar. After Mon-El&#x27;s parents come to Earth to retrieve him, he reluctantly goes with them due to Rhea&#x27;s machinations until Lar Gand allows him to stay on Earth with Supergirl. Refusing to accept this, Rhea kills Lar Gand and attempts to conquer Earth, only to be foiled by Lena Luthor, who uses her brother Lex Luthor&#x27;s equipment to lace Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with a mixture of Kryptonite and lead to make the planet uninhabitable for Daxamites. Following the deaths of Rhea and several Daxamites, Mon-El leaves for deep space, where he enters a time portal, ends up in the 31st century, becomes a founding member of the Legion, and marries fellow Legionnaire Imra Ardeen over the course of seven years. After returning to the present to help Supergirl defeat Reign, Mon-El breaks up with Ardeen and brings Winn Schott to the 31st century to induct him into the Legion.
*** Additionally, two alternate timeline versions of Mon-El appear in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Super Life&quot;.
** Mon-El appears in &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;Duet&quot;.

===Film===
* Mon-El makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;Justice League vs. the Fatal Five&quot;.
* Lar Gand appears in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (2023), voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. This version is a member of the Dark Circle who infiltrates the Legion Academy to seize the Miracle Machine, during which he adopted the Mon-El alias due to being a self-proclaimed fan of Kryptonian culture.

=== Video games ===
Mon-El appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>Middle Chinese (formerly known as Ancient Chinese) or the Qieyun system (QYS) is the historical variety of Chinese recorded in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, a rime dictionary first published in 601 and followed by several revised and expanded editions. The Swedish linguist Bernhard Karlgren believed that the dictionary recorded a speech standard of the capital Chang&#x27;an of the Sui and Tang dynasties. However, based on the preface of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, most scholars now believe that it records a compromise between northern and southern reading and poetic traditions from the late Northern and Southern dynasties period. This composite system contains important information for the reconstruction of the preceding system of Old Chinese phonology (early 1st millennium BC).

The &quot;fanqie&quot; method used to indicate pronunciation in these dictionaries, though an improvement on earlier methods, proved awkward in practice. The mid-12th-century &quot;Yunjing&quot; and other rime tables incorporate a more sophisticated and convenient analysis of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; phonology. The rime tables attest to a number of sound changes that had occurred over the centuries following the publication of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;. Linguists sometimes refer to the system of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; as Early Middle Chinese and the variant revealed by the rime tables as Late Middle Chinese.

The dictionaries and tables describe pronunciations in relative terms, but do not give their actual sounds. Karlgren was the first to attempt a reconstruction of the sounds of Middle Chinese, comparing its categories with modern varieties of Chinese and the Sino-Xenic pronunciations used in the reading traditions of neighbouring countries. Several other scholars have produced their own reconstructions using similar methods.

The Qieyun system is often used as a framework for Chinese dialectology. With the exception of Min varieties, which show independent developments from Old Chinese, modern Chinese varieties can be largely treated as divergent developments from Middle Chinese. The study of Middle Chinese also provides for a better understanding and analysis of Classical Chinese poetry, such as the study of Tang poetry.

==Sources==
The reconstruction of Middle Chinese phonology is largely dependent upon detailed descriptions in a few original sources. The most important of these is the &quot;Qieyun&quot; rime dictionary (601) and its revisions. The &quot;Qieyun&quot; is often used together with interpretations in Song dynasty rime tables such as the &quot;Yunjing&quot;, &quot;Qiyin lüe&quot;, and the later &quot;Qieyun zhizhangtu&quot; and &quot;Sisheng dengzi&quot;. The documentary sources are supplemented by comparison with modern Chinese varieties, pronunciation of Chinese words borrowed by other languages—particularly Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese—transcription into Chinese characters of foreign names, transcription of Chinese names in alphabetic scripts such as Brahmi, Tibetan and Uyghur, and evidence regarding rhyme and tone patterns from classical Chinese poetry.

=== Rime dictionaries ===


Chinese scholars of the Northern and Southern dynasties period were concerned with the correct recitation of the classics.
Various schools produced dictionaries to codify reading pronunciations and the associated rhyme conventions of regulated verse. The &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601) was an attempt to merge the distinctions in six earlier dictionaries, which were eclipsed by its success and are no longer extant. It was accepted as the standard reading pronunciation during the Tang dynasty, and went through several revisions and expansions over the following centuries.

The &quot;Qieyun&quot; is thus the oldest surviving rhyme dictionary and the main source for the pronunciation of characters in Early Middle Chinese (EMC). At the time of Bernhard Karlgren&#x27;s seminal work on Middle Chinese in the early 20th century, only fragments of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; were known, and scholars relied on the &quot;Guangyun&quot; (1008), a much expanded edition from the Song dynasty. However, significant sections of a version of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; itself were subsequently discovered in the caves of Dunhuang, and a complete copy of Wang Renxu&#x27;s 706 edition from the Palace Library was found in 1947.

The rhyme dictionaries organize Chinese characters by their pronunciation, according to a hierarchy of tone, rhyme and homophony. Characters with identical pronunciations are grouped into homophone classes, whose pronunciation is described using two &quot;fanqie&quot; characters, the first of which has the initial sound of the characters in the homophone class and second of which has the same sound as the rest of the syllable (the final). The use of &quot;fanqie&quot; was an important innovation of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; and allowed the pronunciation of all characters to be described exactly; earlier dictionaries simply described the pronunciation of unfamiliar characters in terms of the most similar-sounding familiar character.

The &quot;fanqie&quot; system uses multiple equivalent characters to represent each particular initial, and likewise for finals. The categories of initials and finals actually represented were first identified by the Cantonese scholar Chen Li in a careful analysis published in his &quot;Qieyun kao&quot; (1842). Chen&#x27;s method was to equate two &quot;fanqie&quot; initials (or finals) whenever one was used in the &quot;fanqie&quot; spelling of the pronunciation of the other, and to follow chains of such equivalences to identify groups of spellers for each initial or final. For example, the pronunciation of the character was given using the &quot;fanqie&quot; spelling , the pronunciation of was given as , and the pronunciation of was given as , from which we can conclude that the words , and all had the same initial sound.

The &quot;Qieyun&quot; classified homonyms under 193 rhyme classes, each of which is placed within one of the four tones. A single rhyme class may contain multiple finals, generally differing only in the medial (especially when it is ) or in so-called &quot;chongniu&quot; doublets.

=== Rime tables ===


The &quot;Yunjing&quot; () is the oldest of the so-called rime tables, which provide a more detailed phonological analysis of the system contained in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;. The &quot;Yunjing&quot; was created centuries after the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, and the authors of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; were attempting to interpret a phonological system that differed in significant ways from that of their own Late Middle Chinese (LMC) dialect. They were aware of this, and attempted to reconstruct &quot;Qieyun&quot; phonology as well as possible through a close analysis of regularities in the system and co-occurrence relationships between the initials and finals indicated by the &quot;fanqie&quot; characters. However, the analysis inevitably shows some influence from LMC, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting difficult aspects of the system.

The &quot;Yunjing&quot; is organized into 43 tables, each covering several &quot;Qieyun&quot; rhyme classes, and classified as:
* One of 16 broad rhyme classes ()—each described as either &quot;inner&quot; or &quot;outer&quot;. The meaning of this is debated but it has been suggested that it refers to the height of the main vowel, with &quot;outer&quot; finals having an open vowel ( or , ) and &quot;inner&quot; finals having a mid or close vowel.
* &quot;Open mouth&quot; or &quot;closed mouth&quot;, indicating whether lip rounding is present. &quot;Closed&quot; finals either have a rounded vowel (e.g. ) or rounded glide.
Each table has 23 columns, one for each initial consonant. Although the &quot;Yunjing&quot; distinguishes 36 initials, they are placed in 23 columns by combining palatals, retroflexes, and dentals under the same column. This does not lead to cases where two homophone classes are conflated, as the grades (rows) are arranged so that all would-be minimal pairs distinguished only by the retroflex vs. palatal vs. alveolar character of the initial end up in different rows.

Each initial is further classified as follows:
* Place of articulation: labials, alveolars, velars, affricates and sibilants, and laryngeals
* Phonation: voiceless, voiceless aspirated, voiced, nasal or liquid

Each table also has 16 rows, with a group of 4 rows for each of the four tones of the traditional system in which finals ending in , or are considered to be checked tone variants of finals ending in , or rather than separate finals in their own right. The significance of the 4 rows within each tone is difficult to interpret, and is strongly debated. These rows are usually denoted I, II, III and IV, and are thought to relate to differences in palatalization or retroflexion of the syllable&#x27;s initial or medial, or differences in the quality of similar main vowels (e.g. , , ). Other scholars do not view them not as phonetic categories, but instead as formal devices exploiting distributional patterns in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; to achieve a compact presentation.

Each square in a table contains a character corresponding to a particular homophone class in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, if any such character exists. From this arrangement, each homophone class can be placed in the above categories.

===Modern dialects and Sino-Xenic pronunciations===
The rime dictionaries and rime tables identify categories of phonetic distinctions but do not indicate the actual pronunciations of these categories. The varied pronunciations of words in modern varieties of Chinese can help, but most modern varieties descend from a Late Middle Chinese koiné and cannot very easily be used to determine the pronunciation of Early Middle Chinese. During the Early Middle Chinese period, large amounts of Chinese vocabulary were systematically borrowed by Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese (collectively the Sino-Xenic pronunciations), but many distinctions were inevitably lost in mapping Chinese phonology onto foreign phonological systems.

For example, the following table shows the pronunciation of the numerals in three modern Chinese varieties, as well as borrowed forms in Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese:
===Transcription evidence===
Although the evidence from Chinese transcriptions of foreign words is much more limited, and is similarly obscured by the mapping of foreign pronunciations onto Chinese phonology, it serves as direct evidence of a sort that is lacking in all the other types of data, since the pronunciation of the foreign languages borrowed from—especially Sanskrit and Gandhari—is known in great detail.

For example, the nasal initials were used to transcribe Sanskrit nasals in the early Tang, but later they were used for Sanskrit unaspirated voiced initials , suggesting that they had become prenasalized stops in some northwestern Chinese dialects.

==Methodology==
The rime dictionaries and rime tables yield phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent.
At the end of the 19th century, European students of Chinese sought to solve this problem by applying the methods of historical linguistics that had been used in reconstructing Proto-Indo-European.
Volpicelli (1896) and Schaank (1897) compared the rime tables at the front of the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; with modern pronunciations in several varieties, but had little knowledge of linguistics.

Bernhard Karlgren, trained in transcription of Swedish dialects, carried out the first systematic survey of modern varieties of Chinese. He used the oldest known rime tables as descriptions of the sounds of the rime dictionaries, and also studied the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, at that time the oldest known rime dictionary. Unaware of Chen Li&#x27;s study, he repeated the analysis of the &quot;fanqie&quot; required to identify the initials and finals of the dictionary. He believed that the resulting categories reflected the speech standard of the capital Chang&#x27;an of the Sui and Tang dynasties. He interpreted the many distinctions as a narrow transcription of the precise sounds of this language, which he sought to reconstruct by treating the Sino-Xenic and modern dialect pronunciations as reflexes of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; categories. A small number of &quot;Qieyun&quot; categories were not distinguished in any of the surviving pronunciations, and Karlgren assigned them identical reconstructions.

Karlgren&#x27;s transcription involved a large number of consonants and vowels, many of them very unevenly distributed. Accepting Karlgren&#x27;s reconstruction as a description of medieval speech, Chao Yuen Ren and Samuel E. Martin analysed its contrasts to extract a phonemic description. Hugh M. Stimson used a simplified version of Martin&#x27;s system as an approximate indication of the pronunciation of Tang poetry. Karlgren himself viewed phonemic analysis as a detrimental &quot;craze&quot;.

Older versions of the rime dictionaries and rime tables came to light over the first half of the 20th century, and were used by such linguists as Wang Li, Dong Tonghe and Li Rong in their own reconstructions. Edwin Pulleyblank argued that the systems of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; and the rime tables should be reconstructed as two separate (but related) systems, which he called Early and Late Middle Chinese, respectively. He further argued that his Late Middle Chinese reflected the standard language of the late Tang dynasty.

The preface of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; recovered in 1947 indicates that it records a compromise between northern and southern reading and poetic traditions from the late Northern and Southern dynasties period (a diasystem). Most linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere. Several scholars have compared the &quot;Qieyun&quot; system to cross-dialectal descriptions of English pronunciations, such as John C. Wells&#x27;s lexical sets, or the notation used in some dictionaries. For example, the words &quot;trap&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;palm&quot;, &quot;lot&quot;, &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;thought&quot; contain four different vowels in Received Pronunciation and three in General American; these pronunciations and others can be specified in terms of these six cases.

Although the &quot;Qieyun&quot; system is no longer viewed as describing a single form of speech, linguists argue that this enhances its value in reconstructing earlier forms of Chinese, just as a cross-dialectal description of English pronunciations contains more information about earlier forms of English than any single modern form. The emphasis has shifted from precise phones to the structure of the phonological system. Li Fang-Kuei, as a prelude to his reconstruction of Old Chinese, produced a revision of Karlgren&#x27;s notation, adding new notations for the few categories not distinguished by Karlgren, without assigning them pronunciations.
This notation is still widely used, but its symbols, based on Johan August Lundell&#x27;s Swedish Dialect Alphabet, differ from the familiar International Phonetic Alphabet. To remedy this, William H. Baxter produced his own notation for the &quot;Qieyun&quot; and rime table categories for use in his reconstruction of Old Chinese.

All reconstructions of Middle Chinese since Karlgren have followed his approach of beginning with the categories extracted from the rime dictionaries and tables, and using dialect and Sino-Xenic data (and in some cases transcription data) in a subsidiary role to fill in sound values for these categories. Jerry Norman and W. South Coblin have criticized this approach, arguing that viewing the dialect data through the rime dictionaries and rime tables distorts the evidence. They argue for a full application of the comparative method to the modern varieties, supplemented by systematic use of transcription data.

==Phonology==
The traditional analysis of the Chinese syllable, derived from the &quot;fanqie&quot; method, is into an initial consonant, or &quot;initial&quot;, ( ) and a final ( ). Modern linguists subdivide the final into an optional &quot;medial&quot; glide ( ), a main vowel or &quot;nucleus&quot; ( ) and an optional final consonant or &quot;coda&quot; ( ). Most reconstructions of Middle Chinese include the glides and , as well as a combination , but many also include vocalic &quot;glides&quot; such as in a diphthong . Final consonants , , , , , , and are widely accepted, sometimes with additional codas such as or . Rhyming syllables in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; are assumed to have the same nuclear vowel and coda, but often have different medials.

Middle Chinese reconstructions by different modern linguists vary. These differences are minor and fairly uncontroversial in terms of consonants; however, there is a more significant difference as to the vowels.
The most widely used transcriptions are Li Fang-Kuei&#x27;s modification of Karlgren&#x27;s reconstruction and William Baxter&#x27;s typeable notation.

===Initials===
The preface of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; identifies a traditional set of 36 initials, each named with an exemplary character. An earlier version comprising 30 initials is known from fragments among the Dunhuang manuscripts. In contrast, identifying the initials of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; required a painstaking analysis of &quot;fanqie&quot; relationships across the whole dictionary, a task first undertaken by the Cantonese scholar Chen Li in 1842 and refined by others since. This analysis revealed a slightly different set of initials from the traditional set. Moreover, most scholars believe that some distinctions among the 36 initials were no longer current at the time of the rime tables, but were retained under the influence of the earlier dictionaries.

Early Middle Chinese (EMC) had three types of stops: voiced, voiceless, and voiceless aspirated. There were five series of coronal obstruents, with a three-way distinction between dental (or alveolar), retroflex and palatal among fricatives and affricates, and a two-way dental/retroflex distinction among stop consonants. The following table shows the initials of Early Middle Chinese, with their traditional names and approximate values:

Old Chinese had a simpler system with no palatal or retroflex consonants; the more complex system of EMC is thought to have arisen from a combination of Old Chinese obstruents with a following and/or .

Bernhard Karlgren developed the first modern reconstruction of Middle Chinese. The main differences between Karlgren and newer reconstructions of the initials are:
* The reversal of and . Karlgren based his reconstruction on the Song dynasty rime tables. However, because of mergers between these two sounds between Early and Late Middle Chinese, the Chinese phonologists who created the rime tables could rely only on tradition to tell what the respective values of these two consonants were; evidently they were accidentally reversed at one stage.
* Karlgren also assumed that the EMC retroflex stops were actually palatal stops based on their tendency to co-occur with front vowels and , but this view is no longer held.
* Karlgren assumed that voiced consonants were actually breathy voiced. This is now assumed only for LMC, not EMC.

Other sources from around the same time as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; reveal a slightly different system, which is believed to reflect southern pronunciation. In this system, the voiced fricatives and are not distinguished from the voiced affricates and , respectively, and the retroflex stops are not distinguished from the dental stops.

Several changes occurred between the time of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; and the rime tables:
* Palatal sibilants merged with retroflex sibilants.
* merged with (hence reflecting four separate EMC phonemes).
* The palatal nasal also became retroflex, but turned into a new phoneme rather than merging with any existing phoneme.
* The palatal allophone of () merged with () as a single laryngeal initial ().
* A new series of labiodentals emerged from labials in certain environments, typically where both fronting and rounding occurred (e.g. plus a back vowel in William Baxter&#x27;s reconstruction, or a front rounded vowel in Chan&#x27;s reconstruction). However, modern Min dialects retain bilabial initials in such words, while modern Hakka dialects preserve them in some common words.
* Voiced obstruents gained phonetic breathy voice (still reflected in the Wu Chinese varieties).
The following table shows a representative account of the initials of Late Middle Chinese.
The voicing distinction is retained in modern Wu and Old Xiang dialects, but has disappeared from other varieties. In Min dialects the retroflex dentals are represented with the dentals, while elsewhere they have merged with the retroflex sibilants. In the south these have also merged with the dental sibilants, but the distinction is retained in most Mandarin dialects. The palatal series of modern Mandarin dialects, resulting from a merger of palatal allophones of dental sibilants and velars, is a much more recent development, unconnected with the earlier palatal consonants.

===Finals===
The remainder of a syllable after the initial consonant is the final, represented in the Qieyun by several equivalent second &quot;fanqie&quot; spellers. Each final is contained within a single rhyme class, but a rhyme class may contain between one and four finals. Finals are usually analysed as consisting of an optional medial, either a semivowel, reduced vowel or some combination of these, a vowel, an optional final consonant and a tone. Their reconstruction is much more difficult than the initials due to the combination of multiple phonemes into a single class.

The generally accepted final consonants are semivowels and , nasals , and , and stops , and . Some authors also propose codas and , based on the separate treatment of certain rhyme classes in the dictionaries. Finals with vocalic and nasal codas may have one of three tones, named level, rising and departing. Finals with stop codas are distributed in the same way as corresponding nasal finals, and are described as their entering tone counterparts.

There is much less agreement regarding the medials and vowels. It is generally agreed that &quot;closed&quot; finals had a rounded glide or vowel , and that the vowels in &quot;outer&quot; finals were more open than those in &quot;inner&quot; finals.
The interpretation of the &quot;divisions&quot; is more controversial. Three classes of &quot;Qieyun&quot; finals occur exclusively in the first, second or fourth rows of the rime tables, respectively, and have thus been labelled finals of divisions I, II and IV.
The remaining finals are labelled division-III finals because they occur in the third row, but they may also occur in the second or fourth rows for some initials. Most linguists agree that division-III finals contained a medial and that division-I finals had no such medial, but further details vary between reconstructions. To account for the many rhyme classes distinguished by the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, Karlgren proposed 16 vowels and 4 medials. Later scholars have proposed numerous variations.

===Tones===
The four tones of Middle Chinese were first listed by Shen Yue . The first three, the &quot;even&quot; or &quot;level&quot;, &quot;rising&quot; and &quot;departing&quot; tones, occur in open syllables and syllables ending with nasal consonants. The remaining syllables, ending in stop consonants, were described as the &quot;entering&quot; tone counterparts of syllables ending with the corresponding nasals. The &quot;Qieyun&quot; and its successors were organized around these categories, with two volumes for the even tone, which had the most words, and one volume each for the other tones.

The pitch contours of modern reflexes of the four Middle Chinese tones vary so widely that linguists have not been able to establish the probable Middle Chinese values by means of the comparative method. Karlgren interpreted the names of the first three tones literally as level, rising and falling pitch contours, respectively, and this interpretation remains widely accepted. Accordingly, Pan and Zhang reconstruct the level tone as mid ( or 33), the rising tone as mid rising ( or 35), the departing tone as high falling ( or 51), and the entering tone as ˧3ʔ. Some scholars have voiced doubts about the degree to which the names were descriptive, because they are also examples of the tone categories.

Some descriptions from contemporaries and other data seem to suggest a somewhat different picture. For example, the oldest known description of the tones, which is found in a Song dynasty quotation from the early 9th century &quot;Yuanhe Yunpu&quot; (no longer extant):

Level tone is sad and stable. Rising tone is strident and rising. Departing tone is clear and distant. Entering tone is straight and abrupt.

In 880, the Japanese monk Annen, citing an account from the early 8th century, stated

the level tone was straight and low, ... the rising tone was straight and high, ... the departing tone was slightly drawn out, ... the entering tone stops abruptly
Based on Annen&#x27;s description, other similar statements and related data, Mei Tsu-lin concluded that the level tone was long, level and low, the rising tone was short, level and high, the departing tone was somewhat long and probably high and rising, and the entering tone was short (as the syllable ended in a voiceless stop) and probably high.

The tone system of Middle Chinese is strikingly similar to those of its neighbours in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area—proto-Hmong–Mien, proto-Tai and early Vietnamese—none of which is genetically related to Chinese. Moreover, the earliest strata of loans display a regular correspondence between tonal categories in the different languages. In 1954, André-Georges Haudricourt showed that Vietnamese counterparts of the rising and departing tones corresponded to final and , respectively, in other (atonal) Austroasiatic languages. He thus argued that the Austroasiatic proto-language had been atonal, and that the development of tones in Vietnamese had been conditioned by these consonants, which had subsequently disappeared, a process now known as tonogenesis. Haudricourt further proposed that tone in the other languages, including Middle Chinese, had a similar origin. Other scholars have since uncovered transcriptional and other evidence for these consonants in early forms of Chinese, and many linguists now believe that Old Chinese was atonal.

Around the end of the first millennium AD, Middle Chinese and the southeast Asian languages experienced a phonemic split of their tone categories. Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials, known as the &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot;. When voicing was lost in most varieties (except in the Wu and Old Xiang groups and some Gan dialects), this distinction became phonemic, yielding up to eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables. Cantonese maintains these tones and has developed an additional distinction in checked syllables, resulting in a total of nine tonal categories. However, most varieties have fewer tonal distinctions. For example, in Mandarin dialects the lower rising category merged with the departing category to form the modern falling tone, leaving a system of four tones. Furthermore, final stop consonants disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, and such syllables were reassigned to one of the other four tones.

===Changes from Old to Modern Chinese===

Middle Chinese had a structure similar to many modern varieties, especially conservative ones like Cantonese, with largely monosyllabic words, little or no derivational morphology, three tones, and a syllable structure consisting of initial consonant, glide, main vowel and final consonant, with a large number of initial consonants and a fairly small number of final consonants. Without counting the glide, no clusters could occur at the beginning or end of a syllable.

Old Chinese, on the other hand, had a significantly different structure. There were no tones, a smaller imbalance between possible initial and final consonants, and many initial and final clusters. There was a well-developed system of derivational and possibly inflectional morphology, formed using consonants added onto the beginning or end of a syllable. The system is similar to the system reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan and still visible, for example, in Classical Tibetan; it is also largely similar to the system that occurs in the more conservative Austroasiatic languages, such as modern Khmer.

The main changes leading to the modern varieties have been a reduction in the number of consonants and vowels and a corresponding increase in the number of tones (typically through a Pan-East-Asiatic tone split that doubled the number of tones and eliminated the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants). That has led to a gradual decrease in the number of possible syllables. Standard Mandarin has only about 1,300 possible syllables, and many other varieties of Chinese even fewer (for example, modern Shanghainese has been reported to have only about 700 syllables). The result in Mandarin, for example, has been the proliferation of the number of two-syllable compound words, which have steadily replaced former monosyllabic words; most words in Standard Mandarin now have two syllables.

==Grammar==
The extensive surviving body of Middle Chinese (MC) literature of various types provides much source material for the study of MC grammar. Due to the lack of morphological development, grammatical analysis of MC tends to focus on the nature and meanings of the individual words themselves and the syntactic rules by which their arrangement together in sentences communicates meaning.

<text>Warfarin, sold under the brand name Coumadin among others, is an anticoagulant medication. While the drug is described as a &quot;blood thinner&quot;, it does not reduce viscosity but rather prevents blood clots (thrombus) from forming (coagulating). Accordingly, it is commonly used to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to protect against stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or artificial heart valves. Warfarin may sometimes be prescribed following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is usually taken by mouth, but may also be administered intravenously. It is a vitamin K antagonist.
The common side effect, a natural consequence of reduced clotting, is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage, and purple toes syndrome. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. The effects of warfarin are typically monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytomenadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.
Warfarin decreases blood clotting by blocking vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, the plasma concentrations of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X are reduced and thus have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited, but to a lesser degree. 
Despite being labeled a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K1, but rather antagonizes vitamin K1 recycling, depleting active vitamin K1.
A few days are required for full effect to occur, and these effects can last for up to five days. Because the mechanism involves enzymes such as &quot;VKORC1&quot;, patients on warfarin with polymorphisms of the enzymes may require adjustments in therapy if the genetic variant that they have is more readily inhibited by warfarin, thus requiring lower doses.
Warfarin first came into large-scale commercial use in 1948 as a rat poison. It was formally approved as a medication to treat blood clots in humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1954. In 1955, warfarin&#x27;s reputation as a safe and acceptable treatment for coronary artery disease, arterial plaques, and ischemic strokes was bolstered when President Dwight D. Eisenhower was treated with warfarin following a highly publicized heart attack. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Warfarin is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names. In 2022, it was the 85th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.
== Medical uses ==
Warfarin is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension, pulmonary embolism; prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve replacement; and reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction.

Warfarin is used to decrease the tendency for thrombosis, or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).

Warfarin is best suited for anticoagulation (clot formation inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves), and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally has no effect on platelet function). It can be used to treat people following ischemic strokes due to atrial fibrillation, though direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may offer greater benefits.

=== Dosing ===
Dosing of warfarin is complicated because it is known to interact with many commonly used medications and certain foods. These interactions may enhance or reduce warfarin&#x27;s anticoagulation effect. To optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding, close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an prothrombin time (INR). During the initial stage of treatment, INR is checked daily; intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic INR levels on an unchanged warfarin dose. Newer point-of-care testing is available and has increased the ease of INR testing in the outpatient setting. Instead of a blood draw, the point-of-care test involves a simple finger prick.

==== Maintenance dose ====

Recommendations by many national bodies, including the American College of Chest Physicians, have been distilled to help manage dose adjustments.

The maintenance dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such as peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1. Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains, and other milled products are also low in vitamin K1. 

Several studies reported that the maintenance dose can be predicted based on various clinical data.

==== Self-testing ====
Anticoagulation with warfarin can also be monitored by patients at home. International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005. The guidelines stated:

A 2006 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials showed home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (thrombosis and major bleeding), and improved the time in the therapeutic range.

=== Alternative anticoagulants ===
In some countries, other coumarins are used instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have been approved in a number of countries for classical warfarin uses. Complementing these drugs are reversal agents available for dabigatran (idarucizumab), and for apixaban, and rivaroxaban (andexanet alfa). Andexanet alfa is suggested for edoxaban, but use of it is considered off label due to limited evidence. A reversal agent for dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban is in development (ciraparantag).

== Contraindications ==
All anticoagulants are generally contraindicated in situations in which the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding (e.g., low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension). For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal and lumbar puncture (e.g., spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk, so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.

Warfarin should not be given to people with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia until platelet count has improved or normalised. Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency, as these thrombophilic conditions increase the risk of skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious side effect associated with warfarin.

=== Pregnancy ===

Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy, as it passes through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin &quot;in utero&quot; appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) have been reported in some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.

==== First trimester of pregnancy ====
Usually, warfarin is avoided in the first trimester, and a low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted. With heparin, risks of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects. Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.

When warfarin (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) is given during the first trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.

==== Second trimester and later ====
Warfarin administration in the second and third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from FWS. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.

Warfarin may be used in lactating women who wish to breastfeed their infants. Available data does not suggest that warfarin crosses into the breast milk. Similarly, INR levels should be checked to avoid adverse effects.

== Adverse effects ==

=== Bleeding ===
The only common side effect of warfarin is hemorrhage. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typical yearly rate of 1–3% has been reported), and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.

Several risk scores exist to predict bleeding in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled high blood pressure (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g., aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

=== Warfarin necrosis ===

A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of protein C, an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors whose synthesis warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood&#x27;s tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.

=== Osteoporosis ===
After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density, several studies demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.

A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men, but no association in women was seen. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.

=== Purple toe syndrome ===

Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in the skin of the feet, which causes a blueish-purple colour and may be painful.

It is typically thought to affect the big toe, but it affects other parts of the feet, as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.

=== Calcification ===
Several studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular and vascular calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.

== Overdose ==
The major side effect of warfarin use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.

In patients with supratherapeutic INR but INR less than 10 and no bleeding, it is enough to lower the dose or omit a dose, monitor the INR and resume warfarin at an adjusted lower dose when the target INR is reached. For people who need rapid reversal of warfarin – such as due to serious bleeding – or who need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Generally, four-factor PCC can be given more quickly than FFP, the amount needed is a smaller volume of fluid than FFP, and does not require ABO blood typing. Administration of PCCs results in rapid hemostasis, similar to that of FFP, namely, with comparable rates of thromboembolic events, but with reduced rates of volume overload. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose, when vitamin K could work alone. While PCC has been found in lab tests to be better than FFP, when rapid reversal is needed, as of 2018, whether a difference in outcomes such as death or disability exists is unclear.

When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.

== Interactions ==

Warfarin interacts with many commonly used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods have also been reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause an increase in the INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g., simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.

When taken with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased risk is due to the antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs and possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.

Many commonly used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.

Excessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the INR, and thus increase the risk of bleeding. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided. The Cleveland Clinic suggests that when taking warfarin one should not drink more than &quot;one beer, 6 oz of wine, or one shot of alcohol per day&quot;.

Warfarin also interacts with many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for medicinal purposes (such as ginseng and &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects have been reported with borage (starflower) oil. St. John&#x27;s wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces the effectiveness of a given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.

Between 2003 and 2004, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines received several reports of increased INR and risk of haemorrhage in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice. Data establishing a causal relationship are still lacking, and a 2006 review found no cases of this interaction reported to the USFDA; nevertheless, several authors have recommended that both doctors and patients be made aware of its possibility. The mechanism behind the interaction is still unclear.

== Chemistry ==

X-ray crystallographic studies of warfarin show that it exists in tautomeric form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3-position substituent. However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.

=== Stereochemistry ===
Warfarin contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e., a 1: 1 mixture of (&quot; R &quot;) – and the (&quot; S &quot;) – form:

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Warfarin consists of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomers—&quot;R&quot;- and &quot;S&quot;- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is two to five times more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response. Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3&#x27;,4&#x27;,6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.

Warfarin is slower-acting than the common anticoagulant heparin, though it has a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (an antibody-mediated decrease in platelet levels), which increases the risk for thrombosis. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect, since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a half-life time of days). Warfarin&#x27;s long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it is stopped. Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below).

=== Mechanism of action ===
Warfarin is one of several drugs often referred to as a &quot;blood thinner&quot;; this is not technically correct, as these drugs reduce coagulation of blood, increasing the clotting time, without affecting the viscosity (&quot;thickness&quot;) as such of blood.

Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K-dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as the regulatory factors protein C, protein S, and protein Z. Other proteins not involved in blood clotting, such as osteocalcin, or matrix Gla protein, may also be affected.
The precursors of these factors require gamma carboxylation of their glutamic acid residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces inside blood vessels, on the vascular endothelium. The enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction proceeds only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The vitamin K epoxide is, in turn, recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme, the vitamin K epoxide reductase (&quot;VKOR&quot;). Warfarin inhibits &quot;VKOR&quot; (specifically the VKORC1 subunit), thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues, which decreases the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain glutamic acid residues, and are incapable of binding to the endothelial surface of blood vessels, and are thus biologically inactive. As the body&#x27;s stores of previously produced active factors degrade (over several days) and are replaced by inactive factors, the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent. The coagulation factors are produced, but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation; they are collectively referred to as PIVKAs (proteins induced [by] vitamin K absence), and individual coagulation factors as PIVKA-&quot;number&quot; (e.g., PIVKA-II).

When warfarin is newly started, it may &quot;promote&quot; clot formation temporarily, because the level of proteins C and S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead to a reduction in activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor), so reduces degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5 mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5 mg per day, to co-administering heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, is beneficial, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.

=== Pharmacogenomics ===
Warfarin activity is determined partially by genetic factors. Polymorphisms in two genes (&quot;VKORC1&quot; and &quot;CYP2C9&quot;) play a particularly large role in response to warfarin.

&quot;VKORC1&quot; polymorphisms explain 30% of the dose variation between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 less susceptible to suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). &quot;VKORC1&quot; polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A &quot;VKORC1&quot; polymorphisms lead to a more rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.

&quot;CYP2C9&quot; polymorphisms explain 10% of the dose variation between patients, mainly among Caucasian patients as these variants are rare in African American and most Asian populations. These &quot;CYP2C9&quot; polymorphisms do not influence time to effective INR as opposed to &quot;VKORC1&quot;, but do shorten the time to INR &gt; 4.

Despite the promise of pharmacogenomic testing in warfarin dosing, its use in clinical practice is controversial. In August 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded, &quot;the available evidence does not demonstrate that pharmacogenomic testing of &quot;CYP2C9&quot; or &quot;VKORC1&quot; alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness improves health outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries.&quot; A 2014 meta-analysis showed that using genotype-based dosing did not confer benefit in terms of time within therapeutic range, excessive anticoagulation (as defined by INR greater than 4), or a reduction in either major bleeding or thromboembolic events.

== History ==
In the early 1920s, an outbreak occurred of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures, and on some occasions spontaneously. For example, 21 of 22 cows died after dehorning, and 12 of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had bled to death.

In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian veterinary pathologist, determined that the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, and that this was functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the US and in Canada since the turn of the century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Lee M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.

The identity of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933, Karl Paul Link and his laboratory of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. Five years were needed before Link&#x27;s student, Harold A. Campbell, recovered 6 mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link&#x27;s student, Mark A. Stahmann, took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell&#x27;s, and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments, they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3&#x27;-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.

Dicoumarol was a product of the plant molecule coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants such as sweet grass; in fact, the plant&#x27;s high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of &quot;sweet clover&quot;, which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (&quot;Galium odoratum&quot;, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. The name coumarin comes via the French &quot;coumarou&quot; from &quot;kumarú&quot;, the Tupi name for the tree of the tonka bean, which notably contains a high concentration of coumarin. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, to have any anticoagulant properties.

Over the next few years, numerous similar chemicals (specifically 4-hydroxycoumarins with a large aromatic substituent at the 3 position) were found to have the same anticoagulant properties. The first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was dicoumarol itself, patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical. Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin-based anticoagulants for use as rodent poisons, resulting in warfarin in 1948. The name &quot;warfarin&quot; stems from the acronym WARF, for Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation + the ending &quot;-arin&quot; indicating its link with coumarin. Warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the US in 1948, and was immediately popular. Although warfarin was developed by Link, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent.

After an incident in 1951, in which an army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide, but recovered fully after presenting to a naval hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began in the use of warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954, was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US President Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.

The exact mechanism of action remained unknown until it was demonstrated, in 1978, that warfarin inhibits the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, and hence interferes with vitamin K metabolism.

Lavrenty Beria and I. V. Khrustalyov are thought to have conspired to use warfarin to poison Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Warfarin is tasteless and colourless, and produces symptoms similar to those that Stalin exhibited.

===Occupational safety===
Warfarin used for pest control is a hazardous substance harmful to health. People can be exposed to warfarin in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin absorption, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for warfarin exposure in the workplace as 0.1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100 mg/m3, warfarin is immediately dangerous to life and health.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

== Society and culture ==
The name &quot;warfarin&quot; is derived from the acronym for &quot;Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation&quot;, plus &quot;-arin&quot;, indicating its link with coumarin. Warfarin is a derivative of dicoumarol, an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover. Dicoumarol, in turn, is from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in &quot;sweet&quot; clover and tonka beans (also known as &quot;cumaru&quot; from which coumarin&#x27;s name derives).

=== Brand names ===
Warfarin as a drug is marketed under many brand and generic names, including Aldocumar, Anasmol, Anticoag, Befarin, Cavamed, Cicoxil, Circuvit, Cofarin, Coumadin, Coumadine, Cumar, Farin, Foley, Haemofarin, Jantoven, Kovar, Lawarin, Maforan, Marevan, Marfarin, Marivanil, Martefarin, Morfarin, Orfarin, Panwarfin, Scheme, Simarc, Varfarin, Varfarins, Varfine, Waran, Warcok, Warf, Warfareks, Warfarin, Warfarina, Warfarine, Warfarinum, Warfen, Warfin, Warik, Warin, Warlin, and Zyfarin.

== Veterinary use ==
Warfarin is used as a poison for rats and other pests.

=== Pest control ===
Warfarin was introduced as a rodenticide, only later finding medical uses; in both cases it was used as an anticoagulant. The use of warfarin itself as a rat poison is declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it, and poisons of considerably greater potency have become available. However, warfarin continued to be considered a valuable tool for rodent control which minimised risk to other species.

====Rodents====

Coumarins (4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives) are used as rodenticides for controlling rats and mice in residential, industrial, and agricultural areas. Warfarin is both odorless and tasteless, and is effective when mixed with food bait, because the rodents will return to the bait and continue to feed over a period of days until a lethal dose is accumulated (considered to be 1 mg/kg/day over about six days). It may also be mixed with talc and used as a tracking powder, which accumulates on the animal&#x27;s skin and fur, and is subsequently consumed during grooming. The for warfarin is 50–100mg/kg for a single dose, after 5–7 days. 1mg/kg for repeated daily doses for 5 days, after 5–8 days. The IDLH value is 100 mg/m3 (warfarin; various species).

Resistance to warfarin as a poison has developed in many rat populations due to an autosomal dominant on chromosome 1 in brown rats. This has arisen independently and become fixed several times around the world. Other 4-hydroxycoumarins used as rodenticides include coumatetralyl and brodifacoum, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;super-warfarin&quot;, because it is more potent, longer-acting, and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin. Unlike warfarin, which is readily excreted, newer anticoagulant poisons also accumulate in the liver and kidneys after ingestion. However, such rodenticides may also accumulate in birds of prey and other animals that eat the poisoned rodents or baits.

==== Vampire bats ====
Warfarin is used to cull populations of vampire bats, in which rabies is often prevalent, in areas where human–wildlife conflict is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated with a combination of petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost and other members of the roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.

=== Brand names ===
Warfarin as a pest control poison is marketed under many brand and generic names, including Cov-R-Tox, Co-Rax, d-Con, Dethmor, Killgerm Sewercide, Mar-Fin, Rattunal, Rax, Rodex, Rodex Blox, Rosex, Sakarat, Sewarin, Solfarin, Sorex Warfarin, Tox-Hid, Warf, warfarin, and Warfarat. Warfarin is called coumafene in France, zoocoumarin in the Netherlands and Russia, and coumarin in Japan.

<text>Peter Gordon MacKay (born September 27, 1965) is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2015 and has served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General (2013–2015), Minister of National Defence (2007–2013), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (2006–2007) in the Cabinet of Canada under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. MacKay was the final leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and he agreed to merge the party with Stephen Harper&#x27;s Canadian Alliance in 2003, forming the Conservative Party of Canada and making MacKay one of the co-founders of the current conservative wing of Canadian politics.

The son of Canadian politician and Minister of Public Works Elmer MacKay, MacKay received his undergraduate degree from Acadia University and his law degree from Dalhousie University. MacKay represented the riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough from 1997 to 2004, and the riding of Central Nova from 2004 until 2015, when he decided not to run in that year&#x27;s federal election. With the defeat of the Conservatives in the 2015 federal election, he was considered a potential candidate to succeed Stephen Harper as permanent leader of the party. Between 2015 and 2020, he was a partner with Baker McKenzie at their Toronto office.

On January 15, 2020, MacKay announced his candidacy for the 2020 Conservative leadership race. He was defeated by former veterans affairs minister Erin O’Toole on the third ballot of the leadership vote. Since the race, he moved back to Nova Scotia and is now a senior counsel with the law firm McInnes Cooper, and a strategic advisor with Deloitte Canada.

==Early life and career==
MacKay was born in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. His father, Elmer MacKay, is a former PC cabinet minister, lumber businessman, and lawyer. His mother, Eirene Macha MacKay (née Delap; 1938–2017), was a psychologist and peace activist; through her, Peter MacKay is descended from James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Caledon and James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam. MacKay grew up in Wolfville, Nova Scotia with his three siblings. He graduated from Horton High School in Greenwich, Nova Scotia, and then went on to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Acadia University/Carleton University in 1987. MacKay then studied law at Dalhousie University and was called to the Nova Scotia Bar in June 1991. He worked for Thyssen Henschel, a steel producer, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in Düsseldorf and Kassel, Germany.

In 1993, MacKay accepted an appointment as Crown Attorney for the Central Region of Nova Scotia. He prosecuted cases at all levels, including youth and provincial courts as well as the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKay has publicly stated that the major impetus for his entry into federal politics was his frustrations with the shortcomings in the justice system, particularly his perception that the courts do not care about the impact crime has on victims.

==Member of Parliament==
MacKay was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the June 2, 1997 federal election for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, a riding in northeastern Nova Scotia. He was one of a handful of newly elected &quot;Young Turk&quot; PC MPs (including John Herron, André Bachand and Scott Brison), who were under 35 years old when elected and were considered the future leadership material that might restore the ailing Tories to their glory days. In his first term of office, MacKay served as Justice Critic and House Leader for the Progressive Conservative parliamentary caucus. MacKay was the PC member of the Board of Internal Economy and the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. He also acted as an associate member of the Standing Committees on Canadian Heritage, Finance and the sub-committee on the Study of Sport. Peter MacKay served as PC Party House Leader from September 23, 1997, to September 12, 2001.

MacKay was re-elected in the 2000 federal election and was frequently touted by the media as a possible successor to PC Party leader Joe Clark. Many of his initial supporters referred to his strong performances in the House of Commons and magnetism as key attributes that would make him a popular leader. MacKay has been voted the &quot;sexiest male MP in the House of Commons&quot; by the &quot;Hill Times&quot; (a Parliament Hill newspaper) for six years in a row. When asked in a 2001 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary on the resurgence of the PC Party if he would ever consider running for the PC leadership, MacKay quipped, &quot;If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned in politics it&#x27;s &#x27;never say never.&#x27; Jean Charest taught me that.&quot;

In August 2001, he was one of several PC MPs to engage in open cooperation talks with disaffected Canadian Alliance MPs in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. Eventually a union of sorts was created between the PCs and the newly formed Democratic Representative Caucus (DRC). MacKay was appointed House Leader of the new PC-DR Parliamentary Coalition Caucus when it was formally recognized as a political body on September 10, 2001. The PC-DR initiative collapsed in April 2002, raising questions about Clark&#x27;s leadership. Clark announced his impending resignation as party leader at the PC Party&#x27;s bi-annual convention held in Edmonton, Alberta in August 2002. MacKay&#x27;s name was one of the first to be raised as a possible leadership contender.

===2003 Progressive Conservative leadership race===
MacKay was largely seen as the assumed victor of the race from the outset of the leadership contest. Ultimately, his candidacy was helped by the absence of so-called &quot;dream candidates&quot; such as provincial Progressive Conservative Premiers Bernard Lord, Mike Harris and Ralph Klein who did not run for the leadership. MacKay formally launched his leadership campaign in his hometown of New Glasgow in January 2003. From the onset of the campaign, MacKay insisted that his primary goal upon assuming the leadership would be the rebuilding the fractured conservative movement from within the PC tent. For much of the race, MacKay was the clear front-runner. Several opponents, including former PC Party Treasurer Jim Prentice, social conservative candidate Craig Chandler, and Red Tory Nova Scotia MP Scott Brison, painted MacKay as a &quot;status quo&quot; or &quot;establishment&quot; candidate who could effectively question the Prime Minister.

MacKay&#x27;s campaign was largely based on his leadership skills and a national organization rather than on policies or new directions. MacKay is largely viewed by political analysts as a Red Tory. He voted in favour of same-sex marriage in 2006.

====Leadership convention====
MacKay entered the first ballot of the PC leadership convention held on May 31, 2003 with roughly 41% of the delegates supporting him. However, on the second ballot, MacKay&#x27;s support dropped to 39%. On the third ballot, MacKay&#x27;s support reached 45% but many of his supporters were convinced that he had hit his popular peak. Some analysts noted that the eliminated third-place challenger David Orchard drew his 25% bulk of delegate supporters largely from the Western prairie provinces. Orchard was prepared to speak with either MacKay or Prentice to determine if a deal could be reached over some of the issues that he raised during the leadership campaign. As the results of the third ballot were called, MacKay&#x27;s campaign manager, PC Senator Noël Kinsella, hastily arranged a backroom meeting between MacKay, Orchard, and their campaign advisors. During the meeting, MacKay reached a deal with his rival, and Orchard emerged from the room urging his delegates to support MacKay. Press officials immediately demanded to know what had inspired Orchard&#x27;s surprise move. Orchard repeatedly referred to a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; made between himself and MacKay that had led to his qualified support.

MacKay won the final ballot with nearly 65% of the delegates supporting him. For the next few weeks, the specific details of the &quot;Orchard deal&quot; remained vague: a secret between MacKay, Orchard, and their advisors. However, it was eventually revealed that the &quot;Orchard deal&quot; promised a review of the PC Party&#x27;s policies on the North American Free Trade Agreement, no merger or joint candidates with the Canadian Alliance, and a promise to redouble efforts to rebuild the national status of the Progressive Conservative Party. The agreement also included re-examining the PC Party&#x27;s policies on government subsidies for national railways and preserving the environment. The deal also requested that MacKay &quot;clean up&quot; the party&#x27;s head office and specifically requested that the party&#x27;s National Director be fired. Further evidence later revealed Scott Brison&#x27;s cellphone number written in the margins of the note for some unexplained reason. In an attempt to heal internal rifts after the convention, MacKay edited out the number. After Brison defected to the Liberal party, however, MacKay revealed the original copy. The agreement prompted much outrage and controversy amongst United Alternative supporters and was ribaldly referred to by CA MP Jason Kenney as &quot;a deal with the Devil&quot;.

At first, MacKay seemed to be willing to adhere to the deal. In June, several Clark-appointed personnel were let go from the party&#x27;s main office and MacKay appointed new experienced staff whose loyalties were more closely linked to himself and former Prime Minister and PC Party leader Brian Mulroney. MacKay also appointed a couple of low level staff workers who had been supportive of David Orchard&#x27;s leadership bid. In July, MacKay struck up a &quot;Blue Ribbon PC Policy Review Panel&quot;, made up of conservative MPs, Senators, and Orchard himself, that was to be chaired by MP Bill Casey, in order to reexamine the party&#x27;s policies on NAFTA. The committee was scheduled to hold talks across the country and make a report to the leader by January 2004.

By mid-July, political opponents and fellow Tories began attacking MacKay over the &quot;Orchard deal.&quot; MacKay&#x27;s conservative rival Stephen Harper suggested that the PC Party had hit rock-bottom when its policies and directions would be beholden to a &quot;prairie socialist.&quot; The secretive nature of the deal also led to concerns from within the party&#x27;s headquarters and constituency associations. David Orchard was seen by many within the party as an &quot;outsider&quot; who was attempting to turn the Progressive Conservative Party into the &quot;Prairie Co-operative Party&quot;. Some felt that MacKay&#x27;s credibility and leadership were undermined by the deal and that electoral expectations were low for the upcoming election that was expected to occur in less than a year&#x27;s time. Rex Murphy noted in a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; column that MacKay&#x27;s leadership arrived &quot;stillborn&quot; and that, perhaps for the first time in recent memory, a party immediately emerged from a leadership convention grievously weakened and even less united than when it entered the convention.

===Conservative party merger===
Public musings that the divided PCs would be marginalized in a future election between a relatively stable western-based CA under Stephen Harper and the massively popular Paul Martin Liberals (although Jean Chrétien remained the Liberal leader until November 2003, he had announced he would not run again), MacKay encouraged talks between high-profile members of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives.

On October 15, 2003, the merger talks culminated in MacKay and Alliance leader Stephen Harper signing an Agreement in Principle on the establishment of the Conservative Party of Canada, whereby the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance would merge to form a new Conservative Party of Canada. While MacKay was roundly criticized in some Red Tory circles for permitting a union under his watch, MacKay&#x27;s efforts to sell the merger to the PC membership were successful: 90.4% of the party&#x27;s elected delegates supported the deal in a vote on December 6, 2003. 

Some PC caucus members refused to accept the merger: long-time MP and former Prime Minister Joe Clark continued to sit as a &quot;Progressive Conservative&quot; for the remainder of the Parliament, as did MPs John Herron and André Bachand, while Scott Brison left the new party to join the Liberal Party in December 2003. In January 2004, several Senators left the party to sit as independents or &quot;Progressive Conservatives&quot;. MacKay announced on January 13, 2004, that he would not run for the leadership of the new Conservative Party. On March 22, he was named deputy leader of the new party by newly elected leader Stephen Harper. He was easily re-elected in the June 28, 2004 federal election in the newly redistributed riding of Central Nova.

On September 29, 2005, the Premier of Nova Scotia, John Hamm, announced his intention to resign. There was speculation that MacKay would return to the province to pursue provincial politics and enter the Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia leadership race to become the Premier. MacKay would have been considered a front-runner in the race; however, he decided to remain with the Federal Conservatives.
The Liberal government lost a motion of non-confidence on November 28, 2005. In the resulting January 2006 election, the Conservative Party was elected with a minority government. He did retain his seat by a comfortable margin.

==Government==
===Minister of Foreign Affairs===

Following the Conservative victory in the 2006 election, Prime Minister Stephen Harper named MacKay as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; he was also tasked to be the political minister for both his home province, and for neighbouring Prince Edward Island, just as his father Elmer had done between 1988 and 1993. 

During the first mandate, his biggest issue was the Lebanon–Israel–Hezbollah crisis that occurred in July 2006. The government decided to evacuate thousands of Canadians from Lebanon to safer locations and many back to Canada. MacKay responded to critics saying that the process was slow, that the boats (those which were used to evacuate) had limited capacity. MacKay&#x27;s statements in support of the Israelis during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict created a national debate in Canada, especially among Arabs and Muslim Canadians who opposed MacKay&#x27;s position. During this period MacKay and the Conservative Party of Canada joined the Bush Administration in opposing the United Nations&#x27; call for a ceasefire. It was also during this period that MacKay made a controversial statement in which he referred to Hezbollah as a &quot;cancer&quot; in Lebanon. Hezbollah is formally recognized by the government of Canada as a terrorist organization.

On October 19, 2006, during a debate on the Conservative Party&#x27;s clean air plan, MP Mark Holland said that a Liberal colleague, David McGuinty asked MacKay about the impact of pollution on humans and animals by asking, &quot;What about your dog?&quot;. This referred to MacKay posing for photographs on a farm with his neighbour&#x27;s dog following his break-up with Belinda Stronach. MacKay then allegedly pointed to Stronach&#x27;s vacant chair and replied &quot;You already have her.&quot; Holland lodged a complaint with the Commons Speaker and demanded an apology from MacKay. Stronach has said that the comment was disrespectful to both herself and Canadian women, and has herself asked for an apology. MacKay has denied referring to Stronach as a &quot;dog&quot;. The alleged comment was not heard by Speaker of the House Peter Milliken and it was not recorded in the official Hansard. Afterwards, Milliken and his staff said that they could not hear the remarks on the tape recording.

===Minister of National Defence===

On August 14, 2007, Stephen Harper shuffled MacKay from Foreign Affairs to Defence, replacing Gordon O&#x27;Connor. On November 6, 2007, while attending a meeting at Forward Operating Base Wilson, 20 kilometres west of Kandahar City, Mackay was unharmed as two rockets struck the base at about 11 a.m. local time. Mackay described the incident: &quot;There was an explosion. It was a loud bang&quot;, said MacKay. &quot;When it happened, we heard the explosion, we heard the whistle overhead, we were told to get down and we did.&quot; The incident happened on the same day that a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 75 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.

In 2008, MacKay announced a broad exhaustive and very expensive program to upgrade the Canadian military&#x27;s equipment, spending over $400 billion over 25 years. Unlike every previous spending announcement of its kind, no &quot;white paper&quot; or detailed breakdown of this number was available nor was any claimed to exist. This led to widespread speculation that an election was coming. Stephen Harper did in fact declare Parliament &quot;dysfunctional&quot; in August 2008 and called on Governor General of Canada Michaëlle Jean to dissolve parliament for the 2008 federal election.

In July 2010, MacKay was accused of inappropriately using public funds when he combined the use of a Canadian Cormorant military helicopter for both a search and rescue demonstration, and to transport the minister from a private fishing camp in Newfoundland to Gander Airport. The cost of this to taxpayers was approximately $16,000. MacKay, then the Minister of National Defence, defended his use of the military helicopter stating, &quot;Three days into the visit I participated in a search and rescue demonstration with 103 squadron 9 Wing Gander. I shortened my stay by a day to take part in that demonstration&quot;.

In 2009, he undertook two days of basic military training as part of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Make the Politician Work&quot;.

On June 5, 2012, it was revealed that a widely publicized 2010 news conference announcing Conservative plans to buy 65 F-35 Stealth Fighters had cost $47,000. Documents provided to parliament by Peter Mackay indicated that Lockheed Martin had delivered the F-35 mockup used in the photo-op for free, and that the cost was primarily for services to support the news conference and one hundred invited guests.

===Minister of Justice and Attorney General===
On July 15, 2013, the cabinet was shuffled, and Mackay became the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, replacing Rob Nicholson, who took over the defence portfolio.

On March 5, 2014, MacKay generated controversy when, in response to opposition Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux, he tossed documents purporting to concern the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women onto the floor of the House of Commons. The following week, he apologized to the Commons for his outburst.

==Out of Parliament==

===2015–present===
On May 29, 2015, MacKay announced that he would not be a candidate in the 2015 federal election.

In February 2016, MacKay joined law firm Baker McKenzie as a partner. MacKay&#x27;s family now resides in The Beaches area of Toronto.

On November 17, 2017, MacKay said he had not ruled out the possibility of running for the leadership of the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party.

After the Conservative defeat in the 2015 election, MacKay was considered a potential candidate to succeed former Prime Minister Stephen Harper as permanent leader of the Conservative Party. On September 12, 2016, MacKay announced he would not seek the Conservative party leadership.

On January 15, 2020, MacKay announced his intention to run for the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership race.

He was appointed to the board of Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. on April 8, 2021.

====2020 Conservative leadership race====
On October 10, 2019, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that MacKay supporters were preparing to launch a leadership bid should Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer fail to secure a government in the 2019 federal election. MacKay responded to questions by saying that he was &quot;not [aware]&quot; of Conservatives backers organizing a campaign, and that he was &quot;doing everything I can to help Andrew and support him and his team. I’m not entertaining that at all.”

On December 12, 2019, Scheer announced he was resigning as Conservative party leader, but would stay on until a new leader was chosen.

On January 15, 2020, MacKay announced his intention to run for the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership race. After weeks of speculation, MacKay tweeted from his Twitter account: &quot;I&#x27;m in. Stay tuned.&quot; He officially launched his campaign on January 25, 2020 at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. On January 26, 2020, a Washington Post columnist posted a comparison of Peter MacKay&#x27;s campaign logo and that of personal finance blog Maple Money, which started comparisons to the previous Canadian Energy Centre trademark issues.

MacKay was defeated by Erin O’Toole on the third ballot of the leadership vote.

After the vote, it was revealed that MacKay spent $124,000 on security during the campaign in response to numerous death threats that were lodged against him and his family.

==Personal life==
MacKay was chosen as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Sexiest Male MP&quot; by &quot;The Hill Times&quot; from 1999–2007 and 2009, coming in second in 2008 to Maxime Bernier. His former longtime girlfriend was Lisa Michelle Merrithew, daughter of former Mulroney cabinet minister Gerald Merrithew. They reportedly ended their relationship in 2004. He then was romantically linked to fellow MP Belinda Stronach in published reports. In an interview in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; on January 8, 2005, Stronach confirmed that she and MacKay were dating. Stronach, elected as a Conservative in the 2004 election, crossed the floor to the Liberal Party on May 17, 2005. On May 18, 2005, MacKay told the CBC that his relationship with Stronach was indeed over, and that it had come as a surprise to him that she had crossed the floor. According to Don Martin, a &quot;National Post&quot; columnist who wrote a biography, &quot;Belinda: the Political and Private Life of Belinda Stronach&quot; in September 2006, MacKay reacted &quot;with volcanic fury&quot; when he learned about her defection.

On November 26, 2005, the &quot;National Post&quot; revealed that Mackay and Sophie Desmarais of the billionaire Power Corporation family were dating.

By September 2006, MacKay&#x27;s romantic life was again in the papers, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting on gossip about his alleged involvement with United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;Tall, athletic, young, blond&quot;, and having &quot;a tan and the build of someone who spends his time on the rugby field, not holed up reading G-8 communiqués.&quot;

MacKay had been seen in public dating Jana Juginovic, director of programming at CTV News Channel, after having kept their relationship private for many months. They attended the annual Black &amp; White Opera Soirée together at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa on February 21, 2009. MacKay&#x27;s engagement to Juginovic was announced on November 1, 2009. MacKay and Juginovic later called off the engagement in June 2010.

On January 4, 2012, MacKay married Nazanin Afshin-Jam, an Iranian-born former beauty queen, in a ceremony in Mexico. Afshin-Jam holds degrees in international relations and political science.

<text>Volcanology (also spelled vulcanology) is the study of volcanoes, lava, magma and related geological, geophysical and geochemical phenomena (volcanism). The term &quot;volcanology&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;vulcan&quot;. Vulcan was the ancient Roman god of fire.

A volcanologist is a geologist who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes and their current and historic eruptions. Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, especially active ones, to observe volcanic eruptions, collect eruptive products including tephra (such as ash or pumice), rock and lava samples. One major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions; there is currently no accurate way to do this, but predicting or forecasting eruptions, like predicting earthquakes, could save many lives.

== Modern volcanology ==
In 1841, the first volcanological observatory, the Vesuvius Observatory, was founded in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Volcanology advances have required more than just structured observation, and the science relies upon the understanding and integration of knowledge in many fields including geology, tectonics, physics, chemistry and mathematics, with many advances only being able to occur after the advance had occurred in another field of science. For example, the study of radioactivity only commenced in 1896, and its application to the theory of plate tectonics and radiometric dating took about 50 years after this. Many other developments in fluid dynamics, experimental physics and chemistry, techniques of mathematical modelling, instrumentation and in other sciences have been applied to volcanology since 1841. 
=== Techniques ===
Seismic observations are made using seismographs deployed near volcanic areas, watching out for increased seismicity during volcanic events, in particular looking for long period harmonic tremors, which signal magma movement through volcanic conduits.

Surface deformation monitoring includes the use of geodetic techniques such as leveling, tilt, strain, angle and distance measurements through tiltmeters, total stations and EDMs. This also includes GNSS observations and InSAR. Surface deformation indicates magma upwelling: increased magma supply produces bulges in the volcanic center&#x27;s surface.

Gas emissions may be monitored with equipment including portable ultra-violet spectrometers (COSPEC, now superseded by the miniDOAS), which analyzes the presence of volcanic gases such as sulfur dioxide; or by infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). Increased gas emissions, and more particularly changes in gas compositions, may signal an impending volcanic eruption.

Temperature changes are monitored using thermometers and observing changes in thermal properties of volcanic lakes and vents, which may indicate upcoming activity.

Satellites are widely used to monitor volcanoes, as they allow a large area to be monitored easily. They can measure the spread of an ash plume, such as the one from Eyjafjallajökull&#x27;s 2010 eruption, as well as SO2 emissions. InSAR and thermal imaging can monitor large, scarcely populated areas where it would be too expensive to maintain instruments on the ground.

Other geophysical techniques (electrical, gravity and magnetic observations) include monitoring fluctuations and sudden change in resistivity, gravity anomalies or magnetic anomaly patterns that may indicate volcano-induced faulting and magma upwelling.

Stratigraphic analyses includes analyzing tephra and lava deposits and dating these to give volcano eruption patterns, with estimated cycles of intense activity and size of eruptions.

Compositional analysis has been very successful in the grouping of volcanoes by type, origin of magma, including matching of volcanoes to a mantle plume of a particular hotspot, mantle plume melting depths, the history of recycled subducted crust, matching of tephra deposits to each other and to volcanoes of origin, and the understanding the formation and evolution of magma reservoirs, an approach which has now been validated by real time sampling.

=== Forecasting ===

Some of the techniques mentioned above, combined with modelling, have proved useful and successful in the forecasting of some eruptions, such as the evacuation of the locality around Mount Pinatubo in 1991 that may have saved 20,000 lives. Short-term forecasts tend to use seismic or multiple monitoring data with long term forecasting involving the study of the previous history of local volcanism. However, volcanology forecasting does not just involve predicting the next initial onset time of an eruption, as it might also address the size of a future eruption, and evolution of an eruption once it has begun.

== History ==
Volcanology has an extensive history. The earliest known recording of a volcanic eruption may be on a wall painting dated to about 7,000 BCE found at the Neolithic site at Çatal Höyük in Anatolia, Turkey. This painting has been interpreted as a depiction of an erupting volcano, with a cluster of houses below shows a twin peaked volcano in eruption, with a town at its base (though archaeologists now question this interpretation). The volcano may be either Hasan Dağ, or its smaller neighbour, Melendiz Dağ.

=== Greco-Roman philosophy ===
The classical world of Greece and the early Roman Empire explained volcanoes as sites of various gods. Greeks considered that Hephaestus, the god of fire, sat below the volcano Etna, forging the weapons of Zeus. The Greek word used to describe volcanoes was &quot;etna&quot;, or &quot;hiera&quot;, after Heracles, the son of Zeus. The Roman poet Virgil, in interpreting the Greek mythos, held that the giant Enceladus was buried beneath Etna by the goddess Athena as punishment for rebellion against the gods; the mountain&#x27;s rumblings were his tormented cries, the flames his breath and the tremors his railing against the bars of his prison. Enceladus&#x27; brother Mimas was buried beneath Vesuvius by Hephaestus, and the blood of other defeated giants welled up in the Phlegrean Fields surrounding Vesuvius.

The Greek philosopher Empedocles (c. 490-430 BCE) saw the world divided into four elemental forces, of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Volcanoes, Empedocles maintained, were the manifestation of Elemental Fire. Plato contended that channels of hot and cold waters flow in inexhaustible quantities through subterranean rivers. In the depths of the earth snakes a vast river of fire, the &quot;Pyriphlegethon&quot;, which feeds all the world&#x27;s volcanoes. Aristotle considered underground fire as the result of &quot;the...friction of the wind when it plunges into narrow passages.&quot;

Wind played a key role in volcano explanations until the 16th century after Anaxagoras, in the fifth century BC, had proposed eruptions were caused by a great wind. Lucretius, a Roman philosopher, claimed Etna was completely hollow and the fires of the underground driven by a fierce wind circulating near sea level. Ovid believed that the flame was fed from &quot;fatty foods&quot; and eruptions stopped when the food ran out. Vitruvius contended that sulfur, alum and bitumen fed the deep fires. Observations by Pliny the Elder noted the presence of earthquakes preceded an eruption; he died in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE while investigating it at Stabiae. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, gave detailed descriptions of the eruption in which his uncle died, attributing his death to the effects of toxic gases. Such eruptions have been named Plinian in honour of the two authors.

=== Middle Ages ===
Thirteenth century Dominican scholar Restoro d&#x27;Arezzo devoted two entire chapters (11.6.4.6 and 11.6.4.7) of his seminal treatise &quot;La composizione del mondo colle sue cascioni&quot; to the origin of the endogenous energy of the Earth. Restoro maintained that the interior of the Earth was very hot and insisted, following Empedocles, that the Earth had a molten center and that volcanoes erupted through the rise of molten rock to the surface.

=== Renaissance observations ===
During the Renaissance, observers as Bernard Palissy, Conrad Gessner, and Johannes Kentmann (1518–1568) showed a deep intense interest in the nature, behavior, origin and history of the terrestrial globe. Many theories of volcanic action were framed during the late sixteenth mid-seventeenth centuries. Georgius Agricola argued the rays of the sun, as later proposed by Descartes had nothing to do with volcanoes. Agricola believed vapor under pressure caused eruptions of &#x27;mointain oil&#x27; and basalt. Johannes Kepler considered volcanoes as conduits for the tears and excrement of the Earth, voiding bitumen, tar and sulfur. Descartes, pronouncing that God had created the Earth in an instant, declared he had done so in three layers; the fiery depths, a layer of water, and the air. Volcanoes, he said, were formed where the rays of the sun pierced the earth.

The volcanoes of southern Italy attracted naturalists ever since the Renaissance led to the rediscovery of Classical descriptions of them by wtiters like Lucretius and Strabo. Vesuvius, Stromboli and Vulcano provided an opportunity to study the nature of volcanic phenomena. Italian natural philosophers living within reach of these volcanoes wrote long and learned books on the subject: Giovanni Alfonso Borelli&#x27;s account of the eruption of Mount Etna in 1669 became a standard source of information, as did Giulio Cesare Recupito&#x27;s account of the 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius (1632 and later editions) and Francesco Serao&#x27;s account of the eruption of Vesuvius in 1737 (1737, with editions in French and English).

The Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) witnessed eruptions of Mount Etna and Stromboli, then visited the crater of Vesuvius and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur, bitumen and coal. He published his view of this in &quot;Mundus Subterraneus&quot; with volcanoes acting as a type of safety valve.

The causes of these phenomena were discussed in the large number of theories of the Earth that were published in the hundred years after 1650. The authors of these theories were not themselves observers, but combined the observations of others with Newtonian, Cartesian, Biblical or animistic science to produce a variety of all-embracing systems. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes were generally linked in these systems to the existence of great open caverns under the Earth where inflammable vapours could accumulate until they were ignited. According to Thomas Burnet, much of the Earth itself was inflammable, with pitch, coal and brimstone all ready to burn. In William Whiston&#x27;s theory the presence of underground air was necessary if ignition were to take place, while John Woodward stressed that water was essential. Athanasius Kircher maintained that the caverns and sources of the heat were deep, and reached down towards the centre of the Earth, while other writers, notably Georges Buffon, believed they were relatively superficial, and that volcanic fires were seated well up within the volcanic cone itself. A number of writers, most notably Thomas Robinson, believed that the Earth was an animal, and that its internal heat, earthquakes and eruptions were all signs of life. This animistic philosophy was waning by the end of the seventeenth century, but traces continued well into the eighteenth.
Science wrestled with the ideas of the combustion of pyrite with water, that rock was solidified bitumen, and with notions of rock being formed from water (Neptunism). Of the volcanoes then known, all were near the water, hence the action of the sea upon the land was used to explain volcanism.

=== Interaction with religion and mythology ===
Tribal legends of volcanoes abound from the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Americas, usually invoking the forces of the supernatural or the divine to explain the violent outbursts of volcanoes. Taranaki and Tongariro, according to Māori mythology, were lovers who fell in love with Pihanga, and a spiteful jealous fight ensued. Some Māori will not to this day live on the direct line between Tongariro and Taranaki for fear of the dispute flaring up again.
In the Hawaiian religion, Pele ( Pel-a; ) is the goddess of volcanoes and a popular figure in Hawaiian mythology. Pele was used for various scientific terms as for Pele&#x27;s hair, Pele&#x27;s tears, and Limu o Pele (Pele&#x27;s seaweed). A volcano on the Jovian moon Io is also named Pele.

Saint Agatha is patron saint of Catania, close to mount Etna, and an important highly venerated (till today) example of virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity. In 253 CE, one year after her violent death, the stilling of an eruption of Mt. Etna was attributed to her intercession. Catania was however nearly completely destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Etna in 1169, and over 15,000 of its inhabitants died. Nevertheless, the saint was invoked again for the 1669 Etna eruption and, for an outbreak that was endangering the town of Nicolosi in 1886. The way the saint is invoked and dealt with in Italian folk religion, in a quid pro quo manner, or bargaining approach which is sometimes used in prayerful interactions with saints, has been related (in the tradition of James Frazer) to earlier pagan beliefs and practices.

In 1660 the eruption of Vesuvius rained twinned pyroxene crystals and ash upon the nearby villages. The crystals resembled the crucifix and this was interpreted as the work of Saint Januarius. In Naples, the relics of St Januarius are paraded through town at every major eruption of Vesuvius. The register of these processions and the 1779 and 1794 diary of Father Antonio Piaggio allowed British diplomat and amateur naturalist Sir William Hamilton to provide a detailed chronology and description of Vesuvius&#x27; eruptions.

<doc id="238114" wikidata="Q1058876" url="?curid=238114" title="Real life">
<text>Real life is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the real world and fictional, virtual or idealized worlds, and in acting to distinguish between actors and the characters they portray. It has become a popular term on the Internet to describe events, people, activities, and interactions occurring offline; or otherwise not primarily through the medium of the Internet. It is also used as a metaphor to distinguish life in a vocational setting as opposed to an academic one, or adulthood and the adult world as opposed to childhood or adolescence.

==As distinct from fiction==
When used to distinguish from fictional worlds or universes against the consensus reality of the reader, the term has a long history:
In her 1788 work, &quot;Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness&quot;, author Mary Wollstonecraft employs the term in her title, representing the work&#x27;s focus on a middle-class ethos which she viewed as superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. As phrased by Gary Kelly, writing about the work, &quot;The phrase &#x27;real life&#x27; strengthens &#x27;original&#x27;, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary.&quot;

== As distinct from the Internet ==
On the Internet, &quot;real life&quot; refers to life offline. Online, the acronym &quot;IRL&quot; stands for &quot;in real life&quot;, with the meaning &quot;not on the Internet&quot;. For example, while Internet users may speak of having &quot;met&quot; someone that they have contacted via online chat or in an online gaming context, to say that they met someone &quot;in real life&quot; is to say that they encountered them at a physical location. Some, arguing that the Internet is part of real life, prefer to use &quot;away from the keyboard&quot; ().

Some sociologists engaged in the study of the Internet have predicted that someday, a distinction between online and offline worlds may seem &quot;quaint&quot;, noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and &quot;reality&quot;.

===Related terminology===

The initialism &quot;RL&quot; stands for &quot;real life&quot; and &quot;IRL&quot; for &quot;in real life.&quot; For example, one can speak of &quot;meeting IRL&quot; an online acquaintance. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to &quot;RL problems&quot;. Some internet users use the idioms &quot;face time&quot; and &quot;meatspace&quot; in contrast with the term &quot;cyberspace&quot;. &quot;Meatspace&quot; has appeared in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and in science fiction literature. Some early uses of the term include a post to the Usenet newsgroup austin.public-net in 1993 and an article in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; about John Perry Barlow in 1995. The term entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="238115" wikidata="Q190016" url="?curid=238115" title="Heparin">
<text>Heparin, also known as unfractionated heparin (UFH), is a medication and naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan. Heparin is a blood anticoagulant that increases the activity of antithrombin. It is used in the treatment of heart attacks and unstable angina. It can be given intravenously or by injection under the skin. Its anticoagulant properties make it useful to prevent blood clotting in blood specimen test tubes and kidney dialysis machines.
Common side effects include bleeding, pain at the injection site, and low blood platelets. Serious side effects include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Greater care is needed in those with poor kidney function.

Heparin is contraindicated for suspected cases of vaccine-induced pro-thrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as heparin may further increase the risk of bleeding in an anti-PF4/heparin complex autoimmune manner, in favor of alternative anticoagulant medications (such as argatroban or danaparoid).

Heparin appears to be relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Heparin is produced by basophils and mast cells in all mammals.
The discovery of heparin was announced in 1916. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. A fractionated version of heparin, known as low molecular weight heparin, is also available.
==History==
Heparin was discovered by Jay McLean and William Henry Howell in 1916, although it did not enter clinical trials until 1935. It was originally isolated from dog liver cells, hence its name (ἧπαρ &quot;hēpar&quot; is Greek for &#x27;liver&#x27;; &quot;hepar&quot; + &quot;&quot;).

McLean was a second-year medical student at Johns Hopkins University, and was working under the guidance of Howell investigating pro-coagulant preparations when he isolated a fat-soluble phosphatide anticoagulant in canine liver tissue. In 1918, Howell coined the term &#x27;heparin&#x27; for this type of fat-soluble anticoagulant. In the early 1920s, Howell isolated a water-soluble polysaccharide anticoagulant, which he also termed &#x27;heparin&#x27;, although it was different from the previously discovered phosphatide preparations. McLean&#x27;s work as a surgeon probably changed the focus of the Howell group to look for anticoagulants, which eventually led to the polysaccharide discovery.

It had at first been accepted that it was Howell who discovered heparin. However, in the 1940s, Jay McLean became unhappy that he had not received appropriate recognition for what he saw as his discovery. Though relatively discreet about his claim and not wanting to upset his former chief, he gave lectures and wrote letters claiming that the discovery was his. This gradually became accepted as fact, and indeed after he died in 1959, his obituary credited him as being the true discoverer of heparin. This was elegantly restated in 1963 in a plaque unveiled at Johns Hopkins to commemorate the major contribution (of McLean) to the discovery of heparin in 1916 in collaboration with Professor William Henry Howell.

In the 1930s, several researchers were investigating heparin. Erik Jorpes at Karolinska Institutet published his research on the structure of heparin in 1935, which made it possible for the Swedish company Vitrum AB to launch the first heparin product for intravenous use in 1936. Between 1933 and 1936, Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, then a part of the University of Toronto, perfected a technique for producing safe, nontoxic heparin that could be administered to patients, in a saline solution. The first human trials of heparin began in May 1935, and, by 1937, it was clear that Connaught&#x27;s heparin was safe, easily available, and effective as a blood anticoagulant. Before 1933, heparin was available in small amounts, was extremely expensive and toxic, and, as a consequence, of no medical value.

Heparin production experienced a break in the 1990s. Until then, heparin was mainly obtained from cattle tissue, which was a by-product of the meat industry, especially in North America. With the rapid spread of BSE, more and more manufacturers abandoned this source of supply. As a result, global heparin production became increasingly concentrated in China, where the substance was now procured from the expanding industry of breeding and slaughtering hogs. The dependence of medical care on the meat industry assumed threatening proportions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, several studies demonstrated the efficacy of heparin in mitigating severe disease progression, as its anticoagulant effect counteracted the formation of immunothrombosis. However, the availability of heparin on the world market was decreased, because concurrently a renewed swine flu epidemic had reduced significant portions of the Chinese hog population. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that mass slaughterhouses around the world became coronavirus hotspots themselves and were forced to close temporarily. In less affluent countries, the resulting heparin shortage also led to worsened health care beyond the treatment of COVID-19, for example through the cancellation of cardiac surgeries.

==Medical use==

Heparin acts as an anticoagulant, preventing the formation of clots and extension of existing clots within the blood. Heparin itself does not break down clots that have already formed, instead, it prevents clot formation by inhibiting thrombin and other procoagulant serine proteases. Heparin is generally used for anticoagulation for the following conditions:
* Acute coronary syndrome, e.g., NSTEMI
* Atrial fibrillation
* Deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (both prevention and treatment)
* Other thrombotic states and conditions
* Cardiopulmonary bypass for heart surgery
* ECMO circuit for extracorporeal life support
* Hemofiltration
* Indwelling central or peripheral venous catheters
Heparin and its low-molecular-weight derivatives (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin) are effective in preventing deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli in people at risk, but no evidence indicates any one is more effective than the other in preventing mortality.

In angiography, 2 to 5 units/mL of unfractionated heparin saline flush is used as a locking solution to prevent the clotting of blood in guidewires, sheaths, and catheters, thus preventing thrombus from dislodging from these devices into the circulatory system .

Unfractionated heparin is used in hemodialysis. Compared to low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin does not have prolonged anticoagulation action after dialysis and is low cost. However, the short duration of action for heparin would require it to maintain continuous infusion to maintain its action. Meanwhile, unfractionated heparin has higher risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

==Adverse effects==
A serious side-effect of heparin is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), caused by an immunological reaction that makes platelets a target of immunological response, resulting in the degradation of platelets, which causes thrombocytopenia. This condition is usually reversed on discontinuation, and in general can be avoided with the use of synthetic heparins. Not all patients with heparin antibodies will develop thrombocytopenia. Also, a benign form of thrombocytopenia is associated with early heparin use, which resolves without stopping heparin. Approximately one-third of patients with diagnosed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia will ultimately develop thrombotic complications.

Two non-hemorrhagic side effects of heparin treatment are known. The first is an elevation of serum aminotransferase levels, which has been reported in as many as 80% of patients receiving heparin. This abnormality is not associated with liver dysfunction, and it disappears after the drug is discontinued. The other complication is hyperkalemia, which occurs in 5 to 10% of patients receiving heparin, and is the result of heparin-induced aldosterone suppression. The hyperkalemia can appear within a few days after the onset of heparin therapy. More rarely, the side-effects alopecia and osteoporosis can occur with chronic use.

As with many drugs, overdoses of heparin can be fatal. In September 2006, heparin received worldwide publicity when three prematurely born infants died after they were mistakenly given overdoses of heparin at an Indianapolis hospital.

===Contraindications===
Heparin is contraindicated in those with risk of bleeding (especially in people with uncontrolled blood pressure, liver disease, and stroke), severe liver disease, or severe hypertension.

===Antidote to heparin===
Protamine sulfate has been given to counteract the anticoagulant effect of heparin (1 mg per 100 units of heparin that had been given over the past 6 hours). It may be used in those who overdose on heparin or to reverse heparin&#x27;s effect when it is no longer needed.

==Physiological function==
Heparin&#x27;s normal role in the body is unclear. Heparin is usually stored within the secretory granules of mast cells and released only into the vasculature at sites of tissue injury. It has been proposed that rather than anticoagulation, the main purpose of heparin is defense at such sites against invading bacteria and other foreign materials. In addition, it is observed across many widely different species, including some invertebrates that do not have a similar blood coagulation system. It is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and has the highest negative charge density of any known biological molecule.

===Evolutionary conservation===
In addition to the bovine and porcine tissue from which pharmaceutical-grade heparin is commonly extracted, it has also been extracted and characterized from:

# Turkey
# Whale
# Dromedary camel
# Mouse
# Humans
# Lobster
# Fresh water mussel
# Clam
# Shrimp
# Mangrove crab
# Sand dollar
# Atlantic salmon
# Zebra fish

The biological activity of heparin within species 6–11 is unclear and further supports the idea that the main physiological role of heparin is not anticoagulation. These species do not possess any blood coagulation system similar to that present within the species listed 1–5. The above list also demonstrates how heparin has been highly evolutionarily conserved, with molecules of a similar structure being produced by a broad range of organisms belonging to many different phyla.

== Pharmacology ==
In nature, heparin is a polymer of varying chain size. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) as a pharmaceutical is heparin that has not been fractionated to sequester the fraction of molecules with low molecular weight. In contrast, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has undergone fractionation to make its pharmacodynamics more predictable. Often either UFH or LMWH can be used; in some situations one or the other is preferable.

===Mechanism of action===
Heparin binds to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III (AT), causing a conformational change that results in its activation through an increase in the flexibility of its reactive site loop. The activated AT then inactivates thrombin, factor Xa and other proteases. The rate of inactivation of these proteases by AT can increase by up to 1000-fold due to the binding of heparin. Heparin binds to AT via a specific pentasaccharide sulfation sequence contained within the heparin polymer:

: GlcNAc/NS(6S)-GlcA-GlcNS(3S,6S)-IdoA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)

The conformational change in AT on heparin-binding mediates its inhibition of factor Xa. For thrombin inhibition, however, thrombin must also bind to the heparin polymer at a site proximal to the pentasaccharide. The highly negative charge density of heparin contributes to its very strong electrostatic interaction with thrombin. The formation of a ternary complex between AT, thrombin, and heparin results in the inactivation of thrombin. For this reason, heparin&#x27;s activity against thrombin is size-dependent, with the ternary complex requiring at least 18 saccharide units for efficient formation. In contrast, antifactor Xa activity via AT requires only the pentasaccharide-binding site.

This size difference has led to the development of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and fondaparinux as anticoagulants. Fondaparinux targets anti-factor Xa activity rather than inhibiting thrombin activity, to facilitate a more subtle regulation of coagulation and an improved therapeutic index. It is a synthetic pentasaccharide, whose chemical structure is almost identical to the AT binding pentasaccharide sequence that can be found within polymeric heparin and heparan sulfate.

With LMWH and fondaparinux, the risk of osteoporosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is reduced. Monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time is also not required and does not reflect the anticoagulant effect, as APTT is insensitive to alterations in factor Xa.

Danaparoid, a mixture of heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate can be used as an anticoagulant in patients having developed HIT. Because danaparoid does not contain heparin or heparin fragments, cross-reactivity of danaparoid with heparin-induced antibodies is reported as less than 10%.

The effects of heparin are measured in the lab by the partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), one of the measures of the time it takes the blood plasma to clot. Partial thromboplastin time should not be confused with prothrombin time, or PT, which measures blood clotting time through a different pathway of the coagulation cascade.

===Administration===

Heparin is given parenterally because it is not absorbed from the gut, due to its high negative charge and large size. It can be injected intravenously or subcutaneously (under the skin); intramuscular injections (into muscle) are avoided because of the potential for forming hematomas. Because of its short biologic half-life of about one hour, heparin must be given frequently or as a continuous infusion. Unfractionated heparin has a half-life of about one to two hours after infusion, whereas LMWH has a half-life of four to five hours. The use of LMWH has allowed once-daily dosing, thus not requiring a continuous infusion of the drug. If long-term anticoagulation is required, heparin is often used only to commence anticoagulation therapy until an oral anticoagulant e.g. warfarin takes effect.

The American College of Chest Physicians publishes clinical guidelines on heparin dosing.

===Natural degradation or clearance===
Unfractionated heparin has a half-life of about one to two hours after infusion, whereas low-molecular-weight heparin&#x27;s half-life is about four times longer. Lower doses of heparin have a much shorter half-life than larger ones. Heparin binding to macrophage cells is internalized and depolymerized by the macrophages. It also rapidly binds to endothelial cells, which precludes the binding to antithrombin that results in anticoagulant action. For higher doses of heparin, endothelial cell binding will be saturated, such that clearance of heparin from the bloodstream by the kidneys will be a slower process.

== Chemistry ==
=== Heparin structure ===

Native heparin is a polymer with a molecular weight ranging from 3 to 30 kDa, although the average molecular weight of most commercial heparin preparations is in the range of 12 to 15 kDa. Heparin is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family of carbohydrates (which includes the closely related molecule heparan sulfate) and consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit.
The main disaccharide units that occur in heparin are shown below. The most common disaccharide unit* (see below) is composed of a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid and 6-O-sulfated, N-sulfated glucosamine, IdoA(2S)-GlcNS(6S). For example, this makes up 85% of heparins from beef lung and about 75% of those from porcine intestinal mucosa.

Not shown below are the rare disaccharides containing a 3-O-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS(3S,6S)) or a free amine group (GlcNH3+). Under physiological conditions, the ester and amide sulfate groups are deprotonated and attract positively charged counterions to form a heparin salt. Heparin is usually administered in this form as an anticoagulant.

GlcA = β--glucuronic acid, IdoA = α--iduronic acid, IdoA(2S) = 2-&quot;O&quot;-sulfo-α--iduronic acid, GlcNAc = 2-deoxy-2-acetamido-α--glucopyranosyl, GlcNS = 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-α--glucopyranosyl, GlcNS(6S) = 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-α--glucopyranosyl-6-&quot;O&quot;-sulfate

One unit of heparin (the &quot;Howell unit&quot;) is an amount approximately equivalent to 0.002 mg of pure heparin, which is the quantity required to keep 1 ml of cat&#x27;s blood fluid for 24 hours at 0 °C.

====Three-dimensional structure====

The three-dimensional structure of heparin is complicated because iduronic acid may be present in either of two low-energy conformations when internally positioned within an oligosaccharide. The conformational equilibrium is influenced by the sulfation state of adjacent glucosamine sugars. Nevertheless, the solution structure of a heparin dodecasaccharide composed solely of six GlcNS(6S)-IdoA(2S) repeat units has been determined using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling techniques. Two models were constructed, one in which all IdoA(2S) were in the 2S0 conformation (A and B below), and one in which they are in the 1C4 conformation (C and D below). However, no evidence suggests that changes between these conformations occur in a concerted fashion. These models correspond to the protein data bank code 1HPN.

In the image above:
* A = 1HPN (all IdoA(2S) residues in 2S0 conformation) Jmol viewer
* B = van der Waals radius space-filling model of &quot;A&quot;
* C = 1HPN (all IdoA(2S) residues in 1C4 conformation) Jmol viewer
* D = van der Waals radius space-filling model of &quot;C&quot;

In these models, heparin adopts a helical conformation, the rotation of which places clusters of sulfate groups at regular intervals of about 17 angstroms (1.7 nm) on either side of the helical axis.

===Depolymerization techniques===
Either chemical or enzymatic depolymerization techniques or a combination of the two underlie the vast majority of analyses carried out on the structure and function of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS).

====Enzymatic====
The enzymes traditionally used to digest heparin or HS are naturally produced by the soil bacterium &quot;Pedobacter heparinus&quot; (formerly named &quot;Flavobacterium heparinum&quot;). This bacterium is capable of using either heparin or HS as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. To do so, it produces a range of enzymes such as lyases, glucuronidases, sulfoesterases, and sulfamidases. The lyases have mainly been used in heparin/HS studies. The bacterium produces three lyases, heparinases I (), II (no EC number assigned) and III () and each has distinct substrate specificities as detailed below.

The lyases cleave heparin/HS by a beta elimination mechanism. This action generates an unsaturated double bond between C4 and C5 of the uronate residue. The C4-C5 unsaturated uronate is termed ΔUA or UA. It is a sensitive UV chromophore (max absorption at 232 nm) and allows the rate of an enzyme digest to be followed, as well as providing a convenient method for detecting the fragments produced by enzyme digestion.

====Chemical====
Nitrous acid can be used to chemically depolymerize heparin/HS. Nitrous acid can be used at pH 1.5 or a higher pH of 4. Under both conditions, nitrous acid affects deaminative cleavage of the chain. At both &#x27;high&#x27; (4) and &#x27;low&#x27; (1.5) pH, deaminative cleavage occurs between GlcNS-GlcA and GlcNS-IdoA, albeit at a slower rate at the higher pH. The deamination reaction, and therefore chain cleavage, is regardless of O-sulfation carried by either monosaccharide unit.

At low pH, deaminative cleavage results in the release of inorganic SO4, and the conversion of GlcNS into anhydromannose (aMan). Low-pH nitrous acid treatment is an excellent method to distinguish N-sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin and HS from non N-sulfated polysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate not being susceptible to nitrous acid cleavage.

===Detection in body fluids===
Current clinical laboratory assays for heparin rely on an indirect measurement of the effect of the drug, rather than on a direct measure of its chemical presence. These include activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and antifactor Xa activity. The specimen of choice is usually fresh, nonhemolyzed plasma from blood that has been anticoagulated with citrate, fluoride, or oxalate.

==Other functions==
* Blood specimen test tubes, vacutainers, and capillary tubes that use the lithium salt of heparin (lithium heparin) as an anticoagulant are usually marked with green stickers and green tops. Heparin has the advantage over EDTA of not affecting levels of most ions. However, the concentration of ionized calcium may be decreased if the concentration of heparin in the blood specimen is too high. Heparin can interfere with some immunoassays, however. As lithium heparin is usually used, a person&#x27;s lithium levels cannot be obtained from these tubes; for this purpose, royal-blue-topped (and dark green-topped) vacutainers containing sodium heparin are used.
* Heparin-coated blood oxygenators are available for use in heart-lung machines. Among other things, these specialized oxygenators are thought to improve overall biocompatibility and host homeostasis by providing characteristics similar to those of native endothelium.
* The DNA binding sites on RNA polymerase can be occupied by heparin, preventing the polymerase from binding to promoter DNA. This property is exploited in a range of molecular biological assays.
* Common diagnostic procedures require PCR amplification of a patient&#x27;s DNA, which is easily extracted from white blood cells treated with heparin. This poses a potential problem, since heparin may be extracted along with the DNA, and it has been found to interfere with the PCR reaction at levels as low as 0.002 U in a 50 μL reaction mixture.
* Heparin has been used as a chromatography resin, acting as both an affinity ligand and an ion exchanger. Its polyanionic structure can mimic nucleic acids like DNA and RNA, making it useful for purification of nucleic acid-binding proteins including DNA and RNA polymerases and transcription factors. Heparin&#x27;s specific affinity for VSV-G, a viral envelope glycoprotein often used to pseudotype retroviral and lentiviral vectors for gene therapy, allows it to be used for downstream purification of viral vectors.
* Heparin is being trialed in a nasal spray form as prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, its reported from trials that due to anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and its anti-clotting effects its inhalation could improve at a 70% rate on patients that were actively struck by a COVID-19 infection.

==Society and culture==

===Contamination recalls===
Considering the animal source of pharmaceutical heparin, the number of potential impurities is relatively large compared with a wholly synthetic therapeutic agent. The range of possible biological contaminants includes viruses, bacterial endotoxins, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents, lipids, proteins, and DNA. During the preparation of pharmaceutical-grade heparin from animal tissues, impurities such as solvents, heavy metals, and extraneous cations can be introduced. However, the methods employed to minimize the occurrence and to identify and/or eliminate these contaminants are well established and listed in guidelines and pharmacopeias. The major challenge in the analysis of heparin impurities is the detection and identification of structurally related impurities. The most prevalent impurity in heparin is dermatan sulfate (DS), also known as chondroitin sulfate B. The building block of DS is a disaccharide composed of 1,3-linked N-acetyl galactosamine (GalN) and a uronic acid residue, connected via 1,4 linkages to form the polymer. DS is composed of three possible uronic acids (GlcA, IdoA, or IdoA2S) and four possible hexosamine (GalNAc, Gal- NAc4S, GalNAc6S, or GalNAc4S6S) building blocks. The presence of iduronic acid in DS distinguishes it from chondroitin sulfate A and C and likens it to heparin and HS. DS has a lower negative charge density overall compared to heparin. A common natural contaminant, DS is present at levels of 1–7% in heparin API but has no proven biological activity that influences the anticoagulation effect of heparin.

In December 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled a shipment of heparin because of bacterial growth (&quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;) in several unopened syringes of this product. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; can lead to life-threatening injuries and/or death.

====2008 recall due to adulteration in drug from China====

In March 2008, major recalls of heparin were announced by the FDA due to contamination of the raw heparin stock imported from China. According to the FDA, the adulterated heparin killed nearly 80 people in the United States. The adulterant was identified as an &quot;over-sulphated&quot; derivative of chondroitin sulfate, a popular shellfish-derived supplement often used for arthritis, which was intended to substitute for actual heparin in potency tests.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Problems with heparin reported to the agency include difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and rapidly falling blood pressure that in some cases led to life-threatening shock&quot;.

===Use in homicide===
In 2006, Petr Zelenka, a nurse in the Czech Republic, deliberately administered large doses to patients, killing seven, and attempting to kill ten others.

===Overdose issues===
In 2007, a nurse at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center mistakenly gave the 12-day-old twins of actor Dennis Quaid a dose of heparin that was 1,000 times the recommended dose for infants. The overdose allegedly arose because the labeling and design of the adult and infant versions of the product were similar. The Quaid family subsequently sued the manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare Corp., and settled with the hospital for $750,000. Prior to the Quaid accident, six newborn babies at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, were given an overdose. Three of the babies died after the mistake.

In July 2008, another set of twins born at Christus Spohn Hospital South, in Corpus Christi, Texas, died after an accidentally administered overdose of the drug. The overdose was due to a mixing error at the hospital pharmacy and was unrelated to the product&#x27;s packaging or labeling. , the exact cause of the twins&#x27; death was under investigation.

In March 2010, a two-year-old transplant patient from Texas was given a lethal dose of heparin at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The exact circumstances surrounding her death are still under investigation.

===Production===
Pharmaceutical-grade heparin is derived from mucosal tissues of slaughtered meat animals such as porcine (pig) intestines or bovine (cattle) lungs. Advances to produce heparin synthetically have been made in 2003 and 2008. In 2011, a chemoenzymatic process of synthesizing low molecular weight heparins from simple disaccharides was reported.

===Research===
As detailed in the table below, the potential is great for the development of heparin-like structures as drugs to treat a wide range of diseases, in addition to their current use as anticoagulants.
: – indicates that no information is available

As a result of heparin&#x27;s effect on such a wide variety of disease states, a number of drugs are indeed in development whose molecular structures are identical or similar to those found within parts of the polymeric heparin chain.

<text>Potassium bicarbonate (IUPAC name: potassium hydrogencarbonate, also known as potassium acid carbonate) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula KHCO3. It is a white solid.

==Production and reactivity==
It is manufactured by treating an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide with carbon dioxide:
:K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 KHCO3
Decomposition of the bicarbonate occurs between :
:2 KHCO3 → K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O
This reaction is employed to prepare high purity potassium carbonate.

==Uses==
===Food and drink===
This compound is a source of carbon dioxide for leavening in baking. It can substitute for baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) for those with a low-sodium diet, and it is an ingredient in low-sodium baking powders.

As an inexpensive, nontoxic base, it is widely used in diverse application to regulate pH or as a reagent. Examples include as buffering agent in medications, an additive in winemaking.

Potassium bicarbonate is often added to bottled water to improve taste, and is also used in club soda.

===Medical uses and health===
Higher potassium intake may prevent development of kidney stone disease. Higher potassium intake is associated with a reduced risk of stroke.

===Fire extinguishers===
Potassium bicarbonate is used as a fire suppression agent (&quot;BC dry chemical&quot;) in some dry chemical fire extinguishers, as the principal component of the Purple-K dry chemical, and in some applications of condensed aerosol fire suppression. It is the only dry chemical fire suppression agent recognized by the U.S. National Fire Protection Association for firefighting at airport crash rescue sites. It is about twice as effective in fire suppression as sodium bicarbonate.

===Agriculture===
Potassium bicarbonate has widespread use in crops, especially for neutralizing acidic soil.

Potassium bicarbonate is an effective fungicide against powdery mildew and apple scab, allowed for use in organic farming.

Potassium bicarbonate is a contact killer for Spanish moss when mixed cup per gallon.

==History==
The word &quot;saleratus&quot;, from Latin &quot;sal æratus&quot; meaning &quot;aerated salt&quot;, first used in the nineteenth century, refers to both potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate.
