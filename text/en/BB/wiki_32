<text>Futurism ( ) was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy, and to a lesser extent in other countries, in the early 20th century. It emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures included Italian artists Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. Italian Futurism glorified modernity and, according to its doctrine, &quot;aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&quot; Important Futurist works included Marinetti&#x27;s 1909 &quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot;, Boccioni&#x27;s 1913 sculpture &quot;Unique Forms of Continuity in Space&quot;, Balla&#x27;s 1913–1914 painting &quot;Abstract Speed + Sound&quot;, and Russolo&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; (1913).

Although Futurism was largely an Italian phenomenon, parallel movements emerged in Russia, where some Russian Futurists would later go on to found groups of their own; other countries either had a few Futurists or had movements inspired by Futurism. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and cooking.

To some extent, Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Dada; to a greater degree, Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism. can represent an opposing trend or attitude.

==Italian Futurism==

Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti launched the movement in his &quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot;, which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in &quot;La gazzetta dell&#x27;Emilia&quot;, an article then reproduced in the French daily newspaper on Saturday 20 February 1909. He was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. &quot;We want no part of it, the past,&quot; he wrote, &quot;we the young and strong &quot;Futurists!&quot;&quot; The Futurists admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality &quot;however daring, however violent,&quot; bore proudly &quot;the smear of madness,&quot; dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and glorified science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, music, literature, theatre, cinema, photography, religion, women, fashion, and cuisine. In their manifestos, Futurists described their beliefs and appreciations of various methods. They also detailed their disdain for traditional Italian Renaissance works of art and their subjects. According to the Manifesto of the Futurist Painters (1910) by Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Carlo Carrà: &quot;We want to fight implacably against the mindless, snobbish, and fanatical religion of the past, religion nurtured by the pernicious existence of the museums. We rebel against the spineless admiration for old canvases, old statues, and old objects, and against the enthusiasm for everything worm-eaten, grimy, or corroded by time; and we deem it unjust and criminal that people habitually disdain whatever is young, new, and trembling with life.&quot; The Futurists believed that art should be inspired by the modern marvels of their newly technological world. “Just as our forebears took the subject of art from the religious atmosphere that enveloped them, so we must draw inspiration from the tangible miracles of contemporary life.&quot;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent &quot;Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting&quot; (published in Italian as a leaflet by &quot;Poesia&quot;, Milan, 11 April 1910). This committed them to a &quot;universal dynamism,&quot; which was to be directly represented in painting. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: &quot;The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places. ... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it.&quot;

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911, they used the techniques of Divisionism, breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been adopted from Divisionism by Giovanni Segantini and others. Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism&#x27;s artistic style. Severini was the first to come into contact with Cubism, and following a visit to Paris in 1911, the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists. Cubism offered them a means of analyzing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.
They often painted modern urban scenes. Carrà&#x27;s &quot;Funeral of the Anarchist Galli&quot; (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist himself had been involved with in 1904. The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes. His &quot;Leaving the Theatre&quot; (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni&#x27;s &quot;The City Rises&quot; (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control. His &quot;States of Mind&quot;, in three large panels — &quot;The Farewell&quot;, &quot;Those who Go&quot;, and &quot;Those Who Stay&quot; — &quot;made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in Bergson, Cubism and the individual&#x27;s complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the &#x27;minor masterpieces&#x27; of early twentieth century painting.&quot; The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including &quot;lines of force,&quot; which intend to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space; &quot;simultaneity,&quot; which combines memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events; and &quot;emotional ambience&quot; in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.

Boccioni&#x27;s intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of intuition, which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it. The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted. Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, &quot;Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico&quot; (&quot;Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism&quot;) (1914).
Balla&#x27;s &quot;Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash&quot; (1912) exemplifies the Futurists&#x27; insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement. The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash—and the feet of the woman walking it—have been multiplied to a blur of movement. It illustrates the precepts of the &quot;Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting&quot; that, &quot;on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career. Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular.&quot; His &quot;Rhythm of the Bow&quot; (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist&#x27;s hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism. But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris. As the art critic Robert Hughes observed: &quot;In Futurism, the eye is fixed and the object moves, but it is still the basic vocabulary of Cubism—fragmented and overlapping planes.&quot; Futurist art tended to disdain traditional subjects, specifically those of photographically realistic portraits and landscapes. Futurists thought of &quot;imitation&quot; art that copied from life to be lazy, unimaginative, cowardly, and boring. While there were Futurist portraits — Carrà&#x27;s &quot;Woman with Absinthe&quot; (1911), Severini&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1912), and Boccioni&#x27;s &quot;Matter&quot; (1912) — it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting; Boccioni&#x27;s &quot;The Street Enters the House&quot; (1911), Severini&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin&quot; (1912), and Russolo&#x27;s &quot;Automobile at Speed&quot; (1913) for example.


The Futurists held their first exhibition outside of Italy in 1912 at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery, Paris, which included works by Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo and Giacomo Balla.

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas. In &quot;Unique Forms of Continuity in Space&quot; (1913), he attempted to realize the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of &quot;dynamism&quot;. The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the Tate Modern (it now appears on the national side of Italian 20 eurocent coins). He explored the theme further in &quot;Synthesis of Human Dynamism&quot; (1912), &quot;Speeding Muscles&quot; (1913), and &quot;Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles&quot; (1913); his ideas on sculpture were published in the &quot;Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture.&quot; In 1915, Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract &quot;reconstructions,&quot; which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable, and even made noises. He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that &quot;the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc.&quot;
In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group around Carrà, Ardengo Soffici (1879–1964) and Giovanni Papini (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism. The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish &quot;an immobile church with an infallible creed,&quot; and each group dismissed the other as &quot;passéiste.&quot;

Futurism had, from the outset, admired violence and was intensely patriotic. The &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot; had declared: &quot;We will glorify war—the world&#x27;s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.&quot; Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913. Then, fearing the re-election of Giolitti, Marinetti published a political manifesto. In 1914, the Futurists began to campaign actively against the Austro-Hungarian empire, which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience while Marinetti waved an Italian flag. When Italy entered the First World War in 1915, many Futurists enlisted. The experience of the war marked several Futurists — particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary — actively engaging in propaganda. Italian futurists included &quot;visual poetry in futurist periodicals” to promote their cause or campaign, thus swaying public opinion in their favor after the war; the combat experience also influenced Futurist music.

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914. Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916. Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Armored Train&quot;, and &quot;Red Cross Train&quot;), but in Paris turned towards Cubism; post-war, he was associated with the Return to Order.

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement. This revival was called &quot;il secondo Futurismo&quot; (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s. The art historian Giovanni Lista groups Futurism into three distinct decades according to characteristics of each: &quot;Plastic Dynamism&quot; of the 1910s, &quot;Mechanical Art&quot; of the 1920s, and &quot;Aeroaesthetics&quot; of the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==

Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts, involving various Futurist groups. The Russian Association of Proletarian Writers were associated with Russian Futurists during the 1920s in relation to the Futurists theory &quot;Literature of Fact,&quot; in which Soviet art can be expressed through literacy evolution. The poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement, as were Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksei Kruchyonykh; visual artists such as David Burliuk, Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova, Lyubov Popova, and Kazimir Malevich found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings, and were writers themselves. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera &quot;Victory Over the Sun&quot;, with texts by Kruchenykh, music by Mikhail Matyushin, and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was Cubo-Futurism, extant during the 1910s. Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of Cubism with the Futurist representation of movement; like their Italian contemporaries, the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed, and the restlessness of modern urban life; however, they were the complete opposite of them ideologically, as many embraced the political and social visions of the emerging communist movement in Russia. 

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that Pushkin and Dostoevsky should be &quot;heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity.&quot; They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, as they abhorred his commitment to fascism, and most of them obstructed him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the revolution of 1917. The Futurists either stayed, were persecuted, or left the country. Popova, Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the Soviet establishment and the brief Agitprop movement of the 1920s; Popova died of a fever, Malevich would be briefly imprisoned and forced to paint in the new state-approved style, and Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930. 

==Architecture==

The Futurist architect Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for &quot;La Città Nuova&quot; (The New City) (1912–1914). This project was never built and Sant&#x27;Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists. The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life was projected. The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life. Sant&#x27;Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine. He manipulated light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity. In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy. The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state&#x27;s tendency towards Roman imperial-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts, and post offices. Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are Trento railway station built by Angiolo Mazzoni and the Santa Maria Novella station in Florence. The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the &quot;Gruppo Toscano&quot; (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included Giovanni Michelucci and Italo Gamberini, with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==

Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

Francesco Balilla Pratella joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a &quot;Manifesto of Futurist Musicians&quot; in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the &quot;sublime genius&quot; of Wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers; Richard Strauss, Elgar, Mussorgsky, and Sibelius, for example. By contrast, the Italian symphony was dominated by opera in an &quot;absurd and anti-musical form.&quot; The conservatory was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the &quot;rickety and vulgar&quot; operas of Puccini and Umberto Giordano. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher Pietro Mascagni, because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella&#x27;s tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled &quot;the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice.&quot;

Luigi Russolo (1885–1947) wrote &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; (1913), an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called &quot;intonarumori&quot;, which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with &quot;intonarumori&quot;, in 1914. However, they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art and music that paid homage to, included, or imitated machines. Ferruccio Busoni has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wed to tradition. Russolo&#x27;s &quot;intonarumori&quot; influenced Stravinsky, Arthur Honegger, George Antheil, Edgar Varèse, Stockhausen and John Cage. In &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Steel Step&quot; as well as his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is American artist George Antheil. His fascination with machinery is evident in his &quot;Airplane Sonata&quot;, &quot;Death of the Machines&quot;, and the 30-minute &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot;. The &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by Fernand Léger, but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones, four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two &quot;live pianists,&quot; and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil&#x27;s piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man&#x27;s ultimate fusion with the machine. The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car&#x27;s motor, and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man&#x27;s intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered Futuristic as it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience. The dancer no longer performs a story with clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most notable Futuristic dancers is Italian artist Giannina Censi. She was inspired by the aerial themes in the second wave of Futurism and sought to put this onto the stage. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her &quot;Aerodanze&quot; and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry:&quot;I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled, ... And the face had to express what the pilot felt.&quot;

==Literature==

Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F. T. Marinetti&#x27;s &quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot; (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominant medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem). The Futurists called their style of poetry &quot;parole in libertà&quot; (word autonomy), in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.

There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Bruno Giordano Sanzin (&quot;Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista&quot; edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as &quot;parole in libertà.&quot; Arnaldo Ginna&#x27;s &quot;Le &#x27;locomotive con le calze&quot; (Trains with socks on) plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother, Bruno Corra, wrote in &quot;Sam Dunn è morto&quot; (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called &quot;synthetic&quot; characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony. Science fiction novels play an important role in Futurist literature.

==Film==

Italian futurist cinema (, ) was the oldest movement of European avant-garde cinema. Italian futurism, an artistic and social movement, impacted the Italian film industry from 1916-1919. It influenced Russian Futurist cinema and German Expressionist cinema. Its cultural importance was considerable and influenced all subsequent avant-gardes, as well as some authors of narrative cinema; its echo expands to the dreamlike visions of some films by Alfred Hitchcock.

Most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost, but critics cite &quot;Thaïs&quot; (1917) by Anton Giulio Bragaglia as one of the most influential, serving as the main inspiration for German Expressionist cinema in the following decade. &quot;Thaïs&quot; was born on the basis of the aesthetic treatise &quot;Fotodinamismo futurista&quot; (1911), written by the same author. The film, built around a melodramatic and decadent story, actually reveals multiple artistic influences different from Marinett&#x27;s futurism; the secessionist scenographies, the liberty furniture, and the abstract and surreal moments contribute to create a strong formal syncretism (the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought). &quot;Thaïs&quot; is the only surviving example of the 1910s Italian futurist cinema to date (35 minutes of the original 70).

When interviewed about her favorite film of all times, famed movie critic Pauline Kael stated that the director Dimitri Kirsanoff, in his silent experimental film &quot;Ménilmontant,&quot; &quot;developed a technique that suggests the movement known in painting as Futurism.&quot;

== Female Futurists ==
Within F. T. Marinetti&#x27;s &quot;The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism&quot;, two of his tenets briefly highlight his hatred for women under the pretense that it fuels the Futurist movement&#x27;s visceral nature:

Marinetti would begin to contradict himself when, in 1911, he called Luisa, Marchesa Casati a Futurist; he dedicated a portrait of himself painted by Carrà to her, the dedication declaring Casati as a Futurist being pasted on the canvas itself. Casati, affluent host of parties in support of the Futurist artists in Marinetti&#x27;s circle, was thought to be the muse of several of them, including Bragaglia and Balla. Journalist Eugenio Giovanetti would also declare her the &quot;spirit protector&quot; of Futurist art in 1918, as she had become one of Italy&#x27;s leading collectors.

In 1912, only three years after the &quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot; was published, Valentine de Saint-Point responded to Marinetti&#x27;s claims in her &quot;Manifesto of the Futurist Woman&quot; &quot;(Response to F. T. Marinetti&quot;). Marinetti even later referred to her as &quot;the first futurist woman.&quot; Her manifesto begins with a misanthropic tone by presenting how men and women are equal and both deserve contempt. She instead suggests that rather than the binary being limited to men and women, it should be replaced with &quot;femininity and masculinity;&quot; ample cultures and individuals should possess elements of both. Yet, she still embraces the core values of Futurism, especially its focus on &quot;virility&quot; and &quot;brutality.&quot; Saint-Point uses this as a segue into her antifeminist argument—giving women equal rights destroys their innate &quot;potency&quot; to strive for a better, more fulfilling life. In 1913, Saint-Point further expressed her desire for women to have erotic freedom when writing the &quot;Futurist Manifesto of Lust&quot;. However, it has also been noted that both manifestos favored men, specifically those deemed heroic, contrasting with her ideas about shared human characteristics also present in the manifestos.

In Russian Futurist and Cubo-Futurist circles, however, there was a higher percentage of women participants than in Italy from the start; Natalia Goncharova, Aleksandra Ekster, and Lyubov Popova are some examples of major female Futurists. Although Marinetti expressed his approval of Olga Rozanova&#x27;s paintings during his 1914 lecture tour of Russia, it is possible that the women painters&#x27; negative reaction to the said tour may have largely been due to his misogyny, as well as his explicit support for fascism. 

Despite the chauvinistic nature of the Italian Futurist program, many serious professional female artists adopted the style, especially so after the end of the first World War. Notably among these female futurists is F.T Marinetti&#x27;s own wife Benedetta Cappa Marinetti, whom he had met in 1918 and exchanged a series of letters discussing each of their respective work in Futurism. Letters continued to be exchanged between the two with F. T. Marinetti often complimenting Benedetta – the single name she was best known as – on her genius. In a letter dated August 16, 1919, Marinetti wrote to Benedetta: &quot;Do not forget your promise to work. You must carry your genius to its ultimate splendor. Every day.&quot; Although many of Benedetta&#x27;s paintings were exhibited in major Italian exhibitions — the 1930-1936 Venice Biennales (in which she was the first woman to have her art displayed since the exhibition&#x27;s founding in 1895), the 1935 Rome Quadriennale, and several other futurist exhibitions — she was often overshadowed in her work by her husband. The first introduction of Benedetta&#x27;s feminist convictions regarding futurism is in the form of a public dialogue in 1925 (with an L. R. Cannonieri) concerning the role of women in society. Benedetta was also one of the first to paint in Aeropittura, an abstract and futurist art style of landscape from the view of an airplane. Giannina Censi was the first exponent of Aerodanze. Similar to Aeropittura, this was a second wave Futurist dance style based in the fascination with aviation (in 1931 Censi was accompanied by F.T. Marinetti in a dance tour entitled &quot;Simultanina&quot;).

==1920s and 1930s==
Many Italian Futurists supported Fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, laborers, disgruntled war veterans, radicals, admirers of violence, and opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (&quot;Partito Politico Futurista&quot;) in early 1918, which was absorbed into Benito Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;Fasci Italiani di Combattimento&quot; in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the National Fascist Party. He opposed Fascism&#x27;s later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them &quot;reactionary,&quot; and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists&#x27; association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in architecture. After the Second World War, many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy, but failed to do so. Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the Novecento Italiano group in 1923, he said, &quot;I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual. The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view.&quot; Mussolini&#x27;s mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board. Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of &quot;degenerate art&quot; from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each. He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things. He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the Lateran Treaty of 1929, and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had a diverse range of supporters. They tended to oppose Marinetti&#x27;s artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924, the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of Abyssinia and the Italo-German Pact of Steel in 1939. This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of Georges Sorel, whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

===Aeropainting===

Aeropainting (&quot;aeropittura&quot;) was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926. The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters, offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter. Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes, portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of il Duce&quot;), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, &quot;Perspectives of Flight&quot;, signed by Cappa, Depero, Dottori, Fillìa, Marinetti, Prampolini, Somenzi and Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni). The artists stated that &quot;the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective,&quot; and that &quot;painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything.&quot; Crispolti identifies three main &quot;positions&quot; in aeropainting: &quot;a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini&#x27;s &#x27;cosmic idealism&#x27; ... ; a &#x27;reverie&#x27; of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in Crali, but also in Tato and Ambrosi).&quot;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters. Major figures include Fortunato Depero, Marisa Mori, Enrico Prampolini, Gerardo Dottori, Mino Delle Site, and Crali. Crali continued to produce &quot;aeropittura&quot; up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including Art Deco, Vorticism, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and much later Neo-Futurism and the Grosvenor School linocut artists. Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern Western culture; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. Ridley Scott consciously evoked the designs of Sant&#x27;Elia in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Echoes of Marinetti&#x27;s thought, especially his &quot;dreamt-of metallization of the human body,&quot; are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in manga/anime and the works of artists such as Shinya Tsukamoto, director of the &quot;Tetsuo&quot; (lit. &quot;Ironman&quot;) films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the Internet, such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori, produce work which comments on Futurist ideals and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo-Futurist style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism&#x27;s focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Montreal.

Futurist ideas have been a major influence in Western popular music; examples include ZTT Records, named after Marinetti&#x27;s poem &quot;Zang Tumb Tumb&quot;; the band Art of Noise, named after Russolo&#x27;s manifesto &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;; and the Adam and the Ants single &quot;Zerox,&quot; the cover featuring a photograph by Bragaglia. Influences can also be discerned in dance music since the 1980s.

Japanese Composer Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Futurista&quot; was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track &quot;Variety Show.&quot;

In 2009, Italian director Marco Bellocchio included Futurist art in his feature film &quot;Vincere&quot;.

In 2014, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum featured the exhibition &quot;Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe&quot; This was the first comprehensive overview of Italian Futurism to be presented in the United States.

Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art is a museum in London, with a collection solely centered around modern Italian artists and their works. It is best known for its large collection of Futurist paintings.

<text>Robert Lowry (March 10, 1829January 19, 1910) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 32nd governor of Mississippi from 1882 to 1890. Before entering politics, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.

== Early life and military service ==

Robert Lowry was born in Chesterfield District, South Carolina on March 10, 1829, and was raised in Mississippi. During the American Civil War, he enlisted as a private in the Confederate States Army. He quickly received a commission in the 6th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He commanded the regiment at the Battle of Shiloh, where it suffered very heavy casualties, and he was wounded. In early 1864, he led the troops that were sent to put down the local uprising of citizens near Jones County, Mississippi. Later, Lowry commanded a brigade of Mississippi regiments in the Third Corps, Army of Tennessee; in February 1865, he was finally promoted to brigadier-general. When the war was over, he returned to legal practice in Brandon. Lowry briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate after the war (1865–1866). Massive fraud in the gubernatorial election of 1881 resulted in the election of the subject over the Independent People&#x27;s Party candidate, Benjamin King.

== Governor (1882–1890) ==
Between 1882 and 1890, he was the Democratic governor of Mississippi, serving two four-year terms. He could be called a Bourbon Democrat. The Farmers&#x27; Alliance movement continued to show local action in Yazoo County and most areas of the state.

In September 1889, Lowry ordered the state militia to Leflore County, where organizing by the Colored Farmers&#x27; National Alliance and Cooperative Union sparked false rumors of an impending Black &quot;uprising.&quot; Militia troops killed an estimated 25 Black people.

Political activity related to peonage and racial discrimination in the Mississippi delta and other areas of the state led to violence during his term of office. Rapid industrial development occurred during his administration as well as the founding of the first state-supported women&#x27;s college at Columbus.

== Personal life ==
Lowry was related to J.A.W. Lowry, a lawyer and politician in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana.

<text>Home care (also referred to as domiciliary care, social care, or in-home care) is supportive care provided in the home. Care may be provided by licensed healthcare professionals who provide medical treatment needs or by professional caregivers who provide daily assistance to ensure the activities of daily living (ADLs) are met. In-home medical care is often and more accurately referred to as home health care or formal care. Home health care is different non-medical care, custodial care, or private-duty care which refers to assistance and services provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel. For patients recovering from surgery or illness, home care may include rehabilitative therapies. For terminally ill patients, home care may include hospice care.

Home health services help adults, seniors, and pediatric clients who are recovering after a hospital or facility stay, or need additional support to remain safely at home and avoid unnecessary hospitalization. These Medicare-certified services may include short-term nursing, rehabilitative, therapeutic, and assistive home health care. This care is provided by registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPN&#x27;s), physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), speech language pathologists (SLPs), unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs), home health aides (HHAs), home care agencies (HCAs) and medical social workers (MSWs) as a limited number of up to one hour visits, addressed primarily through the Medicare Home Health benefit. Paid individual providers can also provide health services through programs such as California&#x27;s In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS), or may be paid privately.

The largest segment of home care consists of licensed and unlicensed non-medical personnel, including caregivers who assist the care seeker. Care assistants may help the individual with daily tasks such as bathing, cleaning the home, preparing meals, and offering the recipient support and companionship. Caregivers work to support the needs of individuals who require such assistance. These services help the client to stay at home versus living in a facility. Non-medical home care is paid for by the individual or family. The term &quot;private-duty&quot; refers to the private pay nature of these relationships. Home care (non-medical) has traditionally been privately funded as opposed to home health care which is task-based and government or insurance funded. California&#x27;s In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) also offers financial support for employing a non-medical caregiver.

These traditional differences in home care services are changing as the average age of the population has risen. Individuals typically desire to remain independent and use home care services to maintain their existing lifestyle. Government and Insurance providers are beginning to fund this level of care as an alternative to facility care. In-Home Care is often a lower cost solution to long-term care facilities.

Home care has also been increasingly performed in settings other than clients&#x27; homes, as home workers have begun assisting with travel and performing errands. While this has been increasingly performed for younger populations with disabilities, these changes may also reframe the concept of home care in the future.

== Overview ==
&quot;Home care&quot;, &quot;home health care&quot; and &quot;in-home care&quot; are phrases that have been used interchangeably in the United States to mean any type of care—skilled or otherwise—given to a person in their own home. Home care aims to make it possible for people to remain at home rather than use residential, long-term, or institutional-based nursing care.

Non-medical in-home care is also called companion care or unskilled care. It is a valuable service for seniors in need of household help, social interaction, or transportation to appointments. Home care is most utilized by elderly people who live alone with impairments with their activities of daily living and have low social support. For those with adequate social and familial support, home care is delayed until the impairment level becomes severe or their caregiver is no longer able to support them independently. Home care services include help with daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication reminders, laundry, light housekeeping, errands, shopping, transportation, and companionship.

Home health care is medical in nature and is provided by licensed, skilled healthcare professionals. Home health care providers deliver services in the client&#x27;s own home. Professional home health services may include medical or psychological assessment, wound care, pain management, disease education and management, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. Home care is often an integral component of the post-hospitalization recovery process, especially during the initial weeks after discharge when the patient still requires some level of regular physical assistance. Patients who received home health care after being discharged from the hospital are associated with decrease in use of the healthcare system, hospital readmission, and death. These services may include some combination of professional health care services and life assistance services.

* &quot;Activities of daily living&quot; (ADL) refers to activities, including bathing, dressing, transferring, using the toilet, eating, and walking, that reflect the patient&#x27;s capacity for self-care.
* &quot;Instrumental activities of daily living&quot; (IADL) refer to daily tasks, including light housework, preparing meals, taking medications, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, and managing money, which enables the patient to live independently in the community.

While there are differences in terms used in describing aspects of home care or home health care in the United States and other areas of the world, for the most part the descriptions are very similar. However, it is important to note that there may be cultural differences in home care due to different familial structures - multigenerational households, multiple households, same-sex parents and single-parent families can compose networks of culturally diverse individuals who require home care. Decisions may be made by one dominant authority in the structure or through the collective community. 

Estimates for the U.S. indicate that most home care is informal, with families and friends providing a substantial amount of care. For formal care, the health care professionals most often involved are nurses followed by physical therapists and home care aides. Other health care providers include respiratory and occupational therapists, medical social workers and mental health workers. Home health care is generally paid for by Medicaid, Medicare, long term insurance, or paid with the patient&#x27;s own resources.

There is, however, a distinction made on a state-by-state basis according to how each state regulates the home care industry. In New York State, for example, &quot;home health care&quot; is used to describe medical services performed at home by a healthcare professional, whereas &quot;home care&quot; describes non-medical, private duty care. Other states do not make the same distinction, but the difference between the two must be accounted for when dealing with Medicare reimbursements. In most cases, when ordered by a physician, Medicare will pay for short-term medically necessary services provided in a home setting. A senior who requires only non-medical care, will NOT qualify for Medicare coverage of these services.

== Professionals providing care ==
Professionals providing home health care include licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists and social workers. Rehabilitation services may be provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists and dietitians. Professionals can be independent practitioners, part of a larger organization, or part of a franchise.

Home care aides, Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), and caregivers are trained to provide non-custodial or non-medical care, such as help with dressing, bathing, getting in and out of bed, and using the toilet. They may also prepare meals, accompany the client to medical visits, grocery shop, provide companionship and do various other errands.

== Home health software ==

Home health care software or home care software falls under the broad category of Health care Information Technology (HIT). HIT is &quot;the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making&quot;

== Aide worker qualifications ==
The state department of health issues requirement for that state. Workers can take an examination to become a state tested Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). Other requirements in the U.S.A. often include a background check, drug testing, and general references.

== Licensure and providers by state ==
California usually requires a state license for medical, non-medical and hospice agencies. All the HHAs operating in California are required to be licensed by the California Department of Public Health and are usually also certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, due to the recent demand in provider services in home care for elderly populations and populations with disabilities, there has been an increase in care by providers who are not licensed or certified who are associated with HCAs or private organizations.
Full-service agencies do pre-employment background checks, including (criminal), department of motor vehicle, and reference checks. Full-service agencies also train, monitor, and supervise the staff that provide care to clients in their home.

There is a certification available for home care companies in California, administered by the California Association for Health Services at Home.

Florida is a licensure state which requires different levels of licensing depending upon the services provided. Companion assistance is provided by a home maker companion agency whereas nursing services and assistance with ADLs can be provided by a home health agency or nurse registry. The state licensing authority is the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.

== Compensation ==
Compensation varies according to discipline, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the 2021 median hourly wage for home health aides was $13.52 per hour. There is a fair deal of variance in the compensation offered to Home health aides across different states. For example, Alaska had the highest annual wage of approximately $29,100 and West Virginia on the other end of the spectrum had the average salary of $18,020.

=== Supreme Court case relating to fees ===

Since 1974 until 2015, home care work was classified as a &quot;companionship service&quot; and exempted from federal overtime and minimum wage rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Supreme Court considered arguments on the companionship exemption in a case brought by a home care worker represented by counsel provided by Service Employees International Union. This 2003 case, &quot;Evelyn Coke v. Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. and Maryann Osborne&quot;, argued that agency-employed home caregivers should be covered under overtime and minimum wage regulations.

Evelyn Coke, a home care worker employed by a home care agency that was not paying her overtime, sued the agency in 2003, alleging that the regulation construing the &quot;companionship services&quot; exemption to apply to agency employees and exempt them from the federal minimum wage and overtime law is inconsistent with the law. The Supreme Court heard the case in 2009.

In the court decision, the court stated the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 exempted from the minimum wage and maximum hours rules of the FSLA persons &quot;employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals ... unable to care for themselves.&quot; 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(15). The court found that the power of the Department of Labor (DOL) to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any &#x27;gap&#x27; left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress, and when that agency fills that gap reasonably, it is binding. In this case, one of the gaps was whether to include workers paid by third parties in the exemption and the DOL had done that. Since the DOL followed public notice procedure, and since there was a gap left in the legislation, the DOLs regulation stood and home health care workers were not covered by either minimum wage or overtime pay requirements (but see below).

=== Department of Labor rule ===

A rule issued from the DOL, entitled &quot;Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,&quot; and meant to be effective from 1 January 2015, was written to revise &quot;the definition of &#x27;companionship services&#x27; to clarify and narrow the duties that fall within the term; in addition third party employers, such as home care agencies, will not be able to claim either of the exemptions [from federal overtime or minimum wage rules.] The major effect of this Final Rule [would be] that more domestic service workers will be protected by the FLSA&#x27;s minimum wage, overtime, and record keeping provisions.&quot; However, Home Care Associates of America, the International Franchise Association (IFA), and the National Association for Home Care &amp; Hospice sued the DOL in regards to the rule, and a federal district court threw out the rule. The Labor Department then appealed. In August 2015, the rule was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

== Payment for home care ==
Medicare often is the primary billing source, if this is the primary carrier between two types of insurance (like between Medicare and Medicaid). Also, if a patient has Medicare and that patient has a &quot;skilled need&quot; requiring nursing visits, the patient&#x27;s case is typically billed under Medicare.

Private insurance includes VA (Veterans Administration), some Railroad or Steelworkers health plans or other private insurance. &quot;Self/family&quot; indicates &quot;private pay&quot; status, when the patient or family pays 100% of all home care charges. Home care fees can be quite high; few patients &amp; families can absorb these costs for a long period of time.

== Types of services ==
Home care services are available to individuals who require intermittent or part-time skilled nursing care and/or rehabilitation therapies. The typical services available under the designated term &quot;home care&quot; include nursing care, such as changing dressings, monitoring medications, providing basic daily activities like bathing, short term rehabilitation, occupational and speech therapy. Some home health providers also include non-medical homemaker services including meal preparation, shopping, transportation, and some specific household chores.

The types of services available for home care have expanded throughout the history of the United States health care system due to continuous modernization of medical technology, particularly in the 1980s. Prior to the expansion, specialty services like intravenous antibiotics, oncology therapy, hemodialysis, parenteral and enteral nutrition and ventilator care, were only available in the hospital setting. This newly available technology has proven cost effective and improves the quality of life, increasing independence and flexibility for patients.

Hospice care is a method of care that can be included in the home care realm, but is also available as in inpatient service. Hospice is a cluster of comprehensive services for the terminally ill with a medically determined life expectancy of 6 months or less. Whether hospice services are performed at home or in a medical facility, the emphasis of care are the same; pain and symptom management, which is referred to as palliation.

Pediatric home care offers assistance for young children born with low birth weight, chronic and long term conditions, acute physical conditions, mental health support, chemotherapy, and others.

The available home care services are provided by a mix of physicians, registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, physical therapists, social workers, speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, registered dietitians, home care aides, homemaker and chore workers, companions and volunteers.

==Research and program accreditation==
In 2002, Lotus Shyu &amp; Lee found that providing home nursing care is more suitable for patients rather than in-house nursing-home care for patients that are not seriously ill and who do not need the services after discharge from the hospital. In another 2002 article, Modin and Furhoff regarded the roles of patients&#x27; doctors as more crucial than their nurses and care workers. However, from an epidemiological standpoint, the risks of some community acquired infections are higher from home nursing than from inpatient nursing home care. In regards to financial expenditure, home nursing care is more cost effective than inpatient nursing home care. The quality aspect of home nursing was reviewed in a 2001 article in the &quot;Journal of Nursing Care Quality&quot;. In 2011, Christensen &amp; Grönvall published a study of the challenges and opportunities of providing communication technologies supporting the cooperation between home care workers and family members. Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers harbour diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts. This situation is a challenge for the design of information and computer technology (ICT) for home care.

<text>The Wild Thornberrys is an American animated television series created by Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó, Steve Pepoon, David Silverman, and Stephen Sustarsic for Nickelodeon. The series portrays the zany hijinks of a family of nomadic wildlife documentary filmmakers known as the Thornberrys, which consist of the nature documentary television host Nigel, his wife and camera operator Marianne, their 16-year-old daughter Debbie, their younger daughter Eliza, their adopted son Donnie, and a chimpanzee named Darwin. The series focuses in particular on Eliza, who has a magical ability to communicate with animals. The Thornberry family travels to every continent and wildlife environment in the ComVee, a recreational vehicle equipped with safety mechanisms to handle any terrain or body of water, to document their journeys in detail, with typical episodes involving Eliza befriending an animal and subsequently finding herself in peril.

Originally pitched by Klasky Csupo as an adult animated sitcom for Fox, the series was then retooled as a family-friendly animated series for Nickelodeon and premiered on September 1, 1998, as the eleventh Nicktoon and the third overall produced by the studio following &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;. It ran for 5 seasons containing 91 episodes in total, with the series finale airing on June 11, 2004.

The series&#x27; fourth season premiere, &quot;The Origin of Donnie&quot;, is a television special focusing on Donnie Thornberry&#x27;s life before he was adopted by the family. A feature film, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;, in which Eliza embarks on a quest to save a cheetah cub from poachers, was theatrically released on December 20, 2002. &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, a crossover feature film with Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot;, was released in theaters on June 13, 2003. Spin-off media include DVD releases and three video games.

== Plot ==
The series focuses around a family of documentary filmmakers known as the Thornberrys, famous for their televised wildlife studies, as they travel the world in the &quot;Comvee&quot;, a large, amphibious, multifunctional overland motorhome which doubles as their base of operations. It primarily centers on the family&#x27;s younger daughter Eliza, and her secret gift of being able to communicate with animals, which was bestowed upon her after having freed a shaman masquerading as a trapped warthog.

The gift enables her to talk to the Thornberrys&#x27; pet chimpanzee Darwin. Together, the pair frequently venture through the wilderness, befriending many species of wild animals along the way, and discern moral truths and lessons through either their experiences or a particular animal species&#x27;s lifestyle; often this means simply assisting the creatures by which they become acquainted in their difficulties.

==Characters==
===Main===
* (voiced by Lacey Chabert) is a 12-year-old girl and the youngest daughter of the Thornberrys. She has long red-orange hair that is usually worn in pigtails, and occasionally a ponytail, round eyeglasses, four big teeth connected by two braces, and freckles. She is able to communicate with animals, especially her chimpanzee sidekick Darwin. She must keep this gift secret or she will lose her powers (as revealed in the episode &quot;Gift of Gab&quot;). This happens during the film when Eliza reluctantly tells two poachers her secret in order to save Debbie. However, after saving a herd of elephants from the same poachers later in the film, she is given her powers back. Despite her good intentions, she sometimes interferes with nature which causes more problems.
* (voiced by Tim Curry) is Eliza, Debbie, and Donnie&#x27;s father and Marianne&#x27;s husband. He is also the son of Radcliffe (also voiced by Curry) and Cordelia Thornberry (Lynn Redgrave), an aristocratic British couple. Born in the U.K. and having attended Harrow School near London, he travels around the world with his own family making wildlife documentaries. He is eccentric, enthusiastic, and cheerful even in the face of danger, and is also known for his exaggerated facial features and love of kippers, which he offers frequently.
* (voiced by Jodi Carlisle) is Eliza, Debbie, and Donnie&#x27;s mother and Nigel&#x27;s wife. She is the daughter of Frank (Ed Asner) and Sophie Hunter (Betty White). She is the director and camerawoman of the Thornberry documentaries, even willing to put herself in danger to capture a shot. She mentions that she attended the University of California, Berkeley and as revealed in &quot;Rebel Without a Trunk&quot;.
* (voiced by Flea) is a feral boy adopted by the Thornberrys, who speaks mostly in gibberish and (as revealed in the 4-part TV film, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys: The Origin of Donnie&quot;) was raised by an orangutan in Borneo after his parents, Michael and Lisa, who were old friends of the Thornberrys, were killed by poachers. Debbie is usually left taking care of Donnie and she&#x27;s constantly trying to keep him in control. Donnie&#x27;s age is 4, turning 5 in &quot;The Origin of Donnie&quot;.
* (voiced by Danielle Harris) is Eliza&#x27;s sister, a popular teenage valley girl who is 16 and nags her family, especially Eliza, during her adventures. After the events of the movie, she becomes the only family member to know about Eliza&#x27;s power but is warned that she will be turned into a baboon if she ever tells anyone. Debbie dresses in 1990s clothing and has a long swept hairstyle. Unlike Eliza, Debbie doesn&#x27;t like traveling and wants nothing more than to live in civilization and make friends with people her own age.
* (voiced by Tom Kane) is the Thornberrys&#x27; pet chimpanzee and Eliza&#x27;s best friend. He usually wears a tank top with horizontal blue and white stripes (used to be Debbie&#x27;s lucky tank top) and blue shorts. He speaks with a distinct, upper-class British accent. Although he isn&#x27;t too fond of Debbie, the two do share the same preference to living in civilization over the wilderness. He also acts as the voice of reason for Eliza whenever she tries to interfere in nature.
** Kane also voices others.

===Recurring===
* Kip O&#x27;Donnell (voiced by Keith Szarabajka) is a poacher and The Thornberrys’ sworn enemy who poaches and kidnaps animals with his partner Neil Biederman (voiced by Michael Jeter &amp; replaced by Jerry Sroka). Whenever they aren&#x27;t poaching animals, they are conducting schemes to make easy money. They would eventually be apprehended by the authorities after causing an oil spill while attempting to steal oil from an oil tanker in the episode &quot;You Otter Know&quot;. Kip always refers to Eliza as &quot;The Thornberry Girl&quot;.
* Tyler Tucker (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is Eliza and Debbie&#x27;s cousin. He is Marianne and Nigel&#x27;s nephew through Marianne&#x27;s sister Nancy Tucker née Hunter. He is a year older than Eliza but acts more immaturely than Eliza does. He doesn&#x27;t really understand the dangers of living in the wild. He&#x27;s a know-it-all but generally has a good head on his shoulders, and he cares about his cousins Debbie, Eliza, and Donnie. His parents are Dennis (voiced by Martin Mull) and Nancy Tucker (voiced by Mary Kay Place).
* Shane G. (voiced by Christopher Masterson) is a pop superstar who travels with the Thornberry Family for five episodes while they are filming in Alaska. The Foundation orders Nigel and Marianne to take him with the family to promote Wildlife preservation among young people and Shane&#x27;s fans. Both Eliza and Debbie gain a crush on him, however Debbie loses interest when Shane shows to have more similarities with Eliza than herself.

==Episodes==

== Production ==
&quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; was produced by Klasky Csupo. It was initially pitched as an adult animated sitcom under the name, &quot;Nigel Thornberry&#x27;s Animal World,&quot; and was to be co-produced by 20th Century Fox Television for the Fox network, but it was ultimately rejected. It was then picked up by Nickelodeon under its own animation studio and was retooled as a family-oriented series with Nigel&#x27;s youngest daughter Eliza (originally named Alex) being promoted to the main protagonist role. According to Eryk Casemiro, SVP of Creative Affairs at Klasky-Csupo Productions at the time of the series production, she was originally designed to look &quot;quite frankly, very ugly&quot; in order to contradict the stereotype that all young heroines are beautiful. However, her design was later retooled to look &quot;cuter&quot; at the request of Nickelodeon. It premiered on September 1, 1998, and was the first Nicktoon to exclusively use 22-minute stories (episodes of other Nicktoons usually featured two 10 – 11-minute stories, using 22-minute stories only on occasion).

The series was designed to have a focus on parents, after focus groups run by Klasky and Csupo uncovered that children were talking about the real struggles of the parent-child relationship; this was opposed to Nickelodeon&#x27;s view of only featuring kids in children&#x27;s programming. It was also designed with the potential of being used in science curriculums. To accomplish this, the production crew hired a specialist who did research on different regions of the world, different cultures, and different species of animals, all of which were provided to the writers to help them develop ideas for episodes.

<text>Kino-Pravda () was a series of 23 newsreels by Dziga Vertov, Elizaveta Svilova, and Mikhail Kaufman launched in June 1922. Vertov referred to the twenty-three issues of &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; as the first work by him where his future cinematic methods can be observed.

==Overview==
Working mainly during the 1920s, Vertov promoted the concept of &quot;kino-pravda&quot;, or &quot;film-truth&quot;, through his newsreel series. His driving vision was to capture fragments of actuality which, when organized together, showed a deeper truth which could not be seen with the naked eye. In the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first.

The episodes of &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; usually did not include reenactments or stagings (one exception is the segment about the trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries: the scenes of the selling of the newspapers on the streets and the people reading the papers in the trolley were both staged for the camera). The cinematography is simple, functional, and unelaborated. Twenty-three issues of the series were produced over a period of three years; each issue lasted about twenty minutes and usually covered three topics. The stories were typically descriptive, not narrative, and included vignettes and exposés, showing for instance the renovation of a trolley system, the organization of farmers into communes, and the trial of Socialist Revolutionaries; one story shows starvation in the nascent Marxist state. Propagandistic tendencies are also present, but with more subtlety, in the episode featuring the construction of an airport: one shot shows the former Czar&#x27;s tanks helping prepare a foundation, with an intertitle reading &quot;Tanks on the labor front&quot;.

Vertov intended an active relationship with his audience in the series — in the final segment he includes contact information — but by the fourteenth episode the series had become so experimental that some critics dismissed Vertov&#x27;s efforts as &quot;insane&quot;.

The term &quot;kino pravda&quot;, though it translates from Russian as &quot;film truth&quot;, is not to be confused with the cinéma vérité movement in documentary film, which also translates as &quot;film truth&quot;. Cinéma vérité was similarly marked by the intention of capturing reality &quot;warts and all&quot;, but became popular in France in the 1960s.

<text>Cinéma vérité (, , ) is a style of documentary filmmaking developed by Edgar Morin and Jean Rouch, inspired by Dziga Vertov&#x27;s theory about &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;. It combines improvisation with use of the camera to unveil truth or highlight subjects hidden behind reality.
It is sometimes called observational cinema, if understood as pure direct cinema: mainly without a narrator&#x27;s voice-over. There are subtle, yet important, differences between terms expressing similar concepts. Direct cinema is largely concerned with the recording of events in which the subject and audience become unaware of the camera&#x27;s presence: operating within what Bill Nichols, an American historian and theoretician of documentary film, calls the &quot;observational mode&quot;, a fly on the wall. Many therefore see a paradox in drawing attention away from the presence of the camera and simultaneously interfering in the reality it registers when attempting to discover a cinematic truth.

== History ==
Cinéma vérité can involve stylized set-ups and interaction between the filmmaker and the subject, even to the point of provocation. Some argue that the obvious presence of the filmmaker and camera was seen by most cinéma vérité filmmakers as the best way to reveal the truth. The camera is always acknowledged, for it performs the act of filming real objects, people, and events in a confrontational way. The filmmaker&#x27;s intention was to represent the truth as objectively as possible, freeing the viewer from deceptions in how those aspects of life were formerly presented to them. From this perspective, the filmmaker should be the catalyst of a situation. Even among filmmakers whose works are described by these terms, there is little consensus on their meanings.

Pierre Perrault sets situations up and then films them, for example in &quot;Pour la suite du monde&quot; (1963) where he asked old people to fish for whale. The result is not a documentary about whale fishing; it is about memory and lineage. In this sense cinéma vérité is concerned with anthropological cinema, and with the social and political implications of what is captured on film. How a filmmaker shoots a film, what is being filmed, what to do with what was filmed, and how that film will be presented to an audience, all were very important for filmmakers of the time.

In all cases, the ethical and aesthetic analysis of documentary form (see docufiction) of the 1950s and 1960s has to be linked with a critical look at post-war propaganda analysis. This type of cinema is concerned with notions of truth and reality in film. Feminist documentary films of the 1970s often used cinéma-vérité techniques. This sort of &quot;realism&quot; was criticized for its deceptive pseudo-natural construction of reality.

Edgar Morin coined the term around the time of such essential films as 1960&#x27;s &quot;Primary&quot; and his own 1961 collaboration with Jean Rouch, &quot;Chronicle of a Summer&quot;.

==Legacy==
Many film directors of the 1960s and later adopted use of handheld camera and other cinéma vérité aspects for their scripted, fiction filmshaving actors improvise to get a more spontaneous quality in their dialogue and action. Influential examples include director John Cassavetes, who broke ground with his 1968 Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Faces&quot;. The techniques of cinéma vérité can also be seen in fictional films from &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

Cinéma vérité was also adapted for use in scripted TV programs, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;, both the UK and American versions of &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Parks &amp; Recreation&quot; and &quot;Modern Family&quot;. Documentary series are less common, but &quot;COPS&quot; is one famous non-fictional example.

It has also been a subject ripe for parodies and spoofs such as the mockumentary film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and Emmy Award-nominated TV series &quot;Documentary Now&quot; (the latter paying homage to the style of such CV classics as &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, &quot;Salesman&quot; and &quot;The War Room&quot;).

Armidale is a rural university town, home to the University of New England (UNE). Armidale is located within the New England Renewable Energy Zone, which is expected to bring significant renewable energy development to the area.

==History==

Before the British colonial settlement of New South Wales, the indigenous Anaiwan tribe occupied the area that encompasses current day Armidale.

British pastoralists first entered the region in the early 1830s, following the earlier exploration of the area by John Oxley. Oxley recommended the region for grazing, and soon squatters established large leaseholds in the locality. Armidale was initially founded in 1839 by George James MacDonald who was the Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the local Border Police detachment in the New England district. MacDonald established his barracks on the site and named it after Armadale on the Isle of Skye in Scotland which was the ancestral home of the MacDonald clan.

The James Barnet-designed heritage-listed Armidale Post Office opened on 1 April 1843. The town, which was surveyed in 1848 and gazetted in 1849, was established to provide a market and administration for the farms, but soon after gold was discovered at nearby Rocky River and Gara Gorges, and a gold rush ensued, enlarging the town rapidly in the 1850s. The gold mining settlement of Hillgrove about 40 km east of Armidale was supplied by electricity from Australia&#x27;s first hydro-electric scheme, the Gara River Hydro-Electric Scheme, remains of which are still visible on the Gara River below the Blue Hole at Castle Doyle. The nearby town of Uralla holds the grave of the famous Captain Thunderbolt – outlaw Fred Ward – who caused trouble in the area in the 1860s. As with Ned Kelly, the locals have adopted him as a larrikin hero and make the most of him as a tourist attraction.

Armidale became a municipality in 1863 and was proclaimed a city in 1885.

Although it does not lie between the two major cities of Sydney and Melbourne, a site just to the south of Armidale was, in the early 1900s, considered as a potential site for Australia&#x27;s federal capital. Some saw its northerly location as better suited to all three eastern mainland states, including Queensland. Later, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s, Armidale was one of the centres of separatist agitation by the New England New State Movement. Local politician, David Drummond, a strong supporter of the movement, successfully lobbied for Armidale to have the second teachers&#x27; college in New South Wales, and later a university, positioning the town as a potential state capital.
==Geography==

Armidale is on the banks of Dumaresq Creek, in the Northern Tablelands in the New England region about midway between Sydney and Brisbane at an altitude (980 m AHD) ranging from 970 metres at the valley&#x27;s floor to 1,110 metres above sea level at the crests of the hills. A short distance to the east of Armidale are heavily forested steep gorges dropping down to the eastern coastal plain. Large parts of the highlands are covered by Palaeozoic aged metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. Intruding into these meta-sediments are granite plutons which decompose to form sandy soil, slightly deficient in nutrients. There are also basalt flows which are more fertile for the soil substrates. Those areas away from the deep gorge country tend to display gently undulating terrain mainly used for pastures and where granites occur the areas are usually covered in bushland.

The area contains a number of places of outstanding natural beauty and scientific interest as well as several World Heritage national parks including the New England National Park and the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. To the west is Mount Yarrowyck Nature Reserve. The critically endangered New England Peppermint Grassy Woodland is the main vegetation community in the region.

The coastal plain can be reached directly at Coffs Harbour via Waterfall Way to Dorrigo and Bellingen on the Bellinger River, a two-hour drive.
During winter there is a problem with some air quality reduction caused by the use of solid fuel domestic wood heaters. A peer-reviewed study carried out by the University of New England in 2007 found winter woodsmoke causes 8.8 additional visits per day to GPs in Armidale for respiratory complaints, i.e., about 750 additional visits per year. Another peer-reviewed study estimated the use of wood heaters in Armidale was responsible for about 11.5 premature deaths per year with estimated annual health cost of $14.95 million – about $4720 per year for every woodheater in the city.
===Climate===
Armidale has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Armidale&#x27;s elevation gives it a milder climate than most of northern New South Wales, but the summers are still very warm. Winters are long and cool, with many frosty nights. Snowfall is somewhat rare, on average only one day in every three years.

In Armidale, the presence of four distinct seasons makes it climatically unlike much of inland Australia; hence, the &quot;New England&quot; moniker and the autumn colours are notable features of the city. Summers are characterised by warm to very warm days followed almost always by cool, sometimes cold, nights. Thunderstorms often produce heavy falls of rain and occasionally hail in the afternoons and early evenings, also bringing a sudden drop in temperature. Unlike nearby coastal areas, Armidale does not usually experience high humidity levels making most of the summer days quite comfortable. Temperatures exceed on an average of 13 afternoons per year, but rarely reach higher than . The highest temperature recorded at Armidale Airport was , recorded in February 2017.
As the leaves turn yellow and fall, day temperatures are mostly still warm, particularly in March and April. Days are sunny, the thunderstorm season is over, and rain becomes more sporadic. Nights become colder, and residents often awake to a thick fog blanketing the Armidale valley, but by 9 am fogs have cleared to be followed by a bright sunny day. The year&#x27;s first frosts usually occur in April, but they are not severe.

Winters are cold; overnight temperatures drop below with frost on the ground; at the Tree Group Nursery station a reading as low as was record on 30 June 2010, whilst the older station at Radio 2AD recorded on 15 July 1970. These cold frosty mornings are usually followed by sunny days. Day temperatures may make it as high as , but sometimes may not climb beyond . These are typical Northern Tablelands winter days with westerly winds, bleak grey clouds, and showers of rain and very occasionally snow. Rainfall during the winter months is not infrequent but is usually light.

In spring temperatures are warmer, although occasional morning frosts still can continue well into October. September is usually a pleasantly mild but windy month, and by late October with increasing heat and humidity the thunderstorm season is starting with increasing rainfalls. The spring months produce the most variable weather of the year. A week of very warm sunny weather can be followed by several milder days with temperatures right back at winter levels before gradually warming up again. This cycle often repeats itself many times until the start of summer.


===Weather===
Armidale has been prone to severe hailstorms and experienced three such storms over the ten-year period from 1996 to 2006.

On 29 September 1996 hail of up to in diameter and southerly winds of up to were reported at the airport weather station. The area was declared a disaster zone and State Emergency Service crews were brought in from across the state. Damage was estimated to be in excess of A$200 million.

On 1 January 2000 many homes were damaged by extreme weather conditions which brought large hail stones, strong winds and flash flooding.

On 21 December 2006 hail stones, high winds and flash flooding damaged more than 1,000 homes and destroyed the Armidale Livestock Exhibition Centre which collapsed entirely under the weight of accumulated hail. The city was declared a state of emergency by New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma the following day.

On the night of 14 October 2021 at 10pm, an intense storm produced a tornado causing extensive damage. It tore away roofs and turned vehicles upside down.

==City of Armidale==
Armidale is a cathedral city, being the seat of the Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops of Armidale. St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, which replaced the original St Peter&#x27;s Church, was designed by the Canadian architect John Horbury Hunt, who also designed Booloominbah at the University of New England. St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral opened for worship in 1875 and the tower was added in 1938. The Catholic Cathedral of St Mary and St Joseph was dedicated on 12 December 1919.

The city centre is laid out in a grid of streets. The main street is called Beardy Street, named for two of the founding settlers who had beards. The court house was built in the 1850s and is still a prominent feature of the central district. Much of the rest of the city is residential.

The Australian Wool Fashion Awards, which showcases the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by Armidale in March each year. The Autumn Festival is a popular annual event of April in Armidale. The festival features a street parade, stalls and celebrations throughout the city. It is a regular part of the city&#x27;s attractions, often promoting Armidale&#x27;s diverse culture (for instance, posters set up by council attempt to attract tourists with the motto &quot;Foodies Thrive in Armidale&quot;) and autumn colours. During May the annual New England Wool Expo is staged to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials and demonstrations, a wool bale rolling competition and other activities.

<text>LifeLog was a project of the Information Processing Techniques Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). According to its bid solicitation pamphlet in 2003, it was to be &quot;an ontology-based (sub)system that captures, stores, and makes accessible the flow of one person&#x27;s experience in and interactions with the world in order to support a broad spectrum of associates/assistants and other system capabilities&quot;. The objective of the LifeLog concept was &quot;to be able to trace the &#x27;threads&#x27; of an individual&#x27;s life in terms of events, states, and relationships&quot;, and it has the ability to &quot;take in all of a subject&#x27;s experience, from phone numbers dialed and e-mail messages viewed to every breath taken, step made and place gone&quot;.

== Goals and capabilities ==

LifeLog aimed to compile a massive electronic database of every activity and relationship a person engages in. This was to include credit card purchases, web sites visited, the content of telephone calls and e-mails sent and received, scans of faxes and postal mail sent and received, instant messages sent and received, books and magazines read, television and radio selections, physical location recorded via wearable GPS sensors, biomedical data captured through wearable sensors. The high level goal of this data logging was to identify &quot;preferences, plans, goals, and other markers of intentionality&quot;.

Another of DARPA&#x27;s goals for LifeLog had a predictive function. It sought to “find meaningful patterns in the timeline, to infer the user’s routines, habits, and relationships with other people, organizations, places, and objects, and to exploit these patterns to ease its task&quot;.

Generically, the term &quot;lifelog&quot; or &quot;flog&quot; is used to describe a storage system that can automatically and persistently record and archive some informational dimension of an object&#x27;s (object lifelog) or user&#x27;s (user lifelog) life experience in a particular data category.

News reports in the media described LifeLog as the &quot;diary to end all diaries—a multimedia, digital record of everywhere you go and everything you see, hear, read, say and touch&quot;.

According to U.S. government officials, LifeLog is not connected with DARPA&#x27;s Total Information Awareness.

The LifeLog program was canceled on February 4th 2004 after criticism concerning the privacy implications of the system.

<text>The Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), originally &quot;Command and Control Research&quot;, was part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense.

==Origin==
According to an ARPA-sponsored history of the organization, IPTO grew from a distinctly unpromising beginning: the Air Force had a large, expensive computer (AN/FSQ 321A) which was intended as a backup for the SAGE air defense program, but no longer needed; and it also had too few required tasks to maintain the desired staffing level at its main software contractor, the System Development Corporation (SDC). Accordingly, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering decided to capitalize on these &quot;sunk costs&quot; and SDC expertise by standing up an ARPA program in Command &amp; Control Research. It was accordingly begun in June 1961 with an initial budget of $5.8 million, to include shipping, installation, and checking out the computer at SDC facilities. This new ARPA program was envisioned to &quot;support research on the conceptual aspects of command and control.&quot;

Most fortunately, ARPA then hired J.C.R. Licklider away from Bolt, Beranek and Newman to be IPTO&#x27;s first director. Licklider started work in October 1962, and until his term ended in 1964, he &quot;...initiated three of the most important developments in information technology: the creation of computer science departments at several major universities, time-sharing, and networking&quot;. By the late 1960s, his promotion of the concept had inspired a primitive version of his vision called ARPANET, which expanded into a network of networks in the 1970s that became the Internet.

Licklider described how he had re-envisioned command and control research as research into interactive computing as follows:

There was a belief in the heads of a number of people -- a small number -- that people could really become very much more effective in their thinking and decision-making, if they had the support of a computer system, good displays and so forth, good data bases, computation at your command. It was kind of an image that we were working toward the realization of... It really wasn&#x27;t a command and control research program. It was an interactive computing program. And my belief was, and still is, you can&#x27;t really do command and control outside the framework of such a thing... of course, that wasn&#x27;t believed by people in the command control field.

Licklider quickly set about detaching the program from its sole reliance on a surplus Air Force computer and single industrial contractor. As he recalled:

Essentially what I did on the command and control thing was to try to figure out where the best academic computer centers were, and then go systematically about trying to get research contracts set up with them, aiming for three or four major ones and then a lot of little ones.

Under Licklider&#x27;s direction, the stated mission of IPTO was:
[To] create a new generation of computational and information systems that possess capabilities far beyond those of current systems. These cognitive systems - systems that know what they&#x27;re doing:
* will be able to reason, using substantial amounts of appropriately represented knowledge;
* will learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time;
* will be capable of explaining themselves and taking naturally expressed direction from humans;
* will be aware of themselves and able to reflect on their own behavior;
* will be able to respond robustly to surprises, in a very general way.
==Later history==
Ivan Sutherland replaced J. C. R. Licklider as IPTO&#x27;s director when Licklider left ARPA in 1964. Sutherland was 26 years old at the time. Bob Taylor was hired as Sutherland&#x27;s assistant in 1965 and became director in 1966.

During Taylor&#x27;s tenure, the IPTO facility consisted of a spacious office for the director in Ring D of The Pentagon and a small &quot;terminal room&quot; with remote terminals to mainframe computers at MIT, the University of California, Berkeley and the AN/FSQ-32 in Santa Monica. The staff at the Pentagon consisted of the director and his secretary. The budget was $19 million which funded computer research projects at MIT and other institutions in Massachusetts and California.

In 1966 Taylor went to ARPA, on Ring E, for funding to create a computer network that used interactive computing. He got $1 million and hired Lawrence Roberts to manage the project.

IPTO was combined with the Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO) to form the Information Innovation Office (I2O) in 2010.

<text>The Firenza is a model of car offered by Vauxhall from May 1971 until 1975. It was a development of the Viva, but had a distinctive coupé body style (fastback) and only two doors. In South Africa, it was sold as the Chevrolet Firenza until it was replaced by the Chevrolet 1300/1900 during 1975. Its name is derived from &quot;Firenze&quot;, the name of the Italian city known in English as Florence.

==History==
The initial Firenza was available in a base model 1159 cc overhead valve and two models with overhead camshaft, in 1598 cc and 1975 cc variants. The latter was the same engine as used in the earlier Viva GT. Some six months after launch, in December 1971, performance was boosted when the engine capacities were enlarged to 1256 cc, 1798 cc and 2279 cc respectively. All models had a front-mounted four-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels. The SL model in each engine size carried the highest level of trim.

Suspension was by double wishbone and coil springs at the front, and a live rear axle with trailing arms and coils at the rear. The suspension and steering of the Firenza was adapted for use in the Jensen-Healey sports car.

The model changes in early 1972 included the introduction of a top-of-the-line 2300 Sport SL model (introduced at the Geneva Motor Show), using the 2279 cc engine. The 2300 Sport SL was the only version to feature the seven dial dash (speedometer, clock, rev counter, fuel, oil pressure, water temp, &amp; battery charge). The engine was an inclined four-cylinder with single overhead camshaft and twin Stromberg carburettors, producing . The oversquare straight four engine was renowned for its big torque curve, making the car very flexible and easy to drive. The interior was equipped with bucket seats, front and back, to carry four persons. The centre console with heater controls and warning lights was quite distinctive and luxurious for the time.

The 2300 Sport SL was raced by the Dealer Team Vauxhall, following their successes with the Viva GT. In Castrol colours, these cars enjoyed many successes.

==Droopsnoot Firenza==
In 1973, Vauxhall developed a restyled version of the Firenza, known officially as the High Performance (HP) Firenza, but known colloquially as the &quot;droopsnoot&quot; after its distinct aerodynamic nose. The nose was moulded from GRP, and featured two pairs of Cibié headlamps behind toughened glass covers. The overall look was somewhat reminiscent of the Renault Alpine A310, and used the same headlamp units. Several prototypes of the HP Firenza were considered with different types of front end treatment, requiring different degrees of change from the standard production front end, including cars known as Black Knight and Daytona, the latter for its resemblance to the Ferrari Daytona, a favourite of Wayne Cherry.
At that time, the original flat-fronted Firenza model was rebadged as the Magnum coupé, and the name Firenza was used exclusively for the HP version. This car was an exciting styling departure for Vauxhall, and certainly created something of a buzz. The engine was the 2.3-litre variant of the OHC Slant Four engine, uprated to a very torquey using a variety of parts developed by Blydenstein Racing. It had twin 175 Stromberg carburettors, high-lift camshaft and free-flow tubular exhaust manifold. The car was restyled on the David Jones original by American designer Wayne Cherry and the result was an exceptionally low drag coefficient for its time. Suspension was uprated and lowered, brakes uprated, and a 5-speed ZF dog leg gearbox was installed, a much stronger unit than fitted to the standard model (though rather noisy). Another unusual feature of the car was the alloy Avon Safety Wheels, which were designed to retain the tyre safely in the event of a puncture. This was the first car to use these wheels in production. All production cars were painted in the same colour – Silver Starfire, and featured a largely black interior with silver-grey cloth seats. An unusual interior feature of dubious utility was the passenger grab handle on the dash in place of the standard glovebox.

The car was launched to much publicity in a special one-off race at Thruxton circuit in Hampshire, with top drivers of the day taking part including Gerry Marshall and Barry &quot;Whizzo&quot; Williams, who won the race. However, the fuel crisis of the time meant that suddenly it became very hard to sell gas-guzzling cars like this (even though the aerodynamics increased fuel economy greatly, reducing the power needed to attain its top speed by some 30 hp), and coupled with some production line difficulties in actually building the car meant that sales and delivery were slow, and eventually just 204 examples were built, far short of the 30,000 projected. This very low volume was a disaster for Vauxhall, but it has led to the car becoming a very collectible classic.

The Firenza was also very successful in saloon car racing in the 1970s, especially in its Old Nail (with 2.3-litre inline-4 engine developed by Blydenstein Racing) and Repco-Holden 5-litre V8 engined Baby Bertha versions, piloted to great effect by Gerry Marshall.

Despite the low production run, the aerodynamic qualities and styling of the &quot;droopsnoot&quot; were incorporated, with improved productionisation, into most of Vauxhall&#x27;s remaining 1970s new models: the Chevette, Cavalier and Carlton. The Firenza can be seen as a styling prototype for these models. Its influence can be judged from the fact that Ford adopted a very similar look for its Mk II RS2000 Escort and the 1982 Ford Sierra, which in turn were widely copied throughout the 1980s by others. For this reason, the HPF looks far less dated than many of its contemporaries.

==Chevrolet Firenza==
In South Africa, the local GM subsidiary built the Viva two-door and four-door saloons as the Chevrolet Firenza from January 1971. A 1159 cc Vauxhall engine or a 2.5-litre Chevrolet inline-four, both locally made, were fitted. Two- or four-door saloons, a two-door coupé (2.5 only) and a three-door estate were available from the beginning. From 1973, the 1200 was replaced by the larger 1256 cc version. In 1974 the estate and coupé models were dropped. By 1975 only the de Luxe and SL models remained, with the two-door saloon only as a 1.3 de Luxe. The 2.5 was also available with an automatic transmission. The 2.5 SL received twin round headlamps, while the 1300 had single rectangular units. Firenza production ended in July 1975, with sales continuing at a trickle thereafter.

A limited edition version of the Firenza was built in South Africa known as the Chevrolet Can-Am (or the Little Chev) by South Africans using the 5-litre (302ci) V8 from the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. In order for the car to qualify for racing, 100 had to be sold to the public, so only 100 were built.

In 1975, the Firenza was renamed the Chevrolet 1300/1900. This was facelifted with large square front grille as well as a revised bumper and bonnet. A hatchback version of the Firenza, known as the Chevrolet Hatch, was also introduced. This featured the tailgate and rear lights from the T-Car Vauxhall Chevette/Opel Kadett, which was not sold in South Africa. The Chevrolet Hatch was dropped in 1978.

==Overview==
This an early case of authors attempting to exercise their moral rights under the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA). VARA was passed in 1990 and added several moral rights for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.

==Facts==
The Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in New York City under the name &quot;Jx3&quot;. 474431 Associates was the owner of a former Macy&#x27;s warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the Long Island City section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company [&quot;SIG&quot;] managed the property as &quot;The Factory Building&quot; and marketed it as a mall.

On December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG &quot;to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations&quot; in the building. The artists had &quot;full authority in design, color, and style&quot; of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.

On March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear&#x27;s representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under Visual Artists Rights Act and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.

==District Court==

The District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work. That decision was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

==Circuit Court==
The Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a work made for hire and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from &quot;Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid&quot;, 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a &quot;work made for hire&quot; or if the artist was working as &quot;independent contractor&quot;.

<text>The Vauxhall Viva is a small family car that was produced by Vauxhall in a succession of three versions between 1963 and 1979. These were designated the HA, HB and HC series.

The Viva was introduced a year after Vauxhall&#x27;s fellow General Motors company Opel launched the Opel Kadett A. Both cars were a result of the same General Motors project and share the same floorpan and engine constructions, but with one main difference being the use of metric measurements for the Opel and imperial ones for the Vauxhall. They are also visually similar, however few components are interchangeable. A van version was also produced, as the Bedford HA. In the UK the Viva&#x27;s principal competitors at the time of its launch included the well-established Ford Anglia and Morris Minor.

The third generation HC series was the last solely Vauxhall designed passenger car when it ceased production in 1979 (although not the last Vauxhall designed vehicle to go out of production overall – that distinction belongs to the Bedford CF van), as General Motors Europe unified the Opel and Vauxhall brands around a single range of Opel-developed models.

Vauxhall revived the Viva nameplate from 2015–2019 on a rebadged variant of the fourth generation Opel Karl/Chevrolet Spark.


== HA Viva (1963–1966)==
The HA Viva, announced in September 1963, and replaced in September 1966, was Vauxhall&#x27;s first serious step into the compact car market after World War II. It was also the first new small car produced by Vauxhall since 1936. The HA Viva was powered by a , overhead valve, four cylinder, front-mounted engine driving the rear wheels. It was comparable in size and mechanical specifications with the new Opel Kadett released a year earlier in continental Europe, being a result of the same project — with the two cars sharing much of their inner structure and similar overall dimensions. The Viva and Kadett were sold alongside each other in many markets. The HA Viva was just an inch longer than the Ford Anglia which dated back to 1959. It was offered only as a two-door saloon, and competed with the Anglia as well as BMC&#x27;s hugely successful and highly regarded new 1100 range.

The HA set new standards in its day for lightweight, easy to operate controls, a slick short gearchange, lightweight steering and clutch pedal, good all-round visibility and relatively nippy performance. It was one of the first cars to be actively marketed towards women, perhaps as a result of these perceived benefits for them.

The front crossmember (steering, suspension and engine mounting) assembly from the HA became a very popular item for DIY hot rod builders in the UK, due to its simple self-contained mechanics, similar to older designs such as those from the 1930s, and ability to accommodate much larger engines within its span. The assembly featured a double wishbone/vertical telescopic dampers suspension design in combination with a transverse leaf spring attached to the front crossmember at its centre position and the entire unit could be removed and adapted to another vehicle. (For similar reasons the Jaguar independent rear suspension assembly was often used at the rear of these custom cars). The Viva&#x27;s rear suspension made do with conventional longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs and telescopic dampers. The progressive suspension including a very clever mounting design for the rear axle and the transverse leaf system of the front suspension led to a soft ride on small bumps but with very acceptable roll characteristics on corners along with its precise steering and small turning circle.

In Canada, the HA was sold as the Vauxhall Viva by Pontiac/Buick dealers and also as the Envoy Epic by Chevrolet/Oldsmobile dealers, and was second in sales to the Volkswagen Beetle amongst imported compact cars. In France (and Algeria and Tunisia), the car was marketed as the Vauxhall Epic.

The Viva was initially launched in Standard and Deluxe versions, identifiable by their simple horizontal slatted metal grilles. Minor changes in September 1964 included improved seats and more highly geared steering. A more luxurious SL (for Super Luxury) variant appeared in June 1965. The SL differed from the base models by a relatively elaborate grille and, normally, by a painted strip along the side of the car. Unlike the base model with its unique tail lamp design, the SL featured a horizontal row of three plain, round Lucas parts-bin lamps, not unlike the vertical arrangement employed on Singer Gazelle cars of that era. Engines were available in two states of tune: entry-level models came with a power output of , while the Viva 90, introduced in October 1965, had a higher 9:1 compression ratio and produced . The availability of two engines and three trim options enabled Vauxhall to offer six Viva variants in some markets. 90 models came with front disc brakes, while SLs featured contrasting bodyside flashes, a criss-cross chrome plated front grille, full wheel covers, three-element round tail lights and better interior trim.

During its first ten months, over 100,000 HA Vivas were made, and by 1966 the HA had chalked up over 306,000 sales, proving that Vauxhall had made a successful return to the small-car market, which they had abandoned following the Second World War. One measure of the success is the fact that a budget was made available to design the car&#x27;s successor with a virtually clean sheet. The Viva HB inherited engines, but little else, from the HA. 309,538 Viva HAs were produced.

The HA, however, suffered severely from corrosion problems along with other Vauxhall models of the time and very few of this model remain – one of the main problem areas being the cappings along the top side edges of the luggage compartment badly corroding and allowing water to enter, consequently leading to severe structural corrosion in the luggage-compartment floor area. As with a lot of other British cars of that period, many Vivas failed to survive long term.

The HA Viva was assembled in Australia by Holden commencing in 1964, and in New Zealand by General Motors at Petone. New Zealand built only the Deluxe model and a few base versions for government fleet contracts.
===Bedford HA===

A van version was marketed as the Bedford HA and was offered in 6 cwt, 8 cwt and, from 1972, 10 cwt variants. It differed from the saloon in being taller, and thousands were bought by the GPO (later British Telecom), their bright yellow HA vans becoming a common sight. The HA Van was eventually supplanted by the Chevanne, but because of fleet orders, particularly from British Telecom, British Rail and the Post Office, the HA van remained in production, ultimately using the later HC Viva&#x27;s engine and gearbox, all the way through to 1983.

===Bedford Beagle===

Although no factory built estate versions of the HA Viva were offered, a limited-production estate conversion by Martin Walter Ltd. of Folkestone, based on the closely related Bedford HA van, was marketed as the Bedford Beagle.
== HB Viva (1966–1970)==

The HB Viva, announced in September 1966 and sold by Vauxhall until 1970, was a larger car than the HA, featuring coke bottle styling, and was modelled after American General Motors (GM) models such as the Chevrolet Impala/Caprice of the period, and was a solely Vauxhall design — likewise Opel had also developed the equivalent Opel Kadett B with no platform sharing, unlike the previous generation. It featured the same basic engine as the HA, but enlarged to 1,159 cc, but with the added weight of the larger body the final drive gearing was reduced from 3.9 to 1 to 4.1 to keep the nippy performance (except the SL90 which retained the 3.9 diff having the power to cope with the higher ratio).

The automatic Viva HB was offered from February 1967, and fitted with the ubiquitous Borg Warner Type 35 system. Cars of this size featuring automatic transmission were still unusual owing to the amount of power the transmission systems absorbed: a major British motoring journal later described Viva HBs with automatic transmission as &quot;among the slowest cars on the road&quot;.

The HB used a completely different suspension design from the HA, having double-wishbone and coil springs with integrated telescopic dampers at the front, and trailing arms and coil springs at the rear. Lateral location and anti-squat of the rear axle was achieved using upper trailing arms mounted at approximately 45° fixed to lugs at the top of the differential. Both front and rear could also be fitted with optional anti-roll bars. The HB set new standards for handling in its class as a result of the adoption of this suspension design, where many of its contemporaries stuck with leaf springs and MacPherson struts.

This time, apart from the standard and 90 stages of tune, there was also, for a brief time, a Brabham SL/90 HB that was purported to have been developed with the aid of world racing champion Jack Brabham. Brabham models were marked out externally by distinctive lateral black stripes at the front of the bonnet that curved down the wings and then headed back to end in a taper at the front doors. This model is almost impossible to find today. This model and the Viva GT are the two most sought after models made. The Brabham model differed from the standard Viva SL/90 in having a different cam-shaft, uprated suspension with anti-roll bars, different exhaust manifolds, and a unique twin-carb manifold, as well as differing interior trim. The Viva GT had substantially different engine and running gear and interior from the standard Viva HB models. It was distinguished by having a black bonnet with twin louvres and being all-over white. Later GTs came in different colours.

Two larger overhead camshaft engines from the larger Vauxhall Victor were also offered – a twin carb 1975 cc in the Viva GT from Feb 1968 and a 1599 cc making up the Viva 1600 from May 1968.

With the expanded engine programme, the HB saw numerous permutations of model offerings, with base, deluxe and SL trims offered with a choice of standard 1.2, tuned 90 1.2, Brabham 90 1.2 and the aforementioned overhead cam units offered during its run. The Brabham was effectively replaced by the 1600, although many complained of high fuel consumption with this engine. Front disc brakes came with the 90 and overhead cam engine models, while a larger 12 gallon fuel tank was also part of the 1600 and GT package.

The brakes were problematic: a 1971 survey of passenger cars registered in Sweden during 1967 place the HB Viva at the top of a list of cars identified as having faulty brakes as part of an annual testing procedure. Problems were concentrated on uneven braking and dragging brakes, generally at the rear, and affected 26% of the cars tested. Second on the list, with 24% of cars triggering brake fault reports, was the similarly configured Opel Kadett estate. Although it avoided the bottom spot in other individual categories, the poor score achieved by the brakes left the Viva with the highest overall rate of failure of the 34 passenger cars included in sufficient numbers to feature in the reports of the Swedish test results.

Originally offered as just a two-door saloon, a three-door estate joined the HB range in June 1967, but the advent of the four-door in October 1968 saw the HB breaking sales records worldwide. The introduction of the four-door option coincided with various minor improvements to the interior trim, while &#x27;auxiliary&#x27; switches were relocated from a remote panel to positions nearer to the steering wheel. The GM &quot;energy absorbing&quot; steering column was now fitted to all models and the fuel tank capacity was increased from 8 to 12 British gallons (36 to 55 litres). The 4-door saloon was designed and engineered by Holden in Australia who exported it as a kit of parts back to Vauxhall in England.

In the later 1960s and early 1970s, Britain&#x27;s &quot;Motor&quot; magazine polled readers about their cars: they included a poll of HB Viva 1600 owners. The answers given greatest prominence were to the final question which asked whether or not respondents would buy another car of the same model: just 21% of Viva 1600 owning respondents answered &quot;yes&quot;, which was the lowest score for this question achieved by any of the first seventeen models for which surveys were conducted. By the time of the readership poll, the HB Viva was within a year of being replaced even though the 1600 version itself had only been offered since 1968, so the sample will have been relatively small: it appears that the low satisfaction rate may have reflected not so much the car&#x27;s design but rather a lack of effective quality control in the manufacturing processes.

A van version of the Viva HB was developed, but it never got beyond the prototype/mock-up stage. However, General Motors New Zealand did sell versions of the three-door estate with no rear seat as &#x27;van&#x27; models and continued this with the later HC version.

Aftermarket conversion specialists, Crayford, also ran off some convertibles based on the 2-door Viva. Very few of these conversions exist still, only two GT model HBs were converted, but both are known to survive, and will likely be on the show scene in the coming years.

===Other markets===
A variant of the HB Viva was also built in Australia, by Holden, from 1967 to 1969 and marketed there as the Holden HB Torana. Oddly enough despite being closer in physical location to Australia, all HB Vivas sold in New Zealand were produced from CKD kits imported from the UK and sold as Vauxhalls. The New Zealand Vivas were two- and four-door Deluxe saloons, the latter with the &#x27;90&#x27; engine. Automatic was not offered, nor was the SL trim. Some Deluxe Estates were also assembled locally along with a &#x27;van&#x27; version minus the estate&#x27;s rear seat.

The HB Viva entered the Canadian market for the 1967 model year, in standard, Deluxe, or SL models. Canadian Chevrolet/Oldsmobile dealers also continued to sell a rebadged HB as the Envoy Epic through 1970 while Pontiac/Buick dealers kept selling the car under its original name.

In South Africa, it was assembled locally. The GT model arrived there in mid-1969 and was available in a range of colours, unlike their British counterparts. The GT could be told by slim black stripes down the sides and a strip across the bonnet, as well as four exhaust tip and black paint in the area between the taillights. Power claimed was SAE.

566,391 Viva HBs were produced. Body design had improved after Vauxhall&#x27;s poor reputation with corrosion on previous models. The HB had better underbody protection, but UK cars were still prone to rusting through the front wings in the area behind the headlights where water, mud and salt could accumulate. This ongoing problem with salt on UK roads affected many makes and models, not just the Viva, but Vauxhall&#x27;s ongoing poor reputation for corrosion undoubtedly contributed to the development of bolt-on wings and wheel-arch liners in subsequent generations of family passenger car.
== HC Viva (1970–1979)==


The HC Viva (1970–79) was mechanically the same as the HB but had more modern styling and greater interior space due to redesigned seating and positioning of bulkheads. It offered two- and four-door saloons and a fastback estate with the choice of either standard 1159 cc, 90 tuned 1159 cc or 1600 cc overhead cam power. No 2.0 GT version was offered with the new range, although the 2.0 became the sole engine offering for Canada, where the HC became the Firenza, marketed by Pontiac/Buick dealers without the Vauxhall name. The cloned Envoy Epic was dropped as Chevrolet dealers now carried the domestic Chevrolet Vega. The HC was pulled from the Canadian market after two model years amidst consumer anger over corrosion and reliability issues.

The American influence was still obvious on the design, with narrow horizontal rear lamp clusters, flat dashboard with a &quot;letterbox&quot; style speedometer, and a pronounced mid bonnet hump that was echoed in the front bumper.

A coupé version called the Firenza was introduced in early 1971 to compete with the Ford Capri and forthcoming Morris Marina Coupé. It was available in deluxe and SL forms, with the latter sporting four headlights and finally resurrecting the missing 2.0 twin-carburettor engine from the HB Viva GT.

The basic 1159 cc engine was enlarged to 1256 cc in late 1971 and with this the 90 version was removed from the line-up.

The overhead cam engines were upgraded in early 1972, the 1.6 becoming a 1.8 (1759 cc) and the 2.0 (1975 cc) twin carburettor became a 2.3 (2279 cc). At this time, the Viva 2300 SL and Firenza Sport SL did away with the letter-box speedometer and substituted a seven-dial instrument pack. Firenza SLs had a two round-dial pack, though all other Vivas and Firenzas stuck with the original presentation.

In September 1973, the Viva range was divided, the entry 1256 cc models staying as Vivas, with the 1.8-litre engine an option on the Viva SL with an automatic transmission. The 1.8- and 2.3-litre models took on more luxurious trim and were rebadged as the Magnum. The whole range of Viva-based cars received safety equipment upgrades at the same time, with power-assisted dual-circuit brakes (with discs in front) being made standard. Safety belts, reclining front seats, two-speed windshield wipers, and undercoating were also made standard across the board. Additionally, the Firenza coupé was given a radical makeover with an aerodynamic nose and beefed up 2.3-litre twin carb engine mated to a ZF five-speed gearbox, turning it into the HP (High Performance) Firenza.

The Viva was again revised in 1975, with trim levels becoming the E (for Economy), L and SL. The E was Vauxhall&#x27;s answer to the Ford Popular and was first offered as a promotional edition two-door coupe using surplus Firenza body shells, before becoming a permanent Viva model in two-door saloon form. It was the only Viva to still have the strip speedometer after this as the L and SL adopted the Firenza SL&#x27;s two round dial set up. As of the autumn of 1975 the 1800 engine was also upgraded, increasing power from . In 1977–78, there was also a limited-edition ES model with a slightly improved specification over the E model.

For 1977, the SL was replaced by the GLS, essentially marrying the plusher Magnum trim and equipment with the base 1,256 cc pushrod ohv engine. These models all had the full seven dial instrument panel, velour seating and Rostyle wheels, among many other upgrades.

Viva production was scaled down after the launch of the Chevette in spring 1975. Originally a three-door hatchback (also sold as the Opel Kadett City), the Chevette later offered two- and four-door saloons and as of 1976 a three-door estate which all but usurped the Viva&#x27;s position as Vauxhall&#x27;s small car entry. Nonetheless, the Viva remained on sale until the latter part of 1979.

The Viva was effectively replaced by the new Vauxhall Astra, a variant of the front-wheel-drive Opel Kadett. By that time it was dated in comparison with more modern rivals like the Volkswagen Golf. Production ceased at a time when European manufacturers were making the transition from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the family car market.

The end of production of the HC Viva in 1979 marked a significant moment for Vauxhall, as it would ultimately prove to be the last car to be completely designed by the company with no input from Opel. The company&#x27;s next car — the 1972 Victor FE range — was based on the Opel Rekord D; albeit substantially modified by Vauxhall and ended up having little interchangeable content with the Opel car. However, subsequent models (such as the Chevette — an Opel Kadett C with a restyled front end and the HC Viva&#x27;s powertrain) would set the eventual precedent — that all future Vauxhall cars would be badge-engineered and German designed Opels, or in the case of the 2004 Vauxhall Monaro, a rebadged Holden.

The domestic market launch of the Viva HC coincided with one of the UK&#x27;s periodic surges of debt fueled economic growth, and the latest Viva became Vauxhall&#x27;s fastest selling new model of all time, chalking up its first 100,000 units in just months. 640,863 Viva HCs were produced,&lt;ref name=&quot;motorbase.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; making combined Viva production top the 1.5 million mark. The millionth Viva, a gold HC, was driven off the production line by politician John Eden amid much celebration on 20 July 1971. Although most Vivas were produced at Vauxhall&#x27;s Ellesmere Port plant in northern England, the company&#x27;s production lines were by the standards of the time flexible, and the millionth car was a product of the Luton factory. However, within seconds of the Millionth Viva&#x27;s completion at Luton, Ellesmere Port celebrated what was described – over-optimistically as matters turned out – as the first Viva of the second million.

In New Zealand, the Viva was originally built in two- or four-door saloon and estate/van form with 1,159 cc and 1256 cc engines. For a short time a special New Zealand only variant was produced, called Viva Score 7. This was originally intended to have a higher performance engine fitted, as a sports model, but the accountants stepped in and it became just a &quot;paint-job-and-trim&quot; special. It was available in three colour schemes of lime green, bright red/orange and bright yellow, with extensive black stripes and a prominent &quot;Score 7&quot; logo on the rear mudguards. A batch of 1.8-litre models, some with automatic transmission, was imported from the UK in 1973/4 when the government temporarily relaxed import restrictions on built-up cars as local CKD plants could not meet demand. The 1.8-litre engine and automatic transmission later were added to CKD assembly and the entire range was renamed Magnum in 1976. This had the four headlight nose and improved trim and equipment, such as a two-dial instrument pack and heated rear window, in a bid to overcome the Viva&#x27;s basic car image – its original place in the GM range now taken by a newly launched, wide range of locally-made 1.3-litre Chevettes — and slowing sales. The Magnum also had an 1800 engine option, often teamed with automatic transmission.

A version of the Viva HC, called the Chevrolet Firenza, was produced in South Africa beginning in September 1971. This local derivative offered the small British four or a locally built Chevrolet 2.5-litre engine. After a 1975 facelift and some changes to the lineup, these lost the &quot;Firenza&quot; badges and were sold simply as the Chevrolet 1300 and 1900, as the smaller 1960 cc version had replaced the earlier 2.5. The car was facelifted, with a new front design which mimicked that of the bigger Chevrolet 2500/3800/4100, with the grille protruding somewhat and being set apart from the headlights. The Firenza range originally consisted only of four-door saloons, but South Africa also saw a three-door hatch developed off this rather than taking on the then new Chevette/Kadett City; this was first shown in June 1976 and the first car rolled off the production line in August. This mixture used the T-car&#x27;s rear hatch and taillights, but was a Viva ahead of the B-pillars. The arch around the rear hatch opening was considerably stronger than the T-car&#x27;s, to suit local road conditions. Also, the was larger than one would expect from a car this size, to suit local road conditions and petrol sales restrictions. The split rear-seat folded down. With the new Chevrolet Chevair recently introduced, cost prohibitions made such a creation a better proposition than bringing in an all-new car.

Local parts content was high from the get-go, with some Hatch models reaching 71.15% right away. The car was long, 252 mm shorter than the saloon. Since the Hatch&#x27;s bodywork was a modification of an existing design, some compromises were necessary and the load area was particularly shallow. Another problem, common to all 1300/1900s, was the absence of a universal key — period road testers offered many complaints about requiring no less than four hard-to-tell keys.

The 1300 has Vauxhall&#x27;s 1256 cc engine, carried through from the Firenza, while the 1900 has a locally built 1960 cc Chevrolet cast-iron inline-four; a smaller version of the 2.5 seen earlier in the Firenza. At the time of introduction, the Weber carburetted manual 1900 claimed SAE and a top speed of for the Hatch. Automatics received a Rochester carburettor and more torque-oriented tuning; max power for this version is . The 1300 and 1900 were both available in De Luxe or LS trim, with a four-speed manual transmission and an available three-speed automatic for the 1900s. Claimed power outputs later dropped to for the 1300 and 1900 respectively; presumably these are net outputs unlike the earlier gross numbers.

===Firenza===
From 1971 to 1973, the Viva was sold in Canada as the &quot;Firenza&quot; through Pontiac dealers. While the HB used the Viva nameplate in Canada, the HC was renamed the &quot;Firenza&quot; in response to quality problems the previous generation Viva had, as well as to hide its British origins. The Firenza was plagued with significant quality problems which were made worse with the lack of availability of spare parts due to the frequent labour strikes in the UK at the time. Some of the Firenza&#x27;s common problems included brake failure and engine fires. In 1972, angry Firenza owners organized into the &quot;Dissatisfied Firenza Owners Association&quot; and engaged in public demonstrations to publicize the car&#x27;s quality problems and demand compensation from General Motors for repair costs and depreciation; the Firenza had become so toxic on the used car market that one year old examples with low mileage were worth less than a quarter of their MSRP and dealerships refused to take them as trade-ins. Multiple Firenzas caught on fire during a protest outside of the Canadian House of Commons. The protests, combined with reports of a 19-year-old woman perishing in an accident caused by her Firenza&#x27;s steering failing prompted intervention by the Canadian government, while GM denied the problems and attempted to protect the Firenza&#x27;s reputation through deceptive marketing before withdrawing it from the Canadian market in early 1973. The Disaffected Firenza Owners Association attempted to sue General Motors, but their lawsuit was unable to proceed as Canada didn&#x27;t have any laws establishing class-action lawsuits at the time, prompting Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to oversee their creation. The failure of the Firenza hurt Vauxhall, which considered Canada an important export market but was forced to withdraw from as a result. In a 2018 retrospective, &quot;Autofocus.ca&quot; described the Firenza as &quot;the worst car Canada ever saw&quot; and claimed that its obscurity outside of Canada is the only thing preventing it from being considered one of the all-time worst cars alongside the likes of the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, while also describing it as Canada&#x27;s equivalent of Ralph Nader and the Chevrolet Corvair.

===Grumett===

Several cars based on the Vauxhall Viva were produced from 1970 until 1976 by Grumett in Uruguay.

They came in different models, including a double-cab, two-door pick-up, with different Vauxhall and Opel engines. The body was fibreglass; some original Vauxhalls were imported to serve as moulds. Mechanicals were either Vauxhall or Opel, depending on the batch.
==Name revival==
In 2004, in cooperation with Lada manufacturer AutoVAZ, General Motors launched the GM-AvtoVAZ Chevrolet Viva in Russia. This was essentially a four-door Opel Astra G (the model which was introduced as a Vauxhall/Opel in 1998 and was produced until 2004).

The name was also used by Holden in Australia and New Zealand on versions of the Daewoo Lacetti and Nubira which were marketed as the Holden Viva.

The &quot;Viva&quot; name returned in 2015, as a Vauxhall model for the United Kingdom. This is based on the Korean designed and manufactured Chevrolet Spark, which was marketed as the Opel Karl in most of Europe, 2015–2019. It replaced the Vauxhall Agila. The Viva was discontinued in 2019.

<text>Calahorra (; ; ) is a municipality in the Spanish autonomous community and province of La Rioja. During Ancient Roman times, Calahorra was a municipium known as &quot;Calagurris Nassica Iulia&quot;.

==Location==
The city is located on a hill at an altitude of 358 metres at the confluence of the Ebro and Cidacos rivers, and has an area of 91.41 km². Calahorra is the second-largest city in La Rioja in population and importance, after the capital, Logroño. Its population is 23,923 people.

It is well-connected to other cities, especially by highway. It is situated in the Ebro valley, 48 kilometres from Logroño, 120 km from Zaragoza and 180 km from Bilbao, and is connected to these cities by national highway 232, the A-68 motorway (Vasco-Aragonesa) and the Bilbao-Zaragoza rail line.

Its daily bus services link it to such cities as Pamplona, Soria and San Sebastián.

Its status as seat of a &quot;comarca&quot; and judicial district make it a service-industry city in administrative, commercial and leisure fields.

== History ==
Calahorra has been inhabited since the Paleolithic, and its stable population dates to the Iron Age.

Rome conquered the town in 187 BC and brought it to its highest point of importance as an administrative centre for surrounding regions. Calahorra supported Quintus Sertorius in his war against Pompey, whom the city resisted successfully since 76 BC. It was only taken four years later by Pompey&#x27;s legate Lucius Afranius, after a lot of inhabitants had died from starvation and there had occurred cannibalism. Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar gave the city (then named &quot;Calagurris&quot;) numerous distinctions, converted it into a municipality, and developed its city planning, economy, and politics. Its archeological remains show that it had a circus, baths, an amphitheatre, and other services found in large cities. It minted money and served as a justice administration centre.

Quintilian, well known for his descriptions of the culture of that time, was born in Calahorra, and the Parador in the city is named after him. It has Roman ruins in the grounds. Saints Emeterius and Celedonius, martyred in the city around 305 AD, are the patron saints of the city, and the city&#x27;s coat of arms depict their names. The cathedral is dedicated to them. The Christian Roman poet Prudentius may have inhabited at some point in Calahorra, who pinpoints it on the territory of the Vascones in the 4th century.

After the rule of the Moors in the 9th and 10th centuries the Christian king García Sánchez III of Pamplona captured the city in 1045.

Calahorra was once home to one of the most ancient Jewish communities in Castile, dating to 1145 AD. In 1492, when the Jews were expelled, most left rather than become conversos. 

The population had reached 7,000 by the 1840s.

<text>F-19 is a skipped DoD designation in the Tri-Service fighter aircraft designation sequence which was thought by many popular media outlets to have been allocated to the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, but was actually skipped in favor of F-20 for the Northrop F-5G Tigershark at Northrop&#x27;s request to avoid confusion with the MiG-19.

==History==
Since the unification of the numbering system in 1962, U.S. fighters have been designated by consecutive numbers, beginning with the F-1 Fury. &quot;F-13&quot; was never assigned to a fighter due to triskaidekaphobia, though the designation had previously been used for a reconnaissance version of the B-29. After the F/A-18 Hornet, the next announced aircraft was the F-20 Tigershark. The USAF proposed the F-19 designation for the fighter, but Northrop requested the &quot;F-20&quot; instead. The USAF finally approved the F-20 designation in 1982. The truth behind this jump in numbers is that Northrop pressed the designation &quot;F-20&quot; as they wanted an even number, in order to stand out from the Soviet odd-numbered designations. Despite this, the designations YF-17 and YF-23 were not skipped (although F-20, YF-17 and YF-23 all were prototypes and did not enter production phase).

The United States received the first Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft in 1982. During the decade many news articles discussed what they called the &quot;F-19&quot;. The Testor Corporation produced an F-19 scale model. The company had decades of experience in producing highly detailed models that pilots and aerospace engineers purchased, and used its sources in the United States military and defense contractors. The &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Dan Rather and other media discussed the model after its January 1986 introduction. When the real stealth aircraft crashed in California in July 1986, news stories used the model to depict it. Representative Ron Wyden asked the chairman of Lockheed Corporation why an aircraft that Congressmen could not see was sold as model aircraft. The publicity helped to make the model the best-selling model aircraft of all time, but the model&#x27;s smooth contours bore little resemblance to the F-117 and its angular panels. The F-117 designation was publicly revealed with the actual aircraft in November 1988.

==Notable appearances in media==

* In 1986, the Testor Corporation released a model aircraft kit, calling it the &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot;. The kit is claimed to be the best-selling plastic model kit of all time.
* Like the Testor Corporation, Monogram models also released the &quot;F-19A Specter&quot; which was based on the design by Loral Inc.
* In his 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Tom Clancy featured the &quot;F-19A Ghostrider&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Frisbee&quot; by the pilots and crew) as a secret weapon used to combat a Soviet invasion of Germany. 
* An F-19 was the alternate mode of the Decepticon character Whisper in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Transformers&quot; comic book series during the era.
* The Toyline Ring Raiders, produced by Matchbox, made extensive use of the F19 and F19A on multiple occasions. The main hero Victor Vector flew a personal F19 named &quot;Victory 1&quot;! The antagonistic pilot Cutthroat used a F19A with the designation &quot;Bayonet&quot;. In the so-called &quot;Wing Packs&quot;, in which every main pilot got his own squadron, F19 and F19A fighters were part of many sets.
* The Testors F-19 appears briefly in the animated opening for the TV show &quot;Beyond 2000&quot;.
* The Tyco &quot;Fast Traxx&quot; remote control car from 1991 has a resemblance to the F-19 fighter jet.
* An F-19 appears in Dan Dare as a &quot;Mark Two Stealth low profile penetrator&quot;, flown at Space Fleet&#x27;s annual aerospace show by Colonel Dan Dare and nicknamed a &quot;mud mover&quot; by Digby. A modified &quot;F-19&quot; design with a retrofuturistic cockpit is also seen used as part of an airframe crash test demonstration at the show.
* MicroProse released the 1987 video game &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot; and the successor 1988/1990 game &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot;, both featuring an imagining of the F-19&#x27;s capabilities, with artwork based on the Testor Corporation model kit.
* In 1988, an F-19 was released in the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; toy line, called the &quot;X-19 Phantom&quot;. Included was a pilot codenamed Ghostrider. The &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; toy the &quot;Phantom X-19&quot; was loosely based on the Testor model.
* The 1990 videogame &quot;Air Diver&quot; featured an &quot;F-119D Stealth Fighter&quot; that strongly resembled the Monogram F-19 model.
*The 1989 video game &quot;David Wolf: Secret Agent&quot; involves the disappearance of the SF-2a &quot;Shadowcat&quot; stealth fighter, whose appearance was loosely based on the Testor model. The same happens in the 1990 game &quot;Operation Stealth&quot;.
*The videogame &quot;&quot; shows the F-19A Specter at an OCP expo center.
*The Alabama Air National Guard’s 117th Intelligence Squadron uses the F-19A Specter on their squadron logo.

<text>Whiteflies are Hemipterans that typically feed on the undersides of plant leaves. They comprise the family Aleyrodidae, the only family in the superfamily Aleyrodoidea. More than 1550 species have been described.

==Description and taxonomy==

The Aleyrodidae are a family in the suborder Sternorrhyncha and at present comprise the entire superfamily Aleyrodoidea, related to the superfamily Psylloidea. The family often occurs in older literature as &quot;Aleurodidae&quot;, but that is a junior synonym and accordingly incorrect in terms of the international standards for zoological nomenclature.

Aleyrodidae are small insects, most species with a wingspan of less than 3 mm and a body length of 1 mm to 2 mm. Many are so small that their size complicates their control in greenhouses because they can only be excluded by screening with very fine mesh; in fact they can enter mesh so fine that many of their natural enemies cannot come in after them, so that unchecked whitefly populations in greenhouses rapidly become overwhelming. Some &quot;giant whitefly&quot; species exist, some of which may exceed 5 mm in size. This sometimes is associated with sexual dimorphism in which one sex is markedly larger than the other. Such dimorphism is common in the Sternorrhyncha, in which the males of most scale insects for example are tiny compared to the female. Remarkably however, in some giant tropical species the males are much larger than the females.

Like most of the mobile Sternorrhyncha, adult Aleyrodidae have well-developed antennae, which in most species in this family are seven-segmented.

As in many Hemiptera, there are two ocelli, which generally in the Aleyrodidae are placed at the anterior margins of the compound eyes. The compound eyes themselves are rather remarkable: many have a distinct constriction between the upper and lower halves, and in some species there is a complete separation. Many insects&#x27; compound eyes are divided into functionally and anatomically distinct upper and lower regions, but the adaptation&#x27;s purpose or origin in Aleyrodidae is unclear. The degree of separation is useful in recognising the species; for instance, one way to tell adult &quot;Bemisia&quot; from &quot;Trialeurodes&quot; is that the upper and lower parts of the compound eyes are connected by a single ommatidium in &quot;Bemisia&quot;, while in &quot;Trialeurodes&quot; they are completely separate.

Both sexes have functional mouthparts and two pairs of membranous, functional wings; the rear wings are neither much reduced, nor modified into any such hooked or haltere-like structures as occur in some other Hemiptera such as many of the Coccoidea. The wing venation is reduced, like that of the Psyllidae, only generally much more so. In many genera there is only one conspicuous and unbranched vein in each wing; however, wings of larger species such as &quot;Udamoselis&quot; have less reduced venation, though their veins still are simple and few.

The insects and their wings are variously marked or mottled according to species, and many species are covered with fine wax powder, giving most species a floury, dusted appearance, hence names such as Aleyrodidae, Aleurodidae and &quot;Aleuroduplidens&quot;; the root refers to the (aleurodes) meaning &quot;floury&quot;. However, not all species are white; for example, &quot;Aleurocanthus woglumi&quot; is slaty black.

The legs of Aleyrodidae are well developed and fairly long, but gracile, and in contrast to Psyllidae, not adapted to leaping. The tarsi have two segments of roughly equal length. The pretarsus has paired claws, with an empodium between—in some species the empodium is a bristle, but in others it is a pad.

The digestive system of the Aleyrodidae is typical of the Sternorrhyncha, including a filter chamber, and all active stages of the Aleyrodidae accordingly produce large quantities of honeydew; the anus is adapted to presentation of honeydew to symbiotic species, mainly ants; the honeydew emerges from the anus, which is inside an opening called the on the dorsal surface of the caudal segment of the abdomen. This orifice is large and is covered by an operculum. The entire structure is characteristic of the Aleyrodidae and within the family it is taxonomically diagnostic because it varies in shape according to the species. Within the orifice beneath the operculum there is a tongue-like lingula. It appears to be involved in the expulsion of honeydew, and in fact at one time was wrongly assumed to be the organ that produced the honeydew. In some species it protrudes from beneath the operculum, but in others it normally is hidden.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest members of the family belong to the Mesozoic subfamily Bernaeinae, known from the Middle/Upper Jurassic-Upper Cretaceous, the oldest representatives of the extant subfamilies Aleyrodinae and Aleurodicinae appear during the Lower Cretaceous.

==Reproduction and metamorphosis==
The eggs of Aleyrodidae generally are laid near each other on the food plant, usually on a leaf, in spiral patterns or arcs, sometimes in parallel arcs. The egg is elongated, with one narrow end produced into a pedicel, which in some species is longer than the rest of the egg. After fertilisation the pedicel shrivels into a stalk.

The details vary, but at least some species can reproduce parthenogenically by automixis. However, apparently all males are parthenogenically produced by arrhenotoky. The female however, can mate with her own male offspring, and thereafter produce eggs of both sexes.

There generally are four larval instars. All the instars are more or less in the shape of a flattened ellipse fringed with bristles and waxy filaments. The first instar has functional legs, though short. Once it has inserted its stylets into the phloem to feed, it settles down and no longer uses its legs, and they degenerate after the first ecdysis. From then until it emerges as an adult, it remains attached to the plant by its mouthparts. The final instar feeds for a while, then undergoes changes within its skin, ceasing feeding and growing a new skin, forming what amounts to pupa. In doing so the insect does not shed the larval skin, which it retains as a protective puparium and which dries out. Meanwhile, the pupa within this skin develops into a pharate adult that usually is visible through the wall of the puparium. The puparium splits open as the imago forces its way out.

This pupal stage is analogous to the pupal forms of the Holometabola and it raises questions of terminology and concept. Some authorities argue that there is little functional, and no logically cogent basis for the distinction between the terms &quot;larva&quot; and &quot;nymph&quot;. Some have long been in favour of dropping the term nymph entirely, and certainly apply the term &quot;larvae&quot; to the Aleyrodidae.

==Agricultural threat==
In warm or tropical climates and especially in greenhouses, whiteflies present major problems in crop protection. Worldwide economic losses are estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

Prominent pest species include:
* &quot;Aleurocanthus woglumi&quot;, citrus blackfly, which, in spite of its color, is a whitefly that attacks citrus
* &quot;Aleyrodes proletella&quot;, cabbage whitefly, is a pest of various Brassica crops.
* &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot;, silverleaf whitefly, is a pest of many agricultural and ornamental crops.
* &quot;Trialeurodes vaporariorum&quot;, greenhouse whitefly, a major pest of greenhouse fruit, vegetables, and ornamentals 
Although several species of whitefly may cause some crop losses simply by sucking sap when they are very numerous, the major harm they do is indirect. Firstly, like many other sap-sucking Hemiptera, they secrete large amounts of honeydew that support unsightly or harmful infestations of sooty mold. Recent studies suggest that insecticides can also be excreted through the honeydew leading to unintended effects. Secondly, they inject saliva that may harm the plant more than either the mechanical damage of feeding or the growth of the fungi. However, by far their major importance as crop pests is their transmission of diseases of plants.

Although there are a great many species of whiteflies, and the family is notorious for devastating transmission of crop viruses, the actual proportion of whiteflies which are responsible is very low. The most prominent disease vectors among the Aleyrodidae are a species complex in the genus &quot;Bemisia&quot;. &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot; and &quot;B. argentifolii&quot; transmit African cassava mosaic, bean golden mosaic, bean dwarf mosaic, bean calico mosaic, tomato yellow leaf curl, tomato mottle, and other Begomoviruses, in the family Geminiviridae. The worldwide spread of emerging biotypes, such as &quot;B. tabaci&quot; biotype B, also known as, &#x27;B. argentifolii&#x27;, and a new biotype Q, continue to cause severe crop losses which are expected to increase, demanding matching increases in pesticide use on many crops (tomatoes, beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, potatoes, sweet potatoes). Efforts to develop environmentally friendly integrated pest management systems, with the goal of reducing insecticide use, aim to re-establish the ecological equilibrium of predators, parasitoids, and microbial controls that were once in place. New crop varieties are also being developed with increased tolerance to whiteflies, and to the plant diseases carried by them. A major problem is that whiteflies and the viruses they carry can infect many host plants, including agricultural crops, palms, and weeds. These problems are complicated by difficulties in classifying and detecting new whitefly biotypes and begomoviruses. Proper diagnosis of plant diseases depends on using sophisticated molecular techniques to detect and characterize the viruses and whiteflies which are present in a crop. A team of researchers, extension agents and growers working together are needed to follow disease development, using dynamic modeling, to understand the incidence of disease spread.

In 1997, tomato yellow leaf-curl begomovirus was discovered in Florida, USA. This is the worst viral disease transmitted by the whitefly, &quot;Bemisia argentifolii&quot;. The whitefly has also been shown to transmit almost 60 other viral plant diseases.

In 2023 flower plantations in Naga, Camarines Sur were infested by whiteflies. Eggplant crops in Baler, Aurora were also affected. In 2024, the locos Norte City Agriculture Office discovered cauliflower Aleyrodidae infestation in Laoag due to changing weather. 

===Damage by feeding===
Whiteflies feed by tapping into the phloem of plants, introducing toxic saliva and decreasing the plants&#x27; overall turgor pressure. Since whiteflies congregate in large numbers, susceptible plants can be quickly overwhelmed. Further harm is done by mold growth encouraged by the honeydew whiteflies secrete. This may also seriously impede the ability of farms to process cotton harvests.

Whiteflies share a modified form of hemimetabolous metamorphosis, in that the immature stages begin life as mobile individuals, but soon attach to host plants. The stage before the adult is called a pupa, though it shares little in common with the pupal stage of holometabolous insects.

===Control===

Whitefly control is difficult and complex, as whiteflies rapidly develop resistance to chemical pesticides. The USDA recommends &quot;an integrated program that focuses on prevention and relies on cultural and biological control methods when possible&quot;.
While an initial pesticide application may be necessary to control heavy infestations, repeated applications may lead to strains of whiteflies that are resistant to pesticides, so only use of selective insecticides is advised. Specific insecticide information and guidance for the fig whitefly is available from the University of Florida. Care should be taken to ensure that the insecticide used will not kill the natural predators of whiteflies. For effective use of biological method after application of pesticide, plant washing is advised prior to release of predators or parasitoids.

Pesticides used for whitefly control usually contain neonicotinoid compounds as active ingredients: clothianidin (commercial), dinotefuran (over-the-counter and commercial), imidacloprid (over-the-counter and commercial) and thiamethoxam (commercial). Neonicotinoids can be harmful if ingested. Rotation of insecticides from different families may be effective at preventing the building of tolerance to the product. Clothianidin and dinotefuran are of the same family. Spraying the leaves using insecticidal soap is another, environmentally friendly, option.

===Nonchemical means===
Biological methods have also been proposed to control whitefly infestation, and may be paired with chemical methods. Washing the plant, especially the undersides of leaves, may help reduce the number of the pests on the plants and make their management by other methods more effective. Whiteflies are also attracted by the color yellow, so yellow sticky paper can serve as traps to monitor infestations. Dead leaves or leaves that have been mostly eaten by whiteflies can be removed and burned or carefully placed in closed bins to avoid reinfestation and spreading of the disease.

Early detection in combination with hosing or vacuuming of diseased portions as well as removal of any section that is heavily infested. Pesticide use is not ideal in the case of controlling whitefly and widespread contamination can be costly; it is best to avoid this problem with aggressive preventive measures.

Several predators and parasitoids may be effective in controlling whitefly infestations, including green lacewings, ladybirds, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, &quot;Encarsia formosa&quot; and phytoseiid mites.

Integrated management of whiteflies can as well be done using biopesticides based on microbials such as &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; (effective on larvae and adults) or &quot;Isaria fumosorosea&quot;.

Green lacewing larvae have voracious appetites, so will attack whiteflies, as well as other pests, including aphids, mealybugs, spider mites, leafhopper larvae, moth eggs, scales, and thrips. They also can attack other insects, including caterpillars. They are available as eggs from commercial insectaries, and will stay in a larval stage after they hatch for one to three weeks. The adult insects can fly and will feed only on pollen, honey, and nectar to reproduce. Repeated application may be necessary and the eggs could be eaten before they hatch by their natural predators, such as ants or mature green lacewings.

Ladybirds are also used. They eat mostly insect eggs, but will also feed on beetle larvae, aphids, scale insects, and young caterpillars. Adults are often collected when in a dormant state in the wild and shipped for use in pest control; however, they may not stay in the location where they are released. They do live for about a year and will continuously lay eggs and reproduce. Spraying the bugs&#x27; wings with a sticky substance before release may hinder their ability to fly.

Some promising claims have been made that mesh or film that excludes ultraviolet of certain wavelengths from a greenhouse interfere severely with the ability of whitefly and various other greenhouse pests, to find their food plants. It is not yet clear, assuming that the effect is substantially of value, how readily pests in such circumstances might develop behavioural tolerance to such control measures.

====Companion plants====
A number of plants can be intercropped with vegetables, in a garden setting, serving as companion plants to protect against whiteflies.

For example, nasturtiums are thought to provide a defense to gooseberries or tomatoes. They provide root chemicals that deter whiteflies.

A study intercropping French marigolds with short-vine tomatoes in glasshouse growing conditions achieved some control of whiteflies when the plants were grown together from the beginning of the growing season; however, limonene dispensers were more effective.

Zinnias, conversely, attract predators that consume whiteflies, including hummingbirds and predatory wasps and flies. Other plants with a similar function include the hummingbird bush, pineapple sage, and bee balm. Each of these plants also conceals the scent of nearby plants, making their detection by some pest insects more difficult, as do most other mints.

<doc id="230910" wikidata="Q458874" url="?curid=230910" title="Natacha Rambova">
<text>Natacha Rambova (born Winifred Kimball Shaughnessy; January 19, 1897 – June 5, 1966) was an American film costume designer, set designer, and occasional actress who was active in Hollywood in the 1920s. In her later life, she abandoned design to pursue other interests, specifically Egyptology, a subject on which she became a published scholar in the 1950s.

Rambova was born into a prominent family in Salt Lake City who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She was raised in San Francisco and educated in England before beginning her career as a dancer, performing under Russian ballet choreographer Theodore Kosloff in New York City. She relocated to Los Angeles at age 19, where she became an established costume designer for Hollywood film productions. It was there she became acquainted with actor Rudolph Valentino, with whom she had a two-year marriage from 1923 to 1925. Rambova&#x27;s association with Valentino afforded her a widespread celebrity typically afforded to actors. Although they shared many interests such as art, poetry and spiritualism, his colleagues felt that she exercised too much control over his work and blamed her for several expensive career flops.

After divorcing Valentino in 1925, Rambova operated her own clothing store in Manhattan before moving to Europe and marrying the aristocrat Álvaro de Urzáiz in 1932. It was during this time that she visited Egypt and developed a fascination with the country that remained for the rest of her life. Rambova spent her later years studying Egyptology and earned two Mellon Grants to travel there and study Egyptian symbols and belief systems. She served as the editor of the first three volumes of &quot;Egyptian Religious Texts and Representations&quot; (1954–7) by Alexandre Piankoff, also contributing a chapter on symbology in the third volume. She died in 1966 in California of a heart attack while working on a manuscript examining patterns within the texts in the Pyramid of Unas.

Rambova has been noted by fashion and art historians for her unique costume designs that drew on and synthesized a variety of influences, as well as her dedication to historical accuracy in crafting them. Academics have also cited her interpretive contributions to the field of Egyptology as significant. In popular culture, Rambova has been depicted in several films and television series, figuring significantly in the Valentino biopics &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot; (1975), in which she was portrayed by Yvette Mimieux, and Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977) by Michelle Phillips. She was also featured in a fictionalized narrative in the network series &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot; (2015), portrayed by Alexandra Daddario.

==Early life==
Rambova was born Winifred Kimball Shaughnessy on January 19, 1897, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Her father, Michael Shaughnessy, was an Irish Catholic from New York City who fought for the Union during the American Civil War and then worked in the mining industry. Her mother, Winifred Shaughnessy (née Kimball), was the granddaughter of Heber C. Kimball, a member of the first presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and was raised in a prominent Salt Lake City family. At her father&#x27;s wishes, Rambova was baptized a Catholic at the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City in June 1897, though she later was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the urging of her mother at age eight.

Rambova&#x27;s parents had a tumultuous relationship: Her father was an alcoholic, and often sold her mother&#x27;s possessions to pay off gambling debts. This led Winifred (senior) to divorce Shaughnessy in 1900 and relocate with Rambova to San Francisco. There, she remarried to Edgar de Wolfe in 1907. During her childhood, Rambova spent summer vacations at the Villa Trianon in Le Chesnay, France with Edgar&#x27;s sister, the French designer Elsie de Wolfe. The marriage between Winifred (senior) and Edgar de Wolfe was short-lived, and she again remarried, this time to millionaire perfume mogul Richard Hudnut. Rambova was adopted by her new stepfather, making her legal name Winifred Hudnut. Rambova was given the nickname &quot;Wink&quot; by her aunt Teresa to distinguish her from her mother because of their shared name. She also sometimes went by Winifred de Wolfe, after her former step-aunt Elsie, with whom she maintained a relationship after her mother&#x27;s divorce from Edgar.

A rebellious teenager, Rambova was sent by her mother to Leatherhead Court, a boarding school in Surrey, England. In her schooling, she became fascinated by Greek mythology, and also proved especially gifted at ballet. After seeing Anna Pavlova in a production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in Paris with her former step-aunt Elsie, Rambova decided she wanted to pursue a career as a ballerina. Her family had encouraged her to study ballet purely as a social grace, and were appalled when she chose it as her career. Her aunt Teresa, however, was supportive, and took Rambova to New York City, where she studied under the Russian ballet dancer and choreographer Theodore Kosloff in his Imperial Russian Ballet Company. While dancing under Kosloff, she adopted the Russian-inspired stage name Natacha Rambova. Standing at , Rambova was too tall to be a classical ballerina, but was given leading parts by the then-32-year-old Kosloff, who soon became her lover. Rambova&#x27;s mother was outraged upon discovering the affair as Rambova was 17 years old at the time, and she tried to have Kosloff deported on statutory rape charges. Rambova retaliated against her mother by fleeing abroad, and her mother ultimately agreed to her continuing to perform with the company.

==Career==
===Design in film===

Around 1917, Kosloff was hired by Cecil B. DeMille as a performer and costume designer for DeMille&#x27;s Hollywood films, after which he and Rambova relocated from New York to Los Angeles. Rambova carried out much of the creative work as well as the historical research for Kosloff, and he then stole her sketches and claimed credit for these as his own. When Kosloff started work for fellow-Russian film producer Alla Nazimova at Metro Pictures Corporation (later MGM) in 1919, he sent Rambova to present some designs. Nazimova requested some alterations, and was impressed when Rambova was able to make these changes immediately in her own hand. Nazimova offered Rambova a position on her production staff as an art director and costume designer, proposing a wage of up to USD $5,000 per picture (). Rambova immediately began working for Nazimova on the comedy film &quot;Billions&quot; (1920), for which she supplied the costumes and served as art director. She also designed the costumes for two Cecil DeMille films in 1920: &quot;Why Change Your Wife?&quot; and &quot;Something to Think About&quot;. The following year, she served as the art director on the DeMille production &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; (1921), in which she designed (with Mitchell Leisen) an elaborate costume for a Cinderella-inspired fantasy sequence.

While working on her second project for Nazimova—&quot;Aphrodite&quot;, which never was filmed—Rambova revealed to Kosloff that she planned on leaving him. During the ensuing argument, he attempted to kill her, shooting at her with a shotgun. The gun fired into Rambova&#x27;s leg, and the bullet lodged above her knee. Rambova fled the Hollywood apartment she shared with Kosloff to the set of &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, where a cameraman helped her remove the birdshot from her leg. Despite the nature of the incident, she continued to live with Kosloff for some time.

Stylistically, Rambova favored designers such as Paul Poiret, Léon Bakst, and Aubrey Beardsley. She specialized in &quot;exotic&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; effects in both costume and stage design. For costumes she favored bright colors, baubles, bangles, shimmering draped fabrics, sparkles, and feathers. She also strived for historical accuracy in her costume and set designs. As noted in &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot;″s review of 1917&#x27;s &quot;The Woman God Forgot&quot; (Rambova&#x27;s first film project): &quot;To the student of history the accuracy of the exteriors, interiors, costumes, and accessories ... [the film] will make strong appeal.&quot;

===Relationship with Rudolph Valentino===
In 1921, Rambova was introduced to actor Rudolph Valentino on the set of Nazimova&#x27;s &quot;Uncharted Seas&quot; (1921). She and Valentino subsequently worked together on &quot;Camille&quot; (1921), a film that was a financial failure and resulted in Metro Pictures terminating their contract with Nazimova. While making the film, however, Rambova and Valentino became romantically involved. Although Valentino was still married to American film actress Jean Acker, he and Rambova moved in together within a year, having formed a relationship based more on friendship and shared interests than on emotional or professional rapport. They then had to pretend to separate until Valentino&#x27;s divorce was finalized, and married on May 13, 1922, in Mexicali, Mexico, an event described by Rambova as &quot;wonderful ... even though it did cause many worries and heartaches later.&quot; However, the law required a year to pass before remarriage, and Valentino was jailed for bigamy, having to be bailed out by friends. They legally remarried on March 14, 1923, in Crown Point, Indiana.

Both Rambova and Valentino were spiritualists, and they frequently visited psychics and took part in séances and automatic writing. Valentino wrote a book of poetry, entitled &quot;Daydreams&quot;, with many poems about Rambova. When it came to domestic life, Valentino and Rambova turned out to hold very different views. Valentino cherished Old World ideals of a woman being a housewife and mother, while Rambova was intent on maintaining a career and had no intention of being a housewife. Valentino was known as an excellent cook, while actress Patsy Ruth Miller suspected Rambova didn&#x27;t know &quot;how to make burnt fudge,&quot; although the truth was she did occasionally bake and was an excellent seamstress. Valentino wanted children, but Rambova did not.
While her association with Valentino lent Rambova a celebrity typically afforded to actors, their professional collaborations showed-up their differences more than their similarities, and she did not contribute to any of his successful films in spite of serving as his manager. In &quot;The Young Rajah&quot; (1922) she designed authentic Indian costumes that tended to compromise his Latin lover image, and the film was a major flop. She also supported his one-man strike against Famous Players–Lasky, which left him temporarily banned from movie work. In the interval, they performed a promotional dance-tour for Mineralava Beauty Products, to keep his name in the spotlight, though when they reached her hometown of Salt Lake City, and she was billed as &quot;The Little Pigtailed Shaughnessy Girl&quot;, Rambova was deeply insulted. In 1923, Rambova helped design the costumes for friend Alla Nazimova in &quot;Salomé&quot;, inspired by the work of Aubrey Beardsley. Beginning in February 1924, she accompanied Valentino on a trip abroad that was profiled in twenty-six installments published in &quot;Movie Weekly&quot; over the course of six months.

Rambova&#x27;s later work with Valentino was characterised by elaborate and costly preparations for films that either flopped or never manifested. These included &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;, &quot;The Sainted Devil&quot;, and &quot;The Hooded Falcon&quot; (a film that Rambova co-wrote, but was never realized). By this time, critics and the press were beginning to blame Rambova&#x27;s excessive control for these failures. United Artists went so far as to offer Valentino an exclusive contract with the stipulation that Rambova had no negotiating power, and was disallowed from even visiting the sets of his films. After this, Rambova was offered $30,000 to create a film of her choosing, which resulted in the production of &quot;What Price Beauty?&quot;, a drama which she co-produced and co-wrote. In 1925, Rambova and Valentino separated, and an acrimonious divorce ensued.

After the divorce proceedings began, Rambova moved on to other ventures: On March 2, 1926, she patented a doll she had designed with a &quot;combined coverlet&quot;, and also produced and starred in her own picture, &quot;Do Clothes Make the Woman?&quot; with Clive Brook (now lost). However, the distributor took the opportunity to bill her as &#x27;Mrs. Valentino&#x27; and changed the title to &quot;When Love Grows Cold&quot;; Rambova was horrified by the title change. The film did garner press due to it being Rambova&#x27;s first screen credit, however. An Oregon newspaper teased before a screening: &quot;Natacha Rambova (Mrs. Rudolph Valentino) ... So much has been written of this remarkable lady who won and lost the heart of the great Valentino that everyone wants to see her. Tonight is your opportunity to do so.&quot; The film, however, was not well received by critics; a review in &quot;Picture Play&quot; deemed the film &quot;the poorest picture of the month, or of almost any month, for that matter,&quot; adding: &quot;The interiors are bad, the costumes atrocious. Miss Rambova is not well dressed, nor does she film well, in the slightest degree.&quot; After its release, Rambova never worked in film, on or offscreen, again. Three months later, Valentino died unexpectedly of peritonitis, leaving Rambova inconsolable, and she purportedly locked herself in her bedroom for three days. Though she did not attend his funeral, she sent a telegram to Valentino&#x27;s business manager George Ullman, requesting he be buried in her family crypt at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx (a request Ullman denied).

===Writing and fashion design===
After Valentino&#x27;s death, Rambova relocated to New York City. There, she immersed herself in several endeavors, appearing in vaudeville at the Palace Theatre and writing a semi-fictional play entitled &quot;All that Glitters&quot;, which detailed her relationship with Valentino, and concluded in a fictionalized happy reconciliation. She also published the 1926 memoir, &quot;Rudy: An Intimate Portrait by His Wife Natacha Rambova&quot;, which contains memories of her life with him. The following year, a second memoir was published entitled &quot;Rudolph Valentino Recollections&quot; (a variation of &quot;Rudy: An Intimate Portrait&quot;), in which she prefaces an addended final chapter by asking that only those &quot;ready to accept the truth&quot; read on; what follows is a detailed letter supposedly communicated by Valentino&#x27;s spirit from an astral plane, which Rambova claimed to have received during an automatic writing session. While residing in New York, she frequently arranged séances with medium George Wehner, and claimed to have made contact with Valentino&#x27;s spirit on several occasions. Rambova also appeared in supporting parts in two original 1927 Broadway productions: &quot;Set a Thief&quot;, a drama written by Edward E. Paramore, Jr., and &quot;Creoles&quot;, a comedy written by Kenneth Perkins and Samuel Shipman. 
In June 1928, she opened an elite couture shop on Fifth Avenue and West 55th street in Manhattan, which sold Russian-inspired clothing that Rambova herself designed. Her clientele included Broadway and Hollywood actresses such as Beulah Bondi and Mae Murray. On opening the shop, she commented: &quot;I&#x27;m in business, not exactly because I need the money, but because it enables me to give vent to an artistic urge.&quot; In addition to clothing, the shop also carried jewelry, although it is unknown if it was designed by Rambova or imported. By late 1931, Rambova had grown uneasy about the economic situation of the United States during the Great Depression, and feared the country would experience a drastic revolution. This led her to close her shop and formally retire from commercial fashion design, leaving the United States to live in Juan-les-Pins, France in 1932. On a yacht cruise to the Balearic Islands, she met her second husband Álvaro de Urzáiz, a British-educated Spanish aristocrat, whom she married in 1932. They lived together on the island of Mallorca and restored abandoned Spanish villas for tourists, a venture financed by Rambova&#x27;s inheritance from her stepfather.

It was during her marriage to Urzáiz that Rambova first toured Egypt in January 1936, visiting the ancient monuments in Memphis, Luxor, and Thebes. While there, she met archeologist Howard Carter, and became fascinated by the country and its history, which had a profound effect on her. &quot;I felt as if I had at last returned home,&quot; she said. &quot;The first few days I was there I couldn&#x27;t stop the tears streaming from my eyes. It was not sadness, but some emotional impact from the past – a returning to a place once loved after too long a time.&quot; Upon returning to Spain, Urzáiz became a naval commander for the pro-fascist nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. Rambova fled the country to a familial château in Nice, where she suffered a heart attack at age forty. Soon after, she and Urzáiz separated. Rambova remained in France until the Nazi invasion in June 1940, upon which she returned to New York.

=== Egyptology and scholarly work===
Rambova&#x27;s interest in the metaphysical evolved significantly during the 1940s, and she became an avid supporter of the Bollingen Foundation, through which she believed she could see a past life in Egypt. Rambova was also a follower of Helena Blavatsky and George Gurdjieff, and she conducted classes in her Manhattan apartment about myths, symbolism, and comparative religion. She also began publishing articles on healing, astrology, yoga, post-war rehabilitation, and numerous other topics, some of which appeared in &quot;American Astrology&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. In 1945, the Old Dominion (a predecessor to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) awarded Rambova a grant-in-aid of USD $500 for &quot;making a collection of essential cosmological symbols for a proposed archive of comparative universal symbolism.&quot; Rambova intended to use her research to generate a book, which she wanted Ananda Coomaraswamy to write, with the principal themes derived from astrology, theosophy, and Atlantis. In an undated letter to Mary Mellon, she wrote:


Rambova&#x27;s intellectual investment in Egypt also led her to undertake work deciphering ancient scarabs and tomb inscriptions, which she began researching in 1946. Initially, she believed she would find evidence of a connection between ancient Egyptian belief systems and those of ancient American cultures. While researching at the Institut Français d&#x27;Archéologie Orientale in Cairo, she met the institute&#x27;s director, Alexandre Piankoff, with whom she established a rapport based on their shared interest in Egyptology. Piankoff introduced her to his French translation of the Book of Caverns, a royal funerary text, which he was working on at the time. &quot;To my amazement, I found that it contains all the most important esoteric material,&quot; Rambova wrote. &quot;I can only compare it to the Coptic &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, the Tibetan &quot;Voice of the Silence&quot;, and the Hindu Sutras of Patanjali. It is what I have been looking for for years.&quot;

Her interest in the Book of Caverns led her to abandon her studies of scarabs, and she began translating Piankoff&#x27;s French translation into English, an endeavor she felt &quot;was the main purpose and point&quot; of her studies in Egypt. She secured a second two-year grant of US$50,000 through the Mellon and Bollingen Foundations (a considerably large grant for the time) to help Piankoff photograph and publish his work on the Book of Caverns. In the winter of 1949–50, she joined Piankoff and Elizabeth Thomas in Luxor to undertake further studies. In the spring of 1950, the group was given permission to photograph and study inscriptions on golden shrines that had once enclosed the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, after which they toured the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara.

After completing the expedition in Egypt, Rambova returned to the United States, where, in 1954, she donated her extensive collection of Egyptian artifacts (accumulated over years of research) to the University of Utah&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts (UMFA). She settled in New Milford, Connecticut, where she spent the following several years working as an editor on the first three volumes of Piankoff&#x27;s series &quot;Egyptian Texts and Religious Representations&quot;, which was based on the research he had done with Rambova and Thomas. The first volume was &quot;The Tomb of Ramesses VI&quot; published in 1954, followed by &quot;The Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amon&quot; in 1955. During this time, she kept regular correspondence with fellow Egyptologists William C. Hayes and Richard Parker.

For the third volume of Piankoff&#x27;s series, &quot;Mythological Papyri&quot; (published in 1957), Rambova contributed her own chapter in which she discussed semiotics in Egyptian papyri. Rambova continued to write and research intensely into her sixties, often working twelve hours per day. In the years prior to her death, she was working on a manuscript examining texts from the Pyramid of Unas for a translation by Piankoff. This manuscript, which exceeds a thousand pages, was donated to the Brooklyn Museum after her death. Two additional manuscripts were also left behind, which are part of Yale University&#x27;s Yale in Egypt collection: &quot;The Cosmic Circuit: Religious Origins of the Zodiac&quot; and &quot;The Mystery Pattern in Ancient Symbolism: A Philosophic Interpretation&quot;.

==Later life and death==
In the early 1950s Rambova developed scleroderma, which significantly affected her throat, impeding her ability to swallow and speak.

In 1957, Rambova moved to New Milford, Connecticut, and devoted her time to researching a comparative study of ancient religious symbolism, which she continued virtually unabated until her death.

She grew delusional, believing that she was being poisoned, and quit eating, resulting in malnourishment. On September 29, 1965, she was discovered going &quot;berserk&quot; in a hotel elevator in Manhattan. Rambova was admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital, where she was diagnosed with paranoid psychosis brought on by malnutrition.

With her health in rapid decline, Rambova&#x27;s cousin, Ann Wollen, relocated her from her home in Connecticut to California, in order to help take care of her. There, Rambova was admitted to Methodist Hospital in Arcadia. On January 19, 1966 (her 69th birthday), she was relocated to a nursing home at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena. She died there six months later of a heart attack on June 5, 1966, at the age of 69. At her wishes, Rambova was cremated, and her ashes were scattered in a forest in northern Arizona.

==Claims regarding personal life==

Claims that Rambova was bisexual or homosexual date back to at least 1975 when they appeared in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s notoriously libelous &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, in which it is written that Rambova claimed to have never consummated her marriage with Rudolph Valentino. This has led some historians to refer to the couple&#x27;s union as a &quot;lavender marriage.&quot; The claim, however, is at odds with the grounds of Valentino&#x27;s 1922 arrest after the couple&#x27;s wedding: he was arrested and jailed for consummating the marriage in Palm Springs, California despite still being legally married to Jean Acker. Discussion of Rambova&#x27;s sexuality continued to appear in academic and biographical texts throughout the 1980s and beyond.

The basis of the claim is an alleged relationship Rambova had with Alla Nazimova, her friend and peer while Rambova was beginning her career in film design. Similar inferences have been made about others in Nazimova&#x27;s social circle, including Marlene Dietrich, Eva Le Gallienne, and Greta Garbo.

Whether Rambova was bisexual or homosexual is unclear; some have disputed such claims, including journalist David Wallace, who dismisses it as rumor in his 2002 book &quot;Lost Hollywood&quot;. Biographer Morris also disputes the claim, writing in his epilogue of &quot;Madam Valentino&quot; that &quot;the convenient ... allegation that Rambova was a lesbian collapses when one scrutinizes the facts.&quot; Additionally, a close friend of writer Mercedes de Acosta (also an alleged lover of Nazimova) told Morris that she believed Rambova and Nazimova&#x27;s relationship was nothing other than platonic. Rambova&#x27;s friend Dorothy Norman also stated that Rambova had been &quot;displeased&quot; by De Acosta&#x27;s controversial 1960 autobiography, which implied she was bisexual or homosexual, as it had &quot;cast her in an improper light.&quot; In his 1996 book &quot;The Silent Feminists&quot;, Anthony Slide stated that &quot;all who [knew] Rambova deny that she was a gay woman.&quot;

==Cultural significance==
===Design and fashion===

Rambova was one of the few women in Hollywood during the 1920s to serve as a head art designer in film productions. At the time, her costume and set designs were considered &quot;highly stylized,&quot; and divided opinion among critics. A 1925 &quot;Picture Play&quot; magazine profile on &quot;What Price Beauty?&quot; noted the &quot;bizarre&quot; effects present, adding: &quot;Miss Rambova insists the picture will be popular in its appeal, and not, as one might think, &quot;arty.&quot; Rambova&#x27;s sets incorporated shimmering shades of silver and white against sharp &quot;moderne&quot;&quot; lines, and blended elements of Bauhaus and Asian-inspired geometries.

Commenting on her career in film, design historian Robert La Vine proclaimed Rambova one of the &quot;most inventive designers ... ever,&quot; also noting her as one of few who crafted both sets and costumes. Film historian Robert Klepper wrote of her designs in &quot;Camille&quot; (1921): &quot;In evaluating the film today, one has to give art director Natacha Rambova her due credit for her vision as an artist. The deco sets are beautiful, and the ultra modern design was far ahead of its time. Although Rambova may have influenced her future husband Valentino to make some bad business decisions, her talent as an artist cannot be denied.&quot; Historian Pat Kirkham also praised her contributions to film, writing that she created &quot;some of the most visually unified films in Hollywood history.&quot; Costume historian Deborah Landis named Rambova&#x27;s white rubberized tunic (worn by Alla Nazimova) and the Art Deco-inspired imagery of &quot;Salome&quot; (1922) among the &quot;most memorable in motion picture history.&quot;
Though her work in both set and costume design has been deemed influential by film and fashion historians alike, Rambova herself claimed to &quot;loathe fashion,&quot; adding: 

Thus, Rambova&#x27;s approach to fashion design in her post-film career was conscious of the individual, a practice which fashion historian Heather Vaughan suggests was carried over from her past designing movie costumes for &quot;individual character types.&quot; Vaughan adds: &quot;While not necessarily an innovator of fashion, her Hollywood cachet and ability to synthesize fashion and traditional cultures allowed her to create designs and a personal style that continues to fascinate.&quot;

Rambova&#x27;s clothing designs drew on various influences, described by fashion critics as blending and re-working elements of Renaissance, 18th-century, Oriental, Grecian, Russian, and Victorian fashion. Common preferences in her work included the dolman sleeve, long skirts with high waists, premium velvets, and intricate embroidery, as well as incorporation of geometric shapes and use of &quot;vivid colors ... that are violent and definite. Scarlets, vermilions, strong blues, [and] blazoning purples.&quot; She was cited as influential by several designers with whom she worked, including Norman Norell, Adrian, and Irene Sharaff. Rambova typically dressed in the style of her designs, and thus her personal style was also influential: She often wore her hair in coiled &quot;ballerina style&quot; braids, sometimes covered in a headscarf or turban, with dangling earrings and calf-length velvet or brocade skirts. Actress Myrna Loy once proclaimed Rambova the &quot;most beautiful woman she&#x27;d ever seen.&quot; In 2003, Rambova was posthumously inducted into the Costume Designers&#x27; Guild Hall of Fame.

===Scholarly influence===
Rambova&#x27;s scholarly work has been regarded as significant by contemporary academics in the fields of Egyptology and history: archaeologist Barbara Lesko notes that her contribution to Piankoff&#x27;s &quot;Mythological Papyri&quot; &quot;demonstrates her organizational skills and her commitment to searching out truths and does not reek of unfounded theories or other eccentricity.&quot; Rambova&#x27;s research, specifically her metaphysical interpretations of texts, has been deemed useful by Egyptologists Rudolph Anthes, Edward Wente, and Erik Hornung. In the 1950s, Rambova donated her extensive collection of Egyptian artifacts to the University of Utah, displayed in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts&#x27;s Natacha Rambova Collection of Egyptian Antiquities. Both Rambova and her mother were credited as &quot;vital&quot; to the establishment of the museum through their donations of paintings, furniture, and artifacts.

==Depictions in art and film==
Rambova has been depicted across several mediums, including visual art, film, and television: She was the subject of a 1925 painting by Serbian artist Paja Jovanović (donated by her mother to the UMFA in 1949). In 1975, she was portrayed by Yvette Mimieux in Melville Shavelson&#x27;s television film &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot; (1975), and again by Michelle Phillips in Ken Russell&#x27;s feature film &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977). Ksenia Jarova later portrayed her in the American silent film &quot;Silent Life&quot; (2016), and she also figured in a fictionalized narrative in the network series &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot; (2015), played by Alexandra Daddario.

<doc id="230914" wikidata="Q2578494" url="?curid=230914" title="Culture of Bhutan">
<text>Cradled in the folds of the Himalayas, Bhutan has relied on its geographical isolation to protect itself from outside cultural influences. A sparsely populated country bordered by India to the south, and China to the north, Bhutan has long maintained a policy of strict isolationism, both culturally and economically, with the goal of preserving its cultural heritage and independence. Only in the last decades of the 20th century were foreigners allowed to visit the country, and only then in limited numbers. In this way, Bhutan has successfully preserved many aspects of its culture, which dates directly back to the mid-17th century.

Modern Bhutanese culture derives from ancient culture. This culture affected the early growth of this country. Dzongkha and Sharchop, the principal Bhutanese languages, are closely related to Tibetan, and Bhutanese monks read and write the ancient variant of the Tibetan language, known as &quot;chhokey&quot;. The Bhutanese are physically similar to the Tibetans, but history does not record when they crossed over the Himalayas and settled in the south-draining valleys of Bhutan. Both Tibetans and Bhutanese revere the tantric guru, Padmasambhava, the founder of Himalayan Buddhism in the 8th century.

==Religion==


Bhutanese society is centered around the practice of Buddhism, which is the main religion. Religious beliefs are evidenced in all aspects of life. Prayer flags flutter on hillsides, offering up prayers to benefit all nearby sentient beings. Houses each fly a small white flag on the roof indicating the owner has made his offering payments to appease the local god. Each valley or district is dominated by a huge &quot;dzong&quot;, or high-walled fortress which serves the religious and administrative center of the district.

Approximately 23% of the population is Hindu. There is a small Muslim population in Bhutan, covering 0.2% of the whole country&#x27;s population. Overall, 75% of the population is Buddhist, and 0.4% other religions.

===Religious festivals===
Once every year, a dzong or most important village may hold a religious festival, or &quot;Tsechu&quot;. Villagers from the surrounding district come for several days of religious observances and socializing while contributing auspicious offerings to the lama or monastery of the festival. The central activity is a fixed set of religious mask dances, or &quot;cham&quot;, held in a large courtyard. 

Each individual dance takes up to several hours to complete and the entire set may last two to four days. Observation of the dances directly blesses the audience and also serves to transmit principles of Tantric Buddhism to the villagers. A number of the dances can be traced directly back to Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal himself, the founder of Bhutan, and have been passed down essentially unchanged since the mid-17th century.

Prior to dawn on the final day of the tsechu a huge tapestry, or &quot;thongdrel&quot;, is unfurled in the courtyard of the dzong for several hours. The mere sight of it is believed to bring spiritual liberation. The thongdrel is rolled up before the rays of the morning sun can strike it.

===The monastery===

Monks join the monastery at six to nine years of age and are immediately placed under the discipleship of a headmaster. They learn to read &quot;chhokey&quot;, the language of the ancient sacred texts, as well as Dzongkha and English. Eventually they will choose between two possible paths: to study theology and Buddhist theory, or take the more common path of becoming proficient in the rituals and personal practices of the faith.

The daily life of the monk is austere, particularly if they are stationed at one of the monasteries located high in the mountains. At these monasteries food is often scarce and must be carried up by the monks or their visitors. The monks are poorly clothed for winter conditions and the monasteries are unheated. The hardship of such a posting is well-recognized; to have a son or brother serving in such a monastery is recognized as very good karma for the family.

A monk&#x27;s spiritual training continues throughout his life. In addition to serving the community in sacramental roles, he may undertake several extended silent retreats. A common length for such a retreat is three years, three months, three weeks and three days. During the retreat time he will periodically meet with his spiritual master who will test him on his development to ensure that the retreat time is not being wasted.

Each monastery is headed by an abbot who is typically a Lama, although the titles are distinct. The highest monk in the land is the chief abbot of Bhutan, whose title is Je Khenpo. He is theoretically equivalent in stature to the king.

The Central Monk Body is an assembly of 600 or so monks who attend to the most critical religious duties of the country. In the summer they are housed in Thimphu, the nation&#x27;s capital, and in the winter they descend to Punakha dzong, the most sacred dzong in Bhutan, where Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal&#x27;s mortal body has been kept under vigil since the late 17th century.

==Music==

Bhutanese music has traditional genres such as Zhungdra, Boedra, and a modern genre called Rigsar. Bhutanese musicians include: Jigme Drukpa, who is also a leading Bhutanese musicologist.

==Official behavioural code==
The Driglam Namzha is the official behaviour and dress code of Bhutan. It governs how citizens should dress in public and how they should behave in formal settings. It also regulates a number of cultural assets such as art and Bhutanese architecture. In English, &quot;driglam&quot; means &quot;order, discipline, custom, rules, regimen&quot; and &quot;namzha&quot; means &quot;system,&quot; though the term may be styled &quot;The Rules for Disciplined Behaviour.&quot;

It is a manner and etiquette as what to wear, how to eat, talk and bow down before the government officials and the clergy. The Driglam Namzha was imposed on all citizens from 1990. The people of different ethnic heritage for example the Lhotsampas (Bhutanese citizens of ethnic Nepali origin – they were not Bhutanese citizens and they were not Lhotsampas) resented this and revolted against this imposition, thereby getting kicked out of Bhutan to the refugee camps. About 20% of Bhutan&#x27;s population currently live in exile because of this Bhutanization policies of the Royal Government followed by land expropriation and persecution.

To preserve the indigenous Buddha&#x27;s Teachings as their long-guarded culture and tradition, Menjong Chöthün Tshogpa, a charitable organization was established in 2002 by The Supreme Dharma King or Trulku Jigme Chöda Rinpoche 70th Je Khenpo of Bhutan. The chairman at present is Trizin Tsering Rimpoche who also happens to be the founder of Buddha Dordenma Image Foundation, another charitable organization in Bhutan.

===National dress code===
Previously all Bhutanese citizens were required to observe the national dress code, known as &quot;Driglam Namzha&quot;, while in public during daylight hours. The rule was enforced more rigorously in some districts (&quot;dzongkhag&quot;) than others. Men wear a heavy knee-length robe tied with a belt, called a &quot;gho&quot;, folded in such a way to form a pocket in front of the stomach. 

Women wear colourful blouses over which they fold and clasp a large rectangular cloth called a &quot;kira&quot;, thereby creating an ankle-length dress. A short silk jacket, or &quot;toego&quot; may be worn over the &quot;kira&quot;. Everyday &quot;gho&quot; and &quot;kira&quot; are cotton or wool, according to the season, patterned in simple checks and stripes in earth tones. For special occasions and festivals, colourfully patterned silk &quot;kira&quot; and, more rarely, &quot;gho&quot; may be worn.

Additional rules of protocol apply when visiting a dzong or a temple, or when appearing before a high-level official. Male commoners wear a white sash (&quot;kabney&quot;) from left shoulder to opposite hip. Local and regional elected officials, government ministers, cabinet members, and the King himself each wear their own colored &quot;kabney&quot;. Women wear a narrow embroidered cloth draped over the left shoulder, a &quot;rachu&quot;.

The dress code has met with some resistance from Lhotshampa, people of Nepali ancestry, living along the Indian border who resent having to wear a cultural dress which is not their own.

=== Bhutanization ===
Despite living in Bhutan for up to five generations, the Lhotsampas retained their highly distinctive Nepali language, culture, and religion. They participated in public life and politics, even attaining positions of significant leadership. The Lhotsampas coexisted peacefully with other ethnic groups in Bhutan until the mid 1980s, when Bhutan’s king and the ruling Druk majority became worried that the growing Lhotsampa population could threaten the majority position and the traditional Buddhist culture of the Druk Bhutanese. 

The government therefore initiated a campaign, known as “One country, one people” or “Bhutanization,” to cement Bhutanese national identity. The policies imposed the Druk dress code, religious practices, and language use on all Bhutanese regardless of prior practices. These changes negatively impacted the Lhotsampa people, because they did not wear the same traditional dress, practice the same religion, or speak the same language as the northern Bhutanese. The use of the Nepali language was prohibited in schools, many Lhotsampa teachers were dismissed, and textbooks were burned.

==Men and women in society==

Men and women work together in the fields, and both may own small shops or businesses. Men take a full part in household management, often cook, and are traditionally the makers and repairers of clothing (but do not weave the fabric). In the towns, a more &quot;western&quot; pattern of family structure is beginning to emerge, with the husband as breadwinner and the wife as home-maker. Both genders may be monks, although in practice the number of female monks is relatively small.

Marriages are at the will of either party and divorce is not uncommon. The marriage ceremony consists of an exchange of white scarves and the sharing of a cup. Marriages can be officially registered when the couple has lived together for more than six months. Traditionally the groom moves to the bride&#x27;s family home (matrilocality), but newlyweds may decide to live with either family depending on which household is most in need of labour.

In Asia, Bhutan is an unusual exception to the dowry custom which does not exist; inheritance is matrilineal, and daughters do not take their father&#x27;s name at birth, nor their husband&#x27;s name upon marriage. Rural land may be registered in a woman&#x27;s name. Women own businesses, and both polyandry and polygyny are socially accepted, with polygyny being more prevalent. Sometimes a prospective groom will work in the bride&#x27;s family&#x27;s household to earn the right to marry her.

==Bhutanese names==

Except for royal lineages, Bhutanese names do not include a family name. Instead two traditional auspicious names are chosen at birth by the local lama or by the parents or grandparents of the child. First names generally give no indication if the person is male or female; in some cases the second name may be helpful in that regard.

As there is a limited constellation of acceptable names to choose from, inevitably many people share the same combination of first and second names. To resolve the ambiguity an informal nicknaming system comes into play which recognizes where a person is from. If a certain &quot;Chong Kinley&quot; is from Chozom village in the Paro valley, she is called &quot;Paro Kinley&quot; when she is travelling outside the valley. In Paro valley itself she is identified by the name of her village, thus &quot;Chong Kinley Chozom&quot;. Surprisingly, multiple children in a small hamlet of a few houses may have exactly the same name, reflecting the inspiration of the local lama. In this case, she is identified by the name of the house she was born in, thus &quot;Chemsarpo&quot; Kinley.

==Media==

In the early 1960s, the Third King of Bhutan began the gradual process of introducing modern technology to the medieval kingdom. The first radio service was broadcast for thirty minutes on Sundays (by what is now the Bhutan Broadcasting Service) beginning in 1973. The first television broadcasts were initiated in 1999, although a few wealthy families had bought satellite dish as earlier. Internet service was established in 2000.

In 2002, the first feature-length movie was shot in Bhutan, the acclaimed &quot;Travellers and Magicians&quot; written and directed by Khyentse Norbu, the esteemed lama and head of the non-sectarian Khyentse lineage. The movie examines the pull of modernity on village life in Bhutan as coloured by the Buddhist perspective of &quot;tanha&quot;, or desire.

==Food==
The staple foods of Bhutan are red rice (like brown rice in texture, but with a nutty taste, the only variety of rice that grows in high altitudes), buckwheat, and increasingly maize. The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat, dried beef, pork, pork fat, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat, rice, ferns, lentils, and dried vegetables, spiced with chili peppers and cheese, are a favourite meal during the cold seasons. 

&quot;Zow shungo&quot; is a rice dish mixed with leftover vegetables. Other foods include: &quot;jasha maru&quot; (a chicken dish), &quot;phaksha paa&quot;, &quot;thukpa&quot;, &quot;bathup&quot;, and fried rice. 

Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include: butter tea, black tea, locally brewed &quot;ara&quot; (rice wine), and beer. Popular spices include: curry, cardamom, ginger, &quot;thingay&quot; (Sichuan pepper), garlic, turmeric, and caraway.

When offered food, one says &quot;meshu meshu&quot;, covering one&#x27;s mouth with the hands in refusal according to Bhutanese manners, and then gives in on the second or third offer.

===&quot;Ema datshi&quot;===
&quot;Ema datshi&quot; () is a popular dish in Bhutan. It&#x27;s also known as Bhutanese national dish.

==Sports==

Archery is the national sport in Bhutan, and competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from Olympic standards in technical details, such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. There are two targets placed over 100 m apart and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. 

Traditional Bhutanese Archery is a social event, and competitions are organized between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter&#x27;s ability. Darts (&quot;kuru&quot;) is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10 cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 to 20 m away.

Another traditional sport is &quot;digor&quot;, which resembles shot put and horseshoe throwing.

Football is the most popular sport in Bhutan. In 2002, Bhutan&#x27;s national football team played Montserrat in what was billed as The Other Final; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the World Cup Final, and at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world&#x27;s two lowest ranked teams. It was held in Thimphu&#x27;s Changlimithang Stadium, and Bhutan won 4–0. Cricket has also gained popularity in Bhutan, particularly since the introduction of television channels from India. The Bhutan national cricket team is one of the most successful affiliate nations in the region.

<text>The Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device, designed for films to be viewed by one person at a time through a peephole viewer window. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but it introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video: it created the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1888, it was largely developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab in New Jersey also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.

A Kinetoscope prototype was first semipublicly demonstrated to members of the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs invited to the Edison laboratory on May 20, 1891. The completed version was publicly unveiled in Brooklyn two years later, and on April 14, 1894, the first commercial exhibition of motion pictures in history took place in New York City, using ten Kinetoscopes. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison&#x27;s decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope&#x27;s individual exhibition model. Numerous motion picture systems developed by Edison&#x27;s firm in later years were marketed with the name Projecting Kinetoscope.

==Development==
An encounter with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge appears to have spurred Thomas Edison to pursue the development of a motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in Orange, New Jersey, Muybridge gave a lecture amid a tour in which he demonstrated his zoopraxiscope, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. Edison&#x27;s laboratory was close by, and either or both Edison and his company&#x27;s official photographer, William Dickson, may have attended. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at the Edison lab in West Orange and discussed the possibility of joining the zoopraxiscope with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the U.S. Patent Office announcing his plans to create a device that would do &quot;for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear&quot;. It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: &quot;we may see &amp; hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present&quot;. In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots &quot;&quot; (&quot;movement&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;to view&quot;).

Edison assigned Dickson, one of his most talented employees, to the job of making the Kinetoscope a reality. Edison would take full credit for the invention, but the historiographical consensus is that the title of creator can hardly go to one man:

While Edison seems to have conceived the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed the bulk of the experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.

Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting progress at first. Edison&#x27;s original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 of an inch wide, directly on to a cylinder (also referred to as a &quot;drum&quot;); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as &quot;Monkeyshines, No. 1&quot;, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.

The project would soon head off in more productive directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison&#x27;s to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, for which he departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a &quot;chronophotographic gun&quot;—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at 12 frames per second. Upon his return to the United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud&#x27;s system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device, also known as the Schnellseher (&quot;quick viewer&quot;), is often referred to as an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily &quot;freeze&quot; the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer&#x27;s retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope&#x27;s design.

The question of when the Edison lab began working on a filmstrip device is a matter of historical debate. According to Dickson, in mid-1889, he began cutting the stiff celluloid sheets supplied by Carbutt into strips for use in such a prototype machine; in August, by his description, he attended a demonstration of George Eastman&#x27;s new flexible film and was given a roll by an Eastman representative, which was immediately applied to experiments with the prototype. As described by historian Marta Braun, Eastman&#x27;s product

was sufficiently strong, thin, and pliable to permit the intermittent movement of the film strip behind [a camera] lens at considerable speed and under great tension without tearing ... stimulat[ing] the almost immediate solution of the essential problems of cinematic invention.

Some scholars—in particular, Gordon Hendricks, in &quot;The Edison Motion Picture Myth&quot; (1961)—have argued that the lab began working on a filmstrip machine much later and that Dickson and Edison misrepresented the date to establish priority for reasons of both patent protection and intellectual status. In any event, though film historian David Robinson claims that &quot;the cylinder experiments seem to have been carried on to the bitter end&quot; (meaning the final months of 1890), as far back as September 1889—while Edison was still in Europe, but corresponding regularly with Dickson—the lab definitely placed its first order with the Eastman company for roll film. Three more orders for roll film were placed over the next five months.

Only sporadic work was done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison&#x27;s unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab&#x27;s Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson and his new chief assistant, William Heise, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 3/4 inch (19 mm) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. The device incorporated a rapidly spinning shutter whose purpose—as described by Robinson in his discussion of the completed version—was to &quot;permi[t] a flash of light so brief that [each] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image.&quot; The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.

On May 20, 1891, the first invitational demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs. The New York &quot;Sun&quot; described what the club women saw in the &quot;small pine box&quot; they encountered:

In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect...

The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as &quot;Dickson Greeting&quot;. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a &quot;Kinetographic Camera&quot;, the second for the camera as well, and the third for an &quot;Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects&quot;. In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, &quot;I have been able to take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient.&quot; Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, &quot;Dickson Greeting&quot; and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film projection system that was apparently abandoned.

Early in 1892, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of the mechanics of the viewing system. Before the end of the year, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893, by New York&#x27;s Blair Camera Co., was 1 3/8 inches wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image, 1 inch wide by 3/4 inch high, and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format—with the gauge known by its metric equivalent, 35 mm—would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 &quot;Phonogram&quot; of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.

As for the Kinetoscope itself, there have been differing descriptions of the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor Herman Casler described as &quot;authoritative&quot; by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, &quot;Just above the film...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening in the rim [rotates] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening in the top of the case.&quot; Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, &quot;between the lamp and film&quot;. The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film strip and the lens. Evidently, that major redesign took place, as Robinson&#x27;s description is confirmed by photographs of multiple Kinetoscope interiors, two among the holdings of The Henry Ford and one that appears in Hendricks&#x27;s own book.

On February 21, 1893, a patent was issued for the system that governed the intermittent movement of film in the Kinetograph (though one was not granted for a version of the camera as a whole until 1897). The escapement-based mechanism would be superseded within a few years by competing systems, in particular those based on the so-called Geneva drive or &quot;Maltese cross&quot; that would become the norm for both movie cameras and projectors. The exhibition device itself—which, despite erroneous accounts to the contrary, never employed intermittent film movement, only intermittent lighting or viewing—was finally awarded its patent, number 493,426, on March 14. The Kinetoscope was ready to be unveiled.

==Going public==
The premiere of the completed Kinetoscope was held not at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was &quot;Blacksmith Scene&quot; (also known as &quot;Blacksmiths&quot;); directed by Dickson and shot by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, the world&#x27;s first, known as the Black Maria. Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never took place at the Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson&#x27;s absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown. Hendricks, referring to various accounts, including ones in the July 22 &quot;Science&quot; and the October 21 &quot;Scientific American&quot;, argues that one Kinetoscope did make it to the fair. Robinson, in contrast, argues that such &quot;speculation&quot; is &quot;conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London,&quot; which states, &quot;the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair.&quot; Echoing Hendricks&#x27;s position, fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, &quot;Doubt has been cast on the reports of [the Kinetoscope&#x27;s] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial.&quot; Noting that the fair featured up to two dozen Anschütz Schnellsehers—some or all of a peephole, not projection, variety—film historian Deac Rossell asserts that their presence &quot;is the reason that so many historical sources were confused for so long... [A]nyone who made a clear claim to see the Kinetoscope undoubtedly saw the Schnellseher under its deliberately deceptive name of The Electrical Wonder.&quot;

Work proceeded, though slowly, on the Kinetoscope project. On October 6, a U.S. copyright was issued for a &quot;publication&quot; received by the Library of Congress consisting of &quot;Edison Kinetoscopic Records.&quot; It remains unclear what film was awarded this, the first motion picture copyright in North America. By the turn of the year, the Kinetoscope project would be reenergized. During the first week of January 1894, a five-second film starring an Edison technician was shot at the Black Maria; &quot;Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze&quot;, as it is now widely known, was made expressly to produce a sequence of images for an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine. Never intended for exhibition, it would become one of the most famous Edison films and the first identifiable motion picture to receive a U.S. copyright. With commercial exploitation close at hand, on April 1, the motion picture operation was formally made the Kinetograph Department of the Edison Manufacturing Company, for which Edison appointed a new vice president and general manager: William E. Gilmore. Two weeks later, the Kinetoscope&#x27;s epochal moment arrived.

On April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The four-foot-tall machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison&#x27;s former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria and each running about 15 to 20 seconds, were descriptively titled: &quot;Barber Shop&quot;, &quot;Bertoldi (mouth support)&quot; (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), &quot;Bertoldi (table contortion)&quot;, &quot;Blacksmiths&quot;, &quot;Roosters&quot; (some manner of cock fight), &quot;Highland Dance&quot;, &quot;Horse Shoeing&quot;, &quot;Sandow&quot; (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), &quot;Trapeze&quot;, and &quot;Wrestling&quot;. As historian Charles Musser describes, a &quot;profound transformation of American life and performance culture&quot; had begun.

Twenty-five cents for no more than a few minutes of entertainment was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America&#x27;s first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands&#x27; New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison&#x27;s business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope&#x27;s first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison&#x27;s company.

One of the new firms to enter the field was the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company (no relation to Raff and Gammon&#x27;s Kinetoscope Company); the firm&#x27;s partners, brothers Otway and Grey Latham, Otway&#x27;s friend Enoch Rector, and their employer, Samuel J. Tilden Jr., sought to combine the popularity of the Kinetoscope with that of prizefighting. This led to a series of significant developments in the motion picture field: The Kinetograph was then capable of shooting only a 50-foot-long negative. At 16 frames per foot, this meant a maximum running time of 20 seconds at 40 frames per second (fps), the speed most frequently employed with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been used on occasion as far back as 1891, a film could run for almost 27 seconds. Hendricks identifies &quot;Sandow&quot; as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online catalog, where its duration is listed as 40 seconds. Even at the slowest of these rates, the running time would not have been enough to accommodate a satisfactory exchange of fisticuffs; 16 fps, as well, might have been thought to give too herky-jerky a visual effect for enjoyment of the sport. The Kinetograph and Kinetoscope were modified, possibly with Rector&#x27;s assistance, so they could manage filmstrips three times longer than had previously been used.
On June 15, a match with abbreviated rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images or even more were shot at the rate of 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. Several weeks later, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company&#x27;s parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning 60 cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract. In sum, seventy-five films were shot at the Edison facility in 1894.

Just three months after the commercial debut of the motion picture came the first recorded instance of motion picture censorship. The film in question showed a performance by the Spanish dancer Carmencita, a New York music hall star since the beginning of the decade. According to one description of her live act, she &quot;communicated an intense sexuality across the footlights that led male reporters to write long, exuberant columns about her performance&quot;—articles that would later be reproduced in the Edison film catalog. The Kinetoscope movie of her dance, shot at the Black Maria in mid-March 1894, was playing in the New Jersey resort town Asbury Park by summer. The town&#x27;s founder, James A. Bradley, a real estate developer and leading member of the Methodist community, had recently been elected a state senator: &quot;The &quot;Newark Evening News&quot; of 17 July 1894 reported that [Senator] Bradley...was so shocked by the glimpse of Carmencita&#x27;s ankles and lace that he complained to Mayor Ten Broeck. The showman was thereupon ordered to withdraw the offending film, which he replaced with &quot;Boxing Cats&quot;.&quot; The following month, a San Francisco exhibitor was arrested for a Kinetoscope operation &quot;alleged to be indecent.&quot; The group whose disgruntlement occasioned the arrest was the Pacific Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose targets included &quot;illicit literature, obscene pictures and books, the sale of morphine, cocaine, opium, tobacco and liquors to minors, lottery tickets, etc.,&quot; and which proudly took credit for having &quot;caused 70 arrests and obtained 48 convictions&quot; in a recent two-month span.

The Kinetoscope was also gaining notice abroad. On July 16, 1894, it was demonstrated publicly for the first time in Europe at the 20 boulevard Montmartre newsroom of &quot;Le petit Parisienne&quot;, where photographer Antoine Lumière may have seen it for the first time. In September, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first European Kinetoscope parlor was soon operating in Paris, at 20 boulevard Poissonnière. One of the owners was a business associate of Antoine Lumière&#x27;s, whom he gave a strip from &quot;Barber Shop&quot; and a request for cheaper alternatives to the expensive Edison-produced films he was showing. Along with the stir created by the Kinetoscope itself, this was one of the primary inspirations for the Lumière brothers, Antoine&#x27;s sons, who would go on to develop not only improved motion picture cameras and film stock but also the first commercially successful movie projection system. In mid-October, a Kinetoscope parlor opened in London. At the end of November, by which point New York City was host to half a dozen Kinetophone parlors and London to nearly as many, a venue with five machines opened in Sydney, Australia. By January 3, 25,000 filmgoers had paid the one-shilling fee (roughly equivalent to 25 cents, the same price for five film viewings as in the New York debut).

Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology&#x27;s reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, for instance, claims that Edison &quot;apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright .&quot; As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison &quot;balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents&quot; and &quot;saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope.&quot; Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system&#x27;s development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch&#x27;s interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. In this pursuit, and to make films for both the original device and its knockoffs, Paul and photographer Birt Acres—briefly Paul&#x27;s business partner—would originate a number of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison&#x27;s goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.

==Kinetophone==
The Kinetophone (also known as Phonokinetoscope) was an early attempt by Edison and Dickson to create a sound-film system. The October 1893 &quot;Scientific American&quot; report on the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair suggests that a Kinetograph camera accompanied by a cylinder phonograph was presented there as a demonstration of the potential to simultaneously record image and sound. The first known movie made as a test of the Kinetophone was shot at Edison&#x27;s New Jersey studio in late 1894 or early 1895; now referred to as the Dickson Experimental Sound Film, it is the only surviving movie with live-recorded sound made for the Kinetophone. In March 1895, Edison offered the device for sale; involving no technological innovations, it was a Kinetoscope whose modified cabinet included an accompanying cylinder phonograph. Kinetoscope owners were also offered kits with which to retrofit their equipment. The first Kinetophone exhibitions appear to have taken place in April.

Though a Library of Congress educational website states, &quot;The picture and sound were made somewhat synchronous by connecting the two with a belt&quot;, this is incorrect. As historian David Robinson describes, &quot;The Kinetophone...made no attempt at synchronization. The viewer listened through tubes to a phonograph concealed in the cabinet and performing approximately appropriate music or other sound.&quot; Historian Douglas Gomery concurs, &quot;[Edison] did not try to synchronize sound and image.&quot; Leading production sound mixer Mark Ulano writes that Kinetophones &quot;did &quot;not&quot; play synchronously other than the phonograph turned on when viewing and off when stopped.&quot; While the surviving Dickson test involves live-recorded sound, certainly most, and probably all, of the films marketed for the Kinetophone were shot as silents, predominantly march or dance subjects; exhibitors could then choose from a variety of musical cylinders offering a rhythmic match. For example, three different cylinders with orchestral performances were proposed as accompaniments for &quot;Carmencita&quot;: &quot;Valse Santiago&quot;, &quot;La Paloma&quot;, and &quot;Alma-Danza Spagnola&quot;.

Even as Edison followed his dream of securing the Kinetoscope&#x27;s popularity by adding sound to its allure, many in the field were beginning to suspect that film projection was the next step that should be pursued. When Norman Raff communicated his customers&#x27; interest in such a system to Edison, he summarily rejected the notion:

No, if we make this screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show machines and selling a lot of them at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let&#x27;s not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

Under continuing pressure from Raff, Edison eventually conceded to investigate the possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab&#x27;s technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Tensions between the latter and Edison Company general manager William Gilmore had been running high for months; Dickson&#x27;s eventual discovery of the Kinetoscope Company move appears to have been another central factor in his break with Edison that occurred in April 1895. The Kinetophone&#x27;s debut excited little demand; a total of just forty-five of the machines were built over the next half-decade. With Dickson&#x27;s departure, Edison ceased new work on sound cinema for an extended period.

==Projection wins out==
On January 3, 1895, a British inventor received a patent for an unwieldy contraption meant to cast an enlarged Kinetoscope image onto a screen. Over the course of the year, even as new Kinetoscope exhibits opened as far afield as Mexico City, major cities across Europe, locales large and small around Australia, and Auckland, New Zealand, it became evident that the system was going to lose out to projected motion pictures. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation&#x27;s profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had been developing a film projection system, retaining the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and benefiting secretly from Dickson&#x27;s assistance while he was still in Edison&#x27;s employ. A few weeks after he and Edison fell out, Dickson openly participated in an April 21 screening of the Latham group&#x27;s new Eidoloscope for at least one member of the New York press, which historians describe as the first public film projection in the U.S. On May 20, in Lower Manhattan, the world&#x27;s first run of commercial motion picture screenings began: the Eidoloscope show&#x27;s prime attraction was a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, approximately eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany&#x27;s Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems. Another challenge came from a new &quot;peep show&quot; device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope—another venture to which Dickson had secretly contributed while working for Edison and to which he devoted himself following the Eidoloscope debut. Before year&#x27;s end, the Mutoscope team, using their Mutograph camera as a basis, developed a projector. At that point, North American orders for new Kinetoscopes had all but evaporated.

By the beginning of 1896, Edison was turning his focus to the promotion of a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. The Vitascope premiered in New York in April and met with swift success, but was just as quickly surpassed by the Cinématographe of the Lumières, which arrived in June with the backing of Benjamin F. Keith and his circuit of vaudeville theaters. The Eidoloscope&#x27;s prospects, meanwhile, were crippled by projection deficiencies and business disputes. In September 1896, the Mutoscope Company&#x27;s projector, the Biograph, was released; better funded than its competitors and with superior image quality, by the end of the year it was allied with Keith and soon dominated the North American projection market.

Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year—in which the Edison Company&#x27;s film-related business made a $25,000 profit—Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope, eventually targeting semiprofessional and amateur customers. At its peak, around 1907–8, the Projecting Kinetoscope commanded 30 percent of US projector sales. In 1912, Edison introduced the ambitious Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Three years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Aside from the actual Edison Studios film productions, the company&#x27;s most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.

As far back as some of the early Eidoloscope screenings, exhibitors had occasionally shown films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design.

In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. It met with early acclaim, but poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison&#x27;s West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company&#x27;s Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.

<doc id="230919" wikidata="Q1255047" url="?curid=230919" title="Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence">
<text>The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence () are the Chinese government&#x27;s foreign relations principles first mentioned in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. Also known as Panchsheel (Hindi for &quot;five principles&quot;), these principles were subsequently adopted in a number of resolutions and statements, including the preamble to the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Principles ==
The Five Principles, as stated in the Sino–Indian Agreement 1954, are:
# mutual respect for each other&#x27;s territorial integrity and sovereignty,
# mutual non aggression,
# mutual non-interference in each other&#x27;s internal affairs,
# equality and co-operation for mutual benefit, and
# peaceful co-existence
These principles are a strict interpretation of the Westphalian norms of state sovereignty. Since its inclusion in the Five Principles, China has emphasized non-interventionism as major principle of its foreign policy.

== History ==
The Panchsheel agreement served as one of the most important relation build between India and China to further the economic and security cooperation. An underlying assumption of the Five Principles was that newly independent states after decolonization would be able to develop a new and more principled approach to international relations.

According to V. V. Paranjpe, an Indian diplomat and expert on China, the principles of Panchsheel were first publicly formulated by Zhou Enlai — &quot;While receiving the Indian delegation to the Tibetan trade talks on Dec. 31, 1953 [...] he enunciated them as &quot;five principles governing China&#x27;s relations with foreign countries.&quot; Then in a joint statement in Delhi on 18 June 1954, the principles were emphasized by the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Premier Zhou Enlai in a broadcast speech made at the time of the Asian Prime Ministers Conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka just a few days after the signing of the Sino-Indian treaty in Beijing. Nehru went so far as to say: &quot;If these principles were recognized in the mutual relations of all countries, then indeed there would hardly be any conflict and certainly no war.&quot; It has been suggested that the five principles had partly originated as the five principles of the Indonesian state. In June 1945 Sukarno, the Indonesian nationalist leader, had proclaimed five general principles, or pancasila, on which future institutions were to be founded. Indonesia became independent in 1949.

The five principles were incorporated in modified form in a statement of Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (known as &quot;Dasasila Bandung&quot;) issued in April 1955 at the historic Asian-African Conference in Bandung, Indonesia, which did more than any other meeting to form the idea that post-colonial states had something special to offer the world. &quot;A resolution on peaceful co-existence jointly presented by India, Yugoslavia and Sweden was unanimously adopted in 1957 by the United Nations General Assembly&quot;. The Five Principles as they had been adopted in Colombo and elsewhere formed the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement, established in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961.

China has often emphasized its close association with the Five Principles. It had put them forward, as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, at the start of negotiations that took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the PRC Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the relations between the two countries with respect to the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and what China calls South Tibet and India Arunachal Pradesh. The 28 April 1954 agreement mentioned above was set to last for eight years. When it lapsed, relations were already souring, the provision for renewal of the agreement was not taken up, and the Sino-Indian War broke out between the two sides.

In 1979, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then India&#x27;s Foreign Minister and future Prime Minister, went to China, the word &quot;Panchsheel,&quot; found its way into the conversation during talks with the Chinese. On the 50th anniversary of the treaty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, said that &quot;a new international order on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence&quot; should be built. Also in 2004, Premier Wen Jiabao said,

Deng Xiaoping championed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence stating that they should be used as the &quot;guiding norms of international relations&quot;.

In June 2014, Vice President of India Hamid Ansari was welcomed by China into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing for the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the signing Panchsheel Treaty. In 2017, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said that &quot;China is ready to work with India to seek guidance from the five principles of Panchsheel&quot;.

=== Other Contexts ===

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are Chinese political norms articulated in other contexts as well. In 1982, Hu Yaobang&#x27;s report to the 12th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party stated, &quot;China adheres to an independent foreign policy and develops relationships with other countries under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.&quot; According to the view stated by Hu in this report, &quot;China will never be dependent on any big country or group of countries, nor will it yield to the pressure of any big country [...] The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence apply to our relations with all countries, including socialist countries.&quot;

These principles are also part of the discourse in China-Pakistan relations. In a speech to Pakistani parliament in 1999, Chairman of the Standing Committee of China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress Li Peng stated, &quot;China has all along pursued an independent foreign policy of peace and established and developed relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.&quot; The principles were codified in the April 2005 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Good Neighborly Relations signed during a visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Pakistan.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the fundamental political norms underlying the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum (CACF) and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).

Since the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya, China has more strongly advocated for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

China&#x27;s United Nations Security Council voting behavior reflects its commitment to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. From 1991 to 2020, the vast majority of China&#x27;s abstentions and all of its vetoes have occurred on issues that involve territorial integrity, primarily sanctions and the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. In her analysis of China&#x27;s Security Council voting behavior, Professor Dawn C. Murphy concludes, &quot;These votes directly correspond to China&#x27;s promotion of the Five Principles, especially the principles of mutual respect for territory and sovereignty and mutual noninterference in the internal affairs of other states.&quot;

== Commentary and criticism ==
Bhimrao Ambedkar said of the treaty in the Rajya Sabha &quot;I am indeed surprised that our Hon&#x27;ble Prime Minister is taking this Panchsheel seriously [...] you must be knowing that Panchsheel is one of the significant parts of the Buddha Dharma. If Shri Mao had even an iota of faith in Panchsheel, he would have treated the Buddhists in his country in a different manner.&quot; In 1958, Acharya Kriplani had said the Panchsheel was &quot;born in sin&quot; because it was set forth with the destruction of a nation; India had approved of ancient Tibet&#x27;s destruction.

In 2014, Zhao Gancheng, a Chinese scholar said that on the surface Panchsheel seemed very superficial; but under the Xi Jinping administration it has become relevant again. In 2014, Ram Madhav wrote a piece in the &quot;Indian Express&quot; titled, &quot;Moving beyond the Panchsheel deception&quot; and said that if India and China decide to move on from the Panchsheel framework, it will benefit both countries.

<text>The beluga whale (; Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean. It is one of two living members of the family Monodontidae, along with the narwhal, and the only member of the genus Delphinapterus. It is also known as the white whale, as it is the only cetacean to regularly occur with this colour; the sea canary, due to its high-pitched calls; and the melonhead, though that more commonly refers to the melon-headed whale, which is an oceanic dolphin.

The beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic, with anatomical and physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans. Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a dorsal fin, which allows it to swim under ice with ease. It possesses a distinctive protuberance at the front of its head which houses an echolocation organ called the melon, which in this species is large and deformable. The beluga&#x27;s body size is between that of a dolphin and a true whale, with males growing up to long and weighing up to . This whale has a stocky body. Like many cetaceans, a large percentage of its weight is blubber (subcutaneous fat). Its sense of hearing is highly developed and its echolocation allows it to move about and find breathing holes under sheet ice.

Belugas are gregarious and form groups of 10 animals on average, although during the summer, they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in estuaries and shallow coastal areas. They are slow swimmers, but can dive to below the surface. They are opportunistic feeders and their diets vary according to their locations and the season. The majority of belugas live in the Arctic Ocean and the seas and coasts around North America, Russia, and Greenland; their worldwide population is thought to number around 200,000. They are migratory and the majority of groups spend the winter around the Arctic ice cap; when the sea ice melts in summer, they move to warmer river estuaries and coastal areas. Some populations are sedentary and do not migrate over great distances during the year.

The native peoples of North America and Russia have hunted belugas for many centuries. They were also hunted by non-natives during the 19th century and part of the 20th century. Hunting of belugas is not controlled by the International Whaling Commission, and each country has developed its own regulations in different years. Currently, some Inuit in Canada and Greenland, Alaska Native groups and Russians are allowed to hunt belugas for consumption as well as for sale, as aboriginal whaling is excluded from the International Whaling Commission 1986 moratorium on hunting. The numbers have dropped substantially in Russia and Greenland, but not in Alaska and Canada. Other threats include natural predators (polar bears and killer whales), contamination of rivers (as with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) which bioaccumulate up the food chain), climate change and infectious diseases. The beluga was placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List in 2008 as being &quot;near threatened&quot;; the subpopulation from the Cook Inlet in Alaska is considered critically endangered and is under the protection of the United States&#x27; Endangered Species Act. Of all seven extant Canadian beluga populations, those inhabiting eastern Hudson Bay, Ungava Bay, and the St. Lawrence River are listed as endangered.

Belugas are one of the most commonly kept cetaceans in captivity and are housed in aquariums, dolphinariums and wildlife parks in North America, Europe and Asia. They are considered charismatic because of their docile demeanour and characteristic smile, communicative nature, and supple, graceful movement.
==Etymology==
The common name for the whale, as well as for the unrelated beluga sturgeon, is derived from the Russian word (), meaning .

== Taxonomy ==

The beluga was first described in 1776 by Peter Simon Pallas. It is a member of the family Monodontidae, which is in turn part of the parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). The Irrawaddy dolphin was once placed in the same family, though recent genetic evidence suggests these dolphins belong to the family Delphinidae. The narwhal is the only other species within the Monodontidae. A skull has been discovered with intermediate characteristics supporting the hypothesis that hybridisation is possible between these two species.

The name of the genus, &quot;Delphinapterus&quot;, means &quot;dolphin without fin&quot; (from the Greek δελφίν (&quot;delphin&quot;), dolphin and απτερος (&quot;apteros&quot;), without fin) and the species name &quot;leucas&quot; means &quot;white&quot; (from the Greek λευκας (&quot;leukas&quot;), white). The Red List of Threatened Species gives both beluga and white whale as common names, though the former is now more popular. The English name comes from the Russian белу́га, which derives from the word белый (&quot;bélyj&quot;), meaning &quot;white&quot;. Nowadays the word белу́га in Russian refers to the beluga sturgeon, while the whale is called almost similarly - белу́ха (&quot;belúha&quot;).

The whale is also colloquially known as the &quot;sea canary&quot; on account of its high-pitched squeaks, squeals, clucks, and whistles. A Japanese researcher claimed that he taught a beluga to &quot;talk&quot; by using these sounds to identify three different objects, offering hope that humans may one day be able to communicate effectively with sea mammals. A similar observation has been made by Canadian researchers, where a beluga which died in 2007 &quot;talked&quot; when he was still a subadult. Another example is NOC, a beluga whale that could mimic the rhythm and tone of human language. Beluga whales in the wild have been reported to imitate human voices.

== Evolution ==
Mitochondrial DNA studies have shown modern cetaceans last shared a common ancestor between 25 and 34 million years ago The superfamily Delphinoidea (which contains monodontids, dolphins and porpoises) split from other toothed whales, odontoceti, between 11 and 15 million years ago. Monodontids then split from dolphins (Delphinidae) and later from porpoises (Phocoenidae), their closest relatives in evolutionary terms. In 2017 the genome of a beluga whale was sequenced, comprising 2.327 Gbp of assembled genomic sequence that encoded 29,581 predicted genes. The authors estimated that the genome-wide sequence similarity between beluga whales and killer whales is 97.87%.

The beluga&#x27;s earliest known distinctive ancestors include the prehistoric &quot;Denebola brachycephala&quot; from the late Miocene epoch (9–10 million years ago), and &quot;Bohaskaia monodontoides&quot;, from the early Pliocene (3–5 million years ago). Fossil evidence from Baja California and Virginia indicate the family once inhabited warmer waters. A fossil of the monodontid &quot;Casatia thermophila&quot;, from five million years ago, provides the strongest evidence that monodontids once inhabited warmer waters, as the fossil was found alongside fossils of tropical species such as bull and tiger sharks.

The fossil record also indicates that, in comparatively recent times, the beluga&#x27;s range varied with that of the polar ice packs expanding during ice ages and contracting when the ice retreated. Counter-evidence to this theory comes from the finding in 1849 of fossilised beluga bones in Vermont in the United States, from the Atlantic Ocean. The bones were discovered during construction of the first railroad between Rutland and Burlington in Vermont, when workers unearthed the bones of a mysterious animal in Charlotte. Buried nearly below the surface in a thick blue clay, these bones were unlike those of any animal previously discovered in Vermont. Experts identified the bones as those of a beluga. Because Charlotte is over from the nearest ocean, early naturalists were at a loss to explain the presence of the bones of a marine mammal buried beneath the fields of rural Vermont.

The remains were found to be preserved in the sediments of the Champlain Sea, an extension of the Atlantic Ocean within the continent resulting from the rise in sea level at the end of the ice ages some 12,000 years ago. Today, the Charlotte whale is the official Vermont State Fossil (making Vermont the only state whose official fossil is that of a still extant animal).

== Description ==

Its body is round, particularly when well fed, and tapers less smoothly to the head than the tail. The sudden tapering to the base of its neck gives it the appearance of shoulders, unique among cetaceans. The tail-fin grows and becomes increasingly and ornately curved as the animal ages. The flippers are broad and short—making them almost square-shaped.

=== Longevity ===
Preliminary investigations suggested a beluga&#x27;s life expectancy was rarely more than 30 years. The method used to calculate the age of a beluga is based on counting the layers of dentine and dental cement in a specimen&#x27;s teeth, which were originally thought to be deposited once or twice a year. The layers can be readily identified as one layer consists of opaque dense material and the other is transparent and less dense. It is therefore possible to estimate the age of the individual by extrapolating the number of layers identified and the estimated frequency with which the deposits are laid down. A 2006 study using radiocarbon dating of the dentin layers showed the deposit of this material occurs with a lesser frequency (once per year) than was previously thought. The study therefore estimated belugas can live for 70 or 80 years. However, recent studies suggest that it is unclear as to whether belugas receive a different number of layers per year depending on the age of the animal (for example young belugas may only receive an additional one layer per year), or simply just one layer per year or every other year.

=== Size ===
The species presents a moderate degree of sexual dimorphism, as the males are 25% longer than the females and are sturdier. Adult male belugas can range from , while the females measure . Males weigh between , and occasionally up to while females weigh between . They rank as mid-sized species among toothed whales.

Individuals of both sexes reach their maximum size by the time they are 10 years old. The beluga&#x27;s body shape is stocky and fusiform (cone-shaped with the point facing backwards), and they frequently have folds of fat, particularly along the ventral surface. Between 40% and 50% of their body weight is fat, which is a higher proportion than for cetaceans that do not inhabit the Arctic, where fat only represents 30% of body weight. The fat forms a layer that covers all of the body except the head, and it can be up to thick. It acts as insulation in waters with temperatures between 0 and 18 °C, as well as being an important reserve during periods without food.

=== Colour ===
The adult beluga is rarely mistaken for any other species, because it is completely white or whitish-grey in colour. Calves are usually born grey, and by the time they are a month old, have turned dark grey or blue grey. They then start to progressively lose their pigmentation until they attain their distinctive white colouration, at the age of seven years in females and nine in males. The white colouration of the skin is an adaptation to life in the Arctic that allows belugas to camouflage themselves in the polar ice caps as protection against their main predators, polar bears and killer whales. Unlike other cetaceans, the belugas seasonally shed their skin. During the winter, the epidermis thickens and the skin can become yellowish, mainly on the back and fins. When they migrate to the estuaries during the summer, they rub themselves on the gravel of the riverbeds to remove the cutaneous covering.

=== Head and neck ===
Like most toothed whales, the beluga has a compartment found at the centre of the forehead that contains an organ used for echolocation called a melon, which contains fatty tissue. The shape of the beluga&#x27;s head is unlike that of any other cetacean, as the melon is extremely bulbous, lobed and visible as a large frontal prominence. Another distinctive characteristic it possesses is the melon is malleable; its shape is changed during the emission of sounds. The beluga is able to change the shape of its head by blowing air around its sinuses to focus the emitted sounds. This organ contains fatty acids, mainly isovaleric acid (60.1%) and long-chain branched acids (16.9%), a very different composition from its body fat, and which could play a role in its echolocation system.

Unlike many dolphins and whales, the seven vertebrae in the neck are not fused together, allowing the animal to turn its head laterally without needing to rotate its body. This gives the head a lateral manoeuvrability that allows an improved field of view and movement and helps in catching prey and evading predators in deep water. The rostrum has about eight to ten small, blunt and slightly curved teeth on each side of the jaw and a total of 36 to 40 teeth. Belugas do not use their teeth to chew, but for catching hold of their prey; they then tear them up and swallow them nearly whole.

Belugas only have a single spiracle, which is located on the top of the head behind the melon, and has a muscular covering, allowing it to be completely sealed. Under normal conditions, the spiracle is closed and an animal must contract the muscular covering to open the spiracle. A beluga&#x27;s thyroid gland is larger than that of terrestrial mammals—weighing three times more than that of a horse—which helps it to maintain a greater metabolism during the summer when it lives in river estuaries. It is the marine cetacean that most frequently develops hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of the thyroid.

=== Fins ===

The fins retain the bony vestiges of the beluga&#x27;s mammalian ancestors, and are firmly bound together by connective tissue. The fins are small in relation to the size of the body, rounded and oar-shaped and slightly curled at the tips. These versatile extremities are mainly used as a rudder to control direction, to work in synchrony with the tailfin and for agile movement in shallow waters up to deep. The fins also contain a mechanism for regulating body temperature, as the arteries feeding the fin&#x27;s muscles are surrounded by veins that dilate or contract to gain or lose heat. The tailfin is flat with two oar-like lobes, it does not have any bones, and is made up of hard, dense, fibrous connective tissue. The tailfin has a distinctive curvature along the lower edge. The longitudinal muscles of the back provide the ascending and descending movement of the tailfin, which has a similar thermoregulation mechanism to the pectoral fins.

Belugas have a dorsal ridge, rather than a dorsal fin. The absence of the dorsal fin is reflected in the genus name of the species—&quot;apterus&quot; the Greek word for &quot;wingless&quot;. The evolutionary preference for a dorsal ridge rather than a fin is believed to be an adaptation to under-ice conditions, or possibly as a way of preserving heat. The crest is hard and, along with the head, can be used to open holes in ice up to thick.

=== Senses ===

The beluga has a very specialised sense of hearing and its auditory cortex is highly developed. It can hear sounds within the range of 1.2 to 120 kHz, with the greatest sensitivity between 10 and 75 kHz, where the average hearing range for humans is 0.02 to 20 kHz. The majority of sounds are most probably received by the lower jaw and transmitted towards the middle ear. In the toothed whales, the lower jawbone is broad with a cavity at its base, which projects towards the place where it joins the cranium. A fatty deposit inside this small cavity connects to the middle ear. Toothed whales also possess a small external auditory hole a few centimetres behind their eyes; each hole communicates with an external auditory conduit and an eardrum. It is not known if these organs are functional or simply vestigial.

Belugas are able to see within and outside of water, but their vision is relatively poor when compared to dolphins. Their eyes are especially adapted to seeing under water, although when they come into contact with the air, the crystalline lens and the cornea adjust to overcome the associated myopia (the range of vision under water is short). A beluga&#x27;s retina has cones and rods, which also suggests they can see in low light. The presence of cone cells indicates they can see colours, although this suggestion has not been confirmed. Glands located in the medial corner of their eyes secrete an oily, gelatinous substance that lubricates the eye and helps flush out foreign bodies. This substance forms a film that protects the cornea and the conjunctiva from pathogenic organisms.

Studies on captive animals show they seek frequent physical contact with other belugas. Areas in the mouth have been found that could act as chemoreceptors for different tastes, and they can detect the presence of blood in water, which causes them to react immediately by displaying typical alarm behaviour. Like the other toothed whales, their brains lack olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves, which suggests they do not have a sense of smell.

== Behaviour ==
=== Social structure and play ===
These cetaceans are highly sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain between two and 25 individuals, with an average of 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be hundreds of miles away from that pod. Beluga whale pods can be grouped into three categories, nurseries (which consist of mother and calves), bachelors (which consist of all males) and mixed groups. Mixed groups contain animals of both sexes. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.

They are cooperative animals and frequently hunt in coordinated groups. The animals in a pod are very sociable and often chase each other as if they are playing or fighting, and they often rub against each other. Often individuals will surface and dive together in a synchronized manner, in a behavior known as milling.

In captivity, they can be seen to be constantly playing, vocalising and swimming around each other. In one case, one whale blew bubbles, while the other one popped them. There have also been reports of beluga whales copying and imitating one another, similar to a game of Simon-says. There have also been reports of them displaying physical affection, via mouth to mouth contact. They also show a great deal of curiosity towards humans and frequently approach the windows in the tanks to observe them.

Belugas also show a great degree of curiosity towards humans in the wild, and frequently swim alongside boats. They also play with objects they find in the water; in the wild, they do this with wood, plants, dead fish and bubbles they have created. During the breeding season, adults have been observed carrying objects such as plants, nets, and even the skeleton of a dead reindeer on their heads and backs. Captive females have also been observed displaying this behavior, carrying items such as floats and buoys, after they have lost a calf. Experts consider this interaction with the objects to be a substitute behavior.

In captivity, mothering behavior among belugas depends on the individual. Some mothers are extremely attentive while other mothers are so blasé, that they have actually lost their calves. In aquaria, there have been cases where dominant females have stolen calves from mothers, particularly if they have lost a calf or if they are pregnant. After giving birth, dominant females will return the calf back to their mother. Additionally, male calves will temporarily leave their mothers to interact with an adult male who can serve as a role model for the calf, before they return to their mothers. Male calves are also frequently seen interacting with each other.

=== Swimming and diving ===
Belugas are slower swimmers than the other toothed whales, such as the killer whale and the common bottlenose dolphin, because they are less hydrodynamic and have limited movement of their tail-fins, which produce the greatest thrust. They frequently swim at speeds between , although they are able to maintain a speed of 22 km/h for up to 15 min. Unlike most cetaceans, they are capable of swimming backwards. Belugas swim on the surface between 5% and 10% of the time, while for the rest of the time they swim at a depth sufficient enough to cover their bodies. They do not jump out of the water like dolphins or killer whales.

These animals usually only dive to depths to , although they are capable of diving to greater depths. Individual captive animals have been recorded at depths between 400 and 647 m below sea level, while animals in the wild have been recorded as diving to a depth of more than 700 m, with the greatest recorded depth being over 900 m. A dive normally lasts 3 to 5 minutes, but can last up to over 20 minutes. In the shallower water of the estuaries, a diving session may last around two minutes; the sequence consists of five or six rapid, shallow dives followed by a deeper dive lasting up to one minute. The average number of dives per day varies between 31 and 51.

All cetaceans, including belugas, have physiological adaptations designed to conserve oxygen while they are under water. During a dive, these animals will reduce their heart rate from 100 beats a minute to between 12 and 20. Blood flow is diverted away from certain tissues and organs and towards the brain, heart and lungs, which require a constant oxygen supply. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is 5.5%, which is greater than that found in land-based mammals and is similar to that of Weddell seals (a diving marine mammal). One study found a female beluga had 16.5 L of oxygen dissolved in her blood. Lastly, the beluga&#x27;s muscles contain high levels of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle. Myoglobin concentrations in belugas are several times greater than for terrestrial mammals, which help prevent oxygen deficiency during dives.

Beluga whales often accompany bowhead whales, for curiosity and to secure polynya feasibility to breathe as bowheads are capable of breaking through ice from underwater by headbutting.

=== Diet ===

Belugas play an important role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (&quot;Sebastes marinus&quot;), Greenland halibut (&quot;Reinhardtius hippoglossoides&quot;) and northern shrimp (&quot;Pandalus borealis&quot;), while in Alaska their staple diet is Coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus&quot;), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, such as shrimp, squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms and other deep-sea species. Belugas feed mainly in winter as their blubber is thickest in later winter and early spring, and thinnest in the fall. Inuit observation has led scientists to believe that belugas do not hunt during migration, at least in Hudson Bay.

The diet of Alaskan belugas is quite diverse and varies depending on season and migratory behavior. Belugas in the Beaufort Sea mainly feed on staghorn and shorthorn sculpin, walleye pollock, Arctic cod, saffron cod and Pacific sand lance. Shrimp are the most common invertebrate eaten, with octopus, amphipods and echiurids being other sources of invertebrate prey. The most common prey species for belugas in the Eastern Chukchi Sea appears to be shrimp, echiurid worms, cephalopods and polychaetes. The largest prey item consumed by beluga whales in the Eastern Chukchi Sea seems to be saffron cod. Beluga whales in the Eastern Bering Sea feed on a variety of fish species including saffron cod, rainbow smelt, walleye pollock, Pacific salmon, Pacific herring and several species of flounder and sculpin. The primary invertebrate consumed is shrimp. The primary prey item in regard to fish species for belugas in Bristol Bay appears to be the five species of salmon, with sockeye being the most prevalent. Smelt is also another common fish family eaten by belugas in this region. Shrimp is the most prevalent invertebrate prey item. The most common prey items for belugas in Cook Inlet appear to be salmon, cod and smelt.

Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to . Like their wild counterparts, captive belugas were found to eat less in the fall.

Foraging on the seabed typically takes place at depths between , although they can dive to depths of in search of food. Their flexible necks provide a wide range of movement while they are searching for food on the ocean floor. Some animals have been observed to suck up water and then forcefully expel it to uncover their prey hidden in the silt on the seabed. As their teeth are neither large nor sharp, belugas must use suction to bring their prey into their mouths; it also means their prey has to be consumed whole, which in turn means it cannot be too large or the belugas run the risk of it getting stuck in their throats. They also join into coordinated groups of five or more to feed on shoals of fish by steering the fish into shallow water, where the belugas then attack them. For example, in the estuary of the Amur River, where they mainly feed on salmon, groups of six or eight individuals join to surround a shoal of fish and prevent their escape. Individuals then take turns feeding on the fish.

=== Reproduction ===

Estimations of the age of sexual maturity for beluga whales vary considerably; the majority of authors estimate males reach sexual maturity when they are between nine and fifteen years old, and females reach maturity between eight and fourteen years old. The average age at which females first give birth is 8.5 years and fertility begins to decrease when they are 25, eventually undergoing menopause, and ceasing reproductive potential with no births recorded for females older than 41. There is a slight difference on the sexual maturation period between males and females. The male beluga whales take seven to nine years to become sexually mature, while the females take four to seven years.

 Female belugas typically give birth to one calf every three years. Most mating occurs from February to May, but some occurs at other times of year. The beluga may have delayed implantation. Gestation has been estimated to last 12.0 to 14.5 months, but information derived from captive females suggests a period up to 475 days (15.8 months). During the mating season, the testes of belugas double in weight. Testosterone levels increase, but seems to be independent of copulation. Copulation typically takes place between 3 and 4 AM.

Calves are born over a protracted period that varies by location. In the Canadian Arctic, calves are born between March and September, while in Hudson Bay, the peak calving period is in late June, and in Cumberland Sound, most calves are born from late July to early August. Births usually take place in bays or estuaries where the water is between 10 and 15 °C. Newborns are about long, weigh about , and are grey in colour. They are able to swim alongside their mothers immediately after birth. The newborn calves nurse under water and initiate lactation a few hours after birth; thereafter, they feed at intervals around an hour. Studies of captive females have indicated their milk composition varies between individuals and with the stage of lactation; it has an average content of 28% fat, 11% protein, 60.3% water, and less than 1% residual solids. The milk contains about 92 cal per ounce.

The calves remain dependent on their mothers for nursing for the first year, when their teeth appear. After this, they start to supplement their diets with shrimp and small fish. The majority of the calves continue nursing until they are 20 months old, although occasionally lactation can continue for more than two years, and lactational anoestrus may not occur. Alloparenting (care by females different from the mother) has been observed in captive belugas, including spontaneous and long-term milk production. This suggests this behaviour, which is also seen in other mammals, may be present in belugas in the wild.

Hybrids have been documented between the beluga and the narwhal (specifically offspring conceived by a beluga father and a narwhal mother), as one, perhaps even as many as three, such hybrids were killed and harvested during a sustenance hunt. Whether or not these hybrids could breed remains unknown. The unusual dentition seen in the single remaining skull indicates the hybrid hunted on the seabed, much as walruses do, indicating feeding habits different from those of either parent species.

=== Communication and echolocation ===
Belugas use sounds and echolocation for movement, communication, to find breathing holes in the ice, and to hunt in dark or turbid waters. They produce a rapid sequence of clicks that pass through the melon, which acts as an acoustic lens to focus the sounds into a beam that is projected forward through the surrounding water. These sounds spread through the water at a speed of nearly 1.6 km per second, some four times faster than the speed of sound in air. The sound waves reflect from objects and return as echoes that are heard and interpreted by the animal. This enables them to determine the distance, speed, size, shape and the object&#x27;s internal structure within the beam of sound. They use this ability when moving around thick Arctic ice sheets, to find areas of unfrozen water for breathing, or air pockets trapped under the ice.

Some evidence indicates that belugas are highly sensitive to noise produced by humans. In one study, the maximum frequencies produced by an individual located in San Diego Bay, California, were between 40 and 60 kHz. The same individual produced sounds with a maximum frequency of 100 to 120 kHz when transferred to Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii. The difference in frequencies is thought to be a response to the difference in environmental noise in the two areas. In special circumstances, beluga whale sounds have been reported to resemble human speech.

These animals communicate using sounds of high frequency; their calls can sound like bird songs, so belugas were nicknamed &quot;canaries of the sea&quot;. Like the other toothed whales, belugas do not possess vocal cords and the sounds are probably produced by the movement of air between the nasal sacks, which are located near to the blowhole.

Belugas are among the most vocal cetaceans. They use their vocalisations for echolocation, during mating and for communication. They possess a large repertoire, emitting up to 11 different sounds, such as cackles, whistles, trills and squawks. They make sounds by grinding their teeth or splashing, but they rarely use body language.

There is debate as to whether cetacean vocalizations can constitute a language. A study conducted in 2015 determined that European beluga signals share physical features comparable to vowels. These sounds were found to be stable throughout time, but varied among different geographical locations. The further away the populations were from each other, the more varied the sounds were in relation to one another.

== Distribution ==

The beluga inhabits a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. During the summer, they can mainly be found in deep waters ranging from 76°N to 80°N, particularly along the coasts of Alaska, northern Canada, western Greenland and northern Russia. The southernmost extent of their range includes isolated populations in the St. Lawrence River in the Atlantic, and the Amur River delta, the Shantar Islands and the waters surrounding Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk.

=== Migration ===

Belugas have a seasonal migratory pattern. Migration patterns are passed from parents to offspring. Some travel as far as per year. When the summer sites become blocked with ice during the autumn, they move to spend the winter in the open sea alongside the pack ice or in areas covered with ice, surviving by using polynyas to surface and breathe. In summer after the sheet ice has melted, they move to coastal areas with shallower water ( deep), although sometimes they migrate towards deeper waters (deeper than ). In the summer, they occupy estuaries and the waters of the continental shelf, and, on occasion, they even swim up the rivers. A number of incidents have been reported where groups or individuals have been found hundreds or even thousands of kilometres from the ocean. One such example comes from June 9, 2006, when a young beluga carcass was found in the Tanana River near Fairbanks in central Alaska, nearly from the nearest ocean habitat. Belugas sometimes follow migrating fish, leading Alaska state biologist Tom Seaton to speculate it had followed migrating salmon up the river at some point in the previous autumn. The rivers they most often travel up include: the Northern Dvina, the Mezen, the Pechora, the Ob and the Yenisei in Asia; the Yukon and the Kuskokwim in Alaska, and the Saint Lawrence in Canada. Spending time in a river has been shown to stimulate an animal&#x27;s metabolism and facilitates the seasonal renewal of the epidermal layer. In addition, the rivers represent a safe haven for newborn calves where they will not be preyed upon by killer whales. Calves often return to the same estuary as their mother in the summer, meeting her sometimes even after becoming fully mature. However, not all beluga whale populations summer in estuaries. Belugas from the Beaufort Sea stock were found to summer along the Eastern Beaufort Sea shelf, Amundsen Gulf and slope regions north and west of Banks Island, in addition to core areas in the Mackenzie River Estuary. Male belugas have been observed summering in deeper waters along Viscount Melville Sound, in depths of up to . The bulk of Eastern Chukchi Sea belugas summer over Barrow canyon.

The migration season is relatively predictable, as it is basically determined by the amount of daylight and not by other variable physical or biological factors, such as the condition of the sea ice. Vagrants may travel further south to areas such as Irish and Scottish waters, the islands of Orkney and Hebrides, and to Japanese waters. There had been several vagrant individuals that have demonstrated seasonal residencies at Volcano Bay, and a unique whale were used to return annually to areas adjacent to Shibetsu in Nemuro Strait in the 2000s. On rarer occasions, individuals of vagrancy can reach the Korean Peninsula. A few other individuals have been confirmed to return to the coasts of Hokkaido, and one particular individual became a resident in brackish waters of Lake Notoro since in 2014.

Some populations are not migratory and certain resident groups will stay in well-defined areas, such as in Cook Inlet, the estuary of the Saint Lawrence River and Cumberland Sound. The population in Cook Inlet stays in the waters furthest inside the inlet during the summer until the end of autumn. Then during the winter, they disperse to the deeper water in the center of the inlet, but without completely leaving it.

In April, the animals that spend the winter in the center and southwest of the Bering Sea move to the north coast of Alaska and the east coast of Russia. The populations living in the Ungava Bay and the eastern and western sides of Hudson Bay overwinter together beneath the sea ice in Hudson Strait. Whales in James Bay that spend winter months within the basin, could be a distinct group from those in Hudson Bay. The populations of the White Sea, the Kara Sea and the Laptev Sea overwinter in the Barents Sea. In the spring, the groups separate and migrate to their respective summer sites.

=== Habitat ===

Belugas exploit a varied range of habitats; they are most commonly seen in shallow waters close to the coast, but they have also been reported to live for extended periods in deeper water, where they feed and give birth to their young.

In coastal areas, they can be found in coves, fjords, canals, bays and shallow waters in the Arctic Ocean that are continuously lit by sunlight. They are also often seen during the summer in river estuaries, where they feed, socialize and give birth to young. These waters usually have a temperature between 8 and 10 °C. The mudflats of Cook Inlet in Alaska are a popular location for these animals to spend the first few months of summer. In the eastern Beaufort Sea, female belugas with their young and immature males prefer the open waters close to land, while the adult males live in waters covered by ice near the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The younger males and females with slightly older young can be found nearer to the ice shelf. Generally, the use of different habitats in summer reflects differences in feeding habits, risk from predators and reproductive factors for each of the subpopulations.

== Population ==
There are currently 22 stocks of beluga whales recognized:

# James Bay – 14,500 individuals (belugas remain here all year round)
# Western Hudson Bay – 55,000 individuals 
# Eastern Hudson Bay – 3,400–3,800 individuals 
# Cumberland Sound – 1,151 individuals 
# Ungava Bay – 32 individuals (maybe functionally extinct)
# St. Lawrence River Estuary – 889 individuals

# Southwest Greenland – Extinct
# Eastern Chukchi Sea – 20,700 individuals 
# Eastern Bering Sea – 7,000–9,200 individuals 
# Eastern Beaufort Sea – 39,300 individuals 
# Bristol Bay – 2,000–3,000 individuals 
# Cook Inlet – 300 individuals 
# White Sea – 5,600 individuals
# Kara Sea/Laptev Sea/Barents Sea – Data Deficient
# Ulbansky – 2,300

# Svalbard – 549 individuals

The Yakutat Bay belugas are not considered to be a true stock because they have only been present in these waters since the 1980s, and are believed to be of Cook Inlet origin. It is estimated that less than 20 whales inhabit the bay year-round. Overall the beluga population is estimated to be 150,000–200,000 animals.

== Threats ==

=== Hunting ===
The native populations of the Arctic in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Russia hunt belugas, for both consumption and profit. Belugas have been easy prey for hunters due to their predictable migration patterns and the high population density in estuaries and surrounding coastal areas during the summer.

==== Present ====
The number of animals killed is about 1,000 per year, (see table below. and its sources). Beluga whale hunting quotas in Canada and the United States are established using the Potential Biological Removal equation PBR = Nmin * 0.5 * Rmax * FR, to determine what constitutes a sustainable hunt. Nmin represents a conservative estimation of the population size, Rmax, represents the maximum rate of population increase and FR represents the recovery factor.

Hunters in Hudson&#x27;s Bay rarely eat the meat. They give a little to dogs, and leave the rest for wild animals. Other areas may dry the meat for later consumption by humans. In Greenland the skin (muktuk) is sold commercially to fish factories, and in Canada to other communities. An average of one or two vertebrae and one or two teeth per beluga are carved and sold. One estimate of the annual gross value received from Beluga hunts in Hudson Bay in 2013 was for 190 belugas, or per beluga. However, the net income, after subtracting costs in time and equipment, was a loss of per person. Hunts receive subsidies, but they continue as a tradition, rather than for the money, and the economic analysis noted that whale watching may be an alternate revenue source. Of the gross income, was for skin and meat, to replace beef, pork and chickens which would otherwise be bought. was received for carved vertebrae and teeth.

Russia now harvests 5 to 30 belugas per year for meat and captures an additional 20 to 30 per year for live export to Chinese aquaria. However, in 2018, 100 were illegally captured for live export.

Previous levels of commercial whaling have put the species in danger of extinction in areas such as Cook Inlet, Ungava Bay, the St. Lawrence River and western Greenland. Continued hunting by the native peoples may mean some populations will continue to decline. Northern Canadian sites are the focus of discussions between local communities and the Canadian government, with the objective of permitting sustainable hunting that does not put the species at risk of extinction.

The total amount of landed (defined as belugas successfully hunted and retrieved) belugas averages 275 in regard to the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort stocks from 1987 to 2006. The average annual landed harvest of belugas in the Beaufort Sea consisted of 39 individuals while the Chukchi harvest averaged 62 individuals. Bristol bay&#x27;s annual average landed harvest was 17 while the Bering Sea&#x27;s was 152. Statistical studies have demonstrated that subsistence hunting in Alaska did not significantly impact the population of the Alaskan beluga whale stocks. The number of belugas struck and lost did not seem to profoundly impact Chukchi and Bering Sea belugas.

==== Past ====
Commercial whaling by European, American and Russian whalers during the 18th and 19th centuries decreased beluga populations in the Arctic. The animals were hunted for their meat and blubber, while the Europeans used the oil from the melon as a lubricant for clocks, machinery and lighting in lighthouses. Mineral oil replaced whale oil in the 1860s, but into the early 20th century the cured skin was still used to make horse harnesses and machine belts for saw mills and shoelaces. The cured skin is the only cetacean skin that is sufficiently thick to be used as leather, and was used to manufacture some of the first bulletproof vests. 

Russia had large hunts, peaking in the 1930s at 4,000 per year and the 1960s at 7,000 per year, for a total of 86,000 from 1915 to 2014. Canada hunted a total of 54,000 from 1731 to 1970. Between 1868 and 1911, Scottish and American whalers killed more than 20,000 belugas in Lancaster Sound and Davis Strait.

During the 1920s, fishermen in the Saint Lawrence River estuary considered belugas to be a threat to the fishing industry, as they eat large quantities of cod, salmon, tuna and other fish caught by the local fishermen. The presence of belugas in the estuary was, therefore, considered to be undesirable; in 1928, the Government of Quebec offered a reward of 15 dollars for each dead beluga. The Quebec Department of Fisheries launched a study into the influence of these cetaceans on local fish populations in 1938. The unrestricted killing of belugas continued into the 1950s, when the supposed voracity of the belugas was found to be overestimated and did not adversely affect fish populations. L&#x27;Isle-aux-Coudres is the setting for the classic 1963 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Pour la suite du monde&quot;, which depicts a one-off resurrection of the beluga hunt; one animal is caught live, and transported by truck to an aquarium in the big city. The method of capture is akin to dolphin drive hunting.

=== Beluga catches by location ===
=== Predation ===

During the winter, belugas commonly become trapped in the ice without being able to escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular advantage of these situations and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag them onto the ice to eat them. They are able to capture large individuals in this way; in one documented incident, a bear weighing between 150 and 180 kg was able to capture a beluga that weighed 935 kg.

Killer whales hunt and eat both young and adult belugas. They live in all the seas of the world and share the same habitat as belugas in the sub-Arctic region. Attacks on belugas by killer whales have been reported in the waters of Greenland, Russia, Canada and Alaska. A number of killings have been recorded in Cook Inlet, and experts are concerned the predation by killer whales will impede the recovery of this sub-population, which has already been badly depleted by hunting. The killer whales arrive at the beginning of August, but the belugas are occasionally able to hear their presence and evade them. The groups near to or under the sea ice have a degree of protection, as the killer whale&#x27;s large dorsal fin, up to 2 m in length, impedes their movement under the ice and does not allow them to get sufficiently close to the breathing holes in the ice. Beluga whale behavior under killer whale predation makes them vulnerable to hunters. When killer whales are present, large numbers of beluga whales congregate in the shallows for protection, which allows them to be hunted in droves.

=== Contamination ===

The beluga is considered an excellent sentinel species (indicator of environment health and changes), because it is long-lived, at the top of the food web, bears large amounts of fat and blubber, relatively well-studied for a cetacean, and still somewhat common.

Human pollution can be a threat to belugas&#x27; health when they congregate in river estuaries. Chemical substances such as DDT and heavy metals such as lead, mercury and cadmium have been found in individuals of the Saint Lawrence River population. Local beluga carcasses contain so many contaminants, they are treated as toxic waste. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls between 240 and 800 ppm have been found in belugas&#x27; brains, liver and muscles, with the highest levels found in males. These levels are significantly greater than those found in Arctic populations. These substances have a proven adverse effect on these cetaceans, as they cause cancers, reproductive diseases and the deterioration of the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to pneumonias, ulcers, cysts, tumours and bacterial infections. Although the populations that inhabit the river estuaries run the greatest risk of contamination, high levels of zinc, cadmium, mercury and selenium have also been found in the muscles, livers and kidneys of animals that live in the open sea. The concentration of mercury in Beaufort Sea belugas tripled from the 1980s to the 1990s, but has decreased in Beaufort belugas as of the 21st century, possibly due to changes in dietary preference. Larger body sized belugas tend to have more mercury than smaller sized belugas, because they spend more time offshore, hunting prey such as cod and shrimp, which have more mercury.

From a sample of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River examined between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and is much higher than for other cetaceans and for the majority of terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals. For example, the rate of intestinal cancer in the sample is much higher than for humans. This condition is thought to be directly related to environmental contamination, in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with the high incidence of this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary are having a direct carcinogenic effect or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants&#x27; resistance to the disease.

Indirect human disturbance may also be a threat. While some populations tolerate small boats, most actively try to avoid ships. Whale-watching has become a booming activity in the St. Lawrence and Churchill River areas, and acoustic contamination from this activity appears to have an effect on belugas. For example, a correlation appears to exist between the passage of belugas across the mouth of the Saguenay River, which has decreased by 60%, and the increase in the use of recreational motorboats in the area. A dramatic decrease has also been recorded in the number of calls between animals (decreasing from 3.4 to 10.5 calls/min to 0 or &lt;1) after exposure to the noise produced by ships, the effect being most persistent and pronounced with larger ships such as ferries than with smaller boats. Belugas can detect the presence of large ships (for example icebreakers) up to 50 km away, and they move rapidly in the opposite direction or perpendicular to the ship following the edge of the sea ice for distances of up to 80 km to avoid them. The presence of shipping produces avoidance behaviour, causing deeper dives for feeding, the break-up of groups, and asynchrony in dives.

=== Pathogens ===

As with any animal population, a number of pathogens cause death and disease in belugas, including viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi, which mainly cause skin, intestinal and respiratory infections.

Papillomaviruses, herpesviruses, and encephalitis caused by the protozoan &quot;Sarcocystis&quot; have been found in belugas in the Saint Lawrence River. Cases have been recorded of ciliate protozoa colonising the spiracle of certain individuals, but they are not thought to be pathogens or are not very harmful. The bacterium &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot;, which probably comes from eating infected fish, poses a threat to belugas kept in captivity, causing anorexia and dermal plaques and lesions that can lead to sepsis. This condition can cause death if it is not diagnosed and treated in time with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. A study of infections caused by parasitic worms in a number of individuals of both sexes found the presence of larvae from a species from the genus &quot;Contracaecum&quot; in their stomachs and intestines, &quot;Anisakis simplex&quot; in their stomachs, &quot;Pharurus pallasii&quot; in their ear canals, &quot;Hadwenius seymouri&quot; in their intestines and &quot;Leucasiella arctica&quot; in their rectums.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Captivity ===
Belugas were among the first whale species to be kept in captivity. The first beluga was shown at Barnum&#x27;s Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the predominant source for belugas destined for exhibition. Throughout the early 1960s, belugas were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary. In 1967, the Churchill River estuary became the main source from which belugas were captured. This continued until 1992, when the practice was banned. Since then, Russia has become the largest provider. Individuals are caught in the Amur River delta and the far eastern seas of the country, and then are either transported domestically to aquaria in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi, or exported to foreign nations, including China and formerly Canada. Canada has now banned the practice of holding new animals in captivity.
To provide some enrichment while in captivity, aquaria train belugas to perform behaviours for the public and for medical exams, such as blood draws, ultrasound, providing toys, and allowing the public to play recorded or live music.

Between 1960 and 1992, the United States Navy carried out a program that included the study of marine mammals&#x27; abilities with echolocation, with the objective of improving the detection of underwater objects. The program started with dolphins, but a large number of belugas were also used from 1975 onwards. The program included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working under water, the location of lost objects, surveillance of ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring using cameras held in their mouths. A similar program was implemented by the Soviet Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in Arctic waters. It is possible this program continues within the Russian Navy, as on April 24, 2019, a tame beluga whale wearing a Russian equipment harness was found by fishermen near the Norwegian island of Ingøya.

Belugas released from captivity have difficulties adapting to life in the wild, but if not fed by humans they may have a chance to join a group of wild belugas and learn to feed themselves, according to Audun Rikardsen of the University of Tromsø.

In 2019, a sanctuary in Iceland was established for two belugas, Little White and Little Grey, that retired from a marine park in China. The Sea Life Trust Beluga Whale Sanctuary was created with support from Merlin Entertainments and Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC). Merlin bought the park in 2012, as part of an Australian chain, and it is one of their largest aquaria. Merlin has a policy against captive cetaceans, so they sponsored a 32,000-square-metre sea pen as a sanctuary. The 12-year-old belugas, caught in Russia and raised in captivity, do not know how to live in the wild. The cost is variously listed as ISK 3,000,000 (US$24,000) or US$27,000,000. Merlin was owned until 2015 by Blackstone Group, which also owned SeaWorld until selling its last stake in 2017 to a Chinese company which will use SeaWorld&#x27;s expertise to expand in China; SeaWorld still keeps belugas in captivity.
Belugas are displayed across North America, Europe and Asia. As of 2006, 58 belugas were held in captivity in Canada and the United States, and 42 deaths in US captivity had been reported up to that time. A single specimen costs up to US$100,000, although the price has now dropped to US$70,000. As of January 2018, according to the nonprofit Ceta Base, which tracks belugas and dolphins under human care, there were 81 captive belugas in Canada and the United States, and unknown numbers in the rest of the world. The beluga&#x27;s popularity with visitors reflects its attractive colour and its range of facial expressions. The latter is possible because while most cetacean &quot;smiles&quot; are fixed, the extra movement afforded by the beluga&#x27;s unfused cervical vertebrae allows a greater range of apparent expression.

Most belugas found in aquaria are caught in the wild, as captive-breeding programs have not had much success so far. For example, despite best efforts, as of 2010, only two male whales had been successfully used as stud animals in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums beluga population, Nanuq at SeaWorld San Diego and Naluark at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, US. Nanuq has fathered 10 calves, five of which survived birth. Naluark at Shedd Aquarium has fathered four living offspring. Naluark was relocated to the Mystic Aquarium in the hope that he would breed with two of their females, but he did not, and in 2016 he was moved to SeaWorld Orlando. The first beluga calf born in captivity in Europe was born in L&#x27;Oceanogràfic marine park in Valencia, Spain, in November 2006. However, the calf died 25 days later after suffering metabolic complications, infections and not being able to feed properly. A second calf was born on 16 November 2016, and was successfully maintained by artificial feeding based on enriched milk.

In 2009 during a free-diving competition in a tank of icy water in Harbin, China, a captive beluga brought a cramp-paralysed diver from the bottom of the pool up to the surface by holding her foot in its mouth, saving the diver&#x27;s life.

Films which have publicised issues of beluga welfare include &quot;Born to Be Free&quot;, &quot;Sonic Sea&quot;, and &quot;Vancouver Aquarium Uncovered&quot;.

=== Whale watching ===

Whale watching has become an important activity in the recovery of the economies of towns in Quebec and Hudson Bay, near the Saint Lawrence and Churchill Rivers. The best time to see belugas is during the summer, when they meet in large numbers in the estuaries of the rivers and in their summer habitats. The animals are easily seen due to their high numbers and their curiosity regarding the presence of humans.

However, the boats&#x27; presence poses a threat, as it distracts them from important activities such as feeding, social interaction and reproduction. In addition, the noise produced by the motors has an adverse effect on their auditory function and reduces their ability to detect their prey, communicate and navigate. To protect these marine animals during whale-watching activities, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has published a &quot;Guide for observing marine life&quot;. The guide recommends boats carrying the whale watchers keep their distance from the cetaceans and it expressly prohibits chasing, harassing, obstructing, touching, or feeding them.

Some regular migrations do occur into Russian EEZ of Sea of Japan such as to Rudnaya Bay, where diving with wild belugas became a less-known but popular attraction.

On 25 September 2018, a beluga was sighted in the Thames Estuary and near towns along the Kent side of the Thames, being nicknamed Benny by newspapers. The whale, who was noticed by conservationists to be traveling alone, appeared to be separated from the rest of its group, and is thought to be a lost individual. Subsequent sightings were reported on the following day, and continued into 2019, when local experts concluded that Benny had left the estuary.

On 13 May 2021, two beluga whales were sighted in waters around Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Canada. One whale entered the Charlottetown Harbour and travelled up the Hillsborough River to Mount Stewart, Prince Edward Island. As of 30 May the whale was still sighted in the area.

In August 2022, a beluga was found on the river Seine, France.

=== Human speech ===
Male belugas in captivity can mimic the pattern of human speech, several octaves lower than typical whale calls. One captive male beluga named NOC, pronounced &quot;No-see&quot;, caused a diver in a tank with him to surface by imitating orders to get out of the water. Subsequent recordings confirmed that NOC had become skilled at imitating the patterns and frequency of human speech, and intentionally altered his normal methods of vocalization to achieve these sounds. After several years, he ceased making these sounds.

Prior to 2008, the beluga was listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a higher level of concern. The IUCN cited the stability of the largest sub-populations and improved census methods that indicate a larger population than previously estimated. In 2008, the beluga was reclassified as &quot;near threatened&quot; by the IUCN due to uncertainty about threats to their numbers and the number of belugas over parts of its range (especially the Russian Arctic), and the expectation that if current conservation efforts cease, especially hunting management, the beluga population is likely to qualify for &quot;threatened&quot; status within five years. In June 2017, its status was reassessed to &quot;least concern&quot;.

There are about 21 sub-populations of beluga whales and it is estimated that 200,000 individuals still exist, which are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, the nonmigratory Cook Inlet sub-population off the Gulf of Alaska is a separate sub-population that is listed as &quot;critically endangered&quot; by the IUCN as of 2006 and as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Endangered Species Act as of October 2008. This was primarily due to unregulated overharvesting of beluga whales prior to 1998. The population has remained relatively consistent, though the reported harvest has been small. As of 2016, the estimated abundance of the endangered Cook Inlet population was 293 individuals. The most recent estimate in 2018 by NOAA Fisheries suggested that the population declined to 279 individuals.

Despite beluga whales not being threatened overall, sub-populations are being listed as critically endangered and are facing increased mortality from human actions. For example, even though commercial hunting is now banned due to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, beluga whales are still being hunted to preserve the livelihood of native Alaskan communities. The IUCN and NOAA Fisheries cite habitat degradation, oil and gas drilling, underwater noise, harvesting for consumption and climate change as threats to the prolonged survival of beluga whale sub-populations.

Beluga whale populations are currently being harvested at levels which are not sustainable and it is difficult for those harvesting beluga whales to know which sub-population they are from. Because there is little protection of sub-populations, harvest will need to be managed to ensure sub-populations will survive long into the future to discover the importance of their migratory patterns and habitat use.

Beluga whales, like most other arctic species, are being faced with alteration of their habitat due to climate change and melting arctic ice. Changes in sea-ice has resulted in changes in the area used by Chukchi belugas, since belugas spent less time in close proximity to the ice edge in comparison to previous years. Additionally, Chukchi Sea belugas spent a prolonged amount of time in Barrow Canyon on the Beaufort Sea side in October. Chukchi sea belugas also appear to be spending more time in deeper water presently, as opposed to the 1990s. Belugas also seemed to be taking longer and deeper dives. A hypothesis as to why this might be the case is an up-welling of rich Atlantic water in the Beaufort Sea may result in concentrated prey items like Arctic cod. The fall migration of Chukchi belugas is later, although summer and fall habitat selection has not changed. Fall migration of Chukchi belugas appears to be correlated with Beaufort Sea freeze up.

It is hypothesized that beluga whales utilize ice as protection from killer whale predation or for feeding on schools of fish. Killer whales can penetrate further into the Arctic and remain in arctic waters for a longer period of time due to reductions in sea ice. For example, residents in Kotzebue, have reported that killer whales have been sighted more frequently in Kotzebue Sound.

As annual ice cover declines, humans may gain access and disrupt beluga whale habitats. For example, the number of vessels in the Arctic for gas and oil exploration, fishing, and commercial shipping has already increased and a continuous trend may lead to higher risks of injuries and deaths for beluga whales.

In addition, it is possible that beluga whales may face by an increased risk of entrapment from leads and cracks freezing, due to the erratic nature of climate change. Abrupt changes in weather can cause these leads and cracks to freeze ultimately causing the whales to die of suffocation. An increase in urbanization will likely lead to higher concentrations of toxic pollutants in the blubber of beluga whales since they are at the top of the food chain and are affected by bio-accumulation. Loss of sea ice and a change in ocean temperatures may also affect the distribution and composition of prey or affect their competition. There is also some evidence that climate change can affect males and females differently. Since 1983, belugas have been increasingly scarce in Kotzebue sound. However, in 2007, several hundred whales were spotted in the sound, with over 90% of the whales being male. However, more research needs to be conducted to understand how climate change affects beluga whale sex aggregation.

=== Legal protection ===
The US Congress passed the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, outlawing the persecution and hunting of all marine mammals within US coastal waters. The act has been amended a number of times to permit subsistence hunting by native peoples, temporary capture of restricted numbers for research, education and public display, and to decriminalise the accidental capture of individuals during fishing operations. The act also states that all whales in US territorial waters are under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of NOAA.

To prevent hunting, belugas are protected under the 1986 International Moratorium on Commercial Whaling; however, hunting of small numbers of belugas is still allowed. Since it is very difficult to know the exact population of belugas because their habitats include inland waters away from the ocean, they easily come in contact with oil and gas development centres. To prevent whales from coming in contact with industrial waste, the Alaskan and Canadian governments are relocating sites where whales and waste come in contact.

The beluga whale is listed on appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. All toothed whales are protected under the CITES that was signed in 1973 to regulate the international import and export of certain species.

The isolated beluga population in the Saint Lawrence River has been legally protected since 1983. In 1988 Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada, a governmental agency that supervises national parks, implemented the Saint Lawrence Action Plan with the aim of reducing industrial contamination by 90% by 1993; as of 1992, the emissions had been reduced by 59%. The population of the St. Lawrence belugas decreased from 10,000 in 1885 to around 1,000 in the 1980 and around 900 in 2012.

=== Conservation research in managed care facilities ===
As of 2015, there were 33 individuals housed in managed care facilities in North America. These facilities are members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, aiming to understand the complex reproductive physiology of this species to improve their conservation. With the extreme difficulty of studying beluga whales in the wild and the lack of ability to collect biological samples or perform examinations on individuals, managed care facilities play a critical role.

Managed care facilities in North America have been able to work cooperatively to build upon the research of beluga whale reproduction and have made remarkable advances. Using operant conditioning, these facilities have trained beluga whales for voluntary biological sampling and examinations. Blood, urine, and blow samples have all been collected for longitudinal hormone monitoring studies.

In addition, beluga whales have undergone semen collection, body temperature data collection, reproductive tract examinations via transabdominal ultrasound, and endoscopic exams. With new technology, the reproductive characteristics of both the female and male beluga whale have been accurately described and has benefited captive breeding programs globally.

As more research is done, the management of beluga whales in managed care facilities can be greatly improved and may even help develop other cetacean breeding and contraceptive programs, such as that of the bottlenose dolphin. Through fetal health and gestation monitoring, facilities can be more equipped to deal with pregnant animals as well. While training has been done to collect beluga whale semen, only few facilities have been able to successfully do so as both saltwater and urine contamination need to be avoided. Improvement of this process will help increase the success of captive breeding programs.

== Cultural references ==
&quot;Pour la suite du monde&quot;, is a Canadian documentary film released in 1963 about traditional beluga hunting carried out by the inhabitants of L&#x27;Isle-aux-Coudres on the Saint Lawrence River.

The children&#x27;s singer Raffi released an album called &quot;Baby Beluga&quot; in 1980. The album starts with the sound of whales communicating, and includes songs representing the ocean and whales playing. The song &quot;Baby Beluga&quot; was composed after Raffi saw a recently born beluga calf in Vancouver Aquarium.

The fuselage design of the Airbus Beluga, one of the world&#x27;s biggest cargo planes, is very similar to that of a beluga. It was originally called the Super Transporter, but the nickname Beluga became more popular and was then officially adopted. The company paints the 2019 Beluga XL version to emphasize the plane&#x27;s similarity to the Beluga whale.

In the 2016 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), the character Bailey is a beluga whale and its echolocation abilities are a significant part of the plot.

<text>In computer programming, a weak reference is a reference that does not protect the referenced object from collection by a garbage collector, unlike a strong reference. An object referenced &quot;only&quot; by weak references – meaning &quot;every chain of references that reaches the object includes at least one weak reference as a link&quot; – is considered &quot;weakly reachable,&quot; and can be treated as unreachable and so may be collected at any time. Some garbage-collected languages feature or support various levels of weak references, such as C#, Lua, Java, Lisp, OCaml, MATLAB, Perl, Python and PHP since the version 7.4.

==Uses==
Weak references have a number of common uses. When using reference counting garbage collection, weak references can break reference cycles, by using a weak reference for a link in the cycle. When one has an associative array (mapping, hash map) whose keys are (references to) objects, for example to hold auxiliary data about objects, using weak references for the keys avoids keeping the objects alive just because of their use as keys. When one has an object where other objects are registered, such as in the observer pattern (particularly in event handling), if a strong reference is kept, objects must be explicitly unregistered, otherwise a memory leak occurs (the lapsed listener problem), while a weak reference removes the need to unregister. When holding cached data that can be recreated if necessary, weak references allow the cache to be reclaimed, effectively producing discardable memory. This last case (a cache) is distinct from others, as it is preferable that the objects only be garbage collected if necessary, and there is thus a need for finer distinctions within weak references, here a stronger form of a weak reference. In many cases weak references do not need to be directly used, instead simply using a weak array or other container whose keys or values are weak references.

==Garbage collection==

Garbage collection is used to clean up unused objects and so reduce the potential for memory leaks and data corruption. There are two main types of garbage collection: tracing and reference counting. Reference counting schemes record the number of references to a given object and collect the object when the reference count becomes zero. Reference-counting cannot collect cyclic (or circular) references because only one object may be collected at a time. Groups of mutually referencing objects which are not directly referenced by other objects and are unreachable can thus become permanently resident; if an application continually generates such unreachable groups of unreachable objects this will have the effect of a memory leak. Weak references (references which are not counted in reference counting) may be used to solve the problem of circular references if the reference cycles are avoided by using weak references for some of the references within the group.

A very common case of such strong vs. weak reference distinctions is in tree structures, such as the Document Object Model (DOM), where parent-to-child references are strong, but child-to-parent references are weak. For example, Apple&#x27;s Cocoa framework recommends this approach. Indeed, even when the object graph is not a tree, a tree structure can often be imposed by the notion of object ownership, where ownership relationships are strong and form a tree, and non-ownership relationships are weak and not needed to form the tree – this approach is common in C++ (pre-C++11), using raw pointers as weak references. This approach, however, has the downside of not allowing the ability to detect when a parent branch has been removed and deleted. Since the C++11 standard, a solution was added by using shared_ptr and weak_ptr, inherited from the Boost library.

Weak references are also used to minimize the number of unnecessary objects in memory by allowing the program to indicate which objects are of minor importance by only weakly referencing them.

== Variations ==

Some languages have multiple levels of weak reference strength. For example, Java has, in order of decreasing strength, soft, weak, and phantom references, defined in the package java.lang.ref. Each reference type has an associated notion of reachability. The garbage collector (GC) uses an object&#x27;s type of reachability to determine when to free the object. It is safe for the GC to free an object that is softly reachable, but the GC may decide not to do so if it believes the JVM can spare the memory (e.g. the JVM has much unused heap space). The GC will free a weakly reachable object as soon as the GC notices the object. Unlike the other reference types, a phantom reference cannot be followed. On the other hand, phantom references provide a mechanism to notify the program when an object has been freed (notification is implemented using ReferenceQueues).

In C#, weak references are distinguished by whether they track object resurrection or not. This distinction does not occur for strong references, as objects are not finalized if they have any strong references to them. By default, in C# weak reference do not track resurrection, meaning a weak reference is not updated if an object is resurrected; these are called short weak references, and weak references that track resurrection are called long weak references.

Some non-garbage-collected languages, such as C++, provide weak/strong reference functionality as part of supporting garbage collection libraries. The Boost C++ library provides strong and weak references. It is a mistake to use regular C++ pointers as the &quot;weak&quot; counterparts of smart pointers because such usage removes the ability to detect when the &quot;strong&quot; reference count has gone to 0 and the object has been deleted. Worse yet, it does not allow for detection of whether another strong reference is already tracking a given plain pointer. This introduces the possibility of having two (or more) smart pointers tracking the same plain pointer (which causes corruption as soon as one of these smart pointers&#x27; reference count reaches 0 and the object gets deleted).

==Examples==
Weak references can be useful when keeping a list of the current variables being referenced in the application. This list must have weak links to the objects. Otherwise, once objects are added to the list, they will be referenced by it and will persist for the duration of the program.

===Java===

Java 1.2 in 1998 introduced two kinds of weak references, one known as a &quot;soft reference&quot; (intended to be used for maintaining GC-managed in-memory caches, but which doesn&#x27;t work very well in practice on some platforms with dynamic heap like Android) and the other simply as a &quot;weak reference&quot;. It also added a related experimental mechanism dubbed &quot;phantom references&quot; as an alternative to the dangerous and inefficient finalize() mechanism.

If a weak reference is created, and then elsewhere in the code codice_1 is used to get the actual object, the weak reference is not strong enough to prevent garbage collection, so it may be (if there are no strong references to the object) that codice_1 suddenly starts returning null.
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

public class ReferenceTest {
 public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
 WeakReference r = new WeakReference(&quot;I&#x27;m here&quot;);
 StrongReference sr = new StrongReference(&quot;I&#x27;m here&quot;);
 System.out.println(&quot;Before gc: r=&quot; + r.get() + &quot;, static=&quot; + sr.get());
 System.gc();
 Thread.sleep(100);

 // Only r.get() becomes null.
 System.out.println(&quot;After gc: r=&quot; + r.get() + &quot;, static=&quot; + sr.get());
}

Another use of weak references is in writing a cache. Using, for example, a weak hash map, one can store in the cache the various referred objects via a weak reference. When the garbage collector runs — when for example the application&#x27;s memory usage gets sufficiently high — those cached objects which are no longer directly referenced by other objects are removed from the cache.

===Smalltalk===
|a s1 s2|

s1 := &#x27;hello&#x27; copy. &quot;that&#x27;s a strong reference&quot;
s2 := &#x27;world&#x27; copy. &quot;that&#x27;s a strong reference&quot;
a := WeakArray with:s1 with:s2.
a printOn: Transcript. 
ObjectMemory collectGarbage.
a printOn: Transcript. &quot;both elements still there&quot;

s1 := nil. &quot;strong reference goes away&quot; 
ObjectMemory collectGarbage.
a printOn: Transcript. &quot;first element gone&quot;

s2 := nil. &quot;strong reference goes away&quot; 
ObjectMemory collectGarbage.
a printOn: Transcript. &quot;second element gone&quot; 
===Lua===
weak_table = setmetatable({}, {__mode=&quot;v&quot;})
weak_table.item = {}
print(weak_table.item)
collectgarbage()
print(weak_table.item)
===Objective-C 2.0===
In Objective-C 2.0, not only garbage collection, but also automatic reference counting will be affected by weak references. All variables and properties in the following example are weak.

@interface WeakRef : NSObject
 __weak NSString *str1;
 __unsafe_unretained NSString *str2;

@property (nonatomic, weak) NSString *str3;
@property (nonatomic, unsafe_unretained) NSString *str4;

@end

The difference between codice_3 (codice_4) and codice_5 (codice_6) is that when the object the variable pointed to is being deallocated, whether the value of the variable is going to be changed or not. codice_3 ones will be updated to codice_8 and the codice_5 one will be left unchanged, as a dangling pointer. The codice_3 references is added to Objective-C since Mac OS X 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot; and iOS 5, together with Xcode 4.1 (4.2 for iOS), and only when using ARC. Older versions of Mac OS X, iOS, and GNUstep support only codice_5 references as weak ones.

===Vala===

class Node {
 public weak Node prev; // a weak reference is used to avoid circular references between nodes of a doubly-linked list
 public Node next;


===Python===

»&gt; import weakref
»&gt; import gc
»&gt; class Egg:
... def spam(self):
... print(&quot;I&#x27;m alive!&quot;)
»&gt; obj = Egg()
»&gt; weak_obj = weakref.ref(obj)
»&gt; weak_obj().spam()

»&gt; obj = &quot;Something else&quot;
»&gt; gc.collect()

<text>Navalsaz is a little village located in La Rioja, Spain. Its population is about 3 or 4 people in winter, and 10 to 15 in summer. It is in the municipality of Enciso.

It is most known for being in the Dinosaur Route, beginning it in Herce.

An important zone in the village is El Calbario, where Los Pajares are placed, with some beautiful buildings with great people living there.

Historically, the economy of the village was based on sheep, but today perhaps tourism is the most important axis of employment in Navalsaz.

Navalsaz festival takes place at the end of July. However, you can find whatever you want about it asking in a bar of Enciso.

<text>USS &quot;Vancouver&quot; (LPD-2) was a &quot;Raleigh&quot;-class amphibious transport dock, named after the city of Vancouver, Washington, which was in turn named after the famous north-west explorer George Vancouver. &quot;Vancouver&#x27;s&quot; was commissioned 11 May 1963 and served during the Vietnam War and 1991 Gulf War. She was decommissioned 27 March 1992, placed in reserve and stricken 8 April 1997. Title was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration 29 November 2001. &quot;Vancouver&quot; was towed for scrapping in Brownsville, Texas, in April 2013.

== History ==
Her keel was laid down on 19 November 1960 at Brooklyn, New York by the New York Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 15 September 1962 sponsored by Mrs. Stuart Symington, and commissioned on 11 May 1963.

After completing builder&#x27;s trials at New York City and shakedown training out of Norfolk, Virginia, the amphibious transport dock ship departed the latter port on 14 August and laid a course for the west coast. She transited the Panama Canal on 20 August and after making a side trip to Acapulco, Mexico, to assist a disabled fishing vessel arrived in San Diego, her permanent home port, on 31 August.

Late in September and early in October, &quot;Vancouver&quot; made the traditional visit to her namesake city, Vancouver, Washington, and then returned to San Diego for seven weeks of training. Underway training occupied the first four weeks while amphibious training took up the last three. In mid-December, she welcomed on board the newly appointed Secretary of the Navy, Paul H. Nitze, and the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, Jr., as well as several other high ranking United States Navy and United States Marine Corps officers, and treated them to a display of her multifaceted amphibious capabilities.

In mid-February 1964, the ship moved from San Diego to Long Beach, California, where she entered the naval shipyard for post-shakedown availability. She finished repairs on 21 May, completed final acceptance trials early in June, and then returned to San Diego. Late in June, the amphibious transport dock ship made another voyage north to Canada for a visit to another namesake city, Vancouver, British Columbia, in time to participate in that city&#x27;s annual maritime festival. On the way back home, she stopped in San Francisco, for the Independence Day weekend and then reentered San Diego on 7 July. At that point, she began her operational schedule. She participated in three amphibious warfare exercises between July and October and then began preparations for her first deployment to the Far East.

=== 1964 ===
Her first tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet coincided with the beginning of the rapid acceleration of American involvement in South Vietnam heralded by the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964—generally accepted as the beginning of the Vietnam War. She departed San Diego on 16 November, loaded marines at Port Hueneme, and set out across the Pacific on 18 November. &quot;Vancouver&quot; arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 6 December, and unloaded her passengers. Embarking another Marine battalion at Okinawa on 21 December she moved to Subic Bay in the Philippines, where she traded her second load of marines for a third which she transported to Okinawa in January 1965.

During the 1964 Christmas Holidays in Subic Bay, &quot;Vancouver&quot; had the honor of welcoming aboard the USO tour group consisting of Bob Hope, Jerry Calona, Anna Maria Alberghetti, Jill St. John and Ann Sidney (Miss World 1964).

=== 1965 to 1966 ===
After off-loading the Marines, &quot;Vancouver&quot; departed Buckner Bay, Okinawa on 15 January 1965 bound for Hong Kong for R&amp;R. After a paint job by , she left Hong Kong on 21 January, bound for Subic Bay, arriving on 23 January. She departed Subic Bay fully loaded with Marines and all their gear on 27 January for Da Nang, South Vietnam. She twice returned to Subic Bay twice without off-loading the Marines.

In February, the ship still loaded with elements of the Ninth Marine Expeditionary Brigade departed Subic Bay and took up station off Da Nang South Vietnam. She remained on station for the next 40 days. After 2 false starts she anchored in Da Nang harbor and, on 8 March in company with and , landed the first U.S. combat troops at Red Beach, Da Nang, South Vietnam. The Marines were to protect the perimeter of the Danang Air Base and free South Vietnamese troops for other combat duties.

She left Da Nang on 12 March, stopped over in Okinawa, departed there on 16 March and arrived in Numazu, Japan, then Yokosuka, Japan on 18 March. She spent almost 3 weeks in Yokosuka. She departed Yokosuka on 8 April, bound for Okinawa. She arrived at Okinawa on 11 April, then headed to Da Nang, South Vietnam arriving on 14 April. She moved to Huế, South Vietnam and off-loaded Marines there. On 19 April, &quot;Vancouver&quot; departed Huế for Subic Bay, arriving 20 April. She departed Subic Bay after a 2-hour stop, bound for Sydney, Australia to participate in the Battle of the Coral Sea celebration.

&quot;Vancouver&quot; crossed the equator for the first time on 24 April 1965 arriving in Sydney on 1 May. She participated in the Coral Sea celebration with open house tours of the ship. On 10 May, &quot;Vancouver&quot; departed Sydney for Melbourne, Australia arriving on 12 May. On 19 May, she left Melbourne, bound for Pago Pago, American Samoa. While in Pago Pago, three of the crew were lost in a swimming mishap caused by severe rip currents in one of the lagoons. She departed Pago Pago on 28 May and arrived in San Diego on 8 June. During her first deployment, from 18 November 1964 to 8 June 1966, &quot;Vancouver&quot; steamed 35,442 miles.

However, less than two months after her return, she embarked Marines for a special troop lift to the widening Vietnam War. She departed the west coast on 5 August 1965 and did not return until 5 October 1965. At that point, she began the normal schedule of upkeep and training exercises at San Diego and other points along the California coast.

During the first week in July, &quot;Vancouver&quot; embarked LVT-5s and Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 1/26 (1st Battalion, 26th Marines) in preparation for her second Seventh Fleet assignment. On 9 July, she put to sea and after a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor from 14 to 16 July, arrived at Subic Bay on 28 July. There, she became a unit of the newly constituted Seventh Fleet Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), Task Group (TG) 76.5—a self-contained mobile amphibious assault team made up of a Special Landing Force (SLF), marines and support units, and the ships which served as their transportation and mobile bases. In a series of training exercises held in the Philippines, the Navy-Marine Corps teammates honed their skills for an almost instant response to any need for amphibious support or reinforcement in the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s zone of operations.

Quite naturally, Vietnam constituted the area most in need of such a capability at that time. Accordingly, the ARG concluded its amphibious training on 12 August, reembarked the landing force, and sailed for the waters off South Vietnam. Between 16 and 29 August 1966, &quot;Vancouver&quot; participated in her first combat action during Operation Deckhouse III which consisted of two landings at a point some 60 miles (100 km) east of Saigon. The first phase, from 16 to 20 August, saw BLT 1/26 move ashore in both waterborne and airborne modes against minor opposition and later destroy a fortified Vietcong (VC)-held village. During the second set of landings, 22 to 29 August, the Marines sent ashore changed operational control from the ARG to the authorities ashore to assist in Operation Toledo a search-and-destroy mission to deprive the VC of caches of arms and supplies. At the conclusion of &quot;Deckhouse III&quot;, &quot;Vancouver&quot; returned to Subic Bay for ten days of upkeep.

Departing the Philippines on 12 September, the ship began her second amphibious assault, Operation Deckhouse IV, on 15 September 1966 in the vicinity of the Cua Viet River in Quảng Trị Province just south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The landings constituted a seaward arm of the larger Operation Prairie being conducted by American and South Vietnamese forces ashore to destroy North Vietnamese Army fortifications, bunkers, and supply caches in the area and to stem intensified infiltration across the DMZ. During their ten days ashore, the Marines of the SLF encountered heavy resistance and accounted for 254 of the enemy killed before they reembarked on 25 September. At the conclusion of the operation, &quot;Vancouver&quot; disembarked her portion of BLT 1/26 troops at Da Nang and headed for Okinawa.

After she embarked BLT 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines there, she returned to Vietnamese waters on 6 October and steamed with the contingency force in the area off the DMZ for the next 22 days. On 28 October, she disembarked BLT 3/3 and, two days later, embarked BLT 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines for transportation to the Philippines. She departed Da Nang on 1 November and arrived in Subic Bay on 12 November. During December, she participated in an amphibious exercise, &quot;Mudpuppy II&quot;, at Mindoro and conducted upkeep at Subic Bay. On 30 November, the amphibious transport dock ship got underway for Vietnamese waters and arrived near Vũng Tàu the following day.

=== 1967 ===
There, near the entrance to the Saigon River, she began another amphibious operation in the &quot;Deckhouse&quot; series, Operation Deckhouse V, on 4 January 1967. It lasted until 15 January and was a joint United States – South Vietnamese effort utilizing Marines of both nations. &quot;Vancouver&quot; embarked more than 500 South Vietnamese Marines at Vũng Tàu on 4 January and, after a two-day delay caused by bad weather, sent her binational force ashore on 6 January by both assault craft and helicopter. In spite of continued bad weather and her first experience with riverine operations, the ship and her boats remained in the area for ten days, providing the necessary logistics support for the SLF operating ashore. After reembarking the SLF and South Vietnamese Marines on 15 January and then disembarking the latter again at Vũng Tàu the following day, she departed Vietnam to return to the Philippines.

The ship arrived at Subic Bay on 19 January, but remained only two days before continuing on to Okinawa where she exchanged BLT 1/9 for BLT 1st Battalion, 4th Marines late in January. Following a visit to Keelung Taiwan where she couldn&#x27;t get into the harbor due to an impending typhoon, she returned to the Philippines early in February and conducted an amphibious exercise, &quot;Mudpuppy III&quot;, with the Marines of BLT 1/4. Another brief rest and relaxation period at Subic Bay at the end of the first week in February preceded her departure from the Philippines on 12 February. &quot;Vancouver&quot; resumed duty with the ARG on 14 February and, two days later, began her part in Operation Deckhouse VI, another two-phase amphibious assault in support of operations of wider scope being conducted ashore.

At the conclusion of Operation Deckhouse VI, the amphibious transport dock ship visited Subic Bay; Hong Kong; Okinawa, and Yokosuka, Japan, before departing the latter port on 24 March to return home to San Diego. After a three-day stop at Pearl Harbor at the end of the month, she arrived in San Diego on 8 April.

Following an unusually long period in port at San Diego, &quot;Vancouver&quot; resumed operations along the west coast in July. In addition to single-ship underway training, she revisited Vancouver, British Columbia, in July to participate in a Fleet Assembly as part of the Canadian Centennial Celebration. Late that month, the ship resumed local operations which included underway training and amphibious refresher training. That employment occupied her for the remainder of the year and the first month of 1968.

=== 1968 ===
On 1 February 1968, the ship departed San Diego bound for Okinawa to begin another tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 to 10 February and, after being diverted from Okinawa on 12 February, arrived in Da Nang on 23 February to disembark her marines, urgently needed to stem the 1968 Tet Offensive. The following day, &quot;Vancouver&quot; got underway for Subic Bay where she arrived on 26 February. On 27 February, she changed operational control to TG 76.5 and became part of the Seventh Fleet ARG once more. On 29 February, the ship steamed out of Subic Bay for the Cửa Việt River area of Vietnam where she began supporting the SLF, operating ashore since late January. While continuing that mission, she put into Da Nang on 10 March and spent the next two weeks repairing boats as well. In April, she steamed around off the DMZ providing support for BLT 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines until 10 April, when she headed back to the Philippines.

&quot;Vancouver&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 15 April and remained there until 26 April at which time she got underway to return to Vietnamese waters. The ship arrived on station near the mouth of the Cua Viet River and began providing logistics support to elements of BLT 3/1 committed to defensive positions in the vicinity of Cửa Việt Base and Đông Hà Combat Base. That duty lasted until 3 June, when she reembarked the SLF.

On 6 June, &quot;Vancouver&quot; began a combat operation, code named Operation Swift Sabre. The SLF moved ashore in two groups. One group assaulted beaches in landing craft while the other group flew well inland in helicopters. Both groups then began moving toward one another in a sweep of Elephant Valley in Thừa Thiên Province to eliminate a frequent source of hostile mortar fire on the Da Nang Air Base. After supporting the Marines for a week, &quot;Vancouver&quot; received a replacement SLF, BLT 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, when BLT 3/1 changed operational control to military authorities ashore. The new battalion landing team came on board on 14 and 15 June, and &quot;Vancouver&quot; set a course for the Philippines on 15 June. She entered Subic Bay on 18 June and began a ten-day upkeep period. Between 30 June and 3 July, the ship participated in the amphibious exercise &quot;Hilltop XX&quot; and then departed Subic Bay on 6 July for her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters during the 1968 deployment.

Immediately upon her arrival off Vietnam, she began preparations for the amphibious operation, Operation Eager Yankee. In the predawn of 9 July, destroyers and began the prelanding bombardment, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, as primary control ship for the boat phase of the assault, began shuttling Marines ashore some ten miles east of Phu Bai Combat Base The first elements of BLT 2/7 went ashore in LVTs and began establishing defensive positions and clearing landing zones for the airborne phase of the operation. The ship remained in the area providing logistics support for the Marines as they drove northwest toward a known VC haven. After a week without contacting the enemy, &quot;Vancouver&#x27;s&quot; landing force joined shore-based units in Operation Houston IV while the ship continued in her support role. The second operation ended on 22 July, and the marines reembarked that same day.

However, they did not remain on board for long because, on the following day, Operation Swift Play began. In that operation, an all-helicopter affair, the Marines landed well inland about ten miles southwest of Hội An in east central Quảng Nam Province. They failed to contact the enemy during the helicopter assault and, the following day, changed operational control to authorities ashore while &quot;Vancouver&quot; played her usual support role. She remained in the vicinity until 19 August at which time she headed back to Subic Bay without her Marine contingent.

The warship arrived in Subic Bay on 21 August and spent the next six days engaged in turnover operations with her relief, . On 27 August, she put to sea bound for Hong Kong where she arrived on 29 August. After a five-day rest and relaxation period, she departed Hong Kong for Okinawa. Diverted to Subic Bay by a typhoon, she continued her voyage via the San Bernardino Strait and finally arrived at Okinawa on 9 September. The following day, she set sail for Yokosuka, Japan, where she arrived on 12 September for five days of upkeep.

On 17 September, &quot;Vancouver&quot; began her voyage home. She reentered San Diego on 28 September and, after a month of post-deployment standdown, resumed local operations along the California coast.

=== 1969 ===
That employment lasted until early in February 1969 when she began the first portion of her regular overhaul at San Francisco. That phase of the task was completed in mid-April and, after a brief return to San Diego, the ship entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for drydocking. The refurbishing was finished near the end of May, and &quot;Vancouver&quot; returned to San Diego on 28 February. Following two months of inspections and refresher training, the ship loaded vehicles and cargo at San Diego and got underway for the Western Pacific on 1 August. She made a three-day stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 to 11 August; then resumed her voyage and arrived at Okinawa on 21 August. After unloading cargo at Buckner Bay, she got underway for Vietnam on 24 August. Upon arriving at Tau My, South Vietnam on 27 August, &quot;Vancouver&quot; unloaded cargo there and at Da Nang before departing Vietnam that same day.

On 29 August, she arrived in Subic Bay and began turnover operations to relieve of duty with ARG &quot;Bravo&quot; (TG 76.5). A week later, on 6 September, she put to sea with TG 76.5 for her first line tour with the amphibious ready group. She arrived off Da Nang two days later and entered the harbor on 10 September to unload more cargo. On 12 September, she and her group participated in Operation Defiant Stand by staging an amphibious feint about ten miles south of the actual landing beaches to draw off defenders while ARG &quot;Alfa&quot; stormed ashore. The task group completed its deception early that morning and headed back out to sea to steam around until needed again. That routine, punctuated by brief visits to Da Nang and a series of amphibious and other exercises, occupied her until late October.

On 20 October, &quot;Vancouver&quot; began a new phase in her participation in the Vietnam War. Operation Defiant Stand had been the last amphibious operation of the war. On the heels of President of the United States Richard Nixon&#x27;s announcement of the staged withdrawal of large numbers of American troops from the war, the amphibious ready group began carrying out the withdrawal. On 20 October, &quot;Vancouver&quot; moved from Da Nang to Cửa Việt Base and began loading elements of BLT 1/4. She completed Operation Keystone Cardinal on 22 October and set course for Okinawa the following day. She disembarked the Marines at Okinawa on 25 and 26 October but remained at the island for liberty until 2 November. After embarking BLT 1/9, she headed for Subic Bay where she disembarked the marines on 4 November.

Following a week of repairs at Subic Bay, she reembarked BLT 1/9 on 12 November, conducted an amphibious assault exercise on 13 November, and got underway for Vietnam on 14 November. The new line period, unlike those before, consisted entirely of steaming well off the coast outside the territorial waters of Vietnam in order that the amphibious ready group&#x27;s presence not be construed as a violation of President Nixon&#x27;s troop reduction in Vietnam. She continued steaming in the new operating area until 23 November at which time she retired toward the Philippines. She entered Subic Bay on 27 November. Another practice landing in the Philippines followed on 1 December and &quot;Vancouver&quot; repaired storm damage sustained during the transit from Vietnam to the Philippines.

=== 1970 to 1971 ===
On 6 December, the ship once more got underway for the coast of Vietnam. She arrived off Da Nang on 9 December; but, four days later, she left the combat zone for visits to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Okinawa. &quot;Vancouver&quot; returned to the Vietnamese coast on 31 December 1969. 1 January 1970, however, brought her departure from the area on her way back to the Philippines. She entered Subic Bay on 11 January and remained in the Philippines until 20 January when she started a round-trip voyage to Okinawa. The ship returned to Subic Bay on 27 January and remained in the area until 4 February when she headed for Taiwan. After a patrol of the Taiwan Strait, she entered port at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for a four-day visit. She returned to Subic Bay on 21 February and began turnover operations with her relief ship . On 4 March, she departed Subic Bay for Okinawa where she delivered cargo on 6 March. Continuing her voyage on 7 March, she stopped at Da Nang on 11 March, unloaded cargo, and headed back to Okinawa where she refueled on 14 March before continuing on toward the United States.

&quot;Vancouver&quot; arrived in Del March, California, on 27 March and, the following day, moved to the San Diego Naval Station for drydocking and repairs. Repairs were completed early in June, and the ship departed San Diego on 10 June with United States Naval Academy midshipmen embarked for their summer cruise. She arrived in Yokosuka on 24 June and departed again on 29 June. The ship visited [Hong Kong between 4 and 8 July and stopped at Da Nang on 9 and 10 July to load cargo bound for the United States. On the way back home, she stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 to 27 July and then reentered San Diego on 1 August. Local operations out of San Diego, including LVT training and amphibious refresher training, occupied the ship&#x27;s time through the end of the year and for the first three months of 1971.

On 30 March, &quot;Vancouver&quot; put to sea to return to the Western Pacific. She made a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor at the end of the first week in April and arrived in Subic Bay on 19 April. The ensuing six weeks brought amphibious training and port visits to Singapore and Kaohsiung. In June, the ship carried cargo from Vũng Tàu and Da Nang in the Vietnam to Subic Bay and Okinawa. Early in July, &quot;Vancouver&quot; participated in an amphibious exercise at Zambales and then departed the Philippines on 19 April for a week at Hong Kong. On 28 July, the ship returned to the Philippines at Mindoro for more amphibious exercises. August brought voyages to Sasebo, Japan, and Kaohsiung, Taiwan and, early in September, she returned to the Philippines for another round of practice landings at Zambales.

On 9 September, &quot;Vancouver&quot; left Subic Bay to pick up cargo in Vietnam. She stopped at Da Nang, Qui Nhơn, and Cam Ranh Bay before returning to Subic Bay on 17 September. On 25 September, she embarked upon a roundtrip voyage to Okinawa and returned to Subic Bay on 9 October. On 14 October, &quot;Vancouver&quot; set out on her voyage back to the United States, stopping en route at Okinawa and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego on 5 November 1971.

=== 1972 to 1974 ===
The amphibious transport dock ship remained in San Diego through the end of 1971 for post-deployment standdown and for the usual holiday leave and upkeep period. On 11 January 1972, &quot;Vancouver&quot; began local operations along the California coast. That duty lasted until 10 June, when she embarked midshipmen for the annual training cruise and got underway for the Far East. During the midshipman cruise, the ship made a visit to Yokosuka, Japan, and two each to Hong Kong and Subic Bay in the Philippines. Late in July, she headed back to the west coast, arriving at San Diego on 4 August. There, on 21 August, &quot;Vancouver&quot; began her regularly scheduled overhaul.

The ship completed post-overhaul sea trials early in February 1973 and conducted type and refresher training until mid-March. On 17 March, &quot;Vancouver&quot; again deployed to the Western Pacific. She arrived in Sasebo, Japan, on 4 April then continued her voyage on 5 April. She briefly stopped at Okinawa on 6 April and arrived in Subic Bay on 8 April.

On 9 April, she relieved as one of the support ships for Operation End Sweep, the clearing of American naval mines in the harbors of North Vietnam as a result of the withdrawal of American forces from the Vietnam War. During April, May, and June 1973, the amphibious transport dock ship alternated tours of duty in Vietnamese waters in support of the minesweeping forces with liberty and upkeep periods in Philippine ports. She also made periodic liberty calls at Hong Kong and at various Japanese ports.

The ship completed her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 18 July and headed back to the Philippines, arriving in Subic Bay on 20 July. For her remaining two months in the Far East, &quot;Vancouver&quot; visited Hong Kong, the Japanese ports Numazu, Kagoshima, and Iwakuni. She returned to the Philippines early in September, whence she put to sea on 19 September to return home. After stopping overnight at Pearl Harbor on 2 and 3 October, the ship continued on to San Diego where she arrived on 9 October 1973 and began a year of operations along the California coast. Her tasks included: helicopter qualifications, landing craft training, and full scale amphibious warfare exercises.

On 18 October 1974, she concluded her west coast schedule and got underway for the Western Pacific. She stopped at Pearl Harbor on 25 and 26 October and continuing her voyage on 26 October, arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 9 November 1974. Though assigned to ARG Alfa as relief for , &quot;Vancouver&quot; began her first real peacetime deployment to the Far East in more than a decade. For the next six months, she spent most of her time alternating between Okinawa and the Philippines conducting a series of amphibious exercises and transporting marines and cargo.

=== 1975 to 1976 ===
Having received orders on 13 February 1975 to proceed to rendezvous with ARG &quot;Alfa&quot; (TG 76.4) &quot;Vancouver&quot; consequently cancelled a port visit to Manila and a scheduled Convoy exercise and stood out, bound for the Gulf of Thailand. After operating in those waters (17–24 February), &quot;Vancouver&quot; and her consorts returned to Subic Bay on account of worsening weather on 25 February. In-port maintenance for ships and embarked aircraft ensued until 1 March at which time ARG &quot;Alfa&quot; sailed to return to the Gulf, to prepare for Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Cambodia. TG 76.4 conducted training and preparations (5 March-12 April), punctuating those evolutions with swim calls on 20, 22, and 30 March to permit her crew to enjoy some relaxation.

Eagle Pull commenced on 12 April 1975, with &quot;Vancouver&quot; utilizing helicopters and deploying marines from BLT 2/4 to conduct the evacuation. &quot;Due to the length of [the] preparations,&quot; her chronicler writes, &quot;most of the evacuees were to be airlifted to Thailand and only a handful were actually evacuated during Eagle Pull,&quot; with embarking the evacuees. TG 76.4 proceeded north upon completion of the operation, and disembarked the evacuees at Sattahip, Thailand. The ships then returned to Subic Bay on 17 April, greeted upon arrival by Admiral Maurice F. Weisner, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet.

The deterioration of affairs in South Vietnam, however, dictated a quick return to those waters. &quot;Vancouver&quot; and the rest of TG 76.4 sped out of Subic Bay on 18 April 1975, and headed for the coast of South Vietnam, rendezvousing with TG 76.3 -- carriers and and the guided missile light cruiser , the flagship for Vice Admiral George P. Steele, Commander, 7th Fleet—on 23 April. Five days later, &quot;Vancouver&quot;—placed on one-hour alert and detached for the purpose—proceeded to the mouth of the Batak River to serve as flight deck and wet well for refugees. During her time in those waters, the ship recovered six Air America helicopters, and later transferred the 123 evacuees via the ship&#x27;s embarked LCM-8s to the Military Sealift Command ship SS &quot;Pioneer Contender&quot;. Winding up those evolutions off the mouth of the Batak on 28 April, Vancouver proceeded north to rejoin TG 76.4.

The following day, 29 April 1975, Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of South Vietnam, began, &quot;Vancouver&quot; reprising her operations during Eagle Pull, utilizing her embarked helicopters and marines. &quot;Operations lasted all day and through the night with helicopters full of evacuees landing on any flight deck they could find clear,&quot; an observer on board wrote later, &quot;Not only U.S. helos but South Vietnamese ... shuttling refugees out to U.S. ships for future transfer to MSC ships. Plans and preparations made for Eagle Pull came in handy in Operation Frequent Wind. During the evacuation, &quot;Vancouver&quot; processed over 2,200 refugees.&quot; The evolutions over on 1 May, the amphibious ship, along with TG 76.4, steamed to Subic Bay, arriving on 3 May.

At the end of the deployment, she departed Okinawa on 20 May 1975 and arrived back in San Diego on 6 June, and resumed west coast operations almost immediately with type training and a weapons inspection. Similar duty occupied her through the end of that year and during the first nine months of 1976. On 25 September 1976, she headed back to the western Pacific once more. She made a three-day stop at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of October and put in at Kwajalein Atoll on the 10th for ARG commanding officers to conduct turnover briefings. From Kwajalein, she continued her voyage to Broad Sound, Australia, where she arrived on 21 October. There, she conducted a rehearsal landing in preparation for the Operation Kangaroo II landing exercises conducted between 24 and 29 October in conjunction with Australian military and naval forces. At the conclusion of Kangaroo II, &quot;Vancouver&quot; made a five-day visit to Sydney, Australia, and then got underway for Okinawa. She reached her destination on 20 November, disembarked one group of marines, and took on another. The following day, she headed for Subic Bay, arriving there on 24 November to begin a three-week availability. Late in December, &quot;Vancouver&quot; embarked upon a voyage to Taiwan and Hong Kong observing New Year&#x27;s Eve at the latter port.

=== 1977 to 1978 ===
After a return to Okinawa and Subic Bay early in January 1977, the ship visited Singapore during the latter half of the month. She returned to the Philippines on 11 February and conducted exercises in the vicinity of Subic Bay until mid March. On 16 March, the amphibious transport dock ship put to sea, bound for Inchon, Korea. During the latter part of March and early part of April, she participated in amphibious training with units of the South Korean military. On 12 April, she stopped at Okinawa and the next day headed back to the Philippines. &quot;Vancouver&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 16 April but departed again on 28 April for a round-about voyage home. She made stops at Okinawa, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego on 21 May. After a month of post deployment standdown, the ship entered the Bethlehem Steel Co. shipyard at San Pedro, Los Angeles, for her regular overhaul. She remained there into 1978.

&quot;Vancouver&quot; completed her overhaul satisfactorily on 18 April 1978. A rigorous period of refresher training out of San Diego followed in preparation for the ship&#x27;s forthcoming deployment to the Western Pacific. &quot;Vancouver&quot; departed from San Diego on 31 August and spent the remainder of the year in operations with the Seventh Fleet. Her schedule took her to Eniwetok, Marshall Islands; Subic Bay, Philippines; Pusan, Korea, and Hong Kong.

=== 1980 ===
&quot;Vancouver&quot; received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for 8 August 1980 to 11 October 1980 for service in relating to Iran and / or in the Indian Ocean. Commenced her 13th deployment leaving San Diego, Ca on 24 May 1980 operating in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean during the Iranian Hostage Crisis and participating in five major amphibious operations with embarked Marines. Port calls included Hawaii, the Philippines, Perth Australia, and Mombasa Kenya while crossing the equator. Returned to San Diego on 22 November 1980.

=== 1990 to 1991 ===
During the 1990/1991 Gulf War, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was assigned to ARG 3 embarking the Marine Fifth Expeditionary Brigade. &quot;Vancouver&quot; departed with the 13 ship ARG, 1 December 1990 and arrived in the North Arabian Sea 12 January 1991. The group conducted landing drills and although &quot;Vancouver&quot; was stationed off the coast of Kuwait during its liberation, the Amphibious Marines aboard were deployed into Saudi Arabia and further supported the 2nd Marine Division during ground combat to retake Kuwait. In May 1991, &quot;Vancouver&quot; provided support during relief operations in the aftermath of the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone. &quot;Vancouver&quot; returned to San Diego, via Pearl Harbor, in June 1991.

== Fate ==
&quot;Vancouver&quot; was decommissioned 27 March 1992 and mothballed in reserve status at Pearl Harbor until she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Benicia, California. Sold for scrapping 21 February 2013. She was relocated to the Mare Island Shipyard (former Mare Island Naval Shipyard) for dismantling preparation on 21 February 2013. She moved into dry dock on 8 March 2013. She was towed to Brownsville, Texas in March and April 2013 for scrapping. As of May 2013, she was being recycled at EMR&#x27;s International Shipbreaking Ltd. in Brownsville, Texas.

<text>The New Territories (N.T., Chinese: ) is one of the three areas of Hong Kong, alongside Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. It makes up 86.2% of Hong Kong&#x27;s territory, and contains around half of the population of Hong Kong. Historically, it is the region described in the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. According to that treaty, the territories comprise the mainland area north of Boundary Street on the Kowloon Peninsula and south of the Sham Chun River (which is the border between Hong Kong and mainland China), as well as over 200 outlying islands, including Lantau Island, Lamma Island, Cheung Chau, and Peng Chau in the territory of Hong Kong.

Later, after New Kowloon was defined from the area between the Boundary Street and the Kowloon Ranges spanned from Lai Chi Kok to Lei Yue Mun, and the extension of the urban areas of Kowloon, New Kowloon was gradually urbanised and absorbed into Kowloon.

The New Territories now comprises only the mainland north of the Kowloon Ranges and south of the Sham Chun River, as well as the Outlying Islands. It comprises an area of . Nevertheless, New Kowloon has remained statutorily part of the New Territories instead of Kowloon.

The New Territories were leased from Qing China by the United Kingdom in 1898 for 99 years in the Second Convention of Peking (The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory). Upon the expiry of the lease, sovereignty was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, together with the Qing-ceded territories of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula.

In 2021, the population of the New Territories was recorded at 3,984,077, with a population density of .

==History==
===Lease of New Territories===
Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 and Kowloon south of Boundary Street and Stonecutters Island in 1860. The colony of Hong Kong attracted a large number of Chinese and Westerners to seek their fortune in the city. Its population increased rapidly and the city became overcrowded. The outbreak of bubonic plague in 1894 became a concern to the Hong Kong government. There was a need to expand the colony to accommodate its growing population. The Qing dynasty&#x27;s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War had shown that it was incapable of defending itself. Victoria City and Victoria Harbour were vulnerable to any hostile forces launching attacks from the hills of Kowloon.

Alarmed by the encroachment of other European powers in China, Britain also feared for the security of Hong Kong. Using the most favoured nation clause that it had negotiated with Peking, the United Kingdom demanded the extension of Kowloon to counter the influence of France in southern China in June 1898. In July, it secured Weihaiwei in Shandong in the north as a base for operations against the Germans in Qingdao (Tsingtao) and the Russians in Port Arthur. Chinese officials stayed in the walled cities of Kowloon City and Weihaiwei.

The extension of Kowloon was called the New Territories. The additional land was estimated to be or 12 times the size of the existing colonial Hong Kong at the time.

===British assumption of sovereignty===
Although the convention was signed on the 9 June 1898 and became effective on 1 July, the British did not take over the New Territories immediately. During this period, there was no Hong Kong governor and Wilsone Black acted as administrator. James Stewart Lockhart, the colonial secretary of Hong Kong, was sent back from England to make a survey of New Territories before formal transfer. The survey found that the new frontier at Sham Chun River (Shenzhen river) suggested by Wilsone Black was far from ideal. It excluded the town of Shenzhen (Sham Chun), and the boundary would divide the town. There was no mountain range as a natural border. Lockhart suggested moving the frontier to the line of hills north of Shenzhen. This suggestion was not received favourably and the Chinese official suggested the frontier be moved to the hill much further south of the Sham Chun River. It was settled in March 1899 that the boundary remain at the Sham Chun River.

The new Hong Kong governor, Henry Blake, arrived in November 1898. The date for the takeover of the New Territories was fixed as 17 April 1899, and Tai Po was chosen as the administrative centre. The transfer was not smooth and peaceful. In early April 1899, the captain superintendent of police, Francis Henry May, and some policemen erected a flagstaff and temporary headquarters at Tai Po and posted the governor&#x27;s proclamation of the takeover date. Fearing for their traditional land rights, in the Six-Day War of 1899, a number of clans attempted to resist the British, mobilising clan militias that had been organised and armed to protect against longshore raids by pirates. The militia men attempted a frontal attack against the temporary police station in Tai Po that was the main British base but were beaten back by superior force of arms. An attempt by the clansmen at guerilla warfare was put down by the British near Lam Tsuen with over 500 Chinese men killed, and collapsed when British artillery was brought to bear on the walled villages of the clansmen. Most prominent of the villages in the resistance Kat Hing Wai, of the Tang clan, was symbolically disarmed, by having its main gates dismounted and removed. However, in order to prevent future resistance the British made concessions to the indigenous inhabitants with regards to land use, land inheritance and marriage laws; the majority of which remained in place into the 1960s when polygamy was outlawed. Some of the concessions with regard to land use and inheritance remain in place in Hong Kong to this day and is a source of friction between indigenous inhabitants and other Hong Kong residents.

Lord Lugard was governor from 1907 to 1912, and he proposed the return of Weihaiwei to the Chinese government, in return for the ceding of the leased New Territories in perpetuity. The proposal was not received favourably, although if it had been acted on, Hong Kong might have remained forever in British hands.

===New town development===
Much of the New Territories was, and to a limited extent still is, made up of rural areas. Attempts at modernising the area did not become fully committed until the late 1970s, when many new towns were built to accommodate the population growth from urbanised areas of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. Despite rapid development of the new towns, which now accommodate a population of over 3 million, the Hong Kong government confines built-up areas to a few areas and reserves large parts of the region as parkland.

===Sovereignty transfer to the PRC===
As the expiry date of the lease neared in the 1980s, talks between the United Kingdom and the People&#x27;s Republic of China led to the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration (1984), in which the whole of Hong Kong would be returned, instead of only the New Territories.

==Districts==
The New Territories comprises nine districts, each with their own district council:

*New Territories East
**North District
**Sai Kung District
**Sha Tin District
**Tai Po District
*New Territories West
**Islands District
**Kwai Tsing District (Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Island)
**Tsuen Wan District
**Tuen Mun District
**Yuen Long District

== Population ==
According to the 2021 census, the population of the New Territories was 3,984,077, representing 53.7% of Hong Kong&#x27;s total population. A total of 90.4% of the residents of New Territories use Cantonese as their main language. Meanwhile, 3.5% of its residents use English, 2.0% use Mandarin Chinese, and 2.3% use other Chinese dialects. A total of 93.1% the district&#x27;s population is of Chinese descent. The largest ethnic minority groups are Filipinos (2.1%), Indonesians (1.8%), South Asians (1.1%), Mixed (0.8%) and Whites (0.7%). 

== New Kowloon ==
New Kowloon covers the entirety of the Wong Tai Sin and Kwun Tong districts, as well as the mainland portion of the Sham Shui Po District (i.e. excluding the Stonecutters Island) and the northern portion of the Kowloon City District (portion to the north of Boundary Street/Prince Edward Road West, as well as reclaimed land including the Kai Tak Airport).

<text>Kowloon City is an area in New Kowloon, Hong Kong. It is part of Kowloon City District.

Compared with the council area of Kowloon City District, the Kowloon City area is 

== History ==
As early as in the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), Kowloon City was famous for its pearl production. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), Kowloon City was a part of Kwun Fu Cheung (), which was part of a salt yard governed by Chinese officials. During the late Song Dynasty, two young emperors, Zhao Bing and Duanzong, sought refuge at current day Kowloon City, roughly at present day Sung Wong Toi Garden, to escape from the growing Mongol Army. There are also historic relics and a temple which dates back to 800 years ago.

Part of the area was the location of the original Kowloon Walled City, erected during the Qing dynasty. This is now Kowloon Walled City Park. The former Kai Tak International Airport was also located in the district.

In 1982, Hong Kong was divided into 18 districts, and Kowloon City and its neighbouring areas, such as Hung Hom, have been part of the Kowloon City District since then.

Prior to 1998, a strict building height restriction was imposed in Kowloon City and over much of Kowloon to minimise the hazards of air traffic commuting through the Kai Tak Airport. The closure of Kai Tak as a result of the opening of the new Chek Lap Kok Airport lifted the height restriction and more high-rise apartments started to appear, with heights of up to .

In more recent years, rapid gentrification has taken place and new residential skyscrapers have replaced old tong laus. However, zoning plans have described some of these recent high-rise developments as undesirable and proposed a height limit of for new buildings in Kowloon City.

== Nearby sights ==
*The passenger terminal of Kai Tak Airport, a defunct airport
*Kai Tak Sports Park
*Kowloon City Plaza
*Kowloon City&#x27;s public market – one of the largest wet markets in Hong Kong
*Kowloon Walled City
*Holy Trinity Cathedral, the oldest church in Kowloon
*Sung Wong Toi Garden
*Hau Wong temple

==Features==
Kowloon City is an old district in Hong Kong; however, it has been transforming into a modern district with a lot of new shops and restaurants over the years. The district is well known for its wide range of cuisine. Other than the traditional Hong Kong-style restaurants that offer local dishes, there are numerous restaurants that offer Southeast Asian dishes like Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian.

Many Thai grocery stores can be found throughout Kowloon as well. Due to the prevalence of Thai restaurants and stores as well as the population of Thai-speaking ethnic Chinese, Kowloon City is also known as &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s Little Thailand&quot;. It is not only a food paradise for authentic main dishes of many cultures, but also a popular place for both traditional Hong Kong-style and western desserts. With a sizeable population from the Chiushan area of Guangdong Province, Kowloon City is also famous for Chiuchow-style braised dishes ().

== Transport ==
Major roads that serves the area definitely include:

*Boundary Street
*Argyle Street
*Prince Edward Road

Kowloon City is served by Sung Wong Toi station of the Tuen Ma line.

==Demographics==
In 2016, about 33% of the Thai people living in Hong Kong resided in Kowloon City. Accordingly, there is a concentration of Thai businesses there. Proposed redevelopment in 2022 threatened the Thai businesses.

==Education==
Pooi To Primary School is in Kowloon City.

Kowloon City is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 41. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Kowloon Tong Government Primary School.

<text>Zhu De (1 December 1886 – 6 July 1976) was a Chinese general, military strategist, politician and revolutionary in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Zhu was born into poverty in 1886 in Sichuan. He was adopted by a wealthy uncle at age nine and received a superior early education that led to his admission into a military academy. After graduating, he joined a rebel army and became a warlord. Afterward he joined the CCP. He commanded the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. By the end of the civil war he was also a high-ranking party official.

Zhu is regarded as one of the principal founders of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and was a prominent political figure until dying in 1976. In 1955, he was ranked first among the ten marshals. He was chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress from 1959 to 1976.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Zhu was born on 1 December 1886, to a poor tenant farmer&#x27;s family in Hung, a town in Yilong County, Nanchong, a hilly and isolated part of northern Sichuan province. Of the 15 children born to the family only eight survived. His family relocated to Sichuan during the migration from Hunan province and Guangdong province. His origins are often given as Hakka, but Agnes Smedley&#x27;s biography of him says his people came from Guangdong and speaks of Hakka as merely associates of his. She also says that older generations of his family had spoken the &quot;Kwangtung dialect&quot; (which would be close to but probably different from modern Cantonese) and that his generation also spoke Sichuanese, a distinct regional variant of Southwestern Mandarin that is unintelligible to other speakers of Standard Chinese (Mandarin).

Despite his family&#x27;s poverty, by pooling resources Zhu was chosen to be sent to a regional private school in 1892. At age nine he was adopted by his prosperous uncle, whose political influence allowed him to gain access to Yunnan Military Academy. He enrolled in a Sichuan high school around 1907 and graduated in 1908. Subsequently, he returned to Yilong&#x27;s primary school as a gym instructor. An advocate of modern science and political teaching rather than the strict classical education afforded by schools, he was dismissed from his post and entered the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming. There he joined the Beiyang Army and the Tongmenghui secret political society (the forerunner of the Kuomintang).

=== Nationalism and warlordism ===

At the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming, he first met Cai E (Tsai Ao). He taught at the academy after his graduation in July 1911. Siding with the revolutionary forces after the Chinese Revolution, he joined Brig. Cai E in the October 1911 expeditionary force that marched on Qing forces in Sichuan. He served as a regimental commander in the campaign to unseat Yuan Shikai in 1915–16. When Cai became governor of Sichuan after Yuan&#x27;s death in June 1916, Zhu was made a brigade commander.

Following the death of his mentor Cai E and of his first wife Xiao Jufang in 1916, Zhu developed a severe opium habit that afflicted him for several years until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued to support him, and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium habit and, according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Sun Yat-sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected for being a warlord.

=== Converting to Communism ===

In late 1922 Zhu went to Berlin, along with his partner He Zhihua. He resided in Germany until 1925, studying at one point at Göttingen University. Here he met Zhou Enlai and was expelled from Germany for his role in a number of student protests. Around this time he joined the Chinese Communist Party; Zhou Enlai was one of his sponsors (having sponsors being a condition of probationary membership, the stage before actual membership). In July 1925, after being expelled from Germany, he traveled to the Soviet Union to study military affairs and Marxism at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. While in Moscow He Zhihua gave birth to his only daughter, Zhu Min. Zhu returned to China in July 1926 to unsuccessfully persuade Sichuan warlord Yang Sen to support the Northern Expedition.

In 1927, following the collapse of the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng&#x27;s Nanchang uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng.

=== Zhu-Mao ===

Zhu&#x27;s close affiliation with Mao Zedong began in 1928 when, with the help of Chen Yi and Lin Biao, Zhu defected from Fan Shisheng&#x27;s protection and marched his army of 10,000 men to Jiangxi and the Jinggang Mountains. Here Mao had formed a soviet in 1927, and Zhu began building up his army into the Red Army, consolidating and expanding the Soviet areas of control. The meeting, which happened on the Longjiang Bridge on 28 April 1928, was facilitated by Mao Zetan, who was Mao&#x27;s brother serving under Zhu. He carried a letter to his brother Mao Zedong where Zhu stated, &quot;We must unite forces and carry out a well-defined military and agrarian policy.&quot; This development became a turning point, with the merged forces forming the &quot;Fourth Red Army&quot;, with Zhu as Military Commander and Mao as Party representative.

Zhu&#x27;s leadership made him a figure of immense prestige; locals even credited him with supernatural abilities. During this time Mao and Zhu became so closely associated that to the local villagers they were known collectively as &quot;Zhu-Mao&quot; In 1929, Zhu De and Mao Zedong were forced to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin following military pressure from Chiang Kai-shek. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CCP leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; however, he was not able to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CCP fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 break-out that began the Long March.

=== Red Army leader ===
During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai organized certain battles in tandem. There were few positive effects since the real power was in the hands of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong&#x27;s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan&#x27;an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, he held the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army and, in 1940, Zhu, alongside Peng Dehuai, devised and organized the Hundred Regiments Offensive. Initially, Mao supported this offensive. While a successful campaign, Mao later attributed it as the main provocation for the devastating Japanese Three Alls policy later and used it to criticize Peng at the Lushan Conference.

=== Later life ===

In 1949 Zhu was named Commander-in-Chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). From November 1949 to May 1955, he served as the first secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Zhu also served as the vice-chairman of the Communist Party (1956–1966) and vice-chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1954–1959). Zhu oversaw the PLA during the Korean War within his authority as Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, he was conferred the rank of marshal. At the Lushan Conference, he tried to protect Peng Dehuai, by giving some mild criticisms of Peng; rather than denouncing him, he merely gently reproved his targeted comrade, who was a target of Mao Zedong. Mao was not satisfied with Zhu De&#x27;s behavior. After the conference, Zhu was dismissed from vice chairmen of Central Military Commission, not in least part due to his loyalty for the fallen Peng.

In April 1969, during the summit of the Cultural Revolution, Zhu was dismissed from his position on the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the activity of the National People&#x27;s Congress was halted. In October 1969, Lin Biao issued a command named &quot;Order Number One&quot; that evacuated important martial figures to distant areas due to the tension between China and Soviet Union, and Zhu De was taken to Guangdong. In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Politburo Standing Committee.

He continued to work as a statesman until his death on 6 July 1976. His passing came six months after the death of Zhou Enlai, and just two months before the death of Mao Zedong. Zhu was cremated three days later, and received a funeral days afterwards.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage ===
Zhu De married four times, according to the unfinished biography written by Agnes Smedley. However, there is no evidence of his marrying the mother of his only daughter. His known relationships were with:

* Xiao Jufang ( or Hsiao Chu-fen). Xiao was a fellow student of Zhu&#x27;s at Kunming Normal Institute (). The pair married in 1912. Xiao died of a fever in 1916 after giving birth to Zhu&#x27;s only son, Baozhu.
* Chen Yuzhen (). After the death of Xiao Jufang, Zhu was advised to find a mother for his infant son. He was introduced to Chen by friends in the military. Chen had participated in revolutionary activities in 1911, as well as in 1916. Chen reportedly set the condition that she would not marry unless her future husband proposed to her in person, which Zhu did. The two married in 1916. Chen looked after the home, even building a study for Zhu and his scholarly friends to meet, which she furnished with pamphlets, books, and manifestos on the Russian October Revolution. In the spring of 1922, Zhu left his home to visit the Sichuanese warlord Yang Sen. According to Agnes Smedley&#x27;s biography, Zhu considered himself separated from Chen after leaving her and felt free to marry again, though there had been no formal divorce. Chen was killed by the Kuomintang in 1935.
* He Zhihua (). She met Zhu in Shanghai and followed him to Germany in late 1922.When Zhu was deported from Germany in 1925, she was already pregnant and later gave birth in a village on the outskirts of Moscow. Zhu named the daughter Sixun (), but relations between the two had diminished, and He Zhihua rejected his choice, naming the baby Feifei () instead. He Zhihua sent her daughter to live with her sister in Chengdu shortly after the birth. She then married Huo Jiaxin () in the same year. He returned to Shanghai in 1928. She reportedly betrayed wanted communists to the Kuomintang, before being blinded in a gun attack by Red Army soldiers that killed her husband. After this, she returned to Sichuan, dying of illness before 1949.
* Wu Ruolan ( or Wu Yu-lan). Wu was the daughter of an Intellectual from Jiuyantang () in Hunan. Zhu met Wu after attacking Leiyang with the Peasant&#x27;s and Workers Army. They married in 1928. In January 1929, Zhu and Wu were encircled by Kuomintang troops at a temple in the Jinggang Mountains. Zhu escaped, but Wu was captured. She was executed by decapitation and her head was allegedly sent to Changsha for display.
* Kang Keqing (K&#x27;ang K&#x27;e-ching or Kang Keh-chin). Zhu married Kang in 1929 when he was 43. She was a member of the Red Army and also a peasant leader. Kang was highly studious and Zhu taught her to read and write before they married. Kang outlived him. Unlike most women who joined the Long March, she did not become part of the propaganda unit marching at the rear. Kang fought by the side of her husband, distinguishing herself as a combat soldier, a markswoman, and a troop leader.

=== Children ===
* Zhu Baozhu () was born in 1916 and later changed his name to Zhu Qi (). He died in 1974 from illness.
* Zhu Min () was born in Moscow in April 1926 to He Zhihua (). Zhu De named her Sixun (), but she rejected this and choose Feifei (). He Zhihua sent her daughter to her sister in Chengdu shortly after her birth, where she went by the name He Feifei (). She pursued higher education in Moscow from 1949 to 1953 before teaching at Beijing Normal University. She died of illness in 2009.

<text>The Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), common teal, or Eurasian green-winged teal is a common and widespread duck that breeds in temperate Eurosiberia and migrates south in winter. The Eurasian teal is often called simply the teal due to being the only one of these small dabbling ducks in much of its range. The bird gives its name to the blue-green colour teal.

It is a highly gregarious duck outside the breeding season and can form large flocks. It is commonly found in sheltered wetlands and feeds on seeds and aquatic invertebrates. The North American green-winged teal (&quot;A. carolinensis&quot;) was formerly (and sometimes is still) considered a subspecies of &quot;A. crecca&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian teal belongs to the &quot;true&quot; teals, a group of small &quot;Anas&quot; dabbling ducks closely related to the mallard (&quot;A. platyrhynchos&quot;) and its relatives; that latter group in fact seems to have evolved from a true teal. It forms a superspecies with the green-winged teal and the speckled teal (&quot;A. flavirostris&quot;). A proposed subspecies, &quot;A. c. nimia&quot; of the Aleutian Islands, differs only in slightly larger size; it is probably not distinct.

Whether the Eurasian and green-winged teals are to be treated as one or two species is still being reviewed by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, while the International Union for Conservation of Nature and BirdLife International separate them nowadays. Despite the almost identical and highly apomorphic nuptial plumage of their males, which continues to puzzle scientists, they seem well distinct species, as indicated by a wealth of behavioural, morphological, and molecular data.

The Eurasian teal was first scientifically named by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of &quot;Systema naturae&quot;. His Latin description reads: &quot;[Anas] macula alarum viridi, linea alba supra infraque oculos&quot; – &quot;a duck with green speculum, a white line above and below the eyes&quot; – and his primary reference was the bird&#x27;s description in his earlier work &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot;. In fact, the description he used in &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; was the name under which the bird went in the &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot;, demonstrating the value of his new binomial nomenclature by compressing the long-winded names formerly used in biological classification into much simpler scientific names like &quot;Anas crecca&quot;. Linnaeus also noted in his description that earlier authors had already written about the Eurasan teal at length: Conrad Gessner had described it in the &quot;Historiae animalium&quot; as the &quot;anas parva&quot; (&quot;small duck&quot;) among his &quot;querquedulae&quot; (&quot;teals&quot;); Ulisse Aldrovandi had called it &quot;phascade&quot; or &quot;querquedula minor&quot; (&quot;lesser teal&quot;), and was duly referenced by Francis Willughby who named the species &quot;querquedula secunda Aldrovandi&quot; (&quot;the second teal of Aldrovandi&quot;). John Ray may be credited with formally introducing the name &quot;common teal&quot;, while Eleazar Albin called it simply &quot;the teal&quot;. As regards the type locality Linnaeus simply remarked that it inhabits freshwater ecosystems in Europe.

The scientific name is from Latin &quot;Anas&quot;, &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;kricka&quot;, the Swedish name for this species. The specific name of Linnaeus is onomatopoetic, referring to the male&#x27;s characteristic call which was already discussed by Linnaeus&#x27; sources. The scientific name of the Eurasian teal—unchanged since Linnaeus&#x27; time— therefore translates as &quot;duck that makes &quot;cryc&quot;&quot;; common names like the Bokmål &quot;krikkand&quot;, Danish &quot;krikand&quot; and German &quot;Krickente&quot; mean the same.

==Description==

The Eurasian teal is one of the smallest extant dabbling ducks at length and with an average weight of in drake (males) and in hens (females). The wings are long, yielding a wingspan of . The bill measures in length, and the tarsus .

From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, with a dark head, a yellowish behind, and a white stripe running along the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch&#x27;s forward end, curving along the base of the bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, and the rest of the body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the speculum feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff triangular patch in the center of the coverts at each side.

In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, somewhat darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks on the head and neck, and scaly spots on the rest of the body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (&quot;A. platyrhynchos&quot;) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake&#x27;s, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen&#x27;s rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.

Immatures are coloured much like hens, but have a stronger pattern. The downy young are coloured like in other dabbling ducks: brown above and yellow below, with a yellow supercilium. They are recognizable by their tiny size however, weighing just at hatching.

The drake&#x27;s bill is dark grey, in eclipse plumage often with some light greenish or brownish hue at the base. The bill of hens and immatures is pinkish or yellowish at the base, becoming dark grey towards the tip; the grey expands basewards as the birds age. The feet are dark grey in males and greyish olive or greyish-brown in females and immatures. The iris is always brown.

Moults during summer. Male in eclipse resembles female, but with darker upperparts and grey bill. Flight feathers are moulted simultaneously and birds are flightless for up to 4 weeks.

This is a noisy species. The male whistles &quot;cryc&quot; or &quot;creelycc&quot;, not loud but very clear and far-carrying. The female has a feeble &quot;keh&quot; or &quot;neeh&quot; quack. 

Males in nuptial plumage are distinguished from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, the lack of a vertical white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian teal breeds across the Palearctic and mostly winters well south of its breeding range. However, in the milder climate of temperate Europe, the summer and winter ranges overlap. For example, in the United Kingdom and Ireland a small summer population breeds, but far greater numbers of Siberian birds arrive in winter. In the Caucasus region, western Asia Minor, along the northern shores of the Black Sea, and even on the south coast of Iceland and on the Vestmannaeyjar, the species can be encountered all year, too.

In winter, there are high densities around the Mediterranean, including the entire Iberian Peninsula and extending west to Mauretania; on Japan and Taiwan; as well as in South Asia. Other important wintering locations include almost the entire length of the Nile Valley, the Near East and Persian Gulf region, the mountain ranges of northern Iran, and South Korea and continental East and Southeast Asia. More isolated wintering grounds are Lake Victoria, the Senegal River estuary, the swamps of the upper Congo River, the inland and sea deltas of the Niger River, and the central Indus River valley. Vagrants have been seen in inland Zaire, Malaysia, on Greenland, and on the Marianas, Palau and Yap in Micronesia; they are regularly recorded on the North American coasts south to California and South Carolina, including annual sightings on the island of Newfoundland.

From tracking wintering teal in Italy, most individuals departed the wintering grounds between mid-February and March, using the Black-Sea-Mediterranean flyway to reach their breeding grounds, from central Europe to east of the Urals, by May. This slow migration is due to long stopovers near the start of migration, mainly in south-eastern Europe.

Altogether, the Eurasian teal is much less common than its American counterpart, though still very plentiful. Its numbers are mainly assessed by counts of wintering birds; some 750,000 are recorded annually around the Mediterranean and Black Seas, 250,000 in temperate western Europe, and more than 110,000 in Japan. In 1990 and 1991, a more detailed census was undertaken, yielding over 210,000 birds wintering in Iran, some 109,000 in Pakistan, about 77,000 in Azerbaijan, some 37,000 in India, 28,000 in Israel, over 14,000 in Turkmenistan and almost 12,000 in Taiwan. It appears to be holding its own currently, with its slow decline of maybe 1–2% annually in the 1990s – presumably mainly due to drainage and pollution of wetlands – not warranting action other than continuing to monitor the population and possibly providing better protection for habitat on the wintering grounds. The IUCN and BirdLife International classify the Eurasian teal as a species of Least Concern, unchanged from their assessment before the split of the more numerous &quot;A. carolinensis&quot;.

The Eurasian teal is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Behaviour==
This dabbling duck is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble waders; despite its short legs, it is also rather nimble on the ground by ducks&#x27; standards. In the breeding season, it is a common inhabitant of sheltered freshwater wetlands with some tall vegetation, such as taiga bogs or small lakes and ponds with extensive reedbeds. In winter, it is often seen in brackish waters and even in sheltered inlets and lagoons along the seashore.

The Eurasian teal usually feeds by dabbling, upending or grazing; it may submerge its head and on occasion even dive to reach food. In the breeding season it eats mainly aquatic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insects and their larvae, molluscs and worms. In winter, it shifts to a largely granivorous diet, feeding on seeds of aquatic plants and grasses, including sedges and grains. Diurnal throughout the breeding season, in winter they are often crepuscular or even nocturnal feeders.

It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. The pairs form in the winter quarters and arrive on the breeding grounds together, starting about March. The breeding starts some weeks thereafter, not until May in the most northernly locations. The nest is a deep hollow lined with dry leaves and down feathers, built in dense vegetation near water. After the females have started laying, the males leave them and move away for shorter or longer distances, assembling in flocks on particular lakes where they moult into eclipse plumage; they will usually encounter their offspring only in winter quarters. The clutch may consist of 5–16 eggs, but usually numbers 8–11; they are incubated for 21–23 days. The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are attended by the mother for about 25–30 days, after which they fledge. The drakes and the hens with young generally move to the winter quarters separately. After the first winter, the young moult into adult plumage. The maximum recorded lifespan – though it is not clear whether this refers to the common or the green-winged teal—was over 27 years, which is rather high for such a small bird.

<text>The , ) is a dolmen in Elvillar, Álava, in the Basque Country of Spain. Three large vertical stones support a large horizontal flat stone. Nine large stones form a chamber in a polygonal shape. The corridor is flanked by five stones and divided into two sections. The site was probably a funerary construction to hold the remains of the people in the settlement.

It was discovered in 1935 by Álvaro de Gortázar in a fair state of preservation. José Miguel Barandiarán explored it partially in 1936, finding two stone hammerstones, a polished axe of ophite, fragments of pottery and human remains. The stone lying on top was found broken into three parts, but it was restored and replaced in its assumed original position during the 1974 restoration. The finds are preserved in a museum in nearby Laguardia.

<text>The green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis) or American teal is a common and widespread duck that breeds in the northern areas of North America except on the Aleutian Islands. It was considered conspecific with the Eurasian teal (&quot;A. crecca&quot;) for some time, but the two have since been split into separate species. The American Ornithological Society continues to debate this determination; however, nearly all other authorities consider it distinct based on behavioral, morphological, and molecular evidence. The scientific name is from Latin &quot;Anas&quot;, &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;carolinensis&quot;, &quot;of Carolina&quot;.

This dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters far south of its breeding range. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble waders.

==Taxonomy==
The green-winged teal was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas carolinensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;American teal&quot; that had been described in 1785 by John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; and in the same year by Thomas Pennant in his &quot;Arctic Zoology &quot;. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is Latin for &quot;duck&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;carolinensis&quot; means &quot;of Carolina&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Some authorities treat the green-winged teal as a subspecies of the Eurasian teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;).

==Description==
This is the smallest North American dabbling duck. The breeding male has grey flanks and back, with a yellow rear end and a white-edged green speculum, obvious in flight or at rest. It has a chestnut head with a green eye patch. It is distinguished from drake common teals (the Eurasian relative of this bird) by a vertical white stripe on side of breast, the lack of both a horizontal white scapular stripe and thin buff lines on its head.

The females are light brown, with plumage much like a female mallard. They can be distinguished from most ducks on size, shape, and the speculum. Separation from female common teal is problematic.

In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female.

It is a common duck of sheltered wetlands, such as taiga bogs, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing. It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. While its conservation status is not evaluated by IUCN at present due to non-recognition of the taxon, it is plentiful enough to make it a species of Least Concern if it were; it is far more plentiful than the common teal. It can be seen in vast numbers in the Marismas Nacionales-San Blas mangroves of western Mexico, a main wintering area.

This is a noisy species. The male has a clear whistle, whereas the female has a feeble &quot;quack&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The American green-winged teal breeds from the Aleutian Islands, northern Alaska, Mackenzie River delta, northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador south to central California, central Nebraska, central Kansas, southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and the Maritime Provinces. It winters from southern Alaska and southern British Columbia east to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and south to Central America. It also winters in Hawaii. Though less commonly seen, there are a multiple photographic records from countries in northern South America, such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.

Green-winged teal are abundant in wetlands of the Canadian parkland and northern boreal forest associations. They occur more often in mixed-prairie associations than in shortgrass associations. They also inhabit arctic tundra and semidesert communities. Within the above associations, green-winged teal commonly inhabit wetland communities dominated by bulrushes (&quot;Scirpus&quot; spp.), cattails (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.), sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.), pondweeds (&quot;Potamogeton&quot; spp.) and other emergent and aquatic vegetation. Green-winged teal frequently nest in grasses, sedge meadows, or on dry hillsides having brush or aspen (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.) cover. Near Brooks, Alberta, green-winged teal nests were found most often in beds of rushes (&quot;Juncus&quot; spp.), and in western Montana most nests were located under greasewood (&quot;Sarcobatus&quot; spp.).

Green-winged teal inhabit inland lakes, marshes, ponds, pools, and shallow streams with dense emergent and aquatic vegetation. They prefer shallow waters and small ponds and pools during the breeding season. They are often found resting on mudbanks or stumps, or perching on low limbs of dead trees. These ducks nest in depressions on dry ground located at the base of shrubs, under a log, or in dense grass. The nests are usually from water, but they avoid treeless or brushless habitats. Green-winged teal winter in both freshwater or brackish marshes, ponds, streams, and estuaries. As they are smaller birds, they tend to stay in the calmer water.

In northern areas of the United States, green-winged teal migrating to wintering grounds appear in early September through mid-December. They begin migrating into most central regions during September and often remain through December. On their more southerly winter areas, they arrive as early as late September, but most do not appear until late November.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Green-winged teal are among the earliest spring migrants. They arrive on nesting areas almost as soon as the snow melts. In early February, green-winged teal begin to depart their winter grounds, and continue through April. In central regions green-winged teal begin to arrive early in March with peak numbers in early April. Nesting chronology varies geographically. In North Dakota, green-winged teal generally begin nesting in late April. In the Northwest Territories, Canada, green-winged teal begin nesting between late May and early July. At Minto Lakes, Alaska, green-winged teal initiate nesting as early as June 1 and as late as July 20.

They become sexually mature after their first winter. The nest is usually concealed both from the side and from above in heavy grass, weeds, or brushy cover. Cattails, bulrushes, smartweeds (&quot;Polygonum&quot; spp.), and other emergent vegetation provide hiding cover for ducks on water. The clutch size ranges from 5 to 16 eggs. The incubation period is 21 to 23 days. The young fledge 34 to 35 days after hatching or usually before 6 weeks of age. Young green-winged teal have the fastest growth rate of all ducks.

The males leave the females at the start of incubation and congregate on safe waters to molt. Some populations undergo an extensive molt migration while others remain on or near breeding grounds. Females molt on breeding grounds.

===Food and feeding===
Green-winged teal, more than any other species of duck, prefer to seek food on mud flats. Where mud flats are lacking, they prefer shallow marshes or temporarily flooded agricultural lands. They usually eat vegetative matter consisting of seeds, stems, and leaves of aquatic and emergent vegetation. Green-winged teal appear to prefer the small seeds of nutgrasses (&quot;Cyperus&quot; spp.), millets (&quot;Panicum&quot; spp.), and sedges to larger seeds, but they also consume corn, wheat, barley, and buttonbush (&quot;Cephalanthus&quot; spp.) seeds. In marshes, sloughs, and ponds, green-winged teal select the seeds of bulrushes, pondweeds, and spikerushes (&quot;Eleocharis&quot; spp.). To a lesser extent they feed upon the vegetative parts of muskgrass (&quot;Chara&quot; spp.), pondweeds, widgeongrass (&quot;Ruppia maritima&quot;), and duckweeds (&quot;Lemna&quot; spp.). They will occasionally eat insects, mollusks, and crustaceans. Sometimes during spring months, green-winged teal will gorge on maggots of decaying fish which are found around ponds.

==Predators==
Common predators of green-winged teal include humans, skunks (&quot;Mephitis&quot; and &quot;Spilogale&quot; spp.), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), crows, and magpies (&quot;Pica&quot; spp.).

==Relationships==
mtDNA data-wise, this species is more closely related to the speckled teal than to the common teal. This would require that sexual dimorphism either was lost in the speckled teal or that it evolved in near-identical forms in the green-winged and common teal after the divergence of the green-winged and speckled teal lineages.

Both hypotheses seem rather spurious initially, with the green-winged teal and common teal&#x27;s male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and the tendency to gain, not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. An alternative explanation given the high frequency of hybridisation in ducks would be that the mtDNA of the present-day green-winged teal is originally derived from spotted teal females by introgression and thus the molecular data gives a misleading picture of the species&#x27; true relationships. This is supported by the observation that in mallard × American black duck hybrids, females of both taxa prefer the sexually dimorphic mallard drakes over the dull-plumaged black duck drakes; that the green-winged teal is in some aspects—such as the less contrasting nuptial plumage—intermediate between the common and speckled teal is also interesting to note.

Alternatively, the common teal might be derived from the green-winged teal, with the molecular difference being due to genetic drift or a founder effect in the latter and possibly speckled teal introgression in the former. The three teals certainly belong to a superspecies in the teals (&quot;Nettion&quot;); the ancestors of this group were most likely sexually monomorphic Southern Hemisphere forms (Johnson &amp; Sorenson, 1999; note that their &quot;African&quot; distribution includes Bernier&#x27;s teal taxa which like many Madagascar taxa is of Indo-Australian origin).

Another possibility is that the American lineage is derived from stray common teals, with the founder effect/genetic drift and/or hybrid introgression phenomena applying as above, only in the reverse direction for the former two. Still, this would require loss of sexual dimorphism in the ancestors of the speckled teal, but while extremely rare in dabbling ducks, it is not per se impossible.

The close relationship of speckled and green-winged teals suggested by mtDNA data could of course still apply to the taxa in general, not just to sequences in two maternally inherited genes in a few individual ducks (for which it without doubt does apply), but the overall failure of Johnson &amp; Sorenson to seriously take hybridization into account and their small sample sizes and obsolete conceptions of Indian Ocean biogeography do not help at all to resolve the issue, but in 1999, the methodology and interpretation were reasonable enough and in fact, the study was pioneering in many respects due to dense taxon-level sampling and still represents one of the default references for interpreting the phylogeny of the genus.

The post-copulatory displays of the common and green-winged teal are identical, but those of the speckled teal have some additional elements.

A firm conclusion cannot be reached at present beyond a tentative rejection of the phylogeny suggested by the mtDNA data. Nuclear DNA sequence information is required, but may not be sufficient, to resolve the puzzling relationships in the &quot;crecca-carolinensis-flavirostris&quot; complex of teals.

Components of the unsprung mass include the wheel axles, wheel bearings, wheel hubs, tires, and a portion of the weight of driveshafts, springs, shock absorbers, and suspension links. Brakes that are mounted inboard (i.e. as on the drive shaft, and not part of the wheel or its hub) are part of a vehicle&#x27;s sprung mass.

The unsprung mass of a typical wheel/tire combination represents a trade-off between the pair&#x27;s bump-absorbing/road-tracking ability and vibration isolation. Bumps and surface imperfections in the road cause tire compression, inducing a force on the unsprung mass. The unsprung mass then reacts to this force with movement of its own. The motion amplitude for small duration and amplitude bumps is inversely proportional to the weight. A lighter wheel which readily rebounds from road bumps will have more grip and more constant grip when tracking over an imperfect road. For this reason, lighter wheels are sought especially for high-performance applications. However, the lighter wheel will soak up less vibration. The irregularities of the road surface will transfer to the cabin through the suspension and hence ride quality and road noise are worse. For longer duration bumps that the wheels follow, greater unsprung mass causes more energy to be absorbed by the wheels and makes the ride worse.

Pneumatic or elastic tires help by restoring some spring to the (otherwise) unsprung mass, but the damping possible from tire flexibility is limited by considerations of fuel economy and overheating. The shock absorbers, if any, also damp the spring motion and must be less stiff than would optimally damp the wheel bounce. So the wheels still vibrate after each bump before coming to rest. On dirt roads and on some softly paved roads, the induced motion generates small bumps, known as corrugations, washboarding or &quot;corduroy&quot; because they resemble smaller versions of the bumps in roads made of logs. These cause sustained wheel bounce in subsequent axles, enlarging the bumps.

High unsprung mass also exacerbates wheel control issues under hard acceleration or braking. If the vehicle does not have adequate wheel location in the vertical plane (such as a rear-wheel drive car with Hotchkiss drive, a live axle supported by simple leaf springs), vertical forces exerted by acceleration or hard braking combined with high unsprung mass can lead to severe wheel hop, compromising traction and steering control.

A beneficial effect of unsprung mass is that high frequency road irregularities, such as the gravel in an asphalt or concrete road surface, are isolated from the body more completely because the tires and springs act as separate filter stages, with the unsprung mass tending to uncouple them.
Likewise, sound and vibration isolation is improved (at the expense of handling), in production automobiles, by the use of rubber bushings between the frame and suspension, by any flexibility in the frame or body work, and by the flexibility of the seats.

== Unsprung mass and vehicle design ==
Unsprung mass is a consideration in the design of a vehicle&#x27;s suspension and the materials chosen for its components. Beam axle suspensions, in which wheels on opposite sides are connected as a rigid unit, generally have greater unsprung mass than independent suspension systems, in which the wheels are suspended and allowed to move separately. Heavy components such as the differential can be made part of the sprung mass by connecting them directly to the body (as in a de Dion tube rear suspension). Lightweight materials, such as aluminium, plastic, carbon fiber, and/or hollow components can provide further weight reductions at the expense of greater cost and/or fragility.

The term &quot;unsprung mass&quot; was coined by the mathematician Albert Healey of the Dunlop tyre company. He presented one of the first lectures taking a rigid analytical approach to suspension design, &quot;The Tyre as a part of the Suspension System&quot;, to the Institution of Automobile Engineers in November 1924. This lecture was published as a 100-page paper.

Inboard brakes can significantly reduce unsprung mass, but put more load on half axles and (constant velocity) universal joints, and require space that may not be easily accommodated. If located next to a differential or transaxle, waste heat from the brakes may overheat the differential or vice versa, particularly in hard use, such as racing. They also make anti-dive suspension characteristics harder to achieve because the moment created by braking does not act on the suspension arms.

The Chapman strut used the driveshafts as suspension arms, thus requiring only the weight of one component rather than two. Jaguar independent rear suspension (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the upper wishbone arms of the suspension with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.

Scooter-type motorcycles use an integrated engine-gearbox-final drive system that pivots as part of the rear suspension and hence is partly unsprung. This arrangement is linked to the use of quite small wheels, further affecting their poor reputation for road-holding.

<doc id="230946" wikidata="Q5988110" url="?curid=230946" title="Idea–expression distinction">
<text>The idea–expression distinction or idea–expression dichotomy is a legal doctrine in the United States that limits the scope of copyright protection by differentiating an idea from the expression or manifestation of that idea.

Unlike patents, which may confer proprietary rights in relation to general ideas and concepts &quot;per se&quot; when construed as methods, copyrights cannot confer such rights. An adventure novel provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any artwork contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or genre of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a quest, but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are patentable, they may be the subject of various patent claims, which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. Arthur C. Clarke, for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a geostationary satellite used as a telecommunications relay) in a 1945 paper that was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed at Bell Labs.

==Legal origins and status==
Philosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.
In the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words.
At the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.

In the United States, the doctrine originated from the 1879 Supreme Court case of &quot;Baker v. Selden&quot;. The Supreme Court held in &quot;Selden&quot; that, while exclusive rights to the &quot;useful arts&quot; (in this case bookkeeping) described in a book might be available by patent, only the description itself was protectable by copyright. In later cases, the Supreme Court has stated that &quot;unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea—not the idea itself,&quot; and that &quot;copyright&#x27;s idea/expression dichotomy &#x27;strike[s] a definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author&#x27;s expression.&#x27;&quot;

In the English decision of &quot;Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers Ltd.&quot; (1938) Ch 106, the court illustrated the concept by stating that &quot;the person who has clothed the idea in form, whether by means of a picture, a play or a book&quot; owns the copyright. In the Australian decision of &quot;Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co. Ltd v. Taylor&quot; (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 498, Latham CJ used the analogy of reporting a person&#x27;s fall from a bus: the first person to do so could not use the law of copyright to stop other people from announcing this fact.

Today, Article 1.2 of the European Union Software Directive expressly excludes from copyright ideas and principles that underlie any element of a computer program, including those that underlie its interfaces. As stated by the European Court of Justice in SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd., &quot;to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolize ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development.&quot;

==&quot;Scènes à faire&quot;==
Some courts have recognized that particular ideas can be expressed effectively only by using certain elements or background. There are certain archetypal characters and even types of scenes that are frequently used by authors, due to both necessity to conform to genre conventions or even because the intended audience expects such archetypes. The French name for the doctrine that protects the use of these archetypes is called &quot;Scènes à faire&quot;. Therefore, even the expression in these circumstances is unprotected, or extremely limited to verbatim copying only. This is true in the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries.

The term &quot;Scenes a faire&quot; means &quot;obligatory scene&quot;, a scene in a play that the audience &quot;has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction.&quot; The term was applied to copyright law in &quot;Cain v. Universal Pictures&quot; (1942), where the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ruled that &quot;... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists.&quot;
The concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.
The term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,
or a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.
Another court said &quot;Under the ... doctrine of &quot;scènes à faire&quot;, courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea.&quot;
The concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.

In the United States it is recognized that certain background elements are universal or at least commonplace in some types of work. For example, in &quot;Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.&quot;, 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986), the Second Circuit said that in a film about cops in the South Bronx it was inevitable that the scenery would include drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes, and rats. In &quot;Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.&quot;, 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993), the Tenth Circuit held that hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices were unprotectable &quot;scènes à faire&quot; for computer programs. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the &quot;scènes à faire&quot; doctrine for South Bronx movies. In cases that, &quot;held that scenes a faire . . . are not copyrightable,&quot; outcomes were due to a, &quot;failure of the author to add anything original to the stock idea, rather than upon the impossibility of expressing the stock idea in a new form.&quot;

==Merger doctrine==
A broader but related concept is the merger doctrine. Some ideas can be expressed intelligibly only in one or a limited number of ways. The rules of a game provide an example. For example, in &quot;Morrisey v. Proctor &amp; Gamble&quot; 379 F.2d 675 (1st Cir. 1967), a set of rules for sweepstakes based on entrants&#x27; social security numbers was not copyrightable because there were only a limited number of ways to express the underlying idea of the sweepstakes instructions. In such cases the expression merges with the idea and is therefore not protected.

There are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.
In this case, the &quot;merger doctrine&quot; comes into play.
The fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.
The merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.
The merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.
However, in 1994 a U.K. judge in &quot;Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance&quot; [FSR 275] cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that &quot;if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright.&quot;

United States courts are divided on whether merger prevents copyrightability in the first place, or should instead be considered when determining if the defendant copied protected expression. Only one federal circuit, the Ninth Circuit, has specifically held that merger should be considered a &quot;defense&quot; to copyright infringement, but this is not considered an affirmative defense as the plaintiff still carries the burden of proof that infringement occurred.

==Criticism==

A difficulty posed by the idea-expression distinction is that &quot;[n]obody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can&quot;, as Judge Learned Hand wrote for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1930&#x27;s &quot;Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.&quot;, holding that while a fictional character &quot;can&quot; be copyrighted, it must be well-developed. Thirty years later, Hand reiterated that point in a case that held print patterns on fabrics copyrightable: &quot;Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the &#x27;idea,&#x27; and has borrowed its &#x27;expression.&#x27; Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.&quot;

The extension of the concept to visual art has vexed later courts. In 1978, the Third Circuit heard &quot;Franklin Mint Corp. v. National Wildlife Art Exchange&quot;, where the plaintiff alleged a painter&#x27;s work for the defendant was so similar to one it had previously commissioned as to be infringing. Judge Joseph F. Weis Jr. wrote:

He also observed that under the distinction, a painter&#x27;s copyright might be dependent on how stylized their work was, with a more realism-oriented artist like the one whose works were at the center of the instant case having a more difficult case for copyright infringement than the Impressionist Monet. In a case a few years later holding that the television series &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; did not infringe on the copyright for live-action depictions of Superman since the caped, flying superhero on the show had many significant differences, Judge Jon O. Newman of the Second Circuit commented that adaptations from a textual medium to a visual one created additional problems in resolving idea-expression questions since the former is meant to be perceived linearly while the latter is taken in in its entirety.

In 2005, considering &quot;Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co.&quot;, where a &quot;photograph&quot; was alleged to have been imitated too indistinctly, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York recounted the earlier cases and elaborated on those difficulties:

<text>Arnedo is the third largest town in La Rioja, Spain. It is located near Calahorra, and has a population of about 15,000 people.

Its economy is based on the shoe industry.

==History==
The area of Arnedo has been inhabited as early as the Neolithic Age. In pre-Roman times it was known as Sadacia or Sidacia, while the current name derives from the Latin &quot;Arenetum&quot; (&quot;Place of sand&quot;); the Romans, who arrived here in the 2nd century BC replacing the Celtiberians, built here a fortification to defend the hill, which commanded an important communication hub. Of the Visigothic Age are remains of a 6th-century cave-church.

The Moors conquered Arnedo in the 8th century AD and made it the capital of one of the 26 provinces in which they divided Iberia. The town was conquered by the Christian king Sancho I of Pamplona in 908-909.

On 5 January, 1932, there was a clash between the Guardia Civil and a group of striking workers. The police fired into the crowd killing 11 people and wounding another 30.

<doc id="230949" wikidata="Q459188" url="?curid=230949" title="Kingdom of the Isles">
<text>The Kingdom of the Isles, also known as Sodor, was a Norse-Gaelic kingdom comprising the Isle of Man, the Hebrides and the islands of the Clyde from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norsemen as the , or &quot;Southern Isles&quot; as distinct from the or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. In Scottish Gaelic, the kingdom is known as . The territory is sometimes called the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title. The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period. At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney. At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory. The islands have a total land area of over and extend for more than from north to south.

Viking influence in the area began in the late 8th century, and whilst there is no doubt that the dynasty played a prominent role in this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.

The contains mention of several persons who are said to have come to Iceland from Sodor, which appears to be these , before or around the middle of the 10th century.

An invasion by Magnus Barefoot in the late 11th century resulted in a brief period of direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship. This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled, on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two. Just over a century later, the islands became part of the Kingdom of Scotland, following the 1266 Treaty of Perth.

==Geography==

The principal islands under consideration are as follows:
* The Isle of Man, located in the Irish Sea, equidistant from modern England, Ulster, Scotland and Wales.
* The islands of the Firth of Clyde some to the north, the largest of which are Bute and Arran.
* The southern Inner Hebrides to the west and north of the Kintyre peninsula, including Islay, Jura, Mull and Iona.
* The Inner Hebrides to the north of Ardnamurchan, made up of the Small Isles (including Eigg and Rùm), Skye, Raasay and their outliers.
* The Outer Hebrides, aka the &quot;Long Island&quot; to the west, separated from the northern Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch.

These islands, often referred to as the Sudreys, have a total land area of approximately of which:
* the Isle of Man is , 7% of the total
* the Islands of the Clyde , 7% of the total
* the Inner Hebrides , 50% of the total and
*the Outer Hebrides , 36% of the total.

Anglesey in modern Wales may also have been part of the insular Viking world from an early stage.

Orkney is some east-northeast of the Outer Hebrides, Shetland is a further further northeast and Norway some due east of Shetland. The total distance from the southern tip of the Isle of Man to the Butt of Lewis, the northern extremity of the Outer Hebrides, is approximately .

==Early history==

===Sources===

The presence of the monastery on Iona led to this part of Scotland being relatively well documented from the mid-6th to the mid-9th centuries. However, from 849 on, when Columba&#x27;s relics were removed in the face of Viking incursions, written evidence from local sources all but vanishes for three hundred years. The sources for information about the Hebrides and indeed much of northern Scotland from the 8th to the 11th century are thus almost exclusively Irish, English or Norse. The main Norse text is the , which should be treated with care as it was based on oral traditions and not written down by an Icelandic scribe until the early 13th century. The English and Irish sources are more contemporary, but may have &quot;led to a southern bias in the story&quot;, especially as much of the Hebridean archipelago became Norse-speaking during the period under consideration. The archaeological record for this period is relatively scant, particularly in comparison to the numerous Neolithic and Iron Age finds in the area.

Scholarly interpretations of the period &quot;have led to widely divergent reconstructions of Viking Age Scotland&quot; and Barrett (2008) has identified four competing theories, none of which he regards as proven.

It is clear that the word &quot;king&quot;, as used by and of the rulers of Norwegian descent in the isles, was not intended to convey sovereign rule (that is, that of a High King). This is different from the way the word was used in the emerging Kingdom of Scotland at the time. It should also be borne in mind that different kings may have ruled over very different areas and that few of them can be seen as exerting any kind of close control over this &quot;far-flung sea kingdom&quot;. Precise dates are sometimes a matter of debate amongst historians.

===Early Viking incursions in the Hebrides===

Prior to the Viking incursions the southern Hebrides formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of (or Dalriada). North of , the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control although the historical record is sparse. According to Ó Corráin (1998) &quot;when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable&quot;, although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. &quot;All the islands of Britain&quot; were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806. Various named Viking leaders, who were probably based in Scotland, appear in the Irish annals: in 837, in 845 and in 847. Another early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records is that there was a king of &quot;Viking Scotland&quot; whose heir, , took an army to Ireland in 848.

In the 9th century, the first references to the (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;foreign Gaels&quot;) appear. This term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed Scandinavian–Celtic descent and/or culture who became dominant in southwest Scotland, parts of northern England and the isles.

According to the , in about 872 Harald Fairhair became king of a united Norway and many of his opponents fled to the islands of Scotland including the Hebrides of the west coast, and the Northern Isles. Harald pursued his enemies and incorporated the Northern Isles into his kingdom in 875 and then, perhaps a little over a decade later, the Hebrides as well. The following year the local Viking chieftains of the Hebrides rebelled. Harald then sent Ketill Flatnose to subdue them, which he did quickly, but then he declared himself an independent &quot;King of the Isles&quot;, a title he retained for the rest of his life. is also sometimes equated with , a reported leader of the fighting in Ireland in 857, although this connection is far from definite. left no successors and there is little record of the succeeding four decades. However, Woolf (2007) suggests that his appearance in the sagas &quot;looks very much like a story created in later days to legitimise Norwegian claims to sovereignty in the region&quot;.

There are similar problems with the provenance of , the supposed 9th-century ruler of the Hebrides and ancestor of Clan Donald. It has been suggested that his appearance looks &quot;very much like the product of fourteenth-century propagandists from Clann Donald&quot;.

===House of ===
In 870 Dumbarton was besieged by  and , &quot;the two kings of the Northmen&quot;, who &quot;returned to Dublin from Britain&quot; the following year with numerous captives. It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then. is described as the &quot;son of the king of &quot; in the &quot;Fragmentary Annals of Ireland&quot; and Ó Corráin (1998) argues that &quot;is Viking Scotland and probably includes Man&quot; at this time suggesting an early date for an organised Kingdom of the Isles. In the same source is also recorded as having gone to the aid of his father , who was under assault from Vikings in in about 872. died in 873 and may have been succeeded briefly by who also died that year. probably died in 874. A lament for , a Pictish king who died in 878, suggests Kintyre may have been lost to his kingdom at that time. The Norse may have taken the Isle of Man in 877 and they certainly held it by 900. In 902 the Vikings were expelled from Dublin for up to a dozen years, and a year later , the &quot;grandson of &quot; was killed in battle with the forces of Constantine II in mainland Scotland. However these events were setbacks for the Norse rather than a definitive moment. Internecine fighting is recorded in the Annals of Ulster of 914, which describe &#x27;s defeat of in a naval battle off the Isle of Man.

The first four decades of the 10th century are an obscure period so far as the Hebrides are concerned. It is possible that , who probably ruled Mann during this period may have had some influence. However, is the next King of the Isles on record. After the death of in 941, became King of Northumbria and probably succeeded his cousin as King of Mann. The former is recorded as being the , suggesting he may have been the first King of both Mann and the Western Isles of Scotland.

, who died some four decades later in 980 or 981 whilst in &quot;religious retirement&quot; on Iona, was succeeded by , who was probably his nephew. &#x27;s brother then succeeded him. During their lifetimes these two &quot;sons of Harald&quot; are known to have launched at least two major expeditions against Ireland, and the latter is recorded as having won &quot;the battle of Man&quot; in 987. Iona was sacked twice, in 986 and 987, &#x27;s later piety notwithstanding. This battle of Man, recorded by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, is said to have been won by and &quot;the Danes&quot; – possibly forces directly from Scandinavia under the command of Olaf Tryggvason. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record Gofraid&#x27;s death in Dalriada in 989, describing him as &quot;king of &quot; although it is not clear if this was a completely new term or had originally been used earlier, perhaps to refer to &#x27;s island kingdom. The complex geography of western Scotland and the lack of written records makes certainty about the extent and nature of these kingdoms hard to fathom. For example, the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; indicates that almost all these kings who reigned from the mid-10th to the late 11th century were buried on Iona. This may mean that Iona and Mull lay either within or close to the emerging Kingdom of Scotland. Furthermore, two records in the &quot;Annals of Innisfallen&quot; hint that the Western Isles may not have been &quot;organised into a kingdom or earldom&quot; at this time but rather that they were &quot;ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs&quot;.

===Earls of Orkney and kings of Dublin===

At this point the once again becomes the main source of information about the north. In 990 Sigurd the Stout, Earl of Orkney took control of the Hebrides, and placed a called in charge. By 1004 the isles&#x27; independence had been re-asserted under &#x27;s son , who died in that year. It is possible their rule overlapped, with &#x27;s zone of influence to the north and Ragnal&#x27;s to the south. On Ragnal&#x27;s death re-asserted control, which he held until his death at the Battle of Clontarf after which the islands may have been held by . According to the Welsh text is recorded as having been king of a wide variety of places on his death in 1034. These included the Isle of Man, &quot;many of the other islands of Denmark&quot;, Galloway, the Rhinns, and Anglesey. Olaf was an dynast and it is difficult to reconcile his rule with that of the Norwegians who apparently came before and after him according to the sagas. There is also an obscure reference in &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; hinting that King of Scotland may have been active in Islay and Arran at about this time, emphasising the potentially fluid nature of Scandinavian, Norse-Gael and Scots influence during this period.

The next recorded ruler is Sigurd the Stout&#x27;s son Thorfinn the Mighty, who took control circa 1035 until his own death some two decades later. The continuing close alliance of the Isles with Norway is suggested by a record from the Annals of Tigernach for the year 1058: &quot;A fleet was led by the son of the king of Norway, with the of Orkney, the Hebrides and Dublin, to seize the kingdom of England, but God consented not to this&quot;. This monarch of Norway was Magnus Haraldsson, who may have used the death of Thorfinn as an excuse to exert direct rule of Orkney and the Hebrides.

However, in the mid-11th century the dynast is said to be the ruler of Mann. He was also King of Dublin from 1036 to 1038 and from 1046 to 1052 as well as possibly being the King of the Rhinns in Galloway, suggesting that the overlordship of the Isle of Man and the Hebrides were once again sundered (although it is possible he ruled over part or all of the Hebrides as well).

 from the Kingdom of Leinster is then recorded as having control of Mann and Dublin followed by his father , the High King of Ireland, who took possession of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1072. Godred Sitricson and his son Fingal Godredson then ruled in Mann at least, but the records for the rulers of the Hebrides remain obscure until the arrival of Godred Crovan.

===Godred Crovan and Irish influence===

&quot;Crovan&quot; probably means &quot;white hand&quot; although the reason is unknown and his origins are also uncertain. Godred may have been a son or nephew of , King of Dublin and by extension a descendant of . He was a survivor of Harald Hardraade&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 and fled from there to Man. Little is then heard of him until he succeeded in taking the island from Fingal in 1079, possibly with the help of troops from the Western Isles. The ancestor of many of the succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles, he also became King of Dublin, but no contemporary source refers either to him or any of his predecessors as &quot;King of Mann and the Isles&quot; as such. He was eventually ousted from Dublin by and fled to Islay, where he died in the plague of 1095. It is not clear the extent to which dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway. A high level of political instability is suggested by the battle fought on the Isle of Man at Santwat in 1098. This was internal strife between the men of the north of the island under , and the southerners led by a man named MacManus or Macmaras.

==Later history==

===Norse and influence===
Perhaps as a result of general disorder in the islands, and to counter Irish influence there, Magnus Barefoot had re-established direct Norwegian overlordship by 1098. He first took Orkney, the northern Scottish mainland and the Hebrides, where he &quot;dyed his sword red in blood&quot; in the Uists. According to the , Magnus had his longship dragged across the isthmus north of Kintyre in 1093 as part of his campaign. By taking command of his ship&#x27;s tiller and &quot;sailing&quot; across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula was an island, and it remained under Norwegian rule for more than a dozen years as a result.

In 1098, Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus that settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides and Kintyre.

A second expedition in 1102 saw incursions into Ireland; the saga reports that he obtained &#x27;s daughter in marriage to his young son, Sigurd, whom he then left in nominal charge of the isles. This arrangement did not last long. On 23 August 1103 Magnus was killed fighting in Ulster and the 14-year-old Sigurd returned to Norway without his bride. The next king was Lagmann Godredsson, Godred Crovan&#x27;s son, who was apparently appointed with Sigurd&#x27;s consent. He successfully fought off a rebellion by his brother Harald and after reigning for seven years he abdicated &quot;repenting that he had put out his brother&#x27;s eyes&quot; and went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he died.

Lagmann abdicated during his surviving son Olave&#x27;s minority, and either by force or the invitation of the nobility of the Isles (Domnall MacTade O&#x27;Brien), a grandson of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, became overlord of the isles in 1111. Whatever his route to accession, he proved to be an unpopular tyrant and was expelled by the Islesmen after two years, fleeing to Ireland.

Two years later Sigurd attempted to appoint Ingemund (whose background is unknown) to take possession of the kingdom of the Isles. However, when Ingemund arrived on Lewis he sent messengers to all the chiefs of the Isles to summon them to assemble and declare him king. In the meantime he and his followers spent the time in &quot;plundering and revelling. They violated girls and matrons, and gave themselves up to every species of pleasure amid sensual gratification. When the news reached the chiefs of the Isles, who had already assembled to appoint him king, they were inflamed with great rage, hastened against him, and coming upon him in the night, set fire to the house in which he was, and destroyed, partly by the sword and partly by the flames, Ingemund and all his followers.&quot;

The next recorded king was Godred Crovan&#x27;s son Olave Godredsson, also known as &quot;the Red&quot; to the Highlanders and &quot;&quot; to the Norwegians, the latter apparently on account of his small size. He had spent time at the court of Henry I of England, who may have encouraged his ambitions in an attempt to minimise dominance over the Irish Sea and environs. Olave reigned for forty years, managing to maintain a degree of peace and stability throughout. Nevertheless, the era was not without incident. During his time , one of the Hebridean nobles, took Dublin by force and held it for six years before his assassination in 1148. Oitir&#x27;s son Thorfinn was described as the most powerful of the Hebridean lords in 1150. In 1152 Olave&#x27;s nephews in Dublin rose against him and attacked Man, killing him in the process.

Olave&#x27;s son Godred the Black succeeded him and had his father&#x27;s killers executed. Shortly thereafter the warring Mac Lochlainn clan in Ireland along with &quot;the fleet of Galloway, Arran, Kintyre, Man, and the territories of Scotland&quot; are recorded fighting a naval battle off Inishowen against the dynasty. During his reign the citizens of Dublin offered Godred the rule of the city, which he accepted. Then, according to the &quot;Manx Chronicle&quot;, he inflicted a heavy defeat on his erstwhile Mac Lochlainn allies, following which he and his chieftains returned to the islands, leaving the city to the invading forces of Diarmait Mac Murchada.

===Somerled===

Godred&#x27;s dictatorial style appears to have made him very unpopular with the Islesmen, and the ensuing conflicts were the beginning of the end for Mann and the Isles as a coherent territory under the rule of a single magnate. The powerful barons of the isles began plotting with an emerging and forceful figure – Somerled, Lord of Argyll. Somerled&#x27;s parental origins are obscure, but it is known that he had married Ragnhildis, daughter of Olave the Red and Godred&#x27;s half-sister. It is possible that Somerled first found favour with Olave by helping him wrest control of the northern Hebrides from the Earls of Orkney, whose influence had once more spread into the Sudreys. Somerled&#x27;s popularity led to his son with , , being heralded throughout the Isles (save Man itself) as a future King of the Isles by &quot;Thorfinn, son of Ottar&quot;. When Godred heard of this he engaged Somerled&#x27;s forces in the naval Battle of Epiphany in 1156. There was no clear victor, but it was subsequently agreed that Godred would remain the ruler of Man, the northern Inner Hebrides and the Outer Hebrides, whilst Somerled&#x27;s young sons would nominally control the southern Inner Hebrides, Kintyre and the islands of the Clyde under their father&#x27;s supervision. Two years later Somerled&#x27;s invasion of the Isle of Man caused Godred to flee to Norway, leaving the former as undisputed ruler of the entire realm.

The Hebrides had been difficult to control from a distance since the days of Ketill Flatnose, and even in the time of Magnus Barelegs it is likely that &quot;de facto&quot; control was that of local rulers rather than nominal governance from over the seas. Somerled took this to its ultimate conclusion, declaring himself an independent ruler of the isles from his power base in the southern Hebrides and Kintyre and he had, in effect, recreated Dalriada. There has been some debate about the source of legitimacy Somerled used. It has been suggested that claims of his descent from are &quot;preserved in Gaelic tradition and accepted as broadly authentic by modern scholars&quot;. However, Woolf (2005) asserts that &quot;contrary to the image, projected by recent clan-historians, of as Gaelic nationalists liberating the Isles from Scandinavians, it is quite explicit in our two extended narrative accounts from the thirteenth century, and &quot;The Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles&quot;, that the early leaders of saw themselves as competitors for the kingship of the Isles on the basis of their descent through their mother Ragnhilt&quot; and that their claim &quot;to royal status was based on its position as a segment of &quot;. This prince of Argyll is one of the best known historical figures from the of Scotland, and is known in Gaelic as , although his Norse name, , has the literal meaning of &quot;summer traveller&quot;, a common name for a Viking.

Somerled met his death in 1164, possibly assassinated in his tent as he camped near Renfrew during an invasion of the Scottish mainland. At this point Godred re-took possession of his pre-1158 territories and the southern isles were distributed amongst Somerled&#x27;s sons as previously agreed: received Mull, Coll, Tiree and Jura; Islay and Kintyre went to ; Bute to , with Arran possibly divided between him and Reginald. and at least were styled &quot;Kings of the Isles&quot;. However, their descendants do not seem to have held this title and &quot;The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys&quot; lamented that Somerled&#x27;s marriage to &quot;was the cause of the ruin of the whole kingdom of the Isles&quot;.

===A divided kingdom===
Somerled&#x27;s descendants eventually became known as the Lords of the Isles, with Dubgall giving rise to Clan MacDougall, and Raghnall to Clan Donald and Clan Macruari. Aonghas and his three sons were killed on Skye in 1210. In theory Somerled and his descendants&#x27; island territories were subject to Norway and his mainland ones to the Kingdom of Alba, whilst the Kings of Mann and the North Isles were vassals of the Kings of Norway.

However, both during and after Somerled&#x27;s life the Scottish monarchs sought to take control of the islands he and his descendants held. Diplomacy having failed to achieve much, in 1249 Alexander II took personal command of a large fleet that sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera. Alexander became ill and died there, but the action was continued by his successor Alexander III. This strategy eventually led to an invasion by Haakon Haakonarson, King of Norway. After the stalemate of the Battle of Largs, Haakon retreated to Orkney, where he died in December 1263, entertained on his death bed by recitations of the sagas. Following this ill-fated expedition, the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown &quot;had of old therein&quot; were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth.

In Man, having overcome his usurper brother Ragnald who reigned for a brief time in 1164, Godred the Black resumed his kingship of Mann and the North Isles. On his death in 1187, the kingship passed to his eldest son, Raghnall mac Gofraidh, rather than his chosen successor, Olaf the Black (Raghnall&#x27;s half-brother), who instead became overlord of Lewis. In 1228, Olaf battled Raghnall at Tynwald and the latter was slain. On 21 May 1237, Olaf died on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, and was succeeded by his three sons who all ruled the kingdom in turn: Harald (reigned 1237–1248), Ragnvald (1249), and Magnus (1252–1265). Magnus Olafsson was the last of the Norse kings to rule Mann, which was absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland on his death.

==Life in Norse times==

As with written records, the archaeological evidence for this period is not extensive, and knowledge of the daily lives of the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.

Colonsay and Oronsay have produced important pagan Norse burial grounds. An 11th-century cross slab decorated with Irish and Ringerike Viking art found on Islay was found in 1838. , today an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the Cuillin hills on Skye, contains the small , which is connected to the sea by a short artificial canal. This loch was an important site for maritime activity for many centuries, spanning the Viking and later periods of Scottish clan rule. There is a stone-built quay and a system to maintain constant water levels. Boat timbers discovered there have been dated to the 12th century. Only three rune stones are known from the west coast of Scotland, on Christian memorials found on Barra, Inchmarnock and Iona.

Gaelic continued to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery in the north and that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.

Initially a pagan culture, detailed information about the return of the Christian religion to the islands during the Norse-era is elusive, although the modern-day Diocese of Sodor and Man retains the centuries-old name.

<doc id="230955" wikidata="Q1160214" url="?curid=230955" title="Running of the bulls">
<text>A running of the bulls (, from the verb &quot;encerrar&quot;, &#x27;to corral, to enclose&#x27;; , literally &#x27;haste, momentum&#x27;; &#x27;bulls in the street&#x27;, or &#x27;bull-runner&#x27;) is an event that involves running in front of a small group of bulls, typically six but sometimes ten or more, that have been let loose on sectioned-off streets in a town, usually as part of a summertime festival. Particular breeds of cattle may be favored, such as the in Spain, also often used in post-run bullfighting, and Camargue cattle in Occitan France, which are not fought. Bulls (non-castrated male cattle) are typically used in such events.

The most famous bull-run is the held in Pamplona during the nine-day festival of Sanfermines in honor of Saint Fermin. It has become a major global tourism event, today very different from the traditional, local festival. More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain and Portugal, in some cities in Mexico, and in the Occitan (Camargue) region of southern France. Bull-running was formerly also practiced in rural England, most famously at Stamford until 1837.

The event has its origins in the old practice of transporting bulls from the fields outside the city, where they were bred, to the bullring, where they would be fought and killed in the evening. During this &quot;run&quot;, local youths would jump among them in a display of bravado. In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls that run are also in that afternoon&#x27;s bullfight.

Spanish tradition holds that bull-running began in northeastern Spain in the early 14th century. Cattle herders who wanted to transport their animals from barges or from the countryside into city centers for sale or bullfights needed an easy way to move their precious animals. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. This tradition is carried on each morning of the San Fermin fiesta in Pamplona, with the bulls being released from their corral at Calle de Santo Domingo to run along a barricaded route through the streets of the old quarter to the bullring at the Plaza de Toros. No longer being driven by their herders as in the past, the bulls are nowadays part of a spectacle in which a large group of runners run ahead of the bulls and attempt to beat them to the Plaza de Toros. The event has become so popular that it is a main feature of the San Fermin festival. The running of the bulls was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, but resumed 7–14 July 2022.

==Pamplona bull run==

The Pamplona encierro is the most popular in Spain and has been broadcast live by , the public Spanish national television service, for over 30 years. It is the highest-profile event of the San Fermín festival, which is held every year from 6–14 July. The first bull running is on 7 July, followed by one on each of the following mornings of the festival, beginning every day at 8 am. The rules require participants to be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.

===Fence===
In Pamplona, a set of wooden fences is erected to direct the bulls along the route and to block off side streets. A double wooden fence is used in those areas where there is enough space, while in other parts the buildings of the street act as barriers. The gaps in the barricades are wide enough for a human to slip through but narrow enough to block a bull. The fence is composed of approximately three thousand separate pieces of wood. Some parts of the fence remain in place for the duration of the fiesta, while others are placed and removed each morning. Spectators can only stand behind the second fence, whereas the space between the two fences is reserved for security and medical personnel and also for participants who need cover during the event.

===Preliminaries===
The encierro begins with runners singing a benediction. It is sung three times, each time being sung both in Spanish and Basque. The benediction is a prayer given at a statue of Saint Fermin, patron of the festival and the city, to ask the saint&#x27;s protection and can be translated into English as &quot;We ask Saint Fermin, as our Patron, to guide us through the encierro and give us his blessing&quot;. The singers finish by shouting &quot; and (&#x27;Long live Saint Fermin&#x27;, in Spanish and Basque, respectively). Most runners dress in the traditional clothing of the festival which consists of a white shirt and trousers with a red waistband () and neckerchief (). Also some of them hold the day&#x27;s newspaper rolled to draw the bulls&#x27; attention from them if necessary.

===The running===
A first rocket is set off at 8 a.m. to alert the runners that the corral gate is open. A second rocket signals that all six bulls have been released. The third and fourth rockets are signals that all of the herd has entered the bullring and its corral respectively, marking the end of the event. The average duration between the first rocket and the end of the encierro is two minutes, 30 seconds.

The encierro is usually composed of the six bulls to be fought in the afternoon, six steers that run in herd with the bulls, and three more steers that follow the herd to encourage any reluctant bulls to continue along the route. The function of the steers, who run the route daily, is to guide the bulls to the bullring. The average speed of the herd is .

The length of the run is . It goes through four streets of the old part of the city (Santo Domingo, Ayuntamiento, Mercaderes and Estafeta) via the Town Hall Square and the short section &quot;Telefónica&quot; (named for the location of the old telephone office at end of Calle Estafeta) just before entering into the bullring through its callejón (tunnel). The fastest part of the route is up Santo Domingo and across the Town Hall Square, but the bulls often became separated at the entrance to Estafeta Street as they slow down. One or more would slip going into the turn at Estafeta (&quot;la curva&quot;), resulting in the installation of anti-slip surfacing, and now most of the bulls negotiate the turn onto Estafeta and are often ahead of the steers. This has resulted in a quicker run. Runners are not permitted in the first 50 meters of the encierro, which is an uphill grade where the bulls are much faster.

===Injuries, fatalities, and medical attention===

Every year, between 50 and 100 people are injured during the run Not all of the injuries require taking the patients to hospital: in 2013, 50 people were taken by ambulance to Pamplona&#x27;s hospital, with this number nearly doubling that of 2012.

Goring is much less common but potentially life threatening. In 2013, for example, six participants were gored along the festival, in 2012, only four runners were injured by the horns of the bulls with exactly the same number of gored people in 2011, nine in 2010 and 10 in 2009; with one of these last killed. As most of the runners are male, only 5 women have been gored since 1974. Before that date, running was prohibited for women. 

Another major risk is runners falling and piling up (a &quot;montón&quot;, meaning &quot;heap&quot;) at the entrance of the bullring, which acts as a funnel as it is much narrower than the previous street, resulting in a crowd crush. In such cases, injuries come both from asphyxia and contusions to those in the pile and from goring if the bulls crush into the pile. This kind of blocking of the entrance has occurred at least ten times in the history of the run, the last occurring in 2013 and the first dating back to 1878. A runner died of suffocation in one such pile up in 1977.

Overall, since record-keeping began in 1910, 15 people have been killed in the bull running of Pamplona, most of them due to being gored. To minimize the impact of injuries every day 200 people collaborate in the medical attention. They are deployed in 16 sanitary posts (every 50 metres on average), each one with at least a physician and a nurse among their personnel. Most of these 200 people are volunteers, mainly from the Red Cross. In addition to the medical posts, there are around 20 ambulances. This organization makes it possible to have a gored person stabilized and taken to a hospital in less than 10 minutes.

===Dress code===

Though there is no formal dress code, the very common and traditional attire is white trousers, a white shirt with a red cummerbund around the waist, and a red neckerchief around the neck. Some have large logos on their shirts; in the Internet age this is thought to be a way to highlight someone in a photo. This dress is to honor San Fermin, the center of the celebration, because of his martyr&#x27;s death; the white outfits represent the purity and holiness of a saint, and the red kerchiefs (&quot;pañuelos&quot;), represent his death by decapitation. A common alternate color to red is blue.

===Media===

The encierro of Pamplona has been depicted many times in literature, television or advertising, but became known worldwide partly because of the descriptions of Ernest Hemingway in books &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;.

The cinema pioneer Louis Lumière filmed the run in 1899.

The event is the basis for a chapter in James Michener&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;The Drifters&quot;.

The run is depicted in the 1991 Billy Crystal film &quot;City Slickers&quot;, where the character &quot;Mitch&quot; (Crystal) is gored (non-fatally) from behind by a bull during a vacation with the other main characters. Filmmakers traveled to Spain to shoot the actual running of the bulls with second unit director, Heston Fraser. &quot;City Slickers&quot; director, Ron Underwood, recreated the Pamplona location on the Universal Studios backlot to stage the running of the bulls with the actors.

The run appears in the 2011 Bollywood movie &quot;Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot;, directed by Zoya Akhtar, as the final dare in the bucket list of the three bachelors who have to overcome their ultimate fear; death. At first, the trio run part of the route. They stop at the square, but then recover their nerve, and continue to the end. The completion of the run depicts their freedom as they learn that surviving a mortal danger can bring joy.

&quot;Running with Bulls,&quot; a 2012 documentary of the festival filmed by Construct Creatives and presented by Jason Farrel, depicts the pros and cons of the controversial tradition.

From 2014 until 2016, the Esquire Network broadcast the running of the bulls live in the United States, with both live commentary and then a recorded &#x27;round up&#x27; later in the day by NBCSN commentators the Men in Blazers, including interviews with noted participants such as Madrid-born runner David Ubeda, former US Army soldier turned filmmaker Dennis Clancey, and former British bullfighter and author Alexander Fiske-Harrison.

In 2014, a guidebook authored by Alexander Fiske-Harrison, Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s grandson John, Orson Welles&#x27; daughter Beatrice, and with a foreword by the Mayor of Pamplona, caused headlines around the world when one of the contributors, Bill Hillmann, was gored by a bull soon after its publication. It was republished in 2017 under the title &quot;The Bulls Of Pamplona&quot; with a replacement chapter by Dennis Clancey.

The award-winning 2015 feature documentary &quot;Chasing Red&quot; directed by Dennis Clancey, follows four runners during the 2012 fiesta in Pamplona, including Bill Hillmann and David Ubeda.

==Other examples==
Although the most famous running of the bulls is that of San Fermín, they are held in towns and villages across Spain, Portugal, and in some cities in southern France during the summer. Examples are the bull run of San Sebastián de los Reyes, near Madrid, at the end of August, which is the most popular of Spain after Pamplona; the bull run of Cuéllar, considered as the oldest of Spain since there are documents of its existence dating back to 1215; the Sanjuanes of Coria (Cáceres, Extremadura) since XV century is original and dangerous; the Highland Capeias of the Raia in Sabugal, Portugal, with horses leading the herd crossing old border passes out of Spain and using the medieval &#x27;Forcåo&#x27;; and the bull run of Navalcarnero held at night.

Other &quot;encierros&quot; have also caused fatalities.

=== or ===

&quot;Bous al carrer&quot;, &quot;correbou&quot; or &quot;correbous&quot; (meaning in Catalan, &#x27;bulls in the street&#x27;, &#x27;street-bulls&#x27; or &#x27;bull-running&#x27;) is a typical festivity in many villages in the Valencian region, Terres de l&#x27;Ebre, Catalonia, and Fornalutx, Mallorca. Another similar tradition is &quot;soltes de vaques&quot;, where cows are used instead of bulls. Even though they can take place all along the year, they are most usual during local festivals (normally in August). Compared to encierros, animals are not directed to any bullring.

These festivities are normally organized by the youngsters of the village, as a way for showing their courage and ability with the bull. Some sources consider this tradition a masculine initiation rite to adulthood.

===Occitan area of France===

Numerous bull-running events happen in France in the region around Sommières, in accordance with the Camargues tradition, in which no bulls are intentionally injured or killed. For instance, in Calvisson, the annual event takes place around 20 July over a period of five days. There are four events: the , in which at least ten bulls are run together through the street guided by a group of twelve mounted on white Camargue horses; the , in which one bull is released outside the foyer and finds his own way back to the pen; the , in which one bull is run, accompanied through the streets; and the , which is the same thing but after dark. Boys and men run with the bulls and try and separate them from the horses, stop them, and physically turn them away from the horses.
===Stamford bull run===

The English town of Stamford, Lincolnshire was host to the Stamford bull run for almost 700 years until it was abandoned in 1837. According to local tradition, the custom dated from the time of King John when William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl mounted his horse and rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much that he gave the meadow in which the fight began to the butchers of Stamford, on condition that they should provide a bull to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after. As of 2013 the bull run had been revived as a ceremonial, festival-style community event.

===Mock bull runs===
A variation is the nightly &quot;fire bull&quot; where balls of flammable material are placed on the horns. In modern times, the bull is often replaced by a runner carrying a frame on which fireworks are placed, and dodgers, usually children, run to avoid the sparks.

The (&quot;running of the town bus&quot;) started in Pamplona on 15 July 1984 when, after the end of the festival, youths would run before the earliest urban bus entering the traditional course. Starting in 1990, the Pamplona City Transport detoured the early bus to reduce the risk. Currently, the youths run before a cyclist in a yellow jersey as an homage to the Navarrese cycling champion Miguel Induráin.

In 2008, Red Bull Racing driver David Coulthard and Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais performed a version of a &#x27;bull running&#x27; event in Pamplona, Spain, with the Formula One cars chasing 500 runners through the actual Pamplona route.
The Big Easy Rollergirls roller derby team has performed an annual mock bull run in New Orleans, Louisiana since 2007. The team, dressed as bulls, skates after runners through the French Quarter. In 2012, there were 14,000 runners and over 400 &quot;bulls&quot; from all over the country, with huge before- and after-parties.

In Ballyjamesduff, Ireland, an annual event called the Pig Run is held, functioning as a mini- but with small pigs in place of bulls.

In Dewey Beach, Delaware, a bar named The Starboard sponsors an annual Running of the Bull , in which hundreds of red- and white-clad beachgoers are chased down the shore by a single &quot;bull&quot; (two people in a pantomime horse-style costume).

In Rangiora, New Zealand, an annual Running of the Sheep is held, in which 1000–2000 sheep are released down the main street of the small farming town.

The Running of the Bulls UK is a pub crawl event that takes place on London&#x27;s Hampstead Heath and uses fast human runners in place of bulls.

In 2014, Pamplona inaugurated a series of running events in June, the San Fermín Marathon, of a full marathon (42.195 km), half-marathon (21.097 km), or 10 km road race that concludes with the final 900m of each race using the route, runners crossing the finish line inside the bullring.

Since 2008 in Anchorage, Alaska during the Fur Rendezvous Festival, the Running of the Reindeer has participants run down a four-block downtown street with a group of reindeer released behind them.

==Opposition==
Many opponents state that bulls are mentally stressed by the harassment and voicing of both participants and spectators, and some of animals may also die because of the stress, especially if they are roped or bring flares in their horns (&quot;bou embolat&quot; version). Despite all this, the festivities seem to have wide popular support in their villages.

The city of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, cancelled its &quot;Sanmiguelada&quot; running of the bulls after 2006, citing public disorder associated with the event. After the event was cancelled in San Miguel, the city of Salvatierra, also in the state of Guanajuato, picked up the event. It is now called &quot;La Marquesada&quot; and the three-day event is held during the last weekend of the month of September or first weekend of October.

As of 2002, a Running of the Nudes occurs two days before the running of the bulls. The event is supported by animal welfare groups, including PETA, who object to the running of the bulls, claiming that it is cruel and glorifies bullfighting, which the groups oppose.

<text>The three lands of Denmark historically formed the Danish kingdom from its unification and consolidation in the 10th century:

*Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) and the islands south of it, with Roskilde as a centre
*Jutland (&quot;Jylland&quot;), the western peninsula, with Viborg as a centre and the island of Fyn.
*Scania (&quot;Skåneland&quot;) on the Scandinavian peninsula, with Lund as a centre

Each of the lands retained their own thing (&quot;ting&quot;) and statute laws until late medieval time (Jutlandic Law, Zealandic Law and Scanian Law). Although Denmark was a unified kingdom, the custom of rendering homage to the King at the three individual assemblies remained. A remnant is the current division of Denmark into two High Court districts, the Eastern and Western High Court.

During the early 19th century, Zealand and Fyn became administratively united as &quot;Østifterne&quot; with a provincial assembly in Roskilde. &quot;Jutland&quot;, &quot;The Islands&quot; and &quot;Bornholm&quot; remains an informal subdivision still used, notably in meteorology and public statistics. Bornholm is the only part to represent Scania after the rest of the region was lost to Sweden in 1658. (Bornholm was also lost in 1658, but was recovered two years later.)

In recent decades, the less specific division between &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; Denmark has also become common, for example when describing logistic, economic and political patterns. Funen may be attributed to both the eastern and western part of the country, the border line being either the Great Belt or the Little Belt.

<doc id="230958" wikidata="Q362081" url="?curid=230958" title="Petar II Petrović-Njegoš">
<text>Petar II Petrović-Njegoš (, ;  – ), commonly referred to simply as Njegoš (), was a Prince-Bishop (&quot;vladika&quot;) of Montenegro, poet and philosopher whose works are widely considered some of the most important in Montenegrin and Serbian literature.

Njegoš was born in the village of Njeguši, near Montenegro&#x27;s then-capital Cetinje. He was educated at several Serbian monasteries and became the country&#x27;s spiritual and political leader following the death of his uncle Petar I. After eliminating all initial domestic opposition to his rule, he concentrated on uniting Montenegro&#x27;s tribes and establishing a centralized state. He introduced regular taxation, formed a personal guard and implemented a series of new laws to replace those composed by his predecessor many years earlier. His taxation policies proved extremely unpopular with the tribes of Montenegro and were the cause of several revolts during his lifetime. Njegoš&#x27;s reign was also defined by the constant political and military struggle with the Ottoman Empire, and by his attempts to expand Montenegro&#x27;s territory while gaining unconditional recognition from the Sublime Porte. He was a proponent of uniting and liberating the Serb people, willing to concede his princely rights in exchange for a union with Serbia and his recognition as the religious leader of all Serbs (akin to a modern-day Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church). Although unification between the two states did not occur during his lifetime, Njegoš laid some of the foundations of Yugoslavism and introduced modern political concepts to Montenegro. Venerated as a poet and philosopher, Njegoš is well known for his epic poem &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; (The Mountain Wreath), which is considered a masterpiece of Serbian and other South Slavic literature, and the national epic of Serbia, Montenegro, and Yugoslavia. Njegoš has remained influential in Serbia and Montenegro, as well in neighboring countries.

==Early life and origins==

Petar II Petrović-Njegoš was born Radivoje &quot;Rade&quot; Petrović on in the mountain village of Njeguši, near Cetinje. His father, Tomislav &quot;Tomo&quot; Petrović (b. 1762–63), was a member of the Petrović clan of the Njeguši tribe of Katuni &quot;nahiya&quot;. Njegoš&#x27;s mother, Ivana Proroković, hailed from the hamlet of Mali Zalaz and was the daughter of Njeguši captain Lazo Proroković. There is no reliable information about her exact year of birth, but it is believed that she was about ten years younger than her husband. Tomo and Ivana had five children; their eldest son was Petar (&quot;Pero&quot;), Rade was their middle son and Jovan (&quot;Joko&quot;) was their youngest. The couple&#x27;s daughters were named Marija and Stana; Marija was married to a Montenegrin chieftain named Andrija Perović, the &quot;serdar&quot; (count) of Cuce, while Stana was married to Filip Đurašković, the &quot;serdar&quot; of Rijeka Crnojevića.

Njeguši is a remote village, situated near the Adriatic coast in western Montenegro (or Old Montenegro). The eponymous tribe is one of the oldest in Montenegro, and its history can be traced back to the 14th century. It likely came about as the result of intermarriages between Illyrian population and South Slavic settlers during the 10th century, according to the author Milovan Djilas. Njeguši was dominated by the Petrovićes&#x27; ancestral home, which was the only two-storied house in the village and was made entirely out of stone. Members of Njeguši&#x27;s Petrović clan had been hereditary Serbian Orthodox Metropolitans (Prince-Bishops) of Cetinje since 1696; the title of Prince-Bishop () was passed from uncle to nephew since Orthodox prelates were required to be celibate and could not have children of their own. The ruling Prince-Bishop was allowed to nominate his own successor, subject to approval by the Montenegrin chieftains and the people of Montenegro.

Njegoš spent his early years in Njeguši shepherding his father&#x27;s flock, playing the &quot;gusle&quot; (a traditional one-stringed instrument) and attending family and church celebrations where stories of battles and past suffering were told. His education was rudimentary; he was taught how to read and write by monks at the Cetinje Monastery when he was twelve years old, studied Italian at the Savina Monastery for a year and spent eighteen months at the Topla Monastery near Herceg Novi, learning Russian and French under the tuition of reverend Josif Tropović. In October 1827, the young Njegoš was taken under the tutelage of the poet and playwright Sima Milutinović (nicknamed &quot;Sarajlija&quot;), who had come to Montenegro to serve as the official secretary of Njegoš&#x27;s uncle, &quot;vladika&quot; Petar I. A Sarajevan Serb, Milutinović introduced Njegoš to poetry and inspired him to write down Serb folk tales which had been passed down orally through the centuries. An unconventional mentor, he also taught Njegoš sports, shooting and sword-fighting.

==Reign==

===Historical background===
Nineteenth-century Montenegrin society was quite primitive even by contemporary standards. Foreigners were viewed with suspicion and merchants were widely seen as &quot;money-grubbing&quot; and &quot;effete&quot;. Wars between the Montenegrins and neighboring Muslim tribes were all too common, as was cattle rustling, banditry and headhunting. Men devoted much of their energy to incessant blood feuds, limiting the effectiveness of Montenegrin resistance to the Turks. Most physical labors was done by women; entertainment consisted of contests exhibiting feats of strength and evenings spent listening to songs recounting heroic exploits to the accompaniment of the &quot;gusle&quot;.

Before the 19th century, western Montenegro was nothing more than a cluster of feuding tribes presided over by the Metropolitans of Cetinje. Montenegrin territory consisted of four small districts (), the most important of which was the Katuni &quot;nahiya&quot; with its nine tribes (Cetinje, Njeguši, Ćeklići, Bjelice, Cuce, Čevo, Pješivci, Zagarač, and Komani). These areas had been &quot;de facto&quot; independent from the Ottoman Empire since the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, though elements of self-governance had existed since the earliest days of Turkish rule in the 15th century. For decades, Ottoman authorities treated the inhabitants of western Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina as unsubjected &quot;filuricis&quot; who were only obligated to pay a fixed amount of Florentine ducats (&quot;florin&quot;) to the Ottomans each year. Such taxation did not increase with the wealth or size of one&#x27;s household, and Serbs in these regions were completely exempt from the Ottoman poll tax and other levies usually paid by Christian subjects to the Sublime Porte. Though the privileges granted the highlanders were meant to allay public dissatisfaction in these poor but strategically vital regions on the Venetian border, by the late 16th century, they ended up having the opposite effect. The Serbs began shunning Ottoman tax collectors entirely, and when the Ottomans attempted to impose some of the taxes normally paid by other Christian subjects, the Serbs revolted and carved out their own autonomous region. Absence of Ottoman authority produced an ideal opportunity for tribalism to flourish. Thousands of Serbs who remained in Ottoman-held territory converted to Islam to avoid paying these newly imposed taxes. Converts were granted full rights and privileges as Muslim subjects of the Sultan, while non-Muslims were viewed as second-class subjects and treated as such. Hence, Christians viewed all converts with derision and considered them &quot;traitors to the faith of their forefathers&quot;. Religious killings were common in times of war since both Christians and Muslims considered members of the opposing faith to be apostates worthy of death.

Although Montenegrin warriors often attributed their country&#x27;s survival as an independent entity to their own military prowess, journalist Tim Judah notes that the Turks often saw little point in expending blood and resources trying to subdue the impoverished sliver of land controlled by the Montenegrin chieftains. As far as the Ottomans were concerned, the Montenegrins were &quot;rebellious infidels&quot; who only wished to plunder what property their more prosperous Muslim neighbors possessed. Throughout the 18th century, thousands of Montenegrins left their homeland and migrated to Serbia in the hope of finding fertile fields to raise their crops. Authority became more centralized after Petar I came to power in 1782. In 1796, Petar initiated a war against Kara Mahmud Bushati, &quot;vizier&quot; of the Pashalik of Scutari, which reinforced Montenegro&#x27;s autonomy and resulted in large territorial gains at the Ottomans&#x27; expense. Two years later, a council of tribal chiefs met in Cetinje and agreed to compose a code of laws and form a central court known as a &quot;kuluk&quot;, which had both administrative and judicial functions. Despite these accomplishments, Petar had little success in unifying the disparate Montenegrin tribes, as it was impossible to form a stable government or organize an army unless taxes could be levied, and the tribes were no more willing to pay taxes to Cetinje than they were to the Ottomans. Attempts to stop their raiding and looting were equally futile, as attempted to keep them from feuding with one another. By 1830, Montenegro boasted only a handful of literate citizens, yet it was seen in the Western world as a bastion of Christian resistance to the Turks. The country&#x27;s economic situation remained dire, its borders were still not internationally recognized and the Turks continued to claim it as part of their empire.

===Accession===
Petar I&#x27;s final years were defined by his deteriorating health and continuing inability to find a successor—ideally both a Petrović and a literate monk—capable of carrying on his role. Petar&#x27;s first candidate was Mitar M. Petrović, the son of his eldest brother Stjepan. Within several years, the younger Petrović died and Petar was forced to find a different successor. He turned his attention to Đorđije S. Petrović, his middle brother&#x27;s son. As Đorđije was illiterate, Petar sent him to Saint Petersburg to attend school. Once there, Đorđije realized that he preferred living in Russia over Montenegro. In 1828, he sent his uncle a letter from Saint Petersburg informing him that he wished to enroll into the Imperial Russian Army and asking to be relieved of succession. In 1829, Petar informed Jeremija Gagić, an ethnic Serb who served as the Russian vice-consul in Dubrovnik and was in charge of all of Russia&#x27;s dealings with Montenegro, that Đorđije had his permission to enter the Russian military, depriving him of his right to the throne.

It was only then that Petar entertained the possibility of extending his throne to the teenaged Njegoš and took steps to further his education. The seventeen-year-old was again sent to the Cetinje Monastery and mentored at its seminary. Petar then introduced him to state matters, trusting him with the writing of official letters and orders on his behalf. He died of old age on , without having publicly named a successor. Prior to his death, the elderly &quot;vladika&quot; had dictated his will and testament to Njegoš&#x27;s old mentor, Milutinović, where he named Njegoš as his successor and granted all of his ecclesiastical and secular powers to him. The will also cursed anyone who trampled over Montenegro&#x27;s traditional bonds with Russia in exchange for better relations with Austria, swearing that leprosy would strike them down. Some Montenegrins hostile to the Petrović clan alleged that Milutinović had fabricated the document in order to make Njegoš &quot;vladika&quot;, pointing to their close friendship as proof. Several scholars have raised the possibility that the will was indeed a forgery, though most modern historians believe that it was genuine.

The day after Petar&#x27;s death, all of Montenegro&#x27;s chieftains met in Cetinje to confirm the new &quot;vladika&quot;. According to one account, there were several chieftains who did not wish to see Njegoš bestowed the title. They considered him too young and inexperienced, and disliked the haste with which he was to be crowned. Figures such as Milutinović, Stanko S. Petrović, &quot;iguman&quot; Mojsije Zečević, &quot;serdar&quot; Mikhail Bošković, and the headman of Čevo, Stefan Vukotić, supported Njegoš&#x27;s bid and urged the council to immediately proclaim him the next &quot;vladika&quot;. The first to recognize him as such was the &quot;archimandrite&quot; of Ostrog, Josif Pavičević, followed by the &quot;guvernadur&quot; (governor) of Montenegro, Vukolaj &quot;Vuko&quot; Radonjić, and all the other chieftains. Another account holds that Radonjić hotly opposed Njegoš&#x27;s succession and argued that the expatriated Đorđije was Petar I&#x27;s true heir. The reason behind Radonjić&#x27;s opposition to Njegoš lay in the fact that his clan, the Radonjićes, were bitter enemies of Njegoš&#x27;s Petrović clan. Apparently, Radonjić&#x27;s opinion did not sway the chieftains and they composed a declaration proclaiming Njegoš the next &quot;vladika&quot;. According to this account, &quot;archimandrite&quot; Josif signed the declaration first and Radonjić signed it last after seeing that all of the other chieftains had done so. Despite not having any formal training as a monk, the teenaged Njegoš was consecrated in 1831 an &quot;archimandrite&quot; himself in a ceremony that took place in the Kom Monastery. He adopted the ecclesiastical name Petar in honour of his late predecessor, thus becoming known as Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. Following his consecration, he signed himself using his monastic name and his surname. Thus, all of Njegoš&#x27;s correspondences were signed under the name Petar Petrović, though the Montenegrin people continued to refer to him by his given name and affectionately called him Bishop Rade. In most scholarly texts, he is referred to simply as Njegoš.

===Crushing dissent (1830–32)===

====Whispers of conspiracy====
The Radonjićes traditionally opposed Montenegro&#x27;s close ties with Russia, advocating a closer relationship with Austria instead. This pro-Austrian orientation dated to the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, when Austria annexed all of Venice&#x27;s possessions and established a land border with Montenegro. The Radonjićes then became the leading pro-Austrian clan and frequently made contact with Austrian agents in the Bay of Kotor, on the Montenegrin frontier. Vuko Radonjić&#x27;s conflict with Njegoš took on both a personal and a political dimension, not only because their clans were traditional rivals but because the Petrovićes were ardently pro-Russian, largely due to ecclesiastical ties between the &quot;vladika&quot; and the Russian Most Holy Synod. As &quot;guvernadur&quot;, Radonjić occupied a position that was meant exclusively for the Radonjićes, just as the post of &quot;vladika&quot; could only be held by a Petrović. The office of &quot;guvernadur&quot; dated back to 1715, when the Venetian Senate created the title of supreme &quot;vojvoda&quot; (duke) to share power with the &quot;vladika&quot; of Montenegro. The Venetians titled it &quot;governattore&quot;, which became &quot;guvernadur&quot; in Montenegrin dialect. Although the jurisdiction of a &quot;guvernadur&quot; had never been clearly defined, the Radonjićes and their supporters regularly claimed that his powers were equal to that of the &quot;vladika&quot; while the Petrovićes and their supporters argued that the &quot;vladika&quot; always had the final say in Montenegrin affairs. Now, with Njegoš poised to take the throne, Radonjić began claiming the superiority of his office and attempted to attain full control over secular affairs.

In late November 1830, Radonjić wrote to vice-consul Gagić in Dubrovnik complaining about Cetinje&#x27;s inability to hold the tribes together and the anarchy that was sweeping through the countryside. This apparently led him to conspire with the Austrians to have Njegoš removed from his throne and have him replaced by his cousin, Đorđije. On orders from Franjo Tomašić, the governor of the Kingdom of Dalmatia, the commander of Fort Dubrovnik met Radonjić at Kotor on . Radonjić left Montenegro without informing Njegoš or the other chieftains, raising much suspicion. His meeting with the Austrian commander did not remain a secret for very long. On 28 November, a group of Montenegrins who happened to be visiting Kotor noticed Radonjić in the company of a few Austrian officers. They stormed the house where the meeting was taking place, exchanged obscenities with Radonjić and hurried back to Cetinje to report on what they had seen; Njegoš was furious. In a letter to Gagić dated , he wrote: &quot;Radonjić [went] to the Kotor hinterland ... without anybody&#x27;s notice, but on his own ... and there met some imperial general and other imperial men, having in mind to give up Montenegro and place it under their protection thinking that after the late &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s death there were no sons of Montenegro allied to glorious Russia.&quot;

====Elimination of the Radonjićes====
As soon as they heard the news of Radonjić&#x27;s dealings in Kotor, the chieftains called for an urgent council to decide what was to be done with him. Radonjić faced the chieftains on . He was divested of power, stripped of all his titles, and his gubernatorial seal (a symbol of his office) was taken away from him. At noon, the council decided that he was guilty of treason and condemned him to death by firing squad alongside his brother Marko, a co-conspirator. Radonjić had failed to win over the chieftains; historian Barbara Jelavich asserts that the vast majority of chiefs backed the Petrovićes solely because they saw an ecclesiastical leader like Njegoš as posing less of a threat to their own power. The chieftains later wrote a report to Gagić explaining that Radonjić and his brother would be shot because &quot;[they] dared to make secret arrangements with the imperialists to surrender the independence of Montenegro to Austria.&quot; The other Radonjićes were to be forced into exile. Several weeks later, Njegoš commuted Radonjić&#x27;s sentence in a well-timed display of clemency, first to life imprisonment and then to exile. Radonjić&#x27;s youngest brother, Djuzo, was not as fortunate; he was ambushed by a close friend on the day of his family&#x27;s slava (patron saint day) and killed. Many of the other Radonjićes also met violent ends, either being killed in raids or driven out with their families after their villages were torched. By 1831, Milutinović (now Njegoš&#x27;s personal secretary) was also forced into exile after entering into a disagreement with the young &quot;vladika&quot;. In the weeks before he forced him into exile, Njegoš had become very critical of his old mentor and frequently pointed out his shortcomings before others. Milutinović was given permission to return shortly afterwards on the understanding that their relationship would be on the young man&#x27;s terms. Djilas suggests that this episode occurred because Milutinović had &quot;taken liberties&quot; trying to influence Njegoš&#x27;s decisions during his early days on the throne.

Radonjić, who was exiled to the coast, continued to have treasonous correspondence with the Austrians in Kotor. When some of his letters to the Austrian officials were discovered, he was apprehended by Njegoš&#x27;s warriors, taken back to Cetinje and put on trial for treason alongside his brother Marko on . The two were accused of inciting Serbs to flee from Montenegro and settle in neighbouring Austrian lands, and of conspiring to overthrow Njegoš so that the Radonjićes could surrender Montenegro to the Habsburgs, making it an Austrian protectorate. They were found guilty of treason once again, but this time they were immediately driven into exile. Radonjić died of natural causes on , shortly after being forced from Cetinje.

===Establishment of the Governing Senate===
The beginning of Njegoš&#x27; reign was marked by a revival of Montenegro&#x27;s traditional alliance with Russia. The relationship between the two countries was motivated by the Montenegrins&#x27; need to have a powerful ally who could provide political and financial support to their fledgling nation and Russia&#x27;s desire to exploit Montenegro&#x27;s strategic location in its ongoing geopolitical battle with Austria. Traditionally, the Serbian Orthodox monastery in Cetinje and the institution of &quot;vladika&quot; had survived through the centuries because of Russian support, but Petar I&#x27;s final years witnessed a cooling of Russo–Montenegrin relations. With the Radonjićes expelled, Njegoš abolished the office of &quot;guvernadur&quot; in 1832. This move did not bring him any new powers, as Russia insisted on the establishment of the Governing Senate (&quot;Praviteljstvujuščiji senat&quot;) of Montenegro and the Highlands, whose purpose was to limit and regulate the powers of the &quot;vladika&quot;. Much like the Governing Soviet (&quot;Praviteljstvujušči sovjet&quot;) in Serbia, most of the senate&#x27;s members were hand-picked by the Russians because of their political leanings, which were often more favourable to Saint Petersburg than they were to Vienna. Created to replace the &quot;kuluk&quot; formed by Petar I in 1798, the senate was established by Ivan Vukotić, a Montenegrin-born diplomat in Russian service. He had been sent to Cetinje by the Russian government in 1831, alongside his nephew Matija Vučićević. The two hailed from the Turkish-controlled Zeta Plain and had lived in Russia for much of their lives. They were tasked with establishing a strong central government which could control the country&#x27;s many tribes. Vukotić was quite wealthy, having inherited a large sum of money from a noble family member, and had experience as a non-commissioned officer in the Russian military.

Aside from having to deal with Russian political interference, Njegoš faced several other limitations to his power. He had no army, militia or police force to enforce the rule of law within the territory he nominally controlled and had to rely on warriors from his own clan for protection. The tribes on the Montenegrin frontier often either refused to obey him or befriended his enemies. Tribal raids, which drove deep into Ottoman-held Herzegovina, occurred frequently and looting proved key to the region&#x27;s economic survival. Though such raids normally elicited a harsh response from the Ottomans, Njegoš was powerless to stop them.

The creation of the Governing Senate introduced some semblance of order into Montenegrin politics. Vukotić was proclaimed the senate&#x27;s president and Vučićević became its vice-president. The Montenegrins referred to them as &quot;their Russian lordships&quot;. In total, the senate was made up of twelve men who received an annual salary of 40 &quot;talirs&quot; each. It had legislative, judiciary and executed powers, and was the first state institution in Montenegro&#x27;s modern history. The possibility of any significant opposition to the senate&#x27;s creation was extinguished by the appointment of important chieftains and other prominent citizens as senators. Njegoš himself was not a member of the senate, which was completely dominated by Vukotić and Vučićević during the first few years of its existence. The senate&#x27;s decisions were to be enforced by a military-police organization known as the &quot;Gvardija&quot; (The Guard). It had regional representatives throughout the tribal territories and its headquarters were situated in Rijeka Crnojevića. All its senior commanders were called captains, and were selected as the most prominent men in their clans. The &quot;Gvardija&quot; initially had a strength of about 150 warriors, but this number later rose to 420. Russian subsidies ensured that all of its members received their salaries without delay. Central authority was further strengthened by increasing the size of the &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s personal guard, the &quot;Perjanici&quot; (or &quot;plumed ones&quot;, so called because of the feathers that members wore on their guardsmen&#x27;s caps).

===Battle of Podgorica and early attempts at taxation===
In 1832, the nineteen-year-old Njegoš launched an attack against the Muslim tribes of Podgorica, who were helping the Ottomans subdue rebellions in Bosnia and neighbouring Albania. As in earlier times, when the &quot;vladika&quot; and &quot;guvernadur&quot; jointly led Montenegrin warriors into battle, Njegoš was joined by Vukotić and his men. The Montenegrins were also assisted by the rebellious Hoti clan of northern Albania. Njegoš and his forces were still at a disadvantage, as they lacked a concrete strategy for how to deal with the Ottomans and were not expecting them to bring cavalry onto the field. The Montenegrins&#x27; guerilla-like approach to warfare was ill-suited to taking a city such as Podgorica, whose high stone walls made it impenetrable from the surrounding flatlands. By launching the attack, Njegoš also risked falling out with the Russians, who at that time were allied with the Turks. Badly outmaneuvered, the Montenegrins were defeated and forced to retreat, taking with them many wounded. For Njegoš, the defeat would remain a lasting source of regret. Grand Vizier Reşid Mehmed Pasha seized on the opportunity and attacked a string of Montenegrin towns and villages in response to the attack, impaling and hanging all the Montenegrins that he captured. Subsequent political pressure from Russia discouraged Njegoš from seeking revenge.

In response to the defeat at Podgorica, the Montenegrins formed tactical alliances with neighbouring Muslims tribes that were hostile to the Porte. By entering into such alliances Njegoš risked further alienating the Russians, whose support Montenegro still desperately needed. To neutralize any suspicion that Montenegro was acting against Russian interests, Njegoš cultivated a close personal friendship with vice-consul Grujić, who advised the czar that Njegoš was as dependable as ever. In one of his letters to Grujić, Njegoš reported that the final advice Petar I gave him before his death was &quot;pray to God and hold on to Russia&quot;.

In 1833, Vukotić introduced regular taxation to Montenegro. As Vukotić, Grujić and Njegoš all realized, without taxes the country had no chance of functioning as a centralized state, let alone one which could raise an independent army or survive without needing to rely on plunder or Russian charity. Even though the rates were low, the tribes fiercely resisted the new laws, which never managed to generate more revenue than funds received through Russian subsidies. Many chieftains refused to levy taxes against their tribes, and some even mockingly called on Njegoš to come and collect them himself.

===Journey to Saint Petersburg and consecration===
Njegoš left Cetinje in early 1833 and set out on the long journey to Saint Petersburg. He hoped to be granted a meeting with Russian Emperor (czar) Nicholas I and consecrated as Metropolitan of Cetinje by the Holy Synod. Such a move was considered highly unusual at the time, as a &quot;vladika&quot; was traditionally consecrated by the Patriarch of Peć either in Patriarchal Monastery of Peć or in Sremski Karlovci, not Saint Petersburg. According to church canon, a &quot;vladika&quot; could not be any younger than thirty, a prerequisite that the twenty-year-old Njegoš clearly failed to meet. As such, he chose to have his consecration occur in Saint Petersburg out of political necessity, as he desperately needed the czar to bend church canons in his favour in order to acquire total legitimacy at home and brush aside any theological objections. On his way to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš made stops in several Austrian cities. In Vienna, he met famed Serbian language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Karadžić was greatly impressed with Njegoš, and in a letter to poet Lukijan Mušicki, he wrote: &quot;Petar Petrović is not yet twenty years old, but is taller and more handsome than any grenadier in Vienna. Not only does he know Serbian very well to read and write, but he also composes fine verse. He thinks that there is no finer language in the world than our popular tongue (and he&#x27;s right to think so, even if it were not true).&quot; Njegoš arrived in Saint Petersburg in March 1833 and was consecrated. After the ceremony, the czar granted Njegoš a total of 36,000 rubles, 15,000 of which were to make up for his travel expenses. Standing next to Njegoš as he gave his speech, the czar is said to have commented: &quot;My word, you&#x27;re bigger than I am.&quot; Grateful, the young &quot;vladika&quot; replied: &quot;Only God is bigger than the Russian czar!&quot; The czar promised Njegoš that Russia would intervene on Montenegro&#x27;s behalf as if it were one of its own &quot;gubernias&quot;, while the Holy Synod vowed to provide all the necessary equipment and funds needed to maintain regular religious services in the country.

Njegoš returned to Montenegro with the money that the czar had given him, as well as a number of theological books and icons for the Cetinje Monastery. Shortly afterwards, he established the first two elementary schools in Montenegro, one in Cetinje and the other in Dobrsko Selo, and sent sixteen young Montenegrins to pursue higher education in Serbia, seven of whom returned to Montenegro after finishing school. They were among the few literate people in the country. Njegoš also brought home a modern printing press, the first in Montenegro since the time of the Crnojević dynasty more than 300 years earlier. It was transported from Saint Petersburg in its entirety and had to be carried through the precarious mountain passes of Montenegro to the Cetinje Monastery, where it was finally set up. Although nearly all Montenegrins were illiterate, Njegoš persisted in establishing a periodical which he named &quot;Grlica&quot; (The Turtledove) and used the press to print some of his own poems, as well as works by Milutinović and Karadžić. &quot;Grlica&quot; did not last long, and fell out of circulation in 1839. The printing press survived until 1852, when its type was melted down to make bullets to fight the Turks.

===Canonization of Petar I, taxpayer revolt and the Battle of Grahovo===
While Njegoš was in Vienna and Russia in 1833, Vukotić took advantage of the &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s prolonged absence to increase his own power. Njegoš quickly moved to push Vukotić aside, installing his own brother Pero as senate leader and their cousin Đorđije—who had recently returned from Saint Petersburg—as Pero&#x27;s deputy. Vukotić and Vučićević were exiled to Russia. There, they spread countless rumours about Njegoš in an attempt to tarnish his reputation. While their actions threatened to ruin his image abroad, Njegoš was far more concerned about domestic discontent with his tax policies. He reasoned that his pious and overly superstitious citizens would not protest taxation as fiercely if the Petrovićes boasted a saint who was of the same bloodline. Hence, he arranged for the canonization of the late Petar I on the fourth anniversary of his death, in October 1834. With a saint in his family, Njegoš could now threaten any Montenegrin who challenged his authority with spiritual sanctions. Most Montenegrins were greatly enthusiastic about Petar&#x27;s canonization, and many flocked to his tomb in Cetinje to celebrate the event. While Njegoš was now in a more stable position than he was two years earlier, he still encountered several challenges to his rule. He was criticized for allegedly misappropriating the funds given to him by the Russians, and a tribal rebellion in Crmnica and Riječka &quot;nahiya&quot; erupted in response to the demands of tax collectors and chronic food shortages. The revolt was crushed by Njegoš&#x27;s cousins Đorđije and Stanko, but the allegations of fund misappropriation further tarnished his reputation among the Russians.
In early August 1836, the &quot;vizier&quot; of the Herzegovina Eyalet, Ali Pasha Rıdvanoğlu, attacked Grahovo, a town on Montenegro&#x27;s northern frontier that had long been claimed by the Montenegrins. Its Christian inhabitants, still Ali Pasha&#x27;s feudatories, had refused to pay the &quot;haraç&quot;, an Ottoman poll tax on non-Muslims. Ali Pasha&#x27;s forces overran the town, burned it to the ground and took countless Christians hostage; the rebels appealed to Njegoš for help. As honour demanded, Njegoš sent a force led by his teenage brother Joko and his nephew Stevan to rescue the hostages while Ali Pasha was in Gacko waiting for reinforcements to address the Montenegrin advance. The Montenegrins had assembled a force of several hundred warriors led by Joko, Stevan and eight Petrović chiefs. They were initially successful in rescuing one of the imprisoned clan leaders and his followers, but were overwhelmed by the combined forces of Ali Pasha, Trebinje&#x27;s Osman Pasha-&quot;beg&quot; and the cavalry reinforcements of Smaïl-aga Čengić in what became known as the Battle of Grahovo. Turks made use of a feigned retreat to lure the Montenegrins into a trap, surrounded them and used reinforcements to cut off their lines of retreat. More than forty of the Montenegrin warriors were hacked to death in the ensuing chaos, including Stevan and all eight Petrović chiefs. Joko was killed by Smaïl-aga himself, and his severed head was impaled on a spike for all to see. Njegoš responded by launching a counter-attack near Grahovo and fought the Ottomans to a standstill. Grahovo&#x27;s inhabitants fled to the Austrian-held territory on the Adriatic coast, but after being refused sanctuary, they were forced to return to the ruined town, swear an oath of loyalty to the Sultan and beg for forgiveness from the &quot;vizier&quot;. Consequently, they refused to avenge the deaths of the Petrovićes for fear of Ottoman retaliation.

===Second visit to Russia===
News of the defeat at Grahovo soon reached Saint Petersburg and, paired with the allegations of financial misappropriation, cemented his reputation among the Russians as that of an aggressive provocateur. Njegoš immediately sought permission from the chieftains to travel to Saint Petersburg and explain himself before the czar, given that Montenegro was increasingly desperate for Russian financial and political aid. The chieftains gave Njegoš their blessing, and he headed to Vienna before receiving any response from the Russians regarding his initial request. Njegoš was obliged to stay in Vienna for several weeks as the czar contemplated whether to grant him an audience. In Vienna, Njegoš spent more time with Karadžić, who had just returned from researching Slavic linguistic traits in Montenegro and was in the process of writing a German-language ethnographic study on the country titled &quot;Montenegro und die Montenegriner&quot; (&quot;Montenegro and the Montenegrin&quot;). Njegoš&#x27;s meetings with Karadžić caught the attention of Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich. Metternich&#x27;s distrust of Njegoš was exacerbated by the young &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s request for a visa to travel to France, then considered a breeding ground of radical ideas. Metternich saw to it that the request was denied. In a letter to one of his subordinates, he noted that Njegoš had &quot;spiritually and physically developed&quot;. He went on to say that Njegoš had &quot;little respect for the principles of religion and monarchy, is not firm in them, and is given to liberal and revolutionary ideas.&quot; He ended his message with a note stating that the Njegoš was to be closely monitored by Austrian agents both abroad and at home.

In 1837, the czar gave Njegoš permission to visit Saint Petersburg, just as a severe famine began to affect Montenegro. Immediately, Njegoš sensed that his second visit to the Russian capital was going to be different from the first. He was not greeted as warmly as he had been in 1833 and the Russians used the opportunity to call him out on several instances of &quot;unmonkish&quot; behaviour, particularly his fondness for being in the company of women. Despite this, Russia increased its annual subsidy and provided wheat to Montenegro&#x27;s famished citizens. While Montenegro&#x27;s dependence on Russia often provided the impoverished statelet with desperately needed funding, it was geopolitically disastrous for the Montenegrins, as both the Ottomans and Austrians believed that Montenegrin access to the Adriatic would constitute &quot;de facto&quot; Russian penetration into the Mediterranean given the nature of Russo−Montenegrin relations.

===Modernization efforts===
Njegoš stayed in Saint Petersburg for less than a month. He was escorted out of the city by Russian Lieutenant Colonel Jakov Nikolaevich Ozeretskovsky, who returned to Cetinje with the Montenegrin delegation to personally observe developments in Montenegro on behalf of the czar. Njegoš&#x27;s visit to Russia encouraged him to undertake further modernization efforts. The size of both the &quot;Perjanici&quot; and the &quot;Gvardija&quot; was increased substantially and Montenegrins caught feuding or conducting raids against Ottoman border towns were more severely punished. Njegoš also opened two gunpowder factories in Rijeka Crnojevića, and built a number of roads and artesian wells. He promoted a pan-Serb identity among his people, persuading Montenegrins to show solidarity with Serbia and stop wearing the &quot;fez&quot;, a Turkish hat that was commonly worn throughout the Balkans by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Njegoš proposed that Montenegrins instead adopt a traditional round hat (&quot;kapa&quot;) commonly worn in the region of Kotor. The thin black band that lined its exterior represented mourning for the Serb defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, and its red top symbolized all the Serbian blood that had been spilt since then. Njegoš also introduced the Obilić Medal for Valour, named after the legendary Serb warrior Miloš Obilić, who is said to have slain the Ottoman Sultan at Kosovo; the medal became Montenegro&#x27;s highest military decoration and was awarded until Montenegro&#x27;s union with Serbia in 1918. In keeping with his tendencies towards secularization, Njegoš now insisted on being addressed using royal titles as opposed to religious ones. Ozeretskovsky, now Russian envoy in Cetinje, wrote approvingly of Njegoš&#x27;s efforts: &quot;Senators, captains, the &quot;Gvardija&quot;, the &quot;Perjanici&quot;, all await [Njegoš&#x27;s] nod. I don&#x27;t believe that any other country in the world exists where the orders of the ruler are carried out so precisely and so quickly from the lowest to the greatest.&quot;

In 1838, Njegoš hosted Saxon King Frederick Augustus II, a keen naturalist who had come to Montenegro to study the country&#x27;s diverse flora. The king was housed at the Cetinje Monastery, and Njegoš was forced to move from room to room to accommodate him. Displeased by this state of affairs, and irritated by German press reports that described Montenegro as &quot;primitive&quot;, Njegoš ordered the construction of a secular dwelling that was to serve as both a royal palace and seat of government. Designed by Ozeretskovsky, the residence was a long, two-storied stone building with twenty-five rooms nestled behind a fortified wall and flanked by defensive towers at all four corners. Located just northeast of the Cetinje Monastery, and facing east towards Constantinople, it was soon dubbed the &quot;Biljarda&quot;, after the central room on the second floor which contained a billiard table that Njegoš had ordered transported to Montenegro from the Adriatic coast. The residence was within view of an unfinished stone watchtower intended to protect the monastery from cannon fire and whose construction had begun five years earlier, in 1833. When Njegoš realized that its location was unsuitable for a fortress, he ordered that its construction be abandoned, and it was converted into a tower where the heads of decapitated Turkish warriors were impaled on spears and left exposed to the elements. Turkish heads had previously been impaled beside the monastery walls. Dubbed the &quot;Tablja&quot;, the tower was meant to rival Ali Pasha&#x27;s citadel in Mostar, where the severed heads of four to five Serbs were displayed at any given time. John Gardner Wilkinson, an English traveler and Egyptologist, saw the &quot;Tablja&quot; while visiting Cetinje in 1844. He noted the &quot;acrid stench&quot; that the structure exuded and recalled how dogs would tear pieces of flesh and bone away from the rotting heads and drag them across Cetinje. Wilkinson met with both Njegoš and Ali Pasha on separate occasions over the course of his travels and attempted to persuade them to cease beheading their prisoners. Njegoš agreed in principle, but maintained that ceasing to sever the heads of Turkish warriors would be perceived as &quot;weakness&quot; and serve only to invite attack. Ali Pasha objected along similar lines and said that he doubted the good faith of the Montenegrins, whom he claimed were known for their &quot;wanton cruelty&quot;.

===Stand-off at Humac and peace negotiations===
Clashes between the Christian &quot;raia&quot; (subject peasantry) and their Ottoman overlords continued following the Battle of Grahovo. In 1838, Njegoš erected a fortress at Humac overlooking Grahovo. The fortress strategically dominated the area, and threatened Ali Pasha&#x27;s hold on the wider region. Following his second visit to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš was under considerable pressure from the Russians to secure a peace settlement, and the Porte pressure Ali Pasha to do the same. Seeking to avert a wider conflict, Njegoš wrote a letter to Mehmed Pasha Veçihi, the &quot;vizier&quot; of Bosnia, arguing that Grahovo had been settled by the Montenegrins several generations earlier, that it had paid taxes to the Ottomans for decades while abiding by Montenegrin customary law, and that Muslims and Christians had lived in the area peacefully until Ali Pasha&#x27;s atrocities two years earlier. Njegoš also sent a letter to Ali Pasha, suggesting that the Turks and Montenegrins restore Grahovo to its former status and offering to guarantee peace in return. In late October, Njegoš met with two envoys representing Ali Pasha and Mehmed Pasha in Cetinje and agreed to a negotiated settlement. The agreement had six points:
#Displaced inhabitants of Grahovo could return to the town unmolested.
#Jakov Daković would be declared the hereditary &quot;vojvoda&quot; of Grahovo.
#The locals would resume paying taxes to the Turks, which were to be collected by the &quot;vojvoda&quot;.
#Both the Turks and Montenegrins would be prohibited from erecting any towers or fortifications on the field of Grahovo.
#There was to be &quot;eternal peace&quot; between Montenegro—whose independence the agreement acknowledged—and the &quot;eyalets&quot; of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
#The agreement would be upheld by Njegoš and Mehmed Pasha.

Despite the agreement, Ali Pasha remained unconvinced. The fifth clause indicated that the Ottomans had recognized Montenegro&#x27;s independence, while the final clause made no mention of Ali Pasha at all. Indeed, Ali Pasha resented what he viewed as Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s interference in the affairs of the Herzegovina &quot;eyalet&quot; and began plotting to undermine the agreement. In early 1839, Njegoš sent a delegation consisting of Daković, &quot;vojvoda&quot; Radovan Piper, reverend Stevan Kovačević and several others to Bosnia to ascertain the exact amount that the people of Grahovo would be paying to the Sultan. Mehmed Pasha received the Montenegrins well, but when the delegation travelled south to Mostar, Ali Pasha had them arrested. Several warriors from Grahovo went to Mostar in the hope of freeing their kinsmen, but were impaled on Ali Pasha&#x27;s orders. The Grahovo delegates remained in Ottoman custody until May 1839, when they were released following the arrest of several other Montenegrins who then took their place as Ali Pasha&#x27;s hostages. For his part, Njegoš backed down on his commitment to raze any Montenegrin fortifications overlooking Grahovo and left the Humac fortress intact, ensuring that the agreement between him and Mehmed Pasha was never implemented.

===Conspiracy to assassinate Smaïl-aga===
Smaïl-aga&#x27;s contribution to the Ottoman victory at Grahovo was so great that the Porte had granted him a personal fiefdom that stretched from Gacko to Kolašin and was larger than all the Montenegrin-held territories combined. These land acquisitions were met with much trepidation by Smaïl-aga&#x27;s fellow &quot;beys&quot;, who feared that his rise would threaten their hold on power. In 1839, Serbia&#x27;s Prince Miloš sent a letter to Ali Pasha informing him that Smaïl-aga would conspire with the Porte to have him removed as &quot;vizier&quot; of Herzegovina. Ali Pasha promptly wrote to Njegoš, asking that he arrange for Smaïl-aga&#x27;s murder. He felt that Njegoš—who held Smaïl-aga primarily responsible for the slaughter at Grahovo—would be enthusiastic about the prospect of avenging his kinsmen. Ali Pasha also reasoned that by allowing the Montenegrins to kill the ambitious Herzegovinian &quot;bey&quot; he would be deflecting suspicion from himself, as the Montenegrins had more than enough reason to want Smaïl-aga dead. In mid-1839, Njegoš began exchanging letters with Smaïl-aga. The letters made it seem that he had forgiven Smaïl-aga for the deaths, and were meant to lull him into a false sense of security.

Between 1836 and 1840, relations between Smaïl-aga and the Christian inhabitants of his land had greatly deteriorated. Smaïl-aga&#x27;s son, Rustem-beg, drank heavily and often raped women from the Drobnjaci and Pivljani tribes while stopping by their villages to collect tribute. Furious, the Drobnjaci approached Njegoš and asked him for help killing Rustem-beg. Njegoš reasoned that by killing Rustem-beg he would risk infuriating Smaïl-aga, prompting him to seek vengeance against Njegoš, as well as the Drobnjaci and Pivljani. Instead, he persuaded the tribes to assassinate Smaïl-aga himself, as well as his closest associates, leaving Rustem-beg unprotected and powerless to avenge his father&#x27;s death. The Drobnjaci heeded Njegoš&#x27;s advice and organized a plot to have Smaïl-aga killed. In early September 1840, some of the Drobnjaci rebelled and refused to pay tribute to Smaïl-aga&#x27;s son, instead daring Smaïl-aga to come to their villages and collect it himself. Smaïl-aga arranged for a carriage procession to Drobnjaci and set up camp in Mljetičak, a hamlet overlooking the town of Nikšić. On 23 September, he and his delegation were ambushed by a band of 300–400 Drobnjaci warriors led by Novica Cerović, Đoko Malović and Šujo Karadžić. Smaïl-aga attempted to flee but discovered that a spy had hobbled all the horses. He was surrounded in his tent and shot by one of the Drobnjaci warriors; forty other Turks were killed in the ambush. Once Smaïl-aga was dead, the warrior Mirko Aleksić severed his head with an axe. Cerović then took the head to Cetinje and presented it to Njegoš. Satisfied with the outcome of the plot, Njegoš rewarded Cerović by making him a senator.

The killing of Smaïl-aga set in motion a series of attacks which left many Montenegrins and Turks dead. Anxious to conceal his role in the murder, Ali Pasha pretended to be outraged and ordered an attack on the Drobnjaci. More than seventy Drobnjaci warriors were killed, dozens of homes were torched, wells were poisoned and several women were raped. At the same time, Ali Pasha sought to shore up his own position by removing any pretext for intervention by the Porte. He contacted Njegoš and expressed a willingness to engage in peace negotiations. Njegoš was in a quandary; he knew that by failing to avenge the Drobnjaci he risked alienating a sizeable portion of his countrymen. At the same time, Njegoš realized that such negotiations could increase Montenegro&#x27;s territory and bring about diplomatic recognition by Austria and the Ottomans, who wanted peace and an end to the continuous skirmishing on the Montenegrin–Turkish frontier. In 1841, in an attempt to legitimize his country and under Russian pressure to normalize relations with Austria, Njegoš reached an agreement with the Austrians defining the Austro–Montenegrin border. Despite the agreement, the Austrians failed to officially recognize Montenegro as a sovereign state, and demanded the Montenegrins&#x27; complete withdrawal from the coast in exchange for Montenegrin tribesmen being permitted to seek pasturage for their sheep and cattle in Kotor. The withdrawal required the Montenegrins to give up two historic monasteries (Podmaine and Stanjevići), which the Austrians subsequently purchased for a considerable sum. Despite these concessions, the agreement improved trading between the two sides.

In 1842, Njegoš and Ali Pasha met at a Dubrovnik palace to negotiate peace. The two eventually reached an agreement, which was signed before representatives of Austria and Russia. As Njegoš and Ali Pasha emerged from the palace, Ali Pasha produced a bag full of gold coins and tossed them into the air, prompting the Montenegrin delegation—which included several chiefs—to scramble after as many as possible. Through this action, Ali Pasha effectively demonstrated Montenegro&#x27;s poverty before the Austrians and Russians, embarrassing Njegoš in the process.

===Osman Pasha&#x27;s invasion of southern Montenegro===
Osman Pasha, the &quot;vizier&quot; of Scutari, was an exceptional politician and military leader. Despite his Serb origin, he held a deep hatred for Montenegro, and Njegoš in particular. As Smaïl-aga&#x27;s son-in-law, he blamed the Montenegrins for his grisly death, and also wished to follow in the footsteps of his father, Suleiman Pasha, who had played a key role in crushing the First Serbian Uprising in 1813. Osman Pasha invaded southern Montenegro in 1843, and his forces soon seized the strategically important islands of Vranjina and Lesendro on Lake Skadar. The capture of these islands rendered Montenegrin trading excursions to towns such as Podgorica and Scutari nearly impossible. The Porte sensed an opportunity to bring Montenegro in line, and offered to recognize Njegoš as secular ruler of Montenegro if he in turn recognized the Porte&#x27;s sovereignty over his country. Njegoš refused, and attempted to retake the islands by force. The Montenegrin forces had no artillery to speak of, and each one of their attempts to recapture the islands resulted in failure. Njegoš tried to enlist foreign support, particularly from Russia and France. To Njegoš&#x27;s surprise, the Russians were not interested in entangling themselves in the dispute. The French, although sympathetic, failed to intervene. The United Kingdom, as it usually did prior to the premiership of William Ewart Gladstone, sided with the Ottomans. When Njegoš attempted to construct ships to retake the islands, the Austrians maneuvered to prevent it, and later refused to supply the munitions needed to arrange a counterattack.

===Osman Pasha===
A severe drought struck Montenegro in late 1846, followed by a catastrophic famine in 1847. Osman Pasha took advantage of Montenegro&#x27;s misfortune and promised some of the Montenegrin chieftains large amounts of wheat if they rose up against the Petrovićes. Njegoš was caught off-guard, having spent much of late 1846 in Vienna overseeing the publication of his epic poem, &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; (The Mountain Wreath). The leaders of the rebellion were Markiša Plamenac, a captain with the &quot;Perjanici&quot; in Crmnica, and Todor Božović, a senator from the Piperi tribe. Plamenac had been one of Njegoš&#x27;s close confidants. According to legend, he planned to become a member of the Petrović clan by marrying the daughter of Njegoš&#x27;s brother Pero, thus increasing his own power and standing. When Pero married his daughter off to Plamenac&#x27;s cousin, the son of reverend Jovan Plamenac, the once-loyal captain switched sides and became an agent of Osman Pasha. On , Plamenac led a band of rebels in an assault against lower Crmnica alongside the Turks. Fortunately for Njegoš, some members of the Plamenac tribe had remained loyal to the Petrovićes. About two weeks later, a force of about 2,000 Petrovićes, Katuni and Plamenac tribesmen forced the Turks out of Crmnica. Plamenac fled Montenegro and sought refuge with the &quot;vizier&quot;, persuading him to erect an Ottoman fortification on the island of Grmožur to keep Njegoš&#x27;s forces at bay. Njegoš countered by building a defensive tower overlooking Lake Skadar.

Unable to subdue the Ottomans militarily, Njegoš concentrated on eliminating those who had betrayed him and his clan. Several weeks after the insurrection was crushed, he informed Božović that he had forgiven him and gave him his word that he and his two brothers would not be harmed if they returned to Cetinje. The two sides arranged to meet in a small village just outside the town. Instead of going to see the brothers, Njegoš sent several henchmen to meet them on his behalf. The Božovićes were arrested and executed by firing squad; their bodies were put on public display as a warning against further insubordination. In early November, Plamenac was shot to death by a fellow Montenegrin in Ottoman-held territory. The assassin was arrested by the Ottomans, and hanged in Scutari. Njegoš posthumously awarded him an Obilić Medal. Osman Pasha soon incited a second revolt; it was also suppressed and Njegoš had all the rebels shot. He then sent an assassin to Scutari in a failed attempt to have Osman Pasha killed. Osman Pasha subsequently sent a number of his own assassins to kill Njegoš, who survived several attempted poisonings and an attempted bombing of his headquarters. By 1848, the situation on Montenegro&#x27;s southern border had stabilized.

===Role in the rise of South Slav nationalism===
By the mid-1840s, the idea of unifying all South Slavs into a common state had gained much support from Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims living in the Austrian Empire. Njegoš&#x27;s travels to Austria and Italy exposed him to many of the concepts that eventually formed the backbone of the Illyrianist movement, notably that all South Slavs share common cultural and linguistic traits and are, as such, one people. His correspondence with South Slavic nationalist leaders in neighbouring lands disturbed the Austrians, who wished to avoid a South Slav uprising in the Habsburg territories. Consequently, Vienna increased its surveillance of the &quot;vladika&quot; and intercepted all his correspondence, amid widespread turmoil during the revolutions of 1848. That year, Njegoš supported the efforts of the pan-Slavist &quot;Ban&quot; Josip Jelačić to resist the implementation of Hungarian as the official language of Croatia. Njegoš soon became disillusioned with Jelačić due to his siding with the House of Habsburg against the Hungarians, believing that such an alliance was ultimately detrimental to the goal of South Slavic unification. Later that year, Njegoš began exchanging letters with Prince Aleksandar of Serbia and the politician Ilija Garašanin, who sought to acquire Serbia access to the sea and revive the medieval Serbian Empire. Montenegro&#x27;s geographic location made it particularly significant to Garašanin because of its proximity to the Adriatic. In April 1848, Njegoš secretly hosted Serbian emissary Matija Ban in Cetinje. The two discussed plans for instigating an uprising in Bosnia, Herzegovina and &quot;Old Serbia&quot; (Kosovo and Macedonia), seeking to take advantage of the revolutionary fervor sweeping through Europe. Whereas the Serbians were more focused on destabilizing the Ottoman establishment in Kosovo and Macedonia, Njegoš was more immediately concerned with the situation in neighbouring Herzegovina. Despite these differences, Njegoš and Prince Aleksandar agreed that, in the event of a unified Serbian state, Prince Aleksandar was to be proclaimed the hereditary secular leader of the Serb people while Njegoš would become the Patriarch of a unified Serbian Orthodox Church.

===Last years and death===
By 1849, Njegoš began experiencing an incessant cough and soon a doctor from Kotor discovered that he had tuberculosis. By early 1850, it was clear that the condition was life-threatening. Painfully aware that Montenegro did not have a single trained physician, he travelled to Kotor in the spring and composed his last will and testament, intending for it to prevent the power struggle that had preceded his own accession to the position of &quot;vladika&quot;. He mailed the will to vice-consul Gagić in Dubrovnik with a message asking him to return the document unopened in the event that he regained his health. Njegoš then headed to Venice and Padua, where he spent much time resting and seemingly succeeded in containing his illness. His cough returned after eight days; he left Padova and went back to Montenegro in the hope that the country&#x27;s fresh mountain air would alleviate his symptoms. He spent the summer of 1850 resting and writing poetry. His condition prevented him from lying down, so he had to keep in a constant upright position, even when sleeping. By November 1850, the cough abated and Njegoš undertook another journey to Italy. He reached Italy in January 1851, and travelled through Venice, Milan, Genoa and Rome. He visited the ruins of Pompeii with Serbian writer Ljubomir Nenadović, and the two men travelled together along Italy&#x27;s western coast discussing philosophy and contemporary politics. The journey was documented in a book Nenadović published following Njegoš&#x27;s death, titled &quot;Letters from Italy&quot;.

While staying in Italy, Njegoš was disturbed by reports of Omar Pasha&#x27;s plans to invade Montenegro. He planned another visit to Saint Petersburg to enlist Russian support, but the czar refused to meet him. Njegoš headed back to Montenegro in the summer, having consulted physicians in Vienna on his way back. While in Vienna, he encountered Serbian photographer Anastas Jovanović, who persuaded him to pose for a picture in his studio. Jovanović&#x27;s calotype portrait is the only known photograph of Njegoš in existence. Jovanović also photographed a group of &quot;Perjanici&quot; that had accompanied Njegoš on his journey to Italy, as well as the chieftains Mirko Petrović and Petar Vukotić. Njegoš returned to Cetinje in August 1851, with his health rapidly deteriorating. He died there on , surrounded by his closest associates and just two weeks shy of his thirty-eighth birthday. Eyewitnesses reported his last words as &quot;love Montenegro and render justice to the poor.&quot;

Njegoš&#x27;s will named Danilo Petrović, the son of Njegoš&#x27;s cousin, Stanko Stijepov, as his successor. Danilo had been sent to acquire a basic education in Russia the year before the &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s death, and was not in Montenegro at the time. When Njegoš died, Đorđije disregarded the will and appeared before the Governing Senate asking that the senators proclaim Pero the new &quot;vladika&quot;. Danilo returned from Russia in 1852, bringing with him a letter authored by the Russian czar which made it clear that Saint Petersburg endorsed Danilo&#x27;s accession, not Pero&#x27;s. In the ensuing power struggle, Đorđije and Pero lost the support of most of the tribal chiefs, and they and their families were forced into exile. Pero sought refuge in Kotor, where his wife gave birth to a boy. In the hope of preserving his brother&#x27;s memory, Pero named the newborn Rade, but the child died after only two months. Pero himself died in 1854 without having produced any male offspring, thus extinguishing the male line of Njegoš&#x27;s parents. Njegoš&#x27;s mother died in 1858, and his father lived into his late nineties, having outlived all three of his sons.

==Burial==
Prior to his death, Njegoš had asked to be buried atop Mount Lovćen, in a chapel dedicated to his predecessor. He had designed the chapel himself, and oversaw its construction in 1845. Following his death in October 1851, Njegoš was interred at the Cetinje Monastery. His remains were transferred to Mount Lovćen in 1855. They remained there until 1916, when during the First World War, Montenegro was occupied by Austria-Hungary and the Habsburg occupiers decided to erect a monument to Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph on Mount Lovćen. Not wishing for a monument to the Austrian Emperor to be located on the same perch as a symbol of South Slavic national feeling, Austro-Hungarian authorities demanded that Njegoš&#x27;s remains be moved back to Cetinje. The Montenegrins had little choice in the matter and the remains were removed under the supervision of Serbian Orthodox clergy so that the Austro-Hungarians would not be accused of desecration. By the end of the war, Njegoš&#x27;s chapel was severely damaged. Local authorities negotiated with the Yugoslav government for years over the question of where, when and at whose expense Njegoš was to be buried. Montenegrin officials favoured restoring the original chapel, while the authorities in Belgrade opened a competition over the designs of a planned mausoleum. Some of the plans differed greatly from the original Byzantinesque building. Due to lack of funds, plans for a mausoleum were discarded by 1925 and the original church building was reconstructed. In September 1925, in the course of a three-day ceremony sponsored and attended by Yugoslavia&#x27;s King Alexander and Queen Maria, the chapel was rededicated and Njegoš&#x27;s remains were reburied. Historian Andrew B. Wachtel writes: &quot;The tone of the event, which was described extensively in the Yugoslav press, bordered on a piety more appropriate for the treatment of a saint than a writer.&quot;

At the end of the Second World War, Yugoslavia came under communist rule. In 1952, Yugoslavia&#x27;s communist authorities decided to replace Njegoš&#x27;s chapel with a secular mausoleum designed by Ivan Meštrović. Wachtel suggests that this was done to &quot;de-Serbianize&quot; Njegoš and eliminate any trace of the chapel&#x27;s Byzantine design. In the late 1960s the chapel was demolished, and a mausoleum was constructed by 1971. Njegoš&#x27;s remains were transferred back to Mount Lovćen in 1974, and the mausoleum was officially inaugurated that year.

==Literary works==

===Influences and style===
Despite being Montenegro&#x27;s ruler for more than twenty years, Njegoš is best known for his literary output. His writings drew on Serb folklore, lyric poetry and biblical stories. He began writing poetry at the age of seventeen, and his literary opus includes &quot;Glas kamenštaka&quot; (The Voice of a Stone-Cutter; 1833), &quot;Lijek jarosti turske&quot; (The Cure for Turkish Fury; 1834), &quot;Ogledalo srpsko&quot; (The Serbian Mirror; 1835), &quot;Luča mikrokozma&quot; (The Ray of the Microcosm; 1845), &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; (The Mountain Wreath; 1847), &quot;Lažni car Šćepan mali&quot; (The False Tsar Stephen the Little; 1851) and, posthumously, &quot;Slobodijada&quot; (The Freedom Song; 1854). His most famous works are &quot;Luča mikrokozma&quot;, &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; and &quot;Lažni car Šćepan mali&quot;, all epic poems.
The historian Zdenko Zlatar argues that Njegoš&#x27;s mentor (and later secretary) Sima Milutinović influenced him more than any other person, noting that while Milutinović &quot;was not a great poet or playwright [...] no one in Cetinje or for that matter the whole of Montenegro had a better knowledge of the wider world.&quot; Indeed, Milutinović introduced Njegoš to his own poetry, which Professor Svetlana Slapšak describes as being &quot;written in unusual syntax, with unparalleled neologisms and fantastic etymologies&quot;. The position of Njegoš&#x27;s secretary was later occupied by Dimitrije Milaković, a physically disabled Dubrovnik-born polyglot who had studied philosophy in Vienna and came to Montenegro with Vukotić and Vučićević in 1832. Milaković operated the printing press at Cetinje Monastery, served as editor-in-chief of &quot;Grlica&quot; and edited all Njegoš&#x27;s works prior to their publication. Njegoš was also a great admirer of the Serbian revolutionary Karađorđe, who led the First Serbian Uprising, and dedicated &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; to his memory. The linguist Vuk Karadžić influenced Njegoš through his reforms of the Serbian language, and used his own fame to popularize Njegoš&#x27;s work. Moreover, he introduced Njegoš to his inner circle, which included some of the leading Serb poets of the day, such as Branko Radičević and Milica Stojadinović-Srpkinja. Njegoš was also impacted by the works of foreign writers, such as Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;; their influence can be strongly felt in &quot;Luča mikrokozma&quot;.

Slapšak notes that Njegoš was born into a culture with an almost exclusively oral storytelling tradition, where the only written works were of a religious nature or recounted the history of Montenegro. Describing his mastery of the traditional oral epic, she asserts that it was the &quot;only adequate, literary genre of his age&quot;, one that allowed him &quot;to interpret [his] community for the world and for himself in the language of poetry.&quot; Multiple scholars have also noted similarities between the chorus of Ancient Greek tragedies and that of &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; (the &quot;kolo&quot;, which represents the collective voice of Montenegro&#x27;s inhabitants, reflecting their hopes, fears and desires.) The epic also features similar character roles, such as that of the pensive ruler (Danilo), the hero (Vuk Mandušić), the blind prophetic monk (&quot;iguman&quot; Stefan) and the lamenting woman (Batrić&#x27;s sister).

===Critical reception===
Most of what was written about Njegoš during his lifetime was the work of foreigners (officials, scholars or travelers). One of the earliest detailed academic analyses of Njegoš&#x27;s works was published by Milan Rešetar in 1890. Following the establishment of a common South Slav state in 1918, scholars reinterpreted Njegoš in a Yugoslav light, despite some of his writings being decidedly anti-Muslim and having the potential to alienate Yugoslavia&#x27;s Muslim citizens, who formed about ten percent of the new country&#x27;s population. During the interwar period, future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić wrote extensively about Njegoš and his works, and published several papers on the &quot;vladika&quot;&#x27;s poetry after the war, as well. Other authors who wrote about Njegoš include Mihailo Lalić, Isidora Sekulić and Anica Savić Rebac.

A former politician and leading Marxist theoretician, Djilas wrote a lengthy study of Njegoš&#x27;s life and works in the late 1950s while serving a prison sentence after a row with Yugoslavia&#x27;s communist leadership. The manuscript was smuggled out of the prison by Djilas&#x27; associates in the early 1960s and taken to the West, where it was edited, translated from the original Serbo-Croatian into English, and published under the title &quot;Njegoš: Poet, Prince, Bishop&quot;, in 1966. The book remains the only English-language biography of Njegoš, and the subsequent Serbo-Croatian edition (1988) is likely the most extensive study of his life in that language, as well. Djilas himself was a great admirer of Njegoš, and later recounted that &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; was the only text that he always carried by his side during the Second World War.

Njegoš&#x27;s writings have received varying degrees of scholarly and critical attention since his death. Some studies have been written about &quot;Luča mikrokozma&quot;, though very little has been written about &quot;Lažni car Šćepan mali&quot;, which Djilas believes contains some of Njegoš&#x27;s finest verse. Of all Njegoš&#x27;s writings, the one that has been the subject of most scholarly analysis is &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot;, which virtually all critics regard as his finest work. It is also his most famous, having been reprinted more than 120 times between 1847 and 1996. By 1913, &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; had been translated into ten different languages. It has been translated into English twice – once by James W. Wiles, in 1930, and the second time by Vasa D. Mihailovich, in 1986. Set in the early 1700s, the epic revolves around Njegoš&#x27;s ancestor, &quot;vladika&quot; Danilo, as he ponders what to do with the Montenegrins who have converted to Islam amid increasing Ottoman encroachment. Danilo knows that every Montenegrin has a responsibility towards his family and towards his clan, for to kill a fellow Montenegrin would elicit a blood feud, but he also realizes that each man has a duty towards his faith and towards his nation, and that these two strains of responsibility are completely irreconcilable. Ultimately, the Montenegrin Christians give their Muslim kin the option of returning to Christianity or of facing death. On Christmas Day, those that refuse to comply are killed and their villages burned. In light of its subject matter, &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; became a source of considerable controversy during and after the Yugoslav Wars, when critics began to re-examine the text within the context of the conflicts&#x27; many atrocities. Judah goes as far as to call it a &quot;paean to ethnic cleansing&quot;. He writes: &quot;In the wake of another Balkan War, its significance is that of a missing link. It helps explain how the Serbian national consciousness has been molded and how ideas of national liberation became inextricably intertwined with killing your neighbour and burning his village.&quot; Some scholars have even claimed that the epic is based on a historical massacre from the late 17th century. Djilas notes that no such event is mentioned in an authoritative history of Montenegro that was written by Danilo&#x27;s successor, Vasilije, and published in 1756. Thus, Djilas concludes that the Christmas Day massacre is either entirely fictional or that the elimination of Montenegrin Muslims occurred in stages over a long period of time, as opposed to a single atrocity eradicating them all. Srdja Pavlović contends that the massacre is a conflation of two historical events – the widespread conversion of Montenegrins to Islam in 1485 and the expulsion of the Medojević family from Montenegro in 1704, following a property dispute. There is no scholarly consensus as to whether the Christmas Day massacre ever occurred.

==Legacy==

Njegoš is regarded as an ambitious, able ruler who was esteemed during and after his lifetime. He is remembered for laying the foundation for the modern Montenegrin state as well as for being one of the most acclaimed South Slavic poets of his time. Since his death, Njegoš has remained a Serbian political and cultural father. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a variety of political factions (including Serbian nationalists, Yugoslavs and communists) drew inspiration from his works. In the decades after Njegoš&#x27; death, &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; became the Montenegrin national epic, reaffirming its connections to the Serbian and Christian worlds and celebrating the military skill of its warriors. For Serbs, the poem was significant because it evoked themes similar to the Kosovo epics and reminded them of their solidarity with Montenegro against the Ottoman Turks. 
Like many of his contemporaries, Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, knew &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; off by heart.

Njegoš&#x27;s influence parallels that of Shakespeare in the English-speaking world and his languagethough archaichas supplied modern Serbian with a number of well known quotations. The epic has become the basic educational text for Montenegrins and Serbs. In Montenegro it was (and still is) learnt by heart, and has been integrated into oral tradition. Njegoš&#x27;s picture can often be seen in taverns, offices, hospitals, on Yugoslav and Serbian currency and in people&#x27;s homes in Montenegro and Serbia.
After the founding of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century, Njegoš was twice declared Yugoslavia&#x27;s national poet, by the royal government in the 1920s and by the communist authorities following the Second World War. In 1947, the 100th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot;, the government promoted Njegoš as a Montenegrin poet rather than a Serb. The change in Njegoš&#x27;s ethnicity may have been related to the communist policy of Brotherhood and Unity and its promotion of a Montenegrin ethnic identity (which the communists had proclaimed distinct from that of Serbs in 1943). Njegoš&#x27; works, particularly &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot;, have been sources of collective identity for Serbs, Montenegrins and Yugoslavs. Njegoš&#x27;s works have been removed from school curricula in Bosnia and Herzegovina so as not to incite ethnic tensions, given the divisive nature of some of his works.

In 2013, Njegoš was regionally canonized within the Serbian Orthodox eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral as Saint Petar of Lovćen, with his feast day celebrated on 19 May (6 May according to the old calendar). In 2017, the first church dedicated to him was opened in Bar.

<doc id="230961" wikidata="Q1151386" url="?curid=230961" title="K–12">
<text>K–12, from kindergarten to 12th grade, is an English language expression that indicates the range of years of publicly supported primary and secondary education found in the United States and Canada, which is similar to publicly supported school grades before tertiary education in several other countries, such as Afghanistan, Australia, China, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Iran, the Philippines, South Korea, and Turkey. K–12 refers to the American system which affords authority to local intersectional &quot;districts&quot; which may be specific to a municipality, county, or several regions, depending on population and proximity.

==History==
U.S. public education was conceived of in the late 18th century. In 1790, Pennsylvania became the first state to require some form of free education for everyone regardless of whether they could afford it. New York passed similar legislation in 1805. In 1820, Massachusetts became the first state to create a tuition-free high school, Boston English.

The first K–12 public school systems appeared in the early 19th century. In the 1830s and 1840s, Ohioans were taking a significant interest in the idea of public education. At that point in time, schools were commonly operated independently of each other, with little attempt at uniformity. The Akron School Law of 1847 changed this. The city of Akron unified the operations, curriculum and funding of local schools into a single public school district: 

In 1849, the state of Ohio enacted a law modeled after the Akron law which extended the idea of school districts to cover the rest of the state.

By 1930, all 48 states had passed laws making education compulsory, and in 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which committed the federal government to significant ongoing expenditures to each state for the purpose of sustaining local K–12 school systems. The ESEA essentially made K–12 education the law of the land.

Since its inception, public K–12 has been debated and subject to several waves of reform throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In the 1980s, Reagan&#x27;s &#x27;A Nation at Risk&#x27; initiative included provisions requiring public education to be evaluated based on standards, and teacher pay to be based on evaluations. In the 1990s, the Goals 2000 Act and the &quot;Improving America&#x27;s Schools&quot; act provided additional federal funding to states to bolster local K–12 systems. This was followed in the 2000s by a rigorous uptick in standards-based evaluations with the No Child Left Behind Act, and the Race to the Top Act. In 2015, President Barack Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which returned some power to state governments with respect to evaluations and standards.

==Etymology==
The expression &quot;K–12&quot; is a shortening of kindergarten (K) for 5–6 year olds through twelfth grade (12) for 17–18 year-olds, as the first and last grades, 
respectively, of free education in these countries. The related term &quot;P–12&quot; is also occasionally used in Australia and the United States to refer to the sum of K–12 plus preschool education.

The accompanying image illustrates the education system in the United States. The table shows the progression of the education system starting with the basic K–12 system then progressing through post-secondary education. K–14 refers to K–12 plus two years of post-secondary where training was received from vocational-technical institutions or community or junior colleges. K–16 is 12 years of compulsory education plus a 4-year undergrad program. The K numbers refer to the years of educational attainment and continues to progress upward accordingly depending on the degree being sought.

== Usage ==

The term is often used as a kind of shorthand to collectively refer to the entirety of primary and secondary education, as it is much easier than having to say one is referring in the aggregate to elementary, middle, and high school education. However, it is rare for a school district to actually teach all K–12 grades at one unified school campus. Even the smallest school districts try to maintain, at a minimum, a two-tier distinction between an elementary school (K–8) and a high school (9–12). Unified K–12 schools are common, however, in rural and remote areas throughout Canada. The terms &quot;PK–12&quot;, &quot;PreK–12&quot;, or &quot;Pre-K–12&quot; are sometimes used to add pre-kindergarten.

In school website URLs, the term also appears in the form &quot;k12&quot; (no punctuation), generally used before the country code top-level domain (or in the United States, the state&#x27;s second-level domain). 

In marketing, the term is also used by American multinationals selling into the educational sector, such as Dell where UK customers are presented with this as a market segment choice.

== P–12 ==
In Australia, P–12 is sometimes used in place of K–12, particularly in Queensland, where it is used as an official term in the curriculum framework. P–12 schools serve children for the thirteen years from prep until Year 12, without including the separate kindergarten component. In Canada (Nova Scotia) P–12 is used commonly in place of K–12 and serves students from grade Primary through 12.

== K–14, K–16, K–18 and K–20 ==

K–14 education also includes community colleges (the first two years of university). K–16 education adds a four-year undergraduate university degree. For simplicity purposes, education shorthand was created to denote specific education levels of achievement. This shorthand is commonly used in articles, publications and educational legislation. The following list contains the most commonly found shorthand descriptors:

* P–14: Pre-school to associate degree
* P–16: Pre-school to bachelor&#x27;s degree
* P–18: Pre-school to master&#x27;s degree
* P–20: Pre-school to graduate degree
* K–14: Kindergarten to associate degree
* K–16: Kindergarten to bachelor&#x27;s degree
* K–18: Kindergarten to master&#x27;s degree
* K–20: Kindergarten to graduate degree

The Career Technical Education (CTE) Unit of the California Community College Economic Development and Workforce Preparation Division focuses on program coordination and advocacy, policy development and coordination with K–18 workforce preparation and career and technical education systems.

The ASCCC Chancellor&#x27;s Office Career Technical Education (CTE) Unit of the Economic Development and Workforce Preparation Division focuses on program coordination and advocacy, policy development and coordination with K–18 workforce preparation and career and technical education systems. Responsible for the implementation of the Vocational and Technical Education Act (VTEA), managing and coordinating activities that impact other interagency and intra-agency objectives. In addition, the CTE Unit is also responsible for the development, dissemination, and implementation of the California State Plan and the annual performance reports.

<text>The Museo del Prado ( ; ), officially known as Museo Nacional del Prado, is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It houses collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish royal collection, and the single best collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. The numerous works by Francisco Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Hieronymus Bosch, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, and Diego Velázquez, are some of the highlights of the collection. Velázquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum&#x27;s fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now one of the largest outside of Italy.

The collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to many other works of art and historic documents. As of 2012, the museum displayed about 1,300 works in the main buildings, while around 3,100 works were on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder were in storage.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 attendance plunged by 76 percent to 852,161. Nonetheless, the Prado was ranked as the 16th most-visited museum in the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.

The Prado and the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía form Madrid&#x27;s Golden Triangle of Art along the Paseo del Prado, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2021.

==History==
The building that is now the home of the &quot;Museo Nacional del Prado&quot; was designed in 1785 by architect of the Enlightenment in Spain Juan de Villanueva on the orders of Charles III to house the Natural History Cabinet. Nonetheless, the building&#x27;s final function was not decided until the monarch&#x27;s grandson, Ferdinand VII, encouraged by his wife, Queen María Isabel de Braganza, decided to use it as a new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures. The royal museum, which would soon become known as the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture, and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado, opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. It was created with the double aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown and to demonstrate to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was of equal merit to any other national school. Also, this museum needed several renovations during the 19th and 20th centuries, because of the increase of the collection as well as the increase of the public who wants to see all the collection that the museum hosted.
The first catalogue of the museum, published in 1819 and solely devoted to Spanish painting, included 311 paintings, although at that time the museum housed 1,510 from the various royal residences, the Reales Sitios, including works from other schools. The exceptionally important royal collection, which forms the nucleus of the present-day , started to increase significantly in the 16th century during the time of Charles V and continued under the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon monarchs. Their efforts and determination led to the royal collection being enriched by some of the masterpieces now to be seen in the Prado. These include &quot;The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden, &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; by Hieronymous Bosch, &quot;The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest&quot; by El Greco, &quot;Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)&quot; by Mantegna, &quot;The Holy Family&quot;, known as &quot;La Perla (painting)&quot;, by Raphael, &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Charles V&quot; by Titian, &quot;Christ Washing the Disciples&#x27; Feet&quot; by Tintoretto, Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Self-portrait at 26&quot;, &quot;Las Meninas&quot; by Velázquez, &quot;The Three Graces&quot; by Rubens, and &quot;The Family of Charles IV&quot; by Goya.

In addition to works from the Spanish royal collection, the other holdings increased and enriched the museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections have been added to that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous legacies, donations and purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including &quot;The Fountain of Grace&quot; by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Martír altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tomás in Ávila by Pedro Berruguete, and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de doña María de Aragón. Most of the Museum&#x27;s 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, José de Madrazo and Federico de Madrazo, Vicente López, Carlos de Haes, Eduardo Rosales and Sorolla.

Upon the deposition of Isabella II in 1868, the museum was nationalized and acquired the new name of &quot;&quot;. The building housed the royal collection of arts, and it rapidly proved too small. The first enlargement to the museum took place in 1918. Since the creation of the more than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into its collection, as well as numerous sculptures, prints, drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases, which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Numerous bequests have enriched the museum&#x27;s holdings, such as the outstanding collection of medals left to the museum by Pablo Bosch; the drawings and items of decorative art left by Pedro Fernández Durán as well as Van der Weyden&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Duran Madonna&quot;; and the Ramón de Errazu bequest of 19th-century paintings. Particularly important donations include Barón Emile d&#x27;Erlanger&#x27;s gift of Goya&#x27;s Black Paintings in 1881. Among the numerous works that have entered the collection through purchase are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works by El Greco, &quot;The Fable&quot; and &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot; acquired in 1993 and 2001, Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Countess of Chinchon&quot; bought in 2000, Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Ferdinando Brandani&quot;, acquired in 2003, Bruegel&#x27;s &quot;The Wine of Saint Martin&#x27;s Day&quot; bought in 2010 and Fra Angelico&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Pomegranate&quot; purchased in 2016.
Between 1873 and 1900, the Prado helped decorate city halls, new universities, and churches. During the Second Spanish Republic from 1931 to 1936, the focus was on developing provincial museums. During the Spanish Civil War, upon the recommendation of the League of Nations, the museum staff removed 353 paintings, 168 drawings and the Dauphin&#x27;s Treasure and sent the art to Valencia, then later to Girona, and finally to Geneva. The art had to be returned across French territory in night trains to the museum upon the commencement of World War II. During the early years of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, many paintings were sent to embassies.

The main building was enlarged with short pavilions in the rear between 1900 and 1960. The next enlargement was the incorporation of two buildings (nearby but not adjacent) into the institutional structure of the museum: the Casón del Buen Retiro, which is equipped to display up to 400 paintings and which housed the bulk of the 20th-century art from 1971 to 1997, and the Salón de Reinos (Throne building), formerly the Army Museum.

In 1993, an extension proposed by the Prado&#x27;s director at the time, Felipe Garin, was quickly abandoned after a wave of criticism. In the late 1990s, a $14 million roof work forced the Velázquez masterpiece &quot;Las Meninas&quot; to change galleries twice. In 1998, the Prado annex in the nearby Casón del Buen Retiro closed for a $10 million two-year overhaul that included three new underground levels. In 2007, the museum finally executed Rafael Moneo&#x27;s project to expand its exposition room to 16,000 square meters, hoping to increase the yearly number of visitors from 1.8 million to 2.5 million.

A glass-roofed and wedge-shaped foyer now contains the museum&#x27;s shops and cafeteria, removing them from the main building to make more room for galleries. The 16th-century Cloister of Jerónimo has been removed stone by stone to make foundations for increased stability of surrounding buildings and will be re-assembled in the new museum&#x27;s extension. Hydraulic jacks had to be used to prevent the basement walls from falling during construction.
 The enlargement is an underground building which connects the main building to another one entirely reconstructed.

In November 2016, it was announced that British architect Norman Foster, in a joint project with Carlos Rubio Carvajal, is to renovate the Hall of Realms, which once formed part of the Buen Retiro palace and transform it into a $32 million extension of the Prado. The museum announced the selection of Foster and Rubio after a jury reviewed the proposals of the eight competition finalists – including David Chipperfield, Rem Koolhaas and Eduardo Souto de Moura – who had already been shortlisted from an initial list of 47 international teams of architects. The building was acquired by the Prado in 2015, after having served as an army museum until 2005. The project is designed to give the Prado about 61,500 square feet of additional available space, of which about 27,000 square feet will be used to exhibit works. Only in 2021, the Spanish government approved the plans and awarded the project 36 million euros.

==Historic structure==
The Prado Museum building is one of the buildings constructed during the reign of Charles III (Carlos III) as part of a grandiose building scheme designed to bestow upon Madrid a monumental urban space. The building was initially conceived by José Moñino y Redondo, count of Floridablanca, and was commissioned in 1785 by Charles III for the &quot;reurbanización&quot; of the Paseo del Prado. To this end, Charles III called on one of his favorite architects, Juan de Villanueva, author also of the nearby Botanical Garden and the City Hall of Madrid.

The &quot;prado&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot;) that was where the museum now stands gave its name to the area, the Salón del Prado (later Paseo del Prado), and to the museum itself upon nationalisation. Work on the building stopped at the conclusion of Charles III&#x27;s reign and throughout the Peninsular War and was only initiated again during the reign of Charles III&#x27;s grandson, Ferdinand VII. The premises had been used as headquarters for the cavalry and a gunpowder-store for the Napoleonic troops based in Madrid during the war.

The next renovations that this museum will undergo will be conducted by British architect Norman Foster. This renovation was approved in June 2020 and is expected to take a minimum of four years.

==Management==

===Funding===
In 1991, Manuel Villaescusa bequeathed his fortune of nearly $40 million in Madrid real estate to the Prado, to be used solely for the acquisition of paintings. The museum subsequently sold Villaescusa&#x27;s buildings to realize income from them. The bequest suddenly made the Prado one of the most formidable bidders for paintings in the world.

Until the early 2000s, the Prado&#x27;s annual income was approximately $18 million, $15 million of which came from the government and the remainder from private contributions, publications, and admissions. In 2001, the conservative government of José María Aznar decided to change the museum&#x27;s financing platform, ushering in a public-private partnership. Under its new bylaws, which the Cortes Generales approved in 2003, the Prado must gradually reduce its level of state support to 50 percent from 80 percent. In exchange, the museum gained control of the budget — which was roughly €35 million in 2004 — and the power to raise money from corporate donations and merchandising. However, its 2004 €150 million expansion was paid for by the Spanish state.

==In Google Earth==
In 2009, the Prado Museum selected 14 of its most important paintings to be displayed in Google Earth and Google Maps at extremely high resolution, with the largest displayed at 14,000 megapixels. The images&#x27; zoom capability allows for close-up views of paint texture and fine detail.

==Nearby museums==
A few meters away there are two museums of international significance, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía.

Nearby is the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. The Museo Arqueológico houses the archaeological collections formerly in the collection of the Prado, with works from Spain, Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome.

The Naval museum, managed by the Ministry of Defence, is also nearby.

Many of the works have never before left Spain.

<text>Galaktika is a Hungarian science fiction magazine. At its peak, 94,000 copies of the magazine were printed in Hungary. The publication originally ran from 1972 to 1995, before ceasing publication. It was revived and financed by Metropolis Media in 2004.

==Original Run==
The magazine was divided into three sections: &quot;Thematic&quot;, &quot;National&quot;, and &quot;Mixed&quot;. The first section concentrated on stories with similar themes, while the second selected works from the literature of a specific country. Péter Kuczka remained the editor during the lifetime of the original magazine.
&quot;Galaktika&quot;&#x27;s first edition was issued in the summer of 1972, with 38,000 copies printed on 125 A5 pages. In 1985, with issue #60, the format was changed to 96 A4 pages. But in 1993 it reverted to the A5 in a black-bordered format. The 1993 format persisted until the original publication ceased. 

&quot;Galaktika&quot; closed in 1995. During its initial run, 2,257 short stories and articles written by more than 1,000 authors were published in &quot;Galaktika&quot;.

==Revival==
&quot;Galaktika&quot; was revived by István Burger and managed by Metropolis Media in November 2004 with issue #176. The revival presented new page layouts, editorial structure, and ownership, but remained a publisher of science fiction.

In 2016 the magazine was accused of publishing works translated from English into Hungarian without payment or permission from the original authors. Several science fiction authors, including Terry Pratchett and George R. R. Martin indicated that their stories had been published without permission. Cat Rambo, president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association, issued a statement criticizing the magazine and formally recommending that: &quot;authors, editors, translators, and other publishing professionals avoid working with Galaktika until the magazine has demonstrated that existing issues have been addressed and that there will be no recurrence.&quot; In July 2017 the Authors Guild and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association reached a formal agreement with Metropolis Media to compensate affected authors and seek proper permissions for future publications.
