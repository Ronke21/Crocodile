<text>Upper Mustang (formerly Kingdom of Lo) is an upper part (Northern area) of Mustang District, which is located in Nepal. The &quot;Upper Mustang&quot; was a restricted kingdom until 1992 which makes it one of the most preserved regions in the world, with a majority of the population still speaking traditional Tibetic languages. Tibetan culture has been preserved by the relative isolation of the region from the outside world. Life in Mustang revolves around tourism, animal husbandry, and trade.

The &quot;Upper Mustang&quot; comprises the northern two-thirds of the Mustang District of Gandaki Province, Nepal. It consists of three rural municipalities namely Lo Manthang, Lo-Ghekar Damodarkunda, and Varagung Muktichhetra.

The southern third (lower Mustang) of the district is called Thak and is the homeland of the Thakali community, who speak the Thakali language and whose culture combines Tibetan and Nepalese elements.

Mustang&#x27;s status as a kingdom ended in 2008 when its suzerain Kingdom of Nepal became a republic. The influence of the outside world, especially China, is growing and contributing to rapid change in the lives of Mustang&#x27;s people. Development work has increased in recent years.

== History ==

Mustang was once an independent kingdom, although closely tied by language and culture to Tibet. From the 15th to the 17th century, its strategic location granted Mustang control over the trade between the Himalayas and India. At the end of the 18th century, the kingdom was annexed by Nepal and became a dependency of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1795.

The Kingdom of Lo Manthang supported Tibet and the Qing Empire during the Sino-Nepalese War.

Though still recognized by many Mustang residents, the monarchy ceased to exist on October 7, 2008, by order of the Government of Nepal. The last official and later unofficial king (raja or &quot;gyelpo&quot;) was Jigme Dorje Palbar Bista (1930–2016), who traced his lineage directly back to Ame Pal, the warrior who founded this Buddhist kingdom in 1380. Ame Pal oversaw the founding and building of much of the Lo and Mustang capital of Lo Manthang, a walled city that has changed little in appearance since that time period.

In 2007, a shepherd in Mustang discovered a collection of 55 cave paintings depicting the life of the Buddha.

== Climate ==
Upper Mustang has a &quot;trans-Himalayan climate&quot; which is cool and semi-arid with precipitation in the range of . It is in the rain shadow of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges.

The Day and Night Temperature in Upper Mustang according to the months is shown below:
== Demographics ==
The population of the whole Mustang District in 2001 was 14,981, spread between three towns and approximately thirty smaller settlements. The inhabitants are either Thakalis, Gurung or, in traditional Mustang, primarily Tibetan.

Most of the population of Mustang lives near the Kali Gandaki River, above sea level. The tough conditions cause a large winter migration into lower regions of Nepal. The administrative center of Mustang District is at Jomsom ( south of Kagbeni) which has had an airport since 1962 and has become the main tourist entry point since Mustang was opened to western tourism in 1992.

== Geography ==

The main hydrographic feature of Mustang is the Gandaki River. The river runs southward towards Nepal Terai, bisecting Mustang. Routes paralleling the river once served as a major trade route between Tibet and India, especially for salt. Part of the river valley in the southern Mustang District forms the Kali Gandaki Gorge, by some measures the deepest gorge in the world.

Traditional Mustang (the Lo Kingdom) is north–south at its longest, east–west at its widest and ranges from a low point of above sea level on the Kali Gandaki River just north of Kagbeni to at Khamjung Himal, a peak in southeast Mustang.

== Transport ==
Upper Mustang is on an ancient trade route between Nepal and Tibet exploiting the lowest pass Kora La through the Himalaya west of Sikkim. Kora La currently serves as one of the active border crossings between China and Nepal.

Mechanized access inside Nepal began with the opening of an airstrip at Jomsom at the approximate boundary between the southern &quot;Thak&quot; and northern &quot;Lo&quot; sections of the valley, which was in operation by the 1960s.

China eventually decided to revitalize trade and in 2001 completed a road from the international border to Lo Manthang. Across the TAR border is Zhongba County of Shigatse Prefecture. China National Highway 219 follows the valley of the Yarlung Tsangpo River some north of the border.

Meanwhile, road-building from the south was inhibited by difficulties along the Kali Gandaki Gorge to the south, but proceeded incrementally. In 2010, a gap remained but the road was completed before 2015 and is suitable for high clearance and four wheel drive vehicles.

Currently, the easiest and only widely used road corridor, from Kathmandu to Lhasa—named Arniko Highway in Nepal and China National Highway 318 in the TAR—traverses a pass. This is some higher than Kora La.

== Tourism ==

Foreign visitors have been allowed to the region since 1992, but tourism to Upper Mustang is regulated. Foreigners need to obtain a special permit to enter, costing $500 for ten days, followed by $50 per day.

 Most tourists visit for the region&#x27;s trekking trails, which largely follow the same trade route used in the 15th century, although road construction is beginning to impact the areas trekking routes. Over a thousand western trekkers now visit each year, with over 7,000 between (mid-July 2018 to mid-July 2019). August and October are the peak visiting months. On August 27, 2010, local youth leaders in Mustang threatened to bar tourists beginning October 1, 2010 due to the refusal of the Nepalese government to provide any of the $50 per day fee to the local economy. Visitation, however, continued uninterrupted beyond that date.

Mustang is rich in Buddhist culture, similar to the area of the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is an alternate way to experience the Tibetan culture and landscape to the tours provided by the Chinese government. The Tiji festival in Lo-Manthang is another popular destination for tourists in the area seeking to experience the native culture.

The first westerner in Mustang was Toni Hagen, Swiss explorer and geologist, who visited the Kingdom in 1952 during one of his travels across the Himalayas. French Michel Peissel is considered the first westerner to stay in Lo Manthang, during the first authorised exploration of Mustang in 1964.

<doc id="234835" wikidata="Q5172451" url="?curid=234835" title="Corporate development">
<text>Corporate development refers to the planning and execution of strategies to meet organizational objectives, primarily through mergers and acquisitions or divestitures. The kinds of activities falling under corporate development may include strategic planning, market and competitor mapping and tracking, phasing in or out of markets or products, arranging strategic alliances or partnerships or joint ventures, identifying and acquiring companies (M&amp;A), securing funding (various forms of equity or debt) or corporate financing, divesting of assets or divisions or selling the whole company, listing on a stock exchange or undertaking various capital management initiatives.

==Process==

Corporate strategy depends on the circumstances of a company and the area where development is desired. Corporate development is usually a process that takes place over an extended period of time and may be adjusted or refined as the project moves forward

==Reshaping management==

One of the manifestations of corporate development has to do with reshaping the management arm of the corporation. This may involve a process of phasing certain management positions out of the existing structure or creating new positions in an effort to strengthen the management team. As part of this type of approach, corporate development may also demand that one or more current managers are released from the company and replaced with people who possess skills required to move the company forward. When this is the case, the corporate development team will handle the functions of recruitment and evaluation of potential hires.

==Growing the company==

The process of corporate development can also be applied to the task of growing the company through mergers and acquisitions. In this scenario, the project development will involve identifying potential target companies for acquisitions or unions resulting in a new and more aggressive corporation. The team will consider all possible outcomes from any given potential merger or acquisition and attempt to project if the action is likely to result in positive growth or could possibly impair the company permanently.

Just as a management team may be revamped, corporate development may also be employed to change the current focus for clients. This may mean looking into the potential for breaking into new markets with existing products or developing complementary products that will allow this type of expansion. Corporate development strategy would monitor the trends associated with a corporation&#x27;s products or services and helps the corporation establish strategies to find more customers. In addition, corporate development works to maximize the profits of a corporation by figuring out the appropriate pricing for a given good or service. A corporate development team also leads discussions with sales department heads regarding how to market corporate goods, organize marketing campaigns, analyze market research and incorporate any customer advice or complaints into marketing strategies in such cases; extensive industry specific business experience is often preferred which is why companies may hire an external firm to help them engage in such moves.

Depending on the status of the base market, corporate development may also look at shifting away from a shrinking consumer market while seeking market share in a different consumer market with newer products. For example, many typewriter manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s slowly phased out their core business and began to focus more on computer parts and accessories as a way to continue operations.

==Need for specialists==
Particularly in larger companies, corporate development is provided as a charter for a particular executive or team. In these cases, the opportunities and initiatives are numerous enough to justify specialists, instead of being delegated to the office of the CEO and line of business executives. When focused on product or financial issues, corporate development executives often have MBA, CFA or CPA credentials. Advanced technical degrees (Ph.D., M.S.) are highly sought in corporate development executives so that they can understand and align strategic, technical, and tactical goals with financial targets. Teams contract and often hire a corporate development contributor from a legal or investment banking background due to the complex contractual and valuation issues associated with many transactions.

<doc id="234841" wikidata="Q28480" url="?curid=234841" title="Max Brod">
<text>Max Brod (; 27 May 1884 – 20 December 1968) was a Bohemian-born Israeli author, composer, and journalist.

Although he was a prolific writer in his own right, he is best remembered as the friend and biographer of writer Franz Kafka. Kafka named Brod as his literary executor, instructing Brod to burn his unpublished work upon his death. Brod refused and had Kafka&#x27;s works published instead.

In 1939, as the Nazis occupied Prague, he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, taking with him a suitcase of Kafka&#x27;s papers, many of them unpublished notes, diaries, and sketches.

== Biography ==
Max Brod was born in Prague, then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia in Austria-Hungary, now the capital of the Czech Republic. At the age of four, Brod was diagnosed with a severe spinal curvature and spent a year in corrective harness; despite this he would be a hunchback his entire life. A German-speaking Jew, he attended the Piarist school together with his lifelong friend Felix Weltsch, later attended the Stephans Gymnasium, then studied law at the German Charles-Ferdinand University (which at the time was divided into a German and a Czech language university; he attended the German-speaking institution) and graduated in 1907 to work in the civil service. From 1912, he was a pronounced Zionist (which he attributed to the influence of Martin Buber) and when Czechoslovakia became independent in 1918, he briefly served as vice-president of the &quot;Jüdischer Nationalrat&quot;. From 1924, already an established writer, he worked as a critic for the &quot;Prager Tagblatt&quot;.

In 1939, as the Nazis took over Prague, Brod and his wife Elsa Taussig fled to Mandatory Palestine. He settled in Tel Aviv, where he continued to write and worked as a dramaturg for &quot;Habimah&quot;, later the Israeli national theatre, for 30 years. For a period following the death of his wife in 1942, Brod published very few works. He became very close to a couple named Otto and Esther Hoffe, regularly taking vacations with the couple and employed Esther as a secretary for many years; it is often presumed that their relationship had a romantic dimension. He would later pass stewardship of the Kafka materials in his possession to Esther in his will.

Another close companion was Felix Weltsch. Their friendship lasted 75 years, from the elementary school of the Piarists in Prague to Weltsch&#x27;s death in 1964. He increasingly devoted himself to music, traveling to Europe to give lectures and to encourage young artists. Brod was also close to Israeli author Aharon Megged, with whom he had many philosophical discussions as they walked along the beachfront in Tel Aviv.

Brod died on 20 December 1968 in Tel Aviv, his final resting place is the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv.

== Literary career==

Unlike Kafka, Brod rapidly became a prolific author who eventually published 83 titles. His first novel and fourth book overall, &quot;Schloss Nornepygge&quot; (&quot;Nornepygge Castle&quot;), published in 1908 when he was only 24, was celebrated in Berlin literary circles as a masterpiece of expressionism. This and other works made Brod a well-known personality in German-language literature. In 1913, together with Weltsch, he published the work &quot;Anschauung und Begriff&quot; which made him better known in Berlin and also in Leipzig, where their publisher Kurt Wolff worked.

Brod was supportive of other writers and musicians. Among his protégés was Franz Werfel, whom he would later fall out with as Werfel abandoned Judaism for Christianity. He would also write at various times both for and against Karl Kraus, a convert from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. His critical endorsement would be crucial to the success of Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier Svejk&quot;, and he played a crucial role in the diffusion of Leoš Janáček&#x27;s operas.

== Friendship with Kafka ==
Brod first met Kafka on 23 October 1902, when they were students at Charles University. Brod had given a lecture on Arthur Schopenhauer at the German students&#x27; hall. Kafka, one year older, addressed him after the lecture and accompanied him home. &quot;He tended to participate in all the meetings, but up to then we had hardly considered each other,&quot; wrote Brod. The quiet Kafka &quot;would have been... hard to notice... even his elegant, usually dark-blue, suits were inconspicuous and reserved like him. At that time, however, something seems to have attracted him to me, he was more open than usual, filling the endless walk home by disagreeing strongly with my all too rough formulations.&quot;

From then on, Brod and Kafka met frequently, often even daily, and remained close friends until Kafka&#x27;s death. Kafka was a frequent guest in Brod&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. There he met his future girlfriend and fiancée Felice Bauer, cousin of Brod&#x27;s brother-in-law Max Friedmann. After graduating, Brod worked for some time at the post office. The relatively short working hours gave him time to begin a career as an art critic and freelance writer. For similar reasons, Kafka took a job at an insurance agency involved in workmen&#x27;s accident insurance. Brod, Kafka, and Brod&#x27;s close friend Felix Weltsch constituted the so-called &quot;enge Prager Kreis&quot; or &quot;close Prague circle&quot;.

During Kafka&#x27;s lifetime, Brod tried repeatedly to reassure him of his writing talents, of which Kafka was chronically doubtful. Brod pushed Kafka to publish his work, and it is probably owing to Brod that he began to keep a diary. Brod tried, but failed, to arrange common literary projects. Notwithstanding their inability to write in tandem – which stemmed from clashing literary and personal philosophies – they were able to publish one chapter from an attempted travelogue in May 1912, for which Kafka wrote the introduction. It was published in the journal &quot;Herderblätter&quot;. Brod prodded his friend to complete the project several years later, but the effort was in vain. Even after Brod&#x27;s 1913 marriage with Elsa Taussig, he and Kafka remained each other&#x27;s closest friends and confidants, assisting each other in problems and life crises.

== Publication of Kafka&#x27;s work==
On Kafka&#x27;s death in 1924, Brod was the administrator of the estate. Although Kafka stipulated that all of his unpublished works were to be burned, Brod refused. He justified this move by stating that when Kafka personally told him to burn his unpublished work, Brod replied that he would outright refuse, and that &quot;Franz should have appointed another executor if he had been absolutely and finally determined that his instructions should stand.&quot; Before even a line of Kafka&#x27;s most celebrated works had been made public, Brod had already praised him as &quot;the greatest poet of our time&quot;, ranking with Goethe or Tolstoy. As Kafka&#x27;s works were posthumously published (&quot;The Trial&quot; arrived in 1925, followed by &quot;The Castle&quot; in 1926 and &quot;Amerika&quot; in 1927), this early positive assessment was bolstered by more general critical acclaim.

When Brod fled Prague in 1939, he took with him a suitcase of Kafka&#x27;s papers, many of them unpublished notes, diaries, and sketches. Although some of these materials were later edited and published in 6 volumes of collected works, much of them remained unreleased. In 1961, at the request of Kafka&#x27;s heirs (the daughters of his sisters), approximately two-thirds of Kafka&#x27;s papers were given to the Bodleian Library, at the University of Oxford. The rest of the papers remained integrated within Brod&#x27;s literary estate. Upon his death, this trove of materials was passed to Esther Hoffe, who maintained most of them until her own death in 2007 (one original manuscript of &quot;The Trial&quot; was auctioned in 1988 for $2 million). Due to certain ambiguities regarding Brod&#x27;s wishes, the proper disposition of the materials was being litigated. On one side was the National Library of Israel, which argued that Brod passed his literary estate (and Kafka&#x27;s papers) to Esther as an executor of his actual intent to have the papers donated to the institution. On the other side were Esther&#x27;s daughters, who claimed that Brod passed the papers to their mother as a pure inheritance which should be theirs. The sisters had announced their intention to sell the materials to the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany, but the Supreme Court of Israel ruled in the National Library of Israel favour.

==Music==
Brod&#x27;s musical compositions are little known, even compared to his literary output. They include songs, works for piano and incidental music for his plays. He translated some of Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s and Leoš Janáček&#x27;s operas into German, and wrote the first book on Janáček (first published in Czech in 1924). He authored a study of Gustav Mahler, &quot;Beispiel einer deutsch-jüdischen Symbiose&quot;, in 1961. Brod had studied orchestration under Alexander Uriah Boskovich. His book &quot;Die Musik Israels&quot;, first published in 1951, which introduced the term &quot;Musica Yam-tikhonit&quot; (Mediterranean music) to define a prominent style in Israeli concert music of the era, shortly before Boskovich published essays which provided an extended definition of this style.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1948, Brod was awarded the Bialik Prize for literature. In 1965, Brod was awarded the Honor Gift of the Heinrich Heine Society in Düsseldorf, Germany.
In 1965, he was awarded the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art and was the first Israeli citizen to be awarded it.

<doc id="234842" wikidata="Q1024118" url="?curid=234842" title="Chorlton-cum-Hardy">
<text>Chorlton-cum-Hardy is a suburban area of Manchester, England, southwest of the city centre. Chorlton ward had a population of 14,138 at the 2011 census, and Chorlton Park 15,147.

By the 9th century, there was an Anglo-Saxon settlement here. In the Middle Ages, improved drainage methods led to population growth. In the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, its rural character made it popular among the middle class. The loss of its railway station, the conversion of larger houses into flats or bedsitters, and significant social housing development to the south of the area changed its character again in the 1970s. Chorlton Manchester Metrolink tram stop was built on the site of the former railway station, served by East Didsbury and Manchester Airport trams.

Chorlton was a village on Lancashire&#x27;s southern border with Cheshire, and a township within the ancient parish of Manchester. It was incorporated into the city of Manchester in 1904. Chorlton borders Stretford, Sale, Didsbury, Withington, and Whalley Range. The River Mersey runs along its southern boundary. The area&#x27;s eastern boundary has changed since the 19th century because of incorporation into the City of Manchester and division into wards.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Chorlton probably means Ceolfrith&#x27;s farm or settlement from the Old English personal name and &quot;tūn&quot;, an enclosure, farmstead or village. Hardy is derived from a personal name, Hearda, and &quot;ēg&quot;, Anglian for island or dry ground in a well-watered land. It has alternatively been suggested that Hardy may mean &quot;by the woods&quot;, in reference to the ancient forest of Arden Wood that grew on both sides of the River Mersey in the area. Chorlton was recorded as Chollirton in 1250, Chollerton from 1292 and as Chourton in 1572. It was also noted down as Chawerton on a map of the Salford Hundred by John Speed in 1610.

The ancient hamlets of Chorlton and Hardy, separated by the Chorlton Brook, together with Martledge and Barlow Moor, did not come under the combined name of Chorlton-cum-Hardy (&quot;cum&quot; is Latin for &quot;with&quot;) until the 18th century; local historian Cliff Hayes reports that he can find no mention of Chorlton-cum-Hardy before 1700. The name was adopted by Victorian property developers who arrived in the wake of the coming of the railway in 1880, to distinguish this Chorlton from Chorlton-on-Medlock. The form Chorlton with Hardy was used to some extent from the early 19th century onwards and in the early years of the 20th.

===Early history===
The district was part of the kingdom of Northumbria from the 7th century, but settlement in the Mersey valley may well have been later. Thomas L. Ellwood suggested 610 AD as the date of founding the settlement, but John Lloyd in his 1972 history considered the period 610 to 900 AD more likely.

The area now known as Chorlton-cum-Hardy comprises the ancient settlements of Chorlton along with Hardy and Barlow to the south on the north side of the Mersey and Martledge, the area around the present-day public library, to the north of Chorlton and Hardy. Chorlton was part of the Withington manor. Hardy was little more than a farm and a few houses, but Barlow was home to the family of that name, who occupied the manor house of Barlow Hall for several hundred years. Barlow Hall was built on a defensive site on rising ground on the north bank of the Mersey. In 1567 the lord of the manor was Alexander Barlow, a staunch recusant who was imprisoned for his beliefs and died in 1584 leaving a son who held similar beliefs. Two of his sons entered the Order of Saint Benedict, one of them, Ambrose Barlow a missionary priest in the Leigh parish, was imprisoned several times and executed for his priesthood in 1641 at Lancaster. Two sons of the papist, Anthony Barlow were charged with treason in the Jacobite rising of 1715. The estate remained with the family until the death of Thomas Barlow in 1773, when it was sold to the Egertons of Tatton Hall. In 1666 Barlow Hall was one of the largest houses paying hearth tax in the Withington manor.

The estimated population in 1640 was 85; in 1714 it was 325. The 1801 census recorded 513 inhabitants, and the 1811 census 619: by 1851 it had increased to 761. The Tithe Commissioners&#x27; survey carried out in 1841 provides details of the size and tenure of every piece of land. The tithe map reveals the township had two major landowners: Wilbraham Egerton of Tatton owned 888 acres and George Lloyd 231, the rest was shared between 21 others. Most land was meadow and pasture while 490 acres was arable. Many small landowners owned orchards or market gardens. At this time the village consisted of its ancient halls and scattered farms centred on Chorlton Green and Beech Road and a few buildings on Barlow Moor Road.
Its public houses were the Bowling Green, built in 1693, and the Horse and Jockey, which was licensed in the early 19th century.

Marl had been dug in Martledge since at least 1598; the disused pits filled with water gave the area its common name of the Isles. The Chorlton Brick Company was established there in the early part of the 20th century and continued producing bricks for about forty years. Turf-cutting was a significant industry in Martledge, as well as in the White Moss and Jackson&#x27;s Moss areas.

===Suburban growth===
Until the last quarter of the 19th century, Chorlton&#x27;s population had increased slowly. When the railway reached neighbouring Stretford in 1849, upmarket villas were built on a flood-free area in Edge Lane and High Lane. Wilbraham Road was built in 1869 to connect the Egerton holdings across Withington from Edge Lane to Fallowfield. The Midland Railway built a line from Manchester Central through Chorlton station which opened on 1 January 1880. Over the following decade land close to the station was developed for residential and commercial purposes centred on the Barlow Moor Road/Wilbraham Road crossroads, northeast of the old village centre. Houses built in the 1880s attracted more affluent residents who worked in Manchester city centre to high quality homes in a more rural area.

Irish immigrants came to work in the expanding industries of Manchester, in small-scale horticulture and farming and domestic service. They brought Roman Catholicism, and by the first decade of the 20th century a church (St Augustine&#x27;s) and convent school had been established on High Lane.

Further growth was aided by the arrival of Manchester Corporation&#x27;s tramway before the First World War: a terminus was built on Barlow Moor Road a short distance south of the junction with High Lane. Chorltonville was developed as a garden suburb south of Chorlton Brook: the houses are mostly large and semi-detached and individual in design, standing on tree-lined roads. Alexandra Park Aerodrome (1917–24), was Manchester&#x27;s first major airfield located east of the Midland Railway overbridge on Mauldeth Road West.

After the First World War came a period of residential development to the east of the new village on either side of Wilbraham Road and a council housing estate at Merseybank. The Ashby, a two-seater light car, was produced in Chorlton-cum-Hardy by Victor Ashby and Son from 1922 to 1924.

From the 1960s onwards a council estate at Nell Lane near Southern Cemetery and patchy redevelopment in other areas were completed. There has been immigration particularly from the Indian subcontinent and from Poland; the Polish community arrived in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Governance==
===Civic history===
The district was a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford hundred of Lancashire. The abolition of Withington&#x27;s manorial rights in the 1840s meant that local government began to be formalised. Chorlton became part of Chorlton Poor Law Union (named after Chorlton-on-Medlock), in 1866 Chorlton cum Hardy became a separate civil parish, in 1894 it became part of Withington Urban District.

From 1876 to 1894 Chorlton was part of the district administered by the Withington Local Board, and from 1894 to 1904 part of Withington Urban District. It was absorbed into the County Borough of Manchester in August 1904, together with the rest of the urban district. A separate Withington Committee of the city council existed from 1904 until 1914. On 1 October 1910 the parish was abolished and merged with South Manchester. In 1901 the parish had a population of 9026.

===Boundary with Trafford===
In 1987 the Local Government Boundary Commission for England revised the Manchester and Trafford boundary. The most notable differences for Chorlton-cum-Hardy were that Stretford Stadium was now actually in Stretford, and the Jackson&#x27;s Boat pub in Sale. Other minor adjustments were made in the Turn Moss area.

===Political representation===
Since the 1970s both of the wards have been in the Manchester Withington parliamentary constituency. Until then Chorlton ward had been in the Manchester Moss Side parliamentary constituency. In the 2015 general election, the Labour Party&#x27;s Jeff Smith won the seat with 57.3% of the vote unseating the incumbent Liberal Democrat candidate John Leech. Smith was reelected in the 2019 general election.

Most of Chorlton is divided into two wards, Chorlton and Chorlton Park, which includes the Mersey Bank and Nell Lane estates of south and south-east Chorlton. The remainder of the area is included in the Whalley Range ward. As of 2019, each of the three wards is represented by three Labour councillors.

==Geography==

The ancient township of Chorlton cum Hardy covered of low-lying, flat land on the north bank of the River Mersey. In medieval times the district formed part of the Manor of Withington, an area stretching from Longford Park to Debdale Park and south to the Mersey. The highest land is at the south-east end, where it reaches a little over OD. It is divided by the Chorlton Brook, which runs east to west to its confluence with the Mersey. Chorlton grew north of the brook; the hamlets of Barlow and Hardy were on the southern part, which stretches along the north bank of the Mersey for two miles (3.2 km). Because the county boundary was determined by the course of the Mersey, it traditionally did not exactly follow the river when it changed course: this happened occasionally in the period before improved flood control measures were introduced in the 1840s. The Manchester–Trafford boundary now follows the course of the river. Chorlton is surrounded by Stretford, Sale, Didsbury, Withington, and Whalley Range.

Chorlton&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK.

Between Chorlton Brook and the river, Chorlton Ees Nature Reserve occupies the site of Withington sewage works which closed in 1972. The derelict site was restored and has a network of trails through its grassland and woodland. In the 1970s, gravel was extracted from the Mersey floodplain at Barlow Hall Farm and used in the construction of the M60 motorway. The area around the flooded gravel pit was restored as Chorlton Water Park and is now a Local Nature Reserve.

Chorltonville, a garden village covering , was developed in 1911 south of Chorlton Brook and became the home of professional classes who moved into the area.

==Demography==
===Population change===
==Economy==
Chorlton Precinct, built in the 1970s and rebranded as &quot;The Square&quot; in 2009, has been the subject of redevelopment plans.
In 2010 Manchester City Council&#x27;s South Manchester Regeneration Team issued an action plan for improvements to the &quot;Chorlton District Centre&quot; for the period 2010 to 2020. It proposes investment in the district aimed at creating &quot;a strong, vibrant and successful centre that supports the local community and has the ability to exploit the economic potential of Metrolink&quot;. In 2023 plans were formulated to redevelop the site of the shopping centre, the office block Graeme House and the municipal car park at Nicolas Road.

Government and public sector employers in Chorlton include the Department for Work and Pensions, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care, and Manchester Social Services. The district centre has a library, three health centres, three dentists and a number of banks.

In 2014 insurance claim figures revealed that the M21 postcode, encompassing Chorlton-cum-Hardy, was the most burgled postcode in the UK with 45.2 claims per 1,000 people.

==Landmarks==
Manchester City Council designated Chorlton Green a conservation area in 1970 and Chorltonville in 1991.

===Chorlton Library===

Chorlton Library was built in 1914 to a design by Manchester City Council architect Henry Price. It was funded by a £5000 donation from steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, one of about 3000 Carnegie libraries around the world. The single-story flat-roofed building is constructed of red brick dressed with Portland stone, and is designed in the Edwardian Baroque style.

In 2013 Manchester Council announced plans to sell the library after its reorganisation of the provision of leisure and library services in Chorlton into a new £5.7 million &quot;joint service centre&quot; to be built on the site of Chorlton shopping precinct. Fears that the library would then be demolished were allayed when on 21 August 2013 it was designated a Grade II listed building following a campaign by local Liberal Democrat councillor Victor Chamberlain.

===Southern Cemetery===
Southern Cemetery is the largest municipal cemetery in the United Kingdom and contains many notable burials, including industrialist John Rylands and broadcaster and music impresario Tony Wilson. The burial ground originally occupied of land that cost Manchester Corporation £38,340 in 1872. Its cemetery buildings were designed by architect H J Paull and its layout is attributed to the city surveyor, James Gascoigne Lynde. The cemetery opened on 9 October 1879 and had mortuary chapels for Anglicans, Nonconformists, and Roman Catholics linked by an elliptical drive and a Jewish chapel at the west corner of the site. The original cemetery is registered by English Heritage in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its historic interest and the mortuary chapels and other structures are listed buildings.

==Transport==
In the 19th century, public transport was provided by the railway through the southern suburbs of Manchester and horse buses from Chorlton Green towards Manchester city centre. In the early 20th century the electric tramway reached Chorlton. Mauldeth Road West&#x27;s dual-carriageway had a central strip intended for use as a double-track for electric trams. Trams remained in service until January 1949. Passenger railway services ended in 1967 when Chorlton-cum-Hardy station closed.

From 1992 conversion of the former railway line through Chorlton to a Metrolink line was planned, but failed to secure funding. Work started in 2010, and the line opened on 7 July 2011, providing residents with a rail journey into the city centre for the first time in 44 years. The tram stop is on the site of the old railway station. Services terminated one stop further south at St Werburgh&#x27;s Road, on the site of the old Chorlton Junction signal box, but in 2013 services were extended to East Didsbury and in November 2014 to Manchester Airport

Bus services include:

* 23: Stockport Interchange to Trafford Centre. This service is operated by Stagecoach as part of the Bee Network.
* 25: Stockport Interchange to Trafford Centre. This service is operated by Stagecoach as part of the Bee Network.

==Religion==

Since 1847 Chorlton has been in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester and Archdeaconry of Manchester; and since 1850, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. Between 1541 and 1847 it was in the Diocese of Chester and before that the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry. In medieval times the parish church was the Collegiate Church in Manchester, dependent on which was the chapel of ease at Didsbury.

A timber-framed chapel dedicated to St Clement provided by the Barlow family in 1512 was used until 1779 when it was replaced by a brick chapel, probably on the same site. (Its Grade II listed gatehouse and bell turret remain at Chorlton Green.) Chorlton was designated a parish in 1839 and by 1860 the chapel was deemed inadequate for the expanding population. Lord Egerton provided land for a replacement but not all parishioners supported the proposal and the old chapel remained after the new church was completed in 1866. After the old chapel was demolished in 1949 St Clement&#x27;s Church became the parish church.

In 1898 a new parish was established consisting of part of St Clement&#x27;s parish and some others. The foundation stone of St Werburgh&#x27;s Church was laid on 5 November 1899, its chancel and transepts dedicated in 1900, it was completed and opened on 1 June 1902 and consecrated 15 July 1902.
A Methodist chapel was built in about 1805 and replaced by a larger building in 1827. It moved to Manchester Road in 1873 when the neo-Gothic chapel was built. It has a memorial to those who lost their lives in the First World War in the grounds. Manley Park Methodist Church was established in a tin tabernacle in 1905. The present building opened in 1910. A smaller chapel was used by Welsh Methodists. A Congregational Chapel opened in 1883 was replaced in 1894 and became the United Reformed Church, the MacFadyen Memorial Church, but was demolished and its congregation meets in the church hall. Other denominations established churches: the Unitarians in Wilbraham Road in 1901; the Macpherson Memorial Primitive Methodist Church was built in 1896 and enlarged in 1908; the Baptist Maclaren Memorial Church in 1907; the Presbyterians in 1908; and the Emmanuel Free Church in 1909. The Unitarian and Baptist Chapels have been demolished, although their congregations are still in existence. The Congregationalists and Baptists have joined the United Reformed Church in the former Congregational church hall. Chorlton Evangelical Church (founded 1930) meets at Ivygreen Road; its present building was opened in 1951.

A Roman Catholic mission began in 1892 at St Peter&#x27;s Chapel in Barlow Moor Road and another was established at St. Augustine&#x27;s in High Lane. A new church was built in 1927 when the parish became St. John&#x27;s. St Ambrose of Milan was founded in 1932 at Barlow Moor and new church opened in 1958. The architects were Reynolds &amp; Stone. Its dedication to St Ambrose of Milan was chosen because St Ambrose Barlow&#x27;s birthplace was in the parish.

The present-day population includes many Muslims, many of which of South Asian origin. Until 2024, the Manchester Islamic High School for Girls was located in Chorlton, before moving to nearby Didsbury. Nearby mosques include Didsbury Mosque, the British Muslim Heritage Centre and Hough End Hall mosque.

There are small numbers of Buddhists: one congregation uses the former Primitive Methodist Chapel and another, the Vairochana Buddhist Centre. The oldest, founded 1975, belongs to the Kagyu Ling school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Manchester Centre for Buddhist Meditation, High Lane, Chorlton, was used by the UK Samatha Association from the 1980s and established as such after its purchase by the Association. This centre supports local Buddhist meditation in the Theravada Buddhist tradition.

==Education==

Sir Nicholas Mosley of Hough End Hall who died in 1612, left £100, £5 a year for 20 years, to pay for a schoolmaster at Chorlton Chapel. The Wesleyan Methodists began a Sunday school and day school in about 1810, whereas the Anglican Sunday school did not begin until a later date. In 1845 the Rev. William Birley was responsible for building a Church School at Chorlton Green. When the building was found to be inadequate it was replaced by a new school on the site in 1879. A number of private schools existed in the late 19th century including C. C. Dadley&#x27;s grammar school and Tom Mostyn&#x27;s art school. In 1898 a school was under construction for the Roman Catholic parish of St Augustine and in 1901 a new church school was built at St Clement&#x27;s Road and the old building was used for infants and juniors until this was no longer necessary. In 1904, when Chorlton was incorporated into Manchester, a municipal school was opened and moved to its permanent premises in Oswald Road in 1909.

Secondary schools in Chorlton are Loreto High School, Chorlton High School, Chorlton High School South and until 2024, the Islamic High School for Girls (High Lane), which has since moved to nearby Didsbury.

Chorlton itself has no sixth-forms or colleges. Nearby sixth-forms include Loreto College, Xaverian College, Stretford Grammar School and Didsbury High School&#x27;s sixth-form.

==Sport and recreation==

In the early 19th century bull-baiting, badger-baiting and cockfighting were popular but were outlawed by an Act of Parliament of 1835 and the last bull-baiting in Chorlton is recorded the same year. Prize-fighting, horse and foot racing, and wrestling took place on the meadows and led to disorder. If the forces of law and order appeared participants and spectators could escape across the Mersey into Cheshire and continue their sport. Horse races are said to have been held on land now part of Chorlton Park in the 16th century.

After the Second World War the Chorltonville owners&#x27; committee sold the recreation area and tennis courts which were absorbed into gardens of adjoining houses, and the rest became a football ground, now owned by West Didsbury &amp; Chorlton A.F.C.
Broughton Park RUFC which was established in 1882 in Salford, moved to Hough End in 2004.

South West Manchester Cricket Club, one of the oldest in the Manchester area, are members of the Saddleworth &amp; District Cricket League: the ground is at Ellesmere Road North, the old clubhouse is what was Hobson&#x27;s Hall Farm. Chorlton-cum-Hardy Cricket Club is based at Hardy Lane.

An area of what is now Chorlton Park was used many centuries ago for horse racing. As a public park, it dates from 1928: there are gardens, many trees, and recreational facilities. The Recreation Ground, Beech Park, was opened in 1896, donated to the community by Lord Egerton.

Longford Park also is the home of Trafford Athletics Club. There is a synthetic six-lane track that is used heavily in the summer for regional competitions and British Milers&#x27; Club meets. Below the main stand is Longfords Gym, run in association with the Athletics Club. There is an 18-hole free to play disc golf course, community football pitches and all-weather tennis courts.

The first part of the Chorlton Cycleway has been delivered with Dutch-style junctions.

==Culture==
A number of poets and minor publishers of poetry were active in the late 20th century and a poetry group meets at Chorlton Library. There are three amateur dramatic societies that rehearse and perform in Chorlton.

The Beech Road Festival took place on Beech Road, Beech Road Park and Chorlton Green in June or July, with commercial and educational stalls, entertainments and live music and a tug-of-war competition. The festival first began in 1991, when two regulars from the Bowling Green Hotel came up with idea of hiring an articulated truck, a sound system and some generators for local acts Rattle &#x27;n&#x27; Reel, Hectors House and Toss The Feathers to play on the August bank holiday Sunday on the rec (Beech Road Park), there was a good crowd and the first tug-of-war competition. Unfortunately, it has not taken place since 2011, when a combination of sunny weather and good social media marketing meant the event was attended by an unexpectedly large crowd estimated at 20,000 people, leading to a number of incidents which threatened to overstretch the modest police presence of eight officers at the event. As a result, The Association of Beech Road Traders – the organisation which ran the festival in order to raise money for nearby Beech Road Park – made the unanimous decision to cancel the festival indefinitely.

The Unity Festival takes place in Chorlton Park, encouraging racial and cultural unity and provides a platform for performances by dancers, musicians and singers. Chorlton Big Green Festival takes place in late March/April combining live music, dancing, food, real ale, cider, arts and crafts, workshops, cycling and films. It aims to encourage sustainable living and has a different theme each year.

The Chorlton Arts Festival in May generally features a programme of events over nine days; in 2020, it was shifted to online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chorlton Book Festival takes place over two weeks in the autumn. Chorlton takes part in the Manchester Food &amp; Drink Festival in early October, and in 2013 the inaugural Chorlton Coffee Festival was held in June.

===Cinemas and dance halls===
Several cinemas opened in the first half of the 20th century. The first was the Chorlton Pavilion bought by H. D. Moorhouse in 1909 followed by the Palais de Luxe in 1915. It closed in 1958. The Rivoli opened on Barlow Moor Road in 1936 and changed its name several times to the Essoldo, the Classic and the Shalimar before closing in the 1980s. Likewise, the Majestic on Manchester Road had several names, the Savoy, the ABC and the Gaumont. There are no remaining cinemas in Chorlton, with the nearest being situated in Manchester city centre, East Didsbury or at the nearby Trafford Centre.

The Chorlton Palais de Danse in Barlow Moor Road became a nightclub before the site was redeveloped.

===Creative and performing arts===
Until October 2009 Chorlton was the location for the Cosgrove Hall animation studios where the children&#x27;s series &quot;Chorlton and the Wheelies&quot;, &quot;Jamie and the Magic Torch&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Toyland Adventures&quot;, &quot;Oakie Doke&quot;, &quot;Cockleshell Bay&quot;, &quot;Lavender Castle&quot;, &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; and &quot;Count Duckula&quot; were created. The area is used by film crews for TV locations, such as &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, as it retains much of its original Victorian architecture. &quot;White Van Man&quot; used several Chorlton locations and was shown on BBC3 Television in 2010.
Chorlton Cum-Hardy was also the home to &quot;Bulman&quot; a British television crime drama series from 1985 to 1987 created by Murray Smith.

==Public services==

Policing in Chorlton-cum-Hardy is the responsibility of the Greater Manchester Police (GMP); the suburb is in the GMP&#x27;s South Manchester Division. Chorlton Police Station was situated on Barlow Moor Road, between Beech Road and the bus station, until it closed in October 2011. The first police station was established in Beech Road in 1885 by the Lancashire Constabulary and was replaced by the one, now closed, on Barlow Moor Road in the 1960s.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.

<text>The Takács Quartet is a string quartet founded in Budapest, Hungary, and now based in Boulder, Colorado, United States.

== History ==
In 1975, four students at the Music Academy in Budapest, Gábor Takács-Nagy (first violin), Károly Schranz (second violin), Gábor Ormai (viola), and András Fejér (cello) formed the Takács Quartet. Takács-Nagy, Ormai and Fejér had been playing trios together for several months when they met Schranz during a pickup soccer game after classes. With his immediate addition to the group, the trio became a quartet.

The quartet first received international attention in 1977, winning the First Prize and the Critics&#x27; Prize at the International String Quartet Competition in Évian-les-Bains, France. After that, the quartet won the Gold Medal at the 1979 Portsmouth and Bordeaux Competitions and First Prizes at the Budapest International String Quartet Competition in 1978 and the Bratislava Competition in 1981. The quartet made its first North American tour in 1982.

In 1983, the group decided it would be best for them and their families if they moved to the United States. A colleague offered them a position as quartet-in-residence at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and they accepted the job.

In 1993, Takács-Nagy left the group, and the British violinist Edward Dusinberre replaced him. In 1994, Ormai learned that he had incurable cancer, and was replaced by another British musician, violist Roger Tapping. Following these changes, the quartet embarked on a successful series of recordings: a cycle of all six Bartók quartets (dedicated to the memory of Ormai, who died in 1995) and a critically acclaimed complete Beethoven quartet cycle, as well as quartets by Smetana and Borodin.

In 2005, following the completion of the Beethoven cycle, Tapping retired from the group to spend more time with his family. He now teaches chamber music at the New England Conservatory. His replacement was Geraldine Walther, an American violist who until then been principal violist of the San Francisco Symphony. The quartet&#x27;s members and critics remarked on how quickly she fitted into the ensemble.

Also in 2005, the quartet became associate artists at the South Bank Centre. In 2006, they released their first recording with Walther, of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot; and &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; quartets. This was also their first recording with Hyperion Records, after switching from the Decca label.

Schranz retired from the quartet in 2018 and was replaced by University of Colorado faculty member Harumi Rhodes.

In 2019, violist Walther announced her retirement from the quartet. She was replaced in 2020 by American violist Richard O&#x27;Neill.

== Awards and recognition ==
Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance: Andrew Keener (producer), Simon Dominic Eadon (engineer) and the Takács Quartet for &quot;Beethoven: String Quartets (&quot;Razumovsky&quot; Op. 59, 1–3; &quot;Harp&quot; Op. 74)&quot; (2003)

Per &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the quartet &quot;has been recording the complete Beethoven quartets, and their survey, now complete, stands as the most richly expressive modern account of this titanic cycle.&quot;

The Takács Quartet&#x27;s interpretation of Bartók&#x27;s six string quartets has been praised.

The quartet was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance for its recording of Brahms&#x27;s String Quartet, Op. 51, No. 2, on the Hyperion label.

In 2010, the quartet was honored for Excellence in Research and Creative Work by the Boulder Faculty Assembly at the University of Colorado.

<text>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is the domestic crime investigating agency of India. It operates under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. Originally set up to investigate bribery and governmental corruption, in 1965 it received expanded jurisdiction to investigate breaches of central laws enforceable by the Government of India, multi-state organised crime, multi-agency or international cases. CBI is exempted from the provisions of the Right to Information Act. CBI is India&#x27;s officially designated single point of contact to act as the liaison with Interpol. The CBI headquarter is located in CGO Complex, near Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi.

== History ==

===Special Police Establishment===
The Bureau of Investigation traces its origins to the Special Police Establishment (SPE), a Central Government Police force, which was set up in 1941 by the Government of India to investigate bribery and corruption in transactions with the War and Supply Department of India. It had its headquarters in Lahore. The Superintendent of the SPE was Qurban Ali Khan, who later opted for Pakistan during the Partition of India. The first legal adviser of the War Department was Rai Sahib Karam Chand Jain. After the end of the war, there was a continued need for a central governmental agency to investigate bribery and corruption by central-government employees. Sahib Karam Chand Jain remained its legal advisor when the department was transferred to the Home Department by the 1946 Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.

=== CBI directors ===
== Organisation ==

The CBI is headed by a Director, an IPS officer with a rank of Director general of police. The current director of CBI is Praveen Sood, who was the former DG and IGP of Karnataka state police. The director is selected by a high-profile committee constituted under The Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 as amended through The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, and has a two-year term which can be extended for another three years.

=== Unconstitutional status ===

Gauhati High Court had given a verdict on 6 November 2013 that CBI is unconstitutional and does not hold a legal status. However, the Supreme Court of India stayed this verdict when challenged by the central government and the next hearing on this is fixed on 6 December 2013. It continues to derive its powers from Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.

=== Demand for greater autonomy ===
Demanding independent investigations, the CBI said that although it deferred to the government&#x27;s authority in non-corruption cases, the agency felt that sufficient financial and administrative powers were required by the director (including a minimum three-year tenure to ensure &quot;functional autonomy&quot;). &quot;As such, it is necessary that the director, CBI, should be vested with ex-officio powers of the Secretary to the Government of India, reporting directly to the minister, without having to go through the DoPT&quot;, the agency said, adding that financial powers were not enough and it wanted a separate budget allocation.

=== Appointment Committee and Selection committee ===
The CBI Director is appointed, for not less than a term of two years, by the Appointment Committee on recommendation of Selection Committee as mentioned in DSPE Act 1946 amended through the Lokpal &amp; Lokayukta Act 2013 and CVC Act, 2003 respectively. The Appointment Committee consists of:
* Prime MinisterChairperson
* Leader of Opposition of Loksabha or the Leader of the single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha, if the former is not present due to lack of mandated strength in the Lok Sabha - member
* Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court Judge recommended by the Chief Justicemember

The Selection Committee constituted under Delhi Special Police Establishment Act 1946 nominates a certain number of names to the Appointment Committee, one among whom the Appointment Committee appoints as the CBI director. The Selection Committee consists of:

The NDA government, on 25 November 2014, moved an amendment bill to do away with the requirement of quorum in high-profile committee while recommending the names for the post of director CBI to the central government by introducing the clause &quot;no appointment of a (CBI) director shall be invalid merely by reason of any vacancy or absence of members in the panel&quot; and to replace the Leader of the Opposition (LOP) with the leader of the single largest opposition party or pre-election coalition.

=== Infrastructure ===

CBI headquarters is a , 11-storey building in New Delhi, housing all branches of the agency. The building is equipped with a modern communications system, an advanced record-maintenance system, storage space, computerised access control and an additional facility for new technology. Interrogation rooms, cells, dormitories and conference halls are provided. The building has a staff cafeteria with a capacity of 500, gyms, a terrace garden, and bi-level basement parking for 470 vehicles. Advanced fire-control and power-backup systems are provided, in addition to a press briefing room and media lounge.

==== Bharatpol ====
On January 7, 2025, the Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, launched the CBI developed Bharatpol platform. It will help streamline the communication between local law enforcement authorities and Interpol. Rapid and secure transmission of Interpol notices will be guaranteed by the platform. 195 countries&#x27; Interpol references will be integrated for global assistance. Local agencies would be able to access the 195 countries&#x27; support requests instantly. Additionally, it will streamline capacity-building programs and document management and interchange. Requests for real-time data exchange, including the sending of Red Corner Notices (RCNs) and other alerts over a worldwide network, will be responded to by Bharatpol more quickly both domestically and internationally. Crimes like cybercrime, illegal drug trade, arms trafficking, human trafficking, and terrorism will be addressed with the assistance of Bharatpol. It will have access to 19 different kinds of Interpol databases.

==CBI Academy==
The CBI Academy in Ghaziabad (east of Delhi) began in 1996. It is about from the New Delhi railway station and about from Indira Gandhi International Airport. The campus, with fields and plantations, houses the administrative, academic, hostel and residential buildings. Before the academy was built a small training centre at Lok Nayak Bhawan, New Delhi, conducted short-term in-service courses. The CBI then relied on state police-training institutions and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad for basic training courses for deputy superintendents of police, sub-inspectors and constables.

== Jurisdiction, powers and restrictions ==
In 2022, responding to a question, The Minister of state in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office informed Rajya Sabha that a total of nine states had withdrawn general consent to the CBI to investigate cases in those states. The states include West Bengal, Maharashtra, Kerala and Punjab. In June 2023, Tamil Nadu became the ninth state to withdraw consent.

===Investigation of corruption cases===
The CBI is the primary investigative agency for corruption cases involving Central Government employees under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act. However, the scope of its jurisdiction has been subject to legal interpretations.

In a significant ruling, the Kerala High Court held that the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), a state anti-corruption agency, also possesses the authority to investigate corruption cases involving Central Government employees within the state. The court reasoned that neither the PC Act nor the DSPE Act explicitly prohibits state agencies from investigating such cases.

This ruling underscores the complexities surrounding the jurisdiction of investigative agencies in corruption matters. While the CBI holds primary responsibility, state anti-corruption agencies may also possess concurrent jurisdiction in certain circumstances, depending on the specific provisions of relevant legislation and judicial interpretations.

The High Court observed that neither the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) nor the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act of 1946 explicitly prohibits state anti corruption agencies or state police from investigating corruption cases involving Central Government employees. Moreover, neither act grants exclusive investigative authority to the CBI, the Central Vigilance Commission, or any other Central Government entity.

The court , therefore, held that “the VACB, being a specially constituted agency to investigate bribery, corruption and misconduct mainly under the PC Act is always clothed with the authority to investigate offences involving corruption that take place within the State, whether it is committed by a Central government employee or a State Government employee.

=== Relationship with state police ===

The CBI was originally constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to operate within the territory of Delhi. As policing and law is a subject that falls within state powers under the structure of Indian federalism, the CBI needs prior consent from other state governments in order to conduct investigations within their territory. This consent can be in the form of a &#x27;general consent&#x27; under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which remains in operation for all investigations until it is revoked, or alternatively, a &#x27;specific consent&#x27; authorising investigations in individual cases. Once consent is granted, the CBI can investigate economic, corruption, and special crimes (including national security, drugs and narcotics, etc.)

Most Indian states had granted general consent to the CBI to investigate crimes within their territory. However, as of 2020, several states have withdrawn their &#x27;general consent&#x27; for the CBI to operate, and require a special consent to be granted on a case to case basis. In November 2018 West Bengal government withdrew general consent for the CBI to investigate, and accused the Central Government of using federal agencies to destabilise state politics. Andhra Pradesh restored general consent in 2019. Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra have given general consent to the CBI after elections. In November 2020, Kerala, Jharkhand, and Punjab withdrew general consent to the CBI.Mizoram had previously withdrawn general consent to the CBI as well. Meghalaya withdrew consent in March 2022, and Tamil Nadu withdrew consent in June 2023, and Karnataka in 2024. Altogether, eight states require prior consent before the CBI can investigate crimes in their territory.

=== High Courts and the Supreme Court ===
The High Courts and the Supreme Court have the jurisdiction to order a CBI investigation into an offence alleged to have been committed in a state without the state&#x27;s consent, according to a five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court (in Civil Appeals 6249 and 6250 of 2001) on 17 February 2010. The bench ruled: The court clarified &quot;this is an extraordinary power which must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and only in exceptional situations.&quot;

=== Exemption from Right to Information (RTI) ===
CBI is exempted from the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005. This exemption was granted by the government on 9 June 2011 (with similar exemptions to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation and the National Intelligence Grid (Natgrid)) on the basis of national security. It was criticized by the Central Information Commission and RTI activists, who said the blanket exemption violated the letter and intent of the RTI Act. The exemption was upheld in Madras High Court.

== Conviction rate ==
The CBI&#x27;s annual conviction rate: 
== Recruitment ==
The CBI recruits personnel through both direct and indirect methods. Direct recruitment primarily occurs through the Staff Selection Commission&#x27;s Combined Graduate Level (SSC CGL) exam, filling entry-level positions for subordinate staff. Indirectly, superior officer positions (Group A) are predominantly filled by deputing experienced and meritorious officers from the Indian Police Service (IPS) cadre and sometimes from Indian Revenue Service (IRS) Cadre. Additionally, subordinate positions can be filled by deputing personnel from various state police forces, union territory police, and other law enforcement agencies.

Officers from State Police Services (SPSs) across India, holding ranks ranging from Deputy superintendent of police (DSPs) to Additional superintendent of police (Addl. SP), as well as subordinate ranks like Inspector and Sub-Inspector of Police, can be deputed to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

== Controversy and criticism ==
=== Corruption ===
In 2013, Judge of the Supreme Court of India (and later Chief Justice of India) R. M. Lodha criticized the CBI for being a &quot;caged parrot speaking in its master&#x27;s voice&quot;, due to its excessive political interference irrespective of which party happened to be in power.

Because of the CBI&#x27;s political overtones, it has been exposed by former officials such as Joginder Singh and B. R. Lall (director and joint director, respectively) as engaging in nepotism, wrongful prosecution and corruption. In Lall&#x27;s book, &quot;Who Owns CBI&quot;, he details how investigations are manipulated and derailed. Corruption within the organisation
has been revealed in information obtained under the RTI Act, and RTI activist Krishnanand Tripathi has alleged harassment from the CBI to save itself from exposure via RTI. The states that have withdrawn consent to the CBI have accused the CBI of being a tool used by the Union Government to unfairly target parties ideologically rivaling them.

=== Political interference ===

Normally, cases assigned to the CBI are sensitive and of national importance. It is standard practice for state police departments to register cases under its jurisdiction; if necessary, the central government may transfer a case to the CBI. The agency has been criticised for its mishandling of several scams. It has also been criticized for dragging its feet investigating prominent politicians, such as P. V. Narasimha Rao, J. Jayalalithaa, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav; this tactic leads to their acquittal or non-prosecution.

==== Bofors scandal ====

In January 2006 it was discovered that the CBI had quietly unfrozen bank accounts belonging to Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, one of those accused in the 1986 Bofors scandal which tainted the government of Rajiv Gandhi. The CBI was responsible for the inquiry into the Bofors case. Associates of then-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi were linked to alleged payoffs made during the mid-1980s by Swedish arms firm AB Bofors, with US millionin kickbacks moved from Britain and Panama to secret Swiss banks. The 410 howitzers purchased in the US million arms sale were reported to be inferior to those offered by a French competitor.

The CBI, which unfroze in a London bank in accounts held by Bofors, accused Quattrocchi and his wife Maria in 2006 but facilitated his travel by asking Interpol to take him off its wanted list on 29 April 2009.
After communications from the CBI, Interpol withdrew the Interpol notice on Quattrocchi.

==== Hawala scandal ====
A 1991 arrest of militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers, revealing evidence of large-scale payments to national politicians. The Jain hawala case encompassed former Union ministers Ajit Kumar Panja and P. Shiv Shankar, former Uttar Pradesh governor Motilal Vora, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Yashwant Sinha. The 20 defendants were discharged by Special Judge V. B. Gupta in the 650-million case, heard in New Delhi.

The judge ruled that there was no &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence against the accused which could be converted into legal evidence. Those freed included Bharatiya Janata Party president L. K. Advani; former Union ministers V. C. Shukla, Arjun Singh, Madhavrao Scindia, N. D. Tiwari and R. K. Dhawan, and former Delhi chief minister Madan Lal Khurana. In 1997 a ruling by late Chief Justice of India J. S. Verma listed about two dozen guidelines which, if followed, would have ensured the independence of the investigating agency. Sixteen years later, successive governments circumvent the guidelines and treat the CBI as another wing of the government. Although the prosecution was prompted by a public-interest petition, the cases concluded with no convictions. In &quot;Vineet Narain &amp; Others v Union of India AIR 1996 SC 3386&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the Central Vigilance Commission should have a supervisory role over the CBI.

==== Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case ====
In this case Santosh Kumar Singh, the alleged murderer of a 25-year-old law student, was acquitted for what the judge called &quot;deliberate inaction&quot; by the investigating team. The accused was the son of a high-ranking officer in the Indian Police Service, the reason for the CBI&#x27;s involvement. The 1999 judgment noted that &quot;the influence of the father of the accused has been there&quot;. Embarrassed by the judgment, CBI Director R. K. Raghavan appointed two special directors (P. C. Sharma and Gopal Achari) to study the judgement. The CBI appealed the verdict in Delhi High Court in 2000, and the court issued a warrant for the accused. The CBI applied for an early hearing in July 2006; in October the High Court found Singh guilty of rape and murder, sentencing him to death.

==== Sister Abhaya ====
This case concerns 27 March 1992 death of a nun who was found in a water well in the Saint Pius X convent hostel in Kottayam, Kerala. Five CBI investigations have failed to yield any suspects. The case was solved finally in December 2020 where the Main Accused were sentenced to life imprisonment by The Kerala High Court.

==== Sohrabuddin case ====
The CBI has been accused of supporting the ruling Indian National Congress against its opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The CBI is investigating the Sohrabuddin case in Gujarat; Geeta Johri, also investigating the case, claimed that the CBI is pressuring her to falsely implicate former Gujarat minister Amit Shah.

==== Sant Singh Chatwal case ====
Sant Singh Chatwal was a suspect in CBI records for 14 years. The agency had filed two charge sheets, sent Letters rogatory abroad and sent a team to the United States to imprison Chatwal and his wife from 2–5 February 1997. On 30 May 2007 and 10 August 2008 former CBI directors Vijay Shankar and Ashwani Kumar, respectively, signed no-challenge orders on the imprisonment. Later, it was decided not to appeal their release.

This closed a case of bank fraud in which Chatwal had been embroiled for over a decade. Along with four others, Chatwal was charged with being part of a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; to defraud the Bank of India&#x27;s New York branch of . Four charges were filed by the CBI, with Chatwal named a defendant in two. The other two trials are still in progress. RTI applicant Krishnanand Tripathi was denied access to public information concerning the closed cases. The Central Information Commission later ordered the CBI to disclose the information; however, the CBI is exempt from the RTI Act (see above). Chatwal is a recipient of the Padma Bhushan.

==== Malankara Varghese murder case ====
This case concerns 5 December 2002 death of T. M. Varghese (also known as Malankara Varghese), a member of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church managing committee and a timber merchant. Varghese Thekkekara, a priest and manager of the Angamali diocese of the rival Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (part of the Syriac Orthodox Church), was charged with murder and conspiracy on 9 May 2010. Thekkekara was not arrested after he was charged, for which the CBI was criticised by the Kerala High Court and the media.

==== Bhopal gas tragedy ====

The CBI was publicly seen as ineffective in trying the 1984 Bhopal disaster case. Former CBI joint director B. R. Lall has said that he was asked to remain soft on extradition for Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson and drop the charges (which included culpable homicide). Those accused received two-year sentences.

==== 2G spectrum case ====

The UPA government has been accused of allocating 2G spectrum to corporations at very low prices through corrupt and illegal means. The Supreme Court cited the CBI many times for its tardiness in the investigations; only after the court began monitoring its investigations were high-profile arrests made.

====Indian coal allocation scam====

This is a political scandal concerning the Indian UPA government&#x27;s allocation of the nation&#x27;s coal deposits to private companies by the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which cost the government . CBI director Ranjit Sinha submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court that the coal-scam status report prepared by the agency was shared with Congress Party law minister Ashwani Kumar &quot;as desired by him&quot; and with secretary-level officers from the prime minister&#x27;s office (PMO) and the coal ministry before presenting it to the court.

====2008 Noida double murder case====

This is a double murder case of 14-year-old girl Aarushi Talwar and 45-year-old Hemraj Banjade from Noida, India. On 26 November 2013, parents of the girl, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders. In January 2014, the Talwars challenged the decision in the Allahabad High Court. The High Court&#x27;s acquitted them of all charges on 12 October 2017 because of the lack of &#x27;irresistible proof&#x27;. The Allahabad HC in its verdict said that there were loopholes in the evidence which found the parents not guilty. Court also said that CBI tampered with evidence and tutored witnesses. Questions arose by nation on investigation and judgement given by CBI court.

2024 Kolkata rape and murder case

This is a rape and murder case of a 31 year old female post-graduate trainee doctor at the state-run R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata,India. On 13 December 2024, the R.G.Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and the station house officer of the Tala Police Station Abhijit Mondal was granted bail by the Sealdah Court in destruction of evidence in the 2024 Kolkata rape and murder incident as the CBI failed to file a chargesheet against Ghosh and Mondal within a span of 90 days. This has led to a widespread outrage as the victim&#x27;s parents were not satisfied with the CBI investigation stating that evidence had been destroyed by Ghosh and Mondal.

==In popular culture==

** The CBI has been portrayed in multiple Indian films across languages. Most notably in the Malayalam film franchise CBI Film Franchise scripted by SN Swamy and directed by K Madhu with veteran actor and film producer Mammootty portraying the lead role of CBI officer Sethurama Iyer.

<text>The following is a list of integrals (antiderivative functions) of rational functions. 
Any rational function can be integrated by partial fraction decomposition of the function into a sum of functions of the form:

which can then be integrated term by term.

For other types of functions, see lists of integrals.
== Miscellaneous integrands ==

* formula_3
* formula_4
* formula_5
== Integrands of the form &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;a x&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)&quot;n&quot; ==

Many of the following antiderivatives have a term of the form ln |&quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot;|. Because this is undefined when &quot;x&quot; = −&quot;b&quot; / &quot;a&quot;, the most general form of the antiderivative replaces the constant of integration with a locally constant function. However, it is conventional to omit this from the notation. For example,
formula_6
is usually abbreviated as
formula_7
where &quot;C&quot; is to be understood as notation for a locally constant function of &quot;x&quot;. This convention will be adhered to in the following.

<text>Integration is the basic operation in integral calculus. While differentiation has straightforward rules by which the derivative of a complicated function can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common antiderivatives.

==Historical development of integrals==
A compilation of a list of integrals (Integraltafeln) and techniques of integral calculus was published by the German mathematician (also spelled Meyer Hirsch) in 1810. These tables were republished in the United Kingdom in 1823. More extensive tables were compiled in 1858 by the Dutch mathematician David Bierens de Haan for his &quot;Tables d&#x27;intégrales définies&quot;, supplemented by &quot;Supplément aux tables d&#x27;intégrales définies&quot; in ca. 1864. A new edition was published in 1867 under the title &quot;Nouvelles tables d&#x27;intégrales définies&quot;.

These tables, which contain mainly integrals of elementary functions, remained in use until the middle of the 20th century. They were then replaced by the much more extensive tables of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, integrals originating from the book by Bierens de Haan are denoted by BI.

Not all closed-form expressions have closed-form antiderivatives; this study forms the subject of differential Galois theory, which was initially developed by Joseph Liouville in the 1830s and 1840s, leading to Liouville&#x27;s theorem which classifies which expressions have closed-form antiderivatives. A simple example of a function without a closed-form antiderivative is , whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the error function.

Since 1968 there is the Risch algorithm for determining indefinite integrals that can be expressed in term of elementary functions, typically using a computer algebra system. Integrals that cannot be expressed using elementary functions can be manipulated symbolically using general functions such as the Meijer G-function.

==Lists of integrals==
More detail may be found on the following pages for the lists of integrals:

* List of integrals of rational functions
* List of integrals of irrational functions
* List of integrals of trigonometric functions
* List of integrals of inverse trigonometric functions
* List of integrals of hyperbolic functions
* List of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions
* List of integrals of exponential functions
* List of integrals of logarithmic functions
* List of integrals of Gaussian functions

Gradshteyn, Ryzhik, Geronimus, Tseytlin, Jeffrey, Zwillinger, and Moll&#x27;s (GR) &quot;Table of Integrals, Series, and Products&quot; contains a large collection of results. An even larger, multivolume table is the &quot;Integrals and Series&quot; by Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev (with volumes 1–3 listing integrals and series of elementary and special functions, volume 4–5 are tables of Laplace transforms). More compact collections can be found in e.g. Brychkov, Marichev, Prudnikov&#x27;s &quot;Tables of Indefinite Integrals&quot;, or as chapters in Zwillinger&#x27;s &quot;CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae&quot; or Bronshtein and Semendyayev&#x27;s &quot;Guide Book to Mathematics&quot;, &quot;Handbook of Mathematics&quot; or &quot;Users&#x27; Guide to Mathematics&quot;, and other mathematical handbooks.

Other useful resources include Abramowitz and Stegun and the Bateman Manuscript Project. Both works contain many identities concerning specific integrals, which are organized with the most relevant topic instead of being collected into a separate table. Two volumes of the Bateman Manuscript are specific to integral transforms.

There are several web sites which have tables of integrals and integrals on demand. Wolfram Alpha can show results, and for some simpler expressions, also the intermediate steps of the integration. Wolfram Research also operates another online service, the Mathematica Online Integrator.

==Integrals of simple functions==
&quot;C&quot; is used for an arbitrary constant of integration that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus, each function has an infinite number of antiderivatives.

These formulas only state in another form the assertions in the table of derivatives.

===Integrals with a singularity===
When there is a singularity in the function being integrated such that the antiderivative becomes undefined or at some point (the singularity), then &quot;C&quot; does not need to be the same on both sides of the singularity. The forms below normally assume the Cauchy principal value around a singularity in the value of &quot;C&quot; but this is in general, not necessary. For instance in
formula_1
there is a singularity at 0 and the antiderivative becomes infinite there. If the integral above were to be used to compute a definite integral between −1 and 1, one would get the wrong answer 0. This however is the Cauchy principal value of the integral around the singularity. If the integration is done in the complex plane the result depends on the path around the origin, in this case the singularity contributes −&quot;i&quot; when using a path above the origin and &quot;i&quot; for a path below the origin. A function on the real line could use a completely different value of &quot;C&quot; on either side of the origin as in:
formula_2

This can be proved by computing the derivative of the right-hand side of the formula, taking into account that the condition on is here for insuring the continuity of the integral.

This gives the following formulas (where ), which are valid over any interval where is continuous (over larger intervals, the constant must be replaced by a piecewise constant function):
*formula_64when is odd, and formula_65.
*formula_66when formula_67 for some integer .
*formula_68when formula_69 for some integer .
*formula_70when formula_67 for some integer .
*formula_72when formula_69 for some integer .

If the function does not have any continuous antiderivative which takes the value zero at the zeros of (this is the case for the sine and the cosine functions), then is an antiderivative of on every interval on which is not zero, but may be discontinuous at the points where . For having a continuous antiderivative, one has thus to add a well chosen step function. If we also use the fact that the absolute values of sine and cosine are periodic with period , then we get:

<text>A yawn is a reflex in vertebrate animals characterized by a long inspiratory phase with gradual mouth gaping, followed by a brief climax (or acme) with muscle stretching, and a rapid expiratory phase with muscle relaxation, which typically lasts a few seconds. For fish and birds, this is described as gradual mouth gaping, staying open for at least three seconds and subsequently a rapid closure of the mouth. Almost all vertebrate animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even fish, experience yawning. The study of yawning is called chasmology.

Yawning (oscitation) most often occurs in adults immediately before and after sleep, during tedious activities and as a result of its contagious quality. It is commonly associated with tiredness, stress, sleepiness, boredom, or even hunger. In humans, yawning is often triggered by the perception that others are yawning (for example, seeing a person yawning, or talking to someone on the phone who is yawning). This is a typical example of echopraxia and positive feedback. This &quot;contagious&quot; yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees, dogs, cats, birds, and reptiles and can occur between members of different species. Approximately twenty psychological reasons for yawning have been proposed by scholars but there is little agreement on the primacy of any one.

During a yawn, muscles around the airway are fully stretched, including chewing and swallowing muscles. Due to these strong repositioning muscle movements, the airway (lungs and throat) dilates to three or four times its original size. The tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear contracts, which creates a rumbling noise perceived as coming from within the head; however, the noise is due to mechanical disturbance of the hearing apparatus and is not generated by the motion of air. Yawning is sometimes accompanied, in humans and other animals, by an instinctive act of stretching several parts of the body including the arms, neck, shoulders and back.
In humans it is often visible that nostrils are dilating involuntary during yawning.

==Etymology==
The English &quot;yawn&quot; continues a number of Middle English forms: from Old English , and from Old English frequentatives , from a Germanic root &quot;*gīn-&quot;. The Germanic root has Proto-Indo-European cognates, from a root &quot;&quot; found also with &quot;-n-&quot; suffix in Greek (&#x27;to yawn&#x27;), and without the &quot;-n-&quot; in English &quot;gap&quot; (compare the &quot;figura etymologica&quot; in Norse ), &quot;gum&quot; (&#x27;palate&#x27;) and &quot;gasp&quot; (via Old Norse), Latin , and Greek .

The Latin term used in medicine is (anglicized as &quot;oscitation&quot;), from the verb &quot;oscito&quot; (&#x27;to open the mouth&#x27;). 
&quot;&quot; is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously.

==Proposed causes==

There are a number of theories that attempt to explain why humans and other animals yawn.

One study states that yawning occurs when one&#x27;s blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen (or expulsion of carbon dioxide) that a yawn can provide. Yawning may reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration; however, the frequency of yawning is not decreased by providing more oxygen or reducing carbon dioxide in the air.

Animals subject to predation or other dangers must be ready to physically exert themselves at any given moment. At least one study suggests that yawning, especially psychological &quot;contagious&quot; yawning, may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals alert. If an animal is drowsy or bored, it will be less alert than when fully awake and less prepared to spring into action. &quot;Contagious&quot; yawning could be an instinctual signal between group members to stay alert.

Nervousness, which often indicates the perception of an impending need for action, has also been suggested as a cause. Anecdotal evidence suggests that yawning helps increase a person&#x27;s alertness. Paratroopers have been noted to yawn during the moments before they exit their aircraft.

Another notion states that yawning is the body&#x27;s way of controlling brain temperature. In 2007, researchers, including a professor of psychology from the SUNY Albany (US), proposed yawning may be a means to keep the brain cool. Mammalian brains operate best within a narrow temperature range. In two experiments, subjects with cold packs attached to their foreheads and subjects asked to breathe strictly nasally exhibited reduced contagious yawning when watching videos of people yawning. 
A similar hypothesis suggests yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Similarly, Guttmann and Dopart (2011) found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawns, the air moving between the subject&#x27;s ear and the environment causes a breeze to be heard. Guttmann and Dopart determined that a yawn causes one of three possible situations to occur: the brain cools down due to an influx or outflux of oxygen; pressure in the brain is reduced by an outflux of oxygen; or the pressure of the brain is increased by an influx of air caused by increased cranial space.

One review hypothesized that yawning&#x27;s goal is to periodically stretch the muscles of the throat, which may be important for efficient vocalization, swallowing, chewing, and also keeping the airway wide.

Yawning behavior may be altered as a result of medical issues such as diabetes, stroke, or adrenal conditions. Excessive yawning is seen in immunosuppressed patients such as those with multiple sclerosis. A professor of clinical and forensic neuropsychology at Bournemouth University has demonstrated that cortisol levels rise during yawning.

==Social function==
With respect to a possible evolutionary advantage, yawning might be a herd instinct. Theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood in gregarious animals, similar to howling in a wolf pack. It signals fatigue among members of a group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods.

Research by Garrett Norris (2013) involving monitoring the behaviour of students kept waiting in a reception area indicates a connection (supported by neuro-imaging research) between empathic ability and yawning. &quot;We believe that contagious yawning indicates empathy. It indicates an appreciation of other peoples&#x27; behavioral and physiological state,&quot; says Norris.

The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious. In 1508, Erasmus wrote, &quot;One man&#x27;s yawning makes another yawn&quot;, and the French proverbialized the idea to (&#x27;One good gaper makes seven others gape&#x27;). Often, if one person yawns, this may cause another person to &quot;empathetically&quot; yawn. Observing another person&#x27;s yawning face (especially their eyes), reading or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn. The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which, upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation, which lies at the root of much human learning, such as language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse.

A 2007 study found that young children with autism spectrum disorders do not increase their yawning frequency after seeing videos of other people yawning, in contrast to non-autistic children. In fact, the autistic children actually yawned less during the videos of yawning than during the control videos.

The relationship between yawn contagion and empathy is strongly supported by a 2011 behavioural study, conducted by Ivan Norscia and Elisabetta Palagi (University of Pisa, Italy). The study revealed that—among other variables such as nationality, gender, and sensory modality—only social bonding predicted the occurrence, frequency, and latency of yawn contagion. As with other measures of empathy, the rate of contagion was found to be greatest in response to kin, then friends, then acquaintances, and lastly strangers. Related individuals (r≥0.25) showed the greatest contagion, in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns. Strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response (latency) compared to friends and kin. Hence, yawn contagion appears to be primarily driven by the emotional closeness between individuals. The social asymmetry in contagious yawning (with contagious yawning being more frequent between familiar subjects than between strangers) remains when only yawns that are heard, but not seen, are considered. This finding makes it unlikely that visual attentional biases are at the basis of the social asymmetry observed in contagious yawning.

Two classes of yawning have been observed among primates. In some cases, the yawn is used as a threat gesture as a way of maintaining order in the primates&#x27; social structure. Specific studies were conducted on chimpanzees and stumptail macaques. A group of these animals was shown a video of other members of their own species yawning; both species yawned as well. This helps to partly confirm a yawn&#x27;s &quot;contagiousness&quot;.

The Discovery Channel&#x27;s show &quot;MythBusters&quot; also tested this concept. In their small-scale, informal study they concluded that yawning is contagious, although elsewhere the statistical significance of this finding has been disputed.

Gordon Gallup, who hypothesizes that yawning may be a means of keeping the brain cool, also hypothesizes that &quot;contagious&quot; yawning may be a survival instinct inherited from our evolutionary past. &quot;During human evolutionary history, when we were subject to predation and attacks by other groups, if everybody yawns in response to seeing someone yawn the whole group becomes much more vigilant and much better at being able to detect danger.&quot;

A study by the University of London has suggested that the &quot;contagiousness&quot; of yawns by a human will pass to dogs. The study observed that 21 of 29 dogs yawned when a stranger yawned in front of them but did not yawn when the stranger only opened his mouth. 
Helt and Eigsti (2010) showed that dogs, like humans, develop a susceptibility to contagious yawning gradually, and that while dogs above seven months &#x27;catch&#x27; yawns from humans, younger dogs are immune to contagion. The study also indicated that nearly half of the dogs responded to the human&#x27;s yawn by becoming relaxed and sleepy, suggesting that the dogs copied not just the yawn, but also the physical state that yawns typically reflect.

===Relation to empathy===
In a study involving gelada baboons, yawning was contagious between individuals, especially those that were socially close. This suggests that emotional proximity rather than spatial proximity is an indicator of yawn contagion.

Evidence for the occurrence of contagious yawning linked to empathy is rare outside of primates. It has been studied in Canidae species, such as the domestic dog and wolf. Domestic dogs have shown the ability to yawn contagiously in response to human yawns. Domestic dogs have demonstrated they are skilled at reading human communication behaviours. This ability makes it difficult to ascertain whether yawn contagion among domestic dogs is deeply rooted in their evolutionary history or is a result of domestication. 
In a 2014 study, wolves were observed in an effort to answer this question. The results of the study showed that wolves are capable of yawn contagion. This study also found that the social bond strength between individuals affected the frequency of contagious yawning in wolves, supporting previous research which ties contagious yawning to emotional proximity.

Some evidence for contagious yawning has also been found in budgerigars (&quot;Melopsittacus undulatus&quot;), a species of social parrots. This indicates that contagious yawning may have evolved several times in different lineages. In budgerigars, contagious yawning does not seem to be related to social closeness.

In certain neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, the patient has an impaired ability to infer the mental states of others. In such cases, yawn contagion can be used to evaluate their ability to infer or empathize with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder which severely affects social and communicative development, including empathy. The results of various studies have showed a diminished susceptibility to contagious yawn compared to the control group of typically developing children. Since atypical development of empathy is reported in autism spectrum disorder, results support the claim that contagious yawning and the capacity of empathy share common neural and cognitive mechanisms. Similarly, patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, have shown an impaired ability to empathize with others. Contagious yawning is one means of evaluating such disorders. The Canadian psychiatrist Heinz Lehmann claimed that increases in yawning could predict recovery in schizophrenia. The impairment of contagious yawning can provide greater insight into its connection to the underlying causes of empathy.

There is still substantial disagreement in the existing literature about whether or not yawn contagion is related to empathy at all. Empathy is a notoriously difficult trait to measure, and the literature on the subject is confused, with the same species sometimes displaying a connection between contagious yawning and social closeness, and sometimes apparently not. Different experimenters typically use slightly different measures of empathy, making comparisons between studies difficult, and there may be a publication bias, where studies which find a significant correlation between the two tested variables are more likely to be published than studies which do not. By revising in critical way the literature for and against yawn contagion as an empathy-related phenomenon, a 2020 review has shown that the social and emotional relevance of the stimulus (based on who the yawner is) can be related to the levels of yawn contagion, as suggested by neurobiological, ethological and psychological findings. Therefore, the discussion over the issue remains open.

==Non-human==

Mammals, birds, and other vertebrates yawn.

In animals, yawning can serve as a warning signal. Charles Darwin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;, mentions that baboons yawn to threaten their enemies, possibly by displaying large canine teeth. Similarly, Siamese fighting fish yawn only when they see a conspecific (same species) or their own mirror-image, and their yawn often accompanies aggressive attack. Guinea pigs also yawn in a display of dominance or anger, displaying their impressive incisor teeth. This is often accompanied by teeth chattering, purring and scent marking.

Adelie penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an &quot;ecstatic display&quot;, opening their beaks and pointing their faces skyward. This trait has also been seen among emperor penguins. Researchers have been attempting to discover why these two different species share this trait, despite not sharing a habitat. Snakes yawn, both to realign their jaws after a meal and for respiratory reasons, as their trachea can be seen to expand when they do this. Dogs, and occasionally cats, often yawn after seeing people yawn and when they feel uncertain. Dogs demonstrate contagious yawning when exposed to human yawning. Dogs are very adept at reading human communication actions, so it is unclear if this phenomenon is rooted in evolutionary history or a result of domestication. Fish can also yawn, and they will increase this behavior when experiencing a lack of oxygen. Socially contagious yawning has been observed in budgerigars, and anecdotally when tired in other parrot species.

==Culture==

Some cultures lend yawning moral or spiritual significance. An open mouth has been associated with letting good immaterial things (such as the soul) escape or letting bad ones (evil spirits) enter, and yawning may have been thought to increase these risks. Covering the mouth when yawning may have been a way to prevent such transmission. Exorcists believe yawning can indicate that a demon or possessive spirit is leaving its human host during the course of an exorcism. Thus, covering one&#x27;s mouth has been conceived as a protective measure against this.

Yawning has also been described as disrespectful (when done before others) or improper (when done alone). For example, in his commentary on Al-Bukhari&#x27;s hadith collection, Ibn Hajar, an Islamic theologian, mentions that yawning, in addition to its risks of letting demons enter or take hold of one&#x27;s body, is unbefitting for humans as it makes them look and sound like dogs by crooking men&#x27;s upright posture and making them howl:

Superstitions regarding the act of yawning may have arisen from concerns over public health. Polydore Vergil (–1555), in his &quot;De Rerum Inventoribus&quot;, writes that it was customary to make the Sign of the Cross over one&#x27;s mouth, since &quot;alike deadly plague was sometime in yawning, wherefore men used to fence themselves with the sign of the cross... which custom we retain at this day.&quot;

Yawning is often perceived as implying boredom, and yawning conspicuously in another&#x27;s presence has historically been a faux pas. In 1663 Francis Hawkins advised, &quot;In yawning howl not, and thou shouldst abstain as much as thou can to yawn, especially when thou speakest.&quot; George Washington said, &quot;If You Cough, Sneeze, Sigh, or Yawn, do it not Loud but Privately; and Speak not in your Yawning, but put Your handkerchief or Hand before your face and turn aside.&quot; These customary beliefs persist in the modern age. One of Mason Cooley&#x27;s aphorisms is &quot;A yawn is more disconcerting than a contradiction.&quot; A loud yawn may even lead to penalties for contempt of court.

<text>James Joseph Sylvester (3 September 1814 – 15 March 1897) was an English mathematician. He made fundamental contributions to matrix theory, invariant theory, number theory, partition theory, and combinatorics. He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University and as founder of the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot;. At his death, he was a professor at Oxford University.

== Biography ==
James Joseph was born in London on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a Jewish merchant. James later adopted the surname &quot;Sylvester&quot; when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States.

At the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of Augustus De Morgan at the University of London (now University College London). His family withdrew him from the university after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the Liverpool Royal Institution.

Sylvester began his study of mathematics at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1831, where his tutor was John Hymers. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge&#x27;s famous mathematical examination, the tripos, for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, and he could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a Smith&#x27;s prize. In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at University College London and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an MA by Trinity College Dublin. 

In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia, the first Jewish professor at any American college or university. He left his appointment after only four months after a classroom incident in which a student he had criticized hit him with a bludgeon and he struck back with a sword-cane. The student collapsed in shock and Sylvester believed (wrongly) that he had killed him. Sylvester resigned when he felt that the university authorities had not sufficiently disciplined the student. He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry. However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England.

On his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, Arthur Cayley, with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also matrix theory during a long collaboration. He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of &quot;The Times&quot;.

One of Sylvester&#x27;s lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, Latin and Greek, and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, Sylvester published a book entitled &quot;The Laws of Verse&quot; in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for prosody in poetry.

In 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.

In 1876 Sylvester again crossed the Atlantic Ocean to become the inaugural professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold. After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold.

In 1877, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1878 he founded the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot;. The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the &quot;Analyst&quot;, which eventually became the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;.

Also in 1878, Christine Ladd-Franklin was accepted into Johns Hopkins University with his help. He remembered some of Ladd&#x27;s earlier works in the &quot;Educational Times&quot;. Ladd&#x27;s application for a fellowship was signed &quot;C. Ladd&quot;, and the university offered her the position without realizing she was a woman. When they did realize her gender, the board tried to revoke the offer, but Sylvester insisted that Ladd should be his student, and so she was. She held a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University for three years, but the trustees did not allow her name to be printed in circulars with those of other fellows, for fear of setting a precedent. Furthermore, dissension over her continued presence forced one of the original trustees to resign.

In 1883, Sylvester returned to England to take up the position of Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the university appointed a deputy professor to the same chair. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School.

Sylvester died at 5 Hertford Street, London on 15 March 1897. He is buried in Balls Pond Road Cemetery on Kingsbury Road in London.

==Legacy==

Sylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as &quot;matrix&quot; (in 1850),
&quot;graph&quot; in the sense of &quot;network&quot; and &quot;discriminant&quot;. He coined the term &quot;totient&quot; for Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;n&quot;). In discrete geometry he is remembered for Sylvester&#x27;s problem and a result on the orchard problem, and in matrix theory he discovered
Sylvester&#x27;s determinant identity, which generalizes the &quot;Desnanot–Jacobi identity&quot;. His collected scientific work fills four volumes. In 1880, the Royal Society of London awarded Sylvester the Copley Medal, its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the Sylvester Medal in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in Oxford.

Sylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at Johns Hopkins University, is named in his honor. Several professorships there are named in his honor also.

<text>Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the north of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from east clockwise) Main-Tauber-Kreis, Hohenlohe-Kreis, Heilbronn, Rhein-Neckar-Kreis, Odenwaldkreis (Hesse) and Landkreis Miltenberg (Bavaria). The district is part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.

==History==
The district was created in 1973 by merging the previous districts Buchen and Mosbach. At first it was named &quot;Odenwaldkreis&quot;, however to avoid confusion with the neighboring district in Hesse with the same name it was renamed in 1974 to be &quot;Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis&quot;.

==Geography==
As the name already suggests the district is located in the Odenwald mountains, with the highest elevation at the Katzenbuckel (626 m) near Waldbrunn in the west of the district. The main river of the district is the Neckar.

==Coat of arms==
The district&#x27;s coat of arms might be described thus: Per pale dexter bendy lozengy argent and azure, sinister gules a wheel spoked of six argent. The coat of arms shows the symbols of the two historical rulers of the district. On the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side is the blue and white &quot;bendy lozengy&quot; (that is, slanted diamond shapes) of the Wittelsbach family as owners of the Electorate of the Palatinate; on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side is the Wheel of Mainz, a symbol of the old Electorate of Mainz.

<doc id="234876" wikidata="Q15975187" url="?curid=234876" title="Migraine (book)">
<text>Migraine is the first book written by Oliver Sacks, a well-known New York City-based neurologist and author. The full title of the first edition was Migraine - Evolution of a Common Disorder. The book was written in 1967, mostly over a nine-day period, and first published in 1970. A revised and updated version was published in 1992. (In the newer edition, the last chapter &quot;Migraine Aura and Hallucinatory Constants&quot; was written in collaboration with Ralph M. Siegel.)

==Summary==
As with Sacks&#x27;s other writings, &quot;Migraine&quot; is a comprehensive review of the subject aimed at the lay population and uses numerous case histories. Sacks describes the nature of and treatments for migraine in general and several various subtypes, particularly examining the visual aura feature that is common to many sufferers, along with the pre-migraine signs &amp; symptoms. The particular focus of the book, however, is on the neuropsychological aspects of migraine.

==Contents==
The book is divided into five sections:
#The Experience of Migraine
#The Occurrence of Migraine
#The Basis of Migraine
#Therapeutic Approaches to Migraine
#Migraine as a Universal

==Inspiration for writing the book==
In an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson about the possible merits of altered states of consciousness by means of psychoactive substance, Sacks revealed that in 1967 he had a revelation when he was under the influence of an undisclosed psychoactive substance while reading a book written in the 19th century about headaches and migraines. This book was written by Edward Liveing, an early and important contributor in theories of migraine pathogenesis. As he was reading the book he had an awakening and thought to himself, &quot;Who shall be the Edward Liveing of our time? And there was a very disingenuous clamor of names that came to me, followed by a very loud inner voice which said, &#x27;You Silly Bugger! You&#x27;re the man!&#x27;&quot;

<text>Gustav Friedrich (after 1908: von) Schmoller (; 24 June 1838 – 27 June 1917) was the leader of the &quot;younger&quot; German historical school of economics.

He was a leading &quot;Sozialpolitiker&quot; (more derisively, &quot;Kathedersozialist&quot;, &quot;Socialist of the Chair&quot;), and a founder and long-time chairman of the &quot;Verein für Socialpolitik&quot;, the German Economic Association, which continues to exist. 
The appellation &quot;Kathedersozialist&quot; was given to Schmoller and other members of the Verein by their enemies. Schmoller disavowed the &quot;socialist&quot; label, instead tracing his thought to the heterodox liberalism represented by Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, John Stuart Mill, Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Bruno Hildebrand, Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie, Lorenz von Stein, and Émile de Laveleye and radicals such as Frederic Harrison and Edward Spencer Beesly. His goal was to reconcile the Prussian monarchy and bureaucracy &quot;with the idea of the Liberal state and complemented by the best elements of parliamentarianism&quot; to carry out social reform.

==Life==
Schmoller was born in Heilbronn. His father was a Württemberg civil servant. Young Schmoller studied &quot;&quot; (a combination of economics, law, history, and civil administration) at the University of Tübingen (1857–1861). In 1861, he obtained an appointment at the . During his academic career, he held appointments as a professor at the universities of Halle (1864–72), Strasbourg (1872–1882), and Berlin (1882–1913). After 1899, he represented the University of Berlin in the Prussian House of Lords.

Schmoller&#x27;s influence on academic policy, economic, social and fiscal reform, and economics as an academic discipline for the time between 1875 and 1910 can hardly be overstated. He was an outspoken proponent of the assertion of German naval power and the expansion of the German colonial empire.

==Work==

As an outspoken leader of the &quot;younger&quot; historical school, Schmoller opposed what he saw as the axiomatic-deductive approach of classical economics and, later, the Austrian school—indeed, Schmoller coined the term to suggest provincialism in an unfavorable review of the 1883 book &quot;Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere)&quot; by Carl Menger, which attacked the methods of the historical school. This led to the controversy known as the &quot;Methodenstreit&quot;. Schmoller&#x27;s primarily inductive approach, requesting careful study, comparative in time and space, of economic performance and phenomena generally, his focus on the evolution of economic processes and institutions, and his insistence on the cultural specificity of economics and the centrality of values in shaping economic exchanges stand in stark contrast to some classical and most neoclassical economists, so that he and his school fell out of the mainstream of economics by the 1930s, being replaced in Germany by the successor Freiburg school.

To Schmoller, psychology and ethics were key aspects of political economy. He was a critic of liberal individualism.

However, it is often overlooked that Schmoller&#x27;s primary preoccupation in his lifetime was not with economic &quot;method&quot; but with economic and social &quot;policy&quot; to address the challenges posed by rapid industrialization and urbanization. That is, Schmoller was first and foremost a social reformer. As such, Schmoller&#x27;s influence extended throughout Europe, to the Progressive movement in the United States, and to social reformers in Meiji Japan. His most prominent non-German students and followers included William Ashley, W. E. B. Du Bois, Richard T. Ely, Albion Woodbury Small, and Edwin R. A. Seligman.

Since the 1980s, Schmoller&#x27;s work has been re-evaluated and found relevant to some branches of heterodox economics, as well as development economics, behavioral economics, evolutionary economics, and new institutional economics. He has long had an influence within the subfield of economic history and the discipline of sociology.

After 1881, Schmoller was editor of the &quot;Jahrbuch für Gesetzebung, Verwaltung, und Volkswirthschaft im deutschen Reich&quot;. From 1878 to 1903, he edited a series of monographs entitled &quot;Staats- und sozialwissenschaftliche Forschungen&quot;. He was also an editor and major contributor to &quot;Acta Borussica&quot;, an extensive collection of Prussian historical sources undertaken by the Berlin Academy of Science upon Schmoller&#x27;s and Sybel&#x27;s instigation.

One of the reasons why Schmoller is not more widely known today is that most of his books and articles were not translated, as during his time Anglo-American economists generally read German, which was the dominant scholarly language of the time. German having fallen out of favor, the untranslated texts are now inaccessible to readers without knowledge of German. Two exceptions are:
* &quot;The Mercantile System and Its Historical Significance&quot;, New York: Macmillan, 2nd ed. 1910. This is a chapter from Schmoller&#x27;s much larger work &quot;Studien über die wirtschaftliche Politik Friedrichs des Grossen&quot; which was published in 1884. The chapter was translated by William J. Ashley and published in 1897 under the English title above. online edition
* &quot;The Idea of Justice in Political Economy.&quot; &quot;Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot;. 4 (1894): 697–737. in JSTOR
His &quot;magnum opus&quot; is
* &quot;Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre&quot;, Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1900–1904.

== Criticism ==
In 1900, Schmoller added a section on &quot;Races and Peoples&quot; to his &quot;Grundriß der Allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre&quot; and in it, on twenty pages of alleged findings on diverse personality traits, described a hierarchical order of &quot;races&quot;, which he presented as a basis of economics. For this reason, the Verein für Socialpolitik, which awards the Gustav Schmoller Medal for outstanding services to the Association, has suspended the award from June 2021 to May 2026 and decided to discuss the subject of the relevant section of Schmoller&#x27;s book at upcoming annual meetings during this period.

The decision was made by the Verein für Socialpolitik on the basis of an expert opinion by Erik Grimmer-Solem (Wesleyan University, Middletown, USA).

==Works==
His works, the majority of which deal with economic history and policy, include:
* &quot;Der französiche Handelsvertrag und seine Gegner&quot; (The French trade treaty and its opponents, 1862)
* &quot;Zur Geschichte der deutschen Kleingewerbe im 19. Jahrhundert&quot; (History of German Small Businesses in the 19th Century, 1870)
* &quot;Strassburg zur Zeit der Zunftkämpfe&quot; (Strassburg During the Guild Fights, 1875)
* &quot;Zur Litteraturgeschichte der Staats- und Sozialwissenschaften&quot; (1888)
* &quot;Umrisse und Untersuchungen zur Verfassungs-, Verwaltungs-, und Wirtschaftsgeschichte&quot; (1898)
* &quot;Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirthschaftslehre&quot; (Layout of General Economics, 1900–1904)
* &quot;Ueber einige Grundfragen der Sozialpolitik&quot; (About a few Questions of Social Politics, 1904)

<doc id="234880" wikidata="Q15274050" url="?curid=234880" title="Loriini">
<text>Loriini is a tribe of small to medium-sized arboreal parrots characterized by their specialized brush-tipped tongues for feeding on nectar of various blossoms and soft fruits, preferably berries. The species form a monophyletic group within the parrot family Psittaculidae. The group consists of the lories and lorikeets. Traditionally, they were considered a separate subfamily (Loriinae) from the other subfamily (Psittacinae) based on the specialized characteristics, but recent molecular and morphological studies show that the group is positioned in the middle of various other groups. They are widely distributed throughout the Australasian region, including south-eastern Asia, Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Australia, and the majority have very brightly coloured plumage.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;lory&quot; comes from the Malay &quot;lūri&quot;, a name used for a number of species of colourful parrots. The name was used by the Dutch writer Johan Nieuhof in 1682 in a book describing his travels in the East Indies.
The spelling &quot;laurey&quot; was used by English naturalist Eleazar Albin in 1731 for a species of parrot from Brazil,
and then in 1751 the English naturalist George Edwards used the spelling &quot;lory&quot; when introducing names for five species of parrot from the East Indies in the fourth volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards credited Nieuhof for the name.

The choice of the terms &quot;lory&quot; and &quot;lorikeet&quot; is subjective, like the use of &quot;parrot&quot; and &quot;parakeet&quot;. Species with longer tapering tails are generally referred to as &quot;lorikeets&quot;, while species with short blunt tails are generally referred to as &quot;lories&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Traditionally, lories and lorikeets have either been classified as the subfamily, Loriinae, or as a family on their own, Loriidae, but they are currently classified as a tribe. Neither traditional view is confirmed by molecular studies. Those studies show that the lories and lorikeets form a single group, closely related to the budgerigar and the fig parrots (&quot;Cyclopsitta&quot; and &quot;Psittaculirostris&quot;).

A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the Loriini published in 2020 led to major changes in the generic boundaries. The reorganisation involved the resurrection of four genera: &quot;Charminetta&quot;, &quot;Hypocharmosyna&quot;, &quot;Charmosynopsis&quot; and &quot;Glossoptilus&quot;, as well as the erection of three entirely new genera: &quot;Synorhacma&quot;, &quot;Charmosynoides&quot; and &quot;Saudareos&quot;. One genus disappeared, as the collared lory, which had previously been placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Phigys&quot;, was found to be embedded in the genus &quot;Vini&quot;. The extinct New Caledonian lorikeet, although not sampled, was assumed to be a member of the genus &quot;Vini&quot; on plumage and biogeographic grounds. The tribe Loriini now contains 61 species divided into 19 genera.

===Genera===
==Morphology==

Lories and lorikeets have specialized brush-tipped tongues for feeding on nectar and soft fruits. They can feed from the flowers of about 5,000 species of plants and use their specialized tongues to take the nectar. The tip of their tongues have tufts of papillae (extremely fine hairs), which collect nectar and pollen.

The multi-coloured rainbow lorikeet was one of the species of parrots appearing in the first edition of &quot;The Parrots of the World&quot; and also in John Gould&#x27;s lithographs of the Birds of Australia.

==Diet==
In the wild, rainbow lorikeets feed mainly on pollen and nectar, and possess a tongue adapted especially for their particular diet. Many fruit orchard owners consider them a pest, as they often fly in groups and strip trees containing fresh fruit. They are also frequent visitors at bird feeders that supply lorikeet-friendly treats, such as store-bought nectar, sunflower seeds, and fruits such as apples, grapes and pears. Occasionally they have been observed feeding on meat.

==Conservation==

The ultramarine lorikeet is endangered. It is now one of the 50 rarest birds in the world. The blue lorikeet is classified as vulnerable. The introduction of European rats to the small island habitats of these birds is a major cause of their endangerment. Various conservation efforts have been made to relocate some of these birds to locations free of predation and habitat destruction.

==In literature==
A &quot;Lory&quot; famously appears in Chapter III of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland. Alice argues with the Lory about its age.

<text>Sports Night is an American comedy drama television series about a fictional sports news show also called &quot;Sports Night&quot;. It focuses on the friendships, pitfalls and ethical issues the creative talent of the program face while trying to produce a good show under constant network pressure. Created by Aaron Sorkin, the half-hour prime time comedy drama aired on ABC for two seasons, from September 22, 1998, to May 16, 2000.

The show stars Robert Guillaume as managing editor Isaac Jaffe, Felicity Huffman as executive producer Dana Whitaker, Peter Krause as anchor Casey McCall, Josh Charles as anchor Dan Rydell, Sabrina Lloyd as senior associate producer Natalie Hurley, and Joshua Malina as associate producer Jeremy Goodwin. Regular guest stars included William H. Macy as ratings expert Sam Donovan and Brenda Strong as Sally Sasser, the producer of &quot;West Coast Update&quot; (a sister show on the same network as &quot;Sports Night&quot;) and professional and romantic rival of Dana. Other notable guest stars included Paula Marshall and several who later appeared on Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;The West Wing&quot; including Janel Moloney, Teri Polo, Ted McGinley, Lisa Edelstein, Clark Gregg, Nina Siemaszko, John de Lancie, Timothy Davis-Reed, Cress Williams, Nadia Dajani, and Spencer Garrett.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #10 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

==Overview==
The show is said to be a semi-fictional account of the ESPN &quot;SportsCenter&quot; team of Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick, with Rydell representing Olbermann and McCall representing Patrick. Patrick has confirmed this on his syndicated radio program &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;. It has also been said that many of the storylines for McCall were inspired by Craig Kilborn, who was an anchor on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; during the mid 1990s.

The fictional &quot;Sports Night&quot; is a sports news program in the style of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. The show broadcasts live from 11 pm to midnight and is rebroadcast through the next morning; it may broadcast at other times for special events, such as the NFL Draft. The program debuted in 1996 and airs from the Rockefeller Center in New York City on the fictional Continental Sports Channel (CSC), a unit of Continental Corp, owned and run by Luther Sachs. Continental Corp owns cable networks around the United States; when the company is offered for sale, bidders include Time Warner, Disney (which, incidentally, owns a majority of ESPN in reality), and News Corporation.

Both the fictional show and the network have competitive and financial difficulties. The network, according to Continental Corp&#x27;s CFO, has an annual deficit up to $120 million. Although &quot;Sports Night&quot; does better than CNN/SI, Dana Whitaker says that &quot;Sports Night&quot; is &quot;in third place. We are getting our asses kicked by ESPN and Fox&quot;. Natalie Hurley replies, &quot;Every show on this network is in third place. It&#x27;s a third-place network.&quot; When &quot;Sports Night&quot; is asked to interview Michael Jordan about his new perfume, the retired basketball star&#x27;s publicity team demands final cut privilege—something it would not ask Fox or ESPN—because it believes that &quot;Sports Night&quot; is more desperate for ratings.

Although the first season of &quot;Sports Night&quot; is a sitcom, it often is portrayed as more of a comedy drama representative of some of Sorkin&#x27;s later work on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Sorkin intended for the series&#x27; humor to be drier and more realistic than typical sitcoms. He initially wanted the show to be recorded without a laugh track, but ABC network executives insisted on including one. The volume of the laugh track faded as Season One continued and was abandoned at the beginning of Season Two.

The dialogue is often delivered at a rapid-fire pace and intentionally exposes many aspects of communication that go beyond the words that are spoken. The show also frequently employed a technique known as &quot;Walk and talk&quot;, where the characters are walking from one location to the next while in conversation. This is another characteristic of Sorkin&#x27;s shows as &quot;walk and talks&quot; are used quite frequently in &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. A number of similar themes, elements and actors carried over from &quot;Sports Night&quot; to &quot;The West Wing&quot; and later &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;.

The show&#x27;s main focus is the relationships between the characters. These include an off-again on-again flirtation and romance between Dana and Casey, the partnership of Natalie and Jeremy, and Dan&#x27;s ongoing problems with relationships in general. The character of Isaac Jaffe hovers over his staff as a benevolent but uncompromising father figure.

The show is mostly set in the studio and station offices. However, in the second season Anthony&#x27;s, a local sports bar and restaurant, was introduced as another location for scenes out of the work environment.

Guillaume suffered a stroke midway through the first season and this event was worked into his character and the season&#x27;s story arc.

&quot;Sports Night&quot; struggled to find an audience and ABC cancelled it after two seasons. Although it had the opportunity to move to several different networks, including HBO, Showtime and USA, Sorkin decided to let the show pass so that he could focus on &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

==Cast==

<text>In computer science, distributed memory refers to a multiprocessor computer system in which each processor has its own private memory. Computational tasks can only operate on local data, and if remote data are required, the computational task must communicate with one or more remote processors. In contrast, a shared memory multiprocessor offers a single memory space used by all processors. Processors do not have to be aware where data resides, except that there may be performance penalties, and that race conditions are to be avoided.

In a distributed memory system there is typically a processor, a memory, and some form of interconnection that allows programs on each processor to interact with each other. The interconnect can be organised with point to point links or separate hardware can provide a switching network. The network topology is a key factor in determining how the multiprocessor machine scales. The links between nodes can be implemented using some standard network protocol (for example Ethernet), using bespoke network links (used in for example the transputer), or using dual-ported memories.

==Programming distributed memory machines==
The key issue in programming distributed memory systems is how to distribute the data over the memories. Depending on the problem solved, the data can be distributed statically, or it can be moved through the nodes. Data can be moved on demand, or data can be pushed to the new nodes in advance.

As an example, if a problem can be described as a pipeline where data &quot;x&quot; is processed subsequently through functions &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, etc. (the result is &quot;h&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)))), then this can be expressed as a distributed memory problem where the data is transmitted first to the node that performs &quot;f&quot; that passes the result onto the second node that computes &quot;g&quot;, and finally to the third node that computes &quot;h&quot;. This is also known as systolic computation.

Data can be kept statically in nodes if most computations happen locally, and only changes on edges have to be reported to other nodes. An example of this is simulation where data is modeled using a grid, and each node simulates a small part of the larger grid. On every iteration, nodes inform all neighboring nodes of the new edge data.

==Distributed shared memory==
Similarly, in distributed shared memory each node of a cluster has access to a large shared memory in addition to each node&#x27;s limited non-shared private memory.

==Shared memory vs. distributed memory vs. distributed shared memory==
* The advantage of (distributed) shared memory is that it offers a unified address space in which all data can be found.
* The advantage of distributed memory is that it excludes race conditions, and that it forces the programmer to think about data distribution.
* The advantage of distributed (shared) memory is that it is easier to design a machine that scales with the algorithm

Distributed shared memory hides the mechanism of communication, it does not hide the latency of communication.

<text>The Yarra River or historically, the Yarra Yarra River, (Kulin languages: Berrern, Birr-arrung, Bay-ray-rung, Birarang, Birrarung, and Wongete) is a perennial river in south-central Victoria, Australia.

The lower stretches of the Yarra are where Victoria&#x27;s state capital Melbourne was established in 1835, and today metropolitan Greater Melbourne dominates and influences the landscape of its lower reaches. From its source in the Yarra Ranges, it flows west through the Yarra Valley which opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne before emptying into Hobsons Bay in northernmost Port Phillip Bay.

The river has been a major food source and meeting place for Indigenous Australians for thousands of years. Shortly after the arrival of European settlers, land clearing forced the remaining Wurundjeri people into neighbouring territories and away from the river. Originally called &quot;Birrarung&quot; by the Wurundjeri, the current name was mistranslated from another Wurundjeri term in the Boonwurrung language; &quot;Yarro-yarro&quot;, meaning &quot;ever-flowing&quot;.

The river was utilised primarily for agriculture by early European settlers. The landscape of the river has changed dramatically since 1835. The course has been progressively disrupted and the river widened in places. The first of many crossings of the Yarra River to facilitate transport was built in Princes Bridge. Beginning with the Victorian gold rush it was extensively mined, creating the Pound Bend Tunnel in Warrandyte, and the Big and Little Peninsula Tunnels above Warburton. Widening and dams, like the Upper Yarra Reservoir have helped protect Melbourne from major flooding. The catchment&#x27;s upper reaches are also affected by logging. Industrialisation ultimately led to the destruction of the marshlands at the confluence of the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers in the area around Coode Island in West Melbourne.

Today, the Yarra mouth including Swanson and Appleton docks are used for container shipping by the Port of Melbourne, which is the busiest on the continent. The city reach which is inaccessible to larger watercrafts, has seen increased use for both transport and recreational boating (including kayaking, canoeing, rowing and swimming). In March 2019, it was reported that the river&#x27;s environmental health is at risk due to litter, pollution, pets and urban development.

The annual Moomba festival celebrates the Yarra River&#x27;s increasing cultural significance to Melbourne. Melbourne Water is the lead agency for implementing the Yarra Strategic Plan (Burndap Birrarung Burndap Unmarkoo) 2022-32. The plan gives effect to the community&#x27;s long-term vision for the Yarra and supports collaborative management of the river and its lands.

==Etymology==
The river was called &quot;Birrarung&quot; by the Kulin people who occupied the Yarra Valley and much of Central Victoria prior to European colonisation. The name &quot;Birrarung&quot; is derived from a Wurundjeri word meaning &#x27;river of mists&#x27;, as the area around the waterfall tended to get misty before nightfall.

At European arrival in 1835, Surveyor-General of the Colony of New South Wales John Helder Wedge of the Port Phillip Association visited the area with two Kulin People, who pointed at the flowing water and said &quot;yarra yarra&quot;, recorded in Wedge&#x27;s notebook as the phrase &quot;yarrow yarrow&quot;, in the mistaken belief that this was the name for the river in the Boonwurrung language.
 &quot;yarra yarra&quot; was instead what the Kulin people had referred to as the Yarra Yarra falls, which was later dynamited in 1883 as part of a series of extensive harbour improvements of the river, engineered by Sir John Coode. The word &quot;yarra&quot; translates to flowing water, Wedge later learnt of this and admitted he had mistaken the Kulin name for the falls, for the river itself, but by then the name had stuck.

On his first contact with local Wurunderi people in 1835, John Wedge wrote:

==Geology and formation==
Before 8000 BC, the Yarra River probably joined course with other present-day Port Phillip Bay tributaries such as the Patterson, Kororoit, Werribee, Little River, and drained directly through a narrow gap (what is now called the Rip) into a bay of the Great Australian Bight on the west side of a prehistoric land bridge called the &quot;Bassian Plain&quot; (which later became submerged into the Bass Strait). Between 8000 BC and 6000 BC, after the end of the most recent Ice Age, the rising sea level flooded the lower basin forming the shallow Port Phillip Bay, moving the Yarra river mouth over inland.

A dry period combined with sand bar formation may have dried out the Bay as recently as between 800 BC and 1000 AD, temporarily re-extending the Yarra south to Bass Strait during this period.

==History==

The area surrounding the Yarra River was first inhabited by the Boonwurrung and Wurundjeri peoples of the Kulin nation. The area has been occupied by various indigenous clans for at least 30,000 years. The river, known to the Wurundjeri people as Birrarung, was an important resource for the Wurundjeri people and several sites along the river and its tributaries were important meeting places where &quot;corroborees&quot; were held between Indigenous communities. The river&#x27;s resources were utilised sustainably by the Wurundjeri until the arrival of European colonists in the early-mid-19th century.

===European discovery and colonisation===
The first Europeans to sail up the river was a surveying party led by Charles Grimes, Acting Surveyor General of New South Wales, who in 1803 sailed upstream to Dights Falls, where they could no longer continue due to the nature of the terrain. European explorers would not enter the river for another 30 years until, in 1835, the area that is now central and northern Melbourne was explored by John Batman, a leading member of the Port Phillip Association, who negotiated a transaction for 600,000 acres (2,400 km2) of land from eight Wurundjeri elders. He selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that &quot;this will be the place for a village&quot;. The document, commonly called Batman&#x27;s Treaty, was declared void by the Governor of New South Wales, Richard Bourke.

The Port Phillip settlement, that would become Melbourne, was established along the lower banks of the Yarra in 1835. The new settlement&#x27;s main port was sited just downstream of Yarra Falls west of modern-day Queen&#x27;s Bridge, the place where saltwater met freshwater. Ships would use one side of the falls while the other side provided fresh drinking water for the town and a convenient sewer. In the city&#x27;s early days the Yarra was one of two major ports, the other being Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), but the Yarra was preferred due to the direct access to the town&#x27;s main streets and was the location of Customs House (now the Immigration Museum). Early industries grew along the banks of the river, rapidly degrading the water quality. Industries then began using the river and tributaries such as Merri Creek as landfill and for harmful chemical dumps for substances like grease and oils.

The disposal of sewerage in Melbourne was very basic in the early days. The majority of waste from homes and industries flowed into street channels and on to local rivers and creeks which became open sewers. The first City Baths were opened in 1860. The objective was to stop people bathing in the Yarra River, which by the 1850s had become quite polluted and the cause of an epidemic of typhoid fever, which hit the city resulting in many deaths. However, people continued to swim and drink the water until Melbourne&#x27;s fresh water was sourced from elsewhere.

The first permanent crossing over the river was Princes Bridge, which first opened as a wooden trestle bridge in 1844. The current bridge was constructed in 1888. In the early days, the river would frequently flood. While this was not considered a problem in the floodplains near Yarra Glen and Coldstream, the floodings caused much trouble further downstream in settlements such as Warrandyte, Templestowe, Bulleen, Heidelberg and Ivanhoe. The Upper Yarra Dam was later constructed to alleviate the flooding, protecting settlements along the river, yet depriving the river banks of soil and silt deposits and causing other problems such as erosion and salinity.

===Victorian gold rush===
Gold was first discovered in Victoria near the Yarra River in Warrandyte. The find was made by Louis Michel in 1851 at a tributary of the river, Andersons Creek and marked the start of the Victorian gold rush. The approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill in the Warrandyte State Park. The river was drained and diverted in various areas throughout the gold rush to aid gold miners. An example of this is the tunnel at Pound Bend in Warrandyte. The river was partially dammed at Pound Bend near Normans Reserve at its eastern entrance and near Bob&#x27;s wetlands at its western exit. Miners then blasted a 145m long tunnel through solid rock. The river was then fully dammed at the entrance and exit to the tunnel and water was diverted through 145m and out the other side leaving a 3.85 km of riverbed around Pound Bend exposed to the sun and the miners picks. Other diversions include The Island cutting in Warrandyte and the Little Peninsula Tunnel and Big Peninsula Tunnel near McMahons Creek.

The Gold Rush saw increased development in Melbourne and &quot;tent cities&quot; of new migrants lined the Yarra during the early years of the gold rush. In the 1840s a weir was built at Dights Falls to power a flour mill and to give some control over the river downstream from there. From the earliest years of settlement, the mid and upper reaches of the Yarra began to be used for recreation. The river was selected as the site for the Royal Botanic Gardens in 1846 and the course of the river was modified slightly for the creation of a feature lake. Further upstream, the Cremorne Gardens were established in 1853.

===Industrialisation===
Sections of the river mouth and the area around the former West Melbourne Swamp were widened in the late 19th century, to make way for docks, harbours, bridges and other infrastructure. The increasing industrialisation of the river and the growth of the shipping industry saw the need for major infrastructure works which dramatically changed the course of the river in its lower reaches. The creation of new shipping channels to cope with the growing use of the Yarra by cargo ships was first tabled in the 1870s.

The first major change came with the cutting of the Coode Canal between 1880 and 1886. This major infrastructure project created an island which was known as Coode Island, named after the British consultant engineer engaged to design the works, Sir John Coode. This also included widening and deepening, and in some cases, vast areas of land were excavated, such as Victoria Dock, in order to give ease of access for cargo and later container ships. Abattoirs, smelters and even mortuaries were to use the river as a means of waste disposal in its lower reaches. This industrialisation also led to a steady deterioration in water quality during the 19th century and into the 20th. In 1891, the great flood caused the Yarra to swell to in width.

Initially known as &quot;West Melbourne Dock&quot;, over of material was excavated and a new dock was eventually opened in 1892, the material that was removed was subsequently used to fill in part of the West Melbourne Swamp, it took 6 days for water from the Yarra River to fill the dock. The dock was later renamed Victoria Dock. In 1910, the main channel was widened and deepened (). In 1916, the central pier at Victoria Dock was completed which provided 6 additional shipping berths and cargo sheds and creating a distinctive landmark for Melbourne ports. By 1942, 650m of the old course of the Yarra River at Coode Island had been filled in, by the 1950s it had been completely filled and land parcels were allocated including a site for the new Fish Markets.

In 1957, the Upper Yarra Reservoir was constructed, primarily to alleviate flooding downstream. This reduced the river&#x27;s flow to around 50%, where it sits today. Swanson Dock was constructed between 1966 and 1972 equipped for modern container shipping. Shipping activity at Victoria Dock during this time had gone into steep decline and it was almost disused by the mid-1970s. In February 1972, the CBD was flooded as the natural watercourse of Elizabeth Street became a raging torrent. This was due mostly to previous storm water drainage works which utilised Elizabeth street as a watercourse during times of intense rain creating flash floods. Prior to settlements, the area now occupied by Elizabeth street was a gully off the river.

===Recent history===


By the 1960s there was a growing awareness of the neglect of the Yarra amongst some residents of Melbourne, spawning various community groups and &quot;friends of...&quot; organisations to protect the remnants of the river&#x27;s ecology. Through the 1970s and 1980s, many desirable developments alongside the river began, such as the Victorian Arts Centre, as its lower courses progressively became gentrified. Growing high density residential development in the lower reaches in the early 1990s coincided with minor government programs such as the installation of litter traps. The riverside apartment complex Como Centre at South Yarra and the larger urban renewal of the formerly industrial Southbank precinct were both built during the late 1990s. During this era it was also commonplace for the winner of the Australian Open to bathe in the Yarra River as a post victory celebration. On the southern side of the river near exists a number of university and private school rowing clubs who use the river for recreational sports.

Around 2000, the river became a focus of major government projects. Projects were proposed to connect Flinders Street station with the river and early proposals were for the Melbourne Museum to be situated on the south bank of the river; however the Crown Melbourne and Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre were built in its place. The Melbourne Docklands urban renewal project began in 2000, comprising mixed use residential and commercial land and recreational boating moors along the river at the disused Victoria Dock and on the south bank of the Yarra. Federation Square was proposed to connect the spine of Melbourne to the Yarra at Federation Wharf and a neighbouring park, Birrarung Marr was also built along the north bank, creating renewed interest in connecting city workers to the river. New ferry services and water taxis sprang up along the city reach, servicing as far up river as South Yarra and out to Hobsons Bay.

In 2008, dredging began to deepen the mouth of the Yarra to enable large container ships to reach the Port of Melbourne. The project was controversial and strict regulations were enacted. It was feared that dredging would disturb heavy metals and other toxic sediments mostly deposited during Melbourne&#x27;s industrial era. The project was completed in November 2009.

==Pollution and environmental issues==
The Yarra River was an important resource for the Wurundjeri people for around 40,000 years. The river&#x27;s resources were utilised sustainably by the Wurundjeri until European settlement in the early-mid-19th century. Early industry located along the river contributed great amounts of pollution such as dangerous chemicals, grease, oil and heavy metals. Through the mid-20th century, industry was slowly relocated away from the river and since then the major pollutants have come from storm water runoff, sewerage and lasting effects of previous pollution. Gold mining cleared small areas of land of vegetation and for periods of time, drained sections of the river; however, when compared to land clearing and industrial pollutants, the effects of gold mining on the river were quite low.

Heavy metals deposited into the river throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries settled to the bottom of the river bed, particularly in the lower reaches through the city and Port Melbourne, and due to the increased artificial depth of the river through here, heavy metals have not been carried further, although some have been deposited out into Port Phillip. Oils and grease remain today in several tributaries in the lower reaches such as Merri Creek and Moonee Ponds Creek.

===Pollution===
Levels of bacteria, particularly E. coli and substances like grease, oils and heavy metals in the Yarra River and its tributaries are a major problem.

High levels of E. coli, some up to 200 times the safe limit in its tributaries, are caused primarily by poorly maintained septic systems.

Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the Yarra catchment storm water runoff every day, these serve as just a small representation of the rubbish and litter that are disposed of in storm water runoff areas that eventually make their way into the river and consequently, the sea.

Some industrial companies continue to use the Yarra as a dumping ground. For example, in recent years paper company Amcor has been fined several times by EPA Victoria for polluting the Yarra and environs. In 2007 it was fined 5,000 for discharging paper pulp into the Yarra from its Alphington plant and in 2008 the company was convicted for releasing oil into the Yarra from its Alphington plant and fined A$80,000.

Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution, mostly organised by community groups, EPA Victoria and local councils.

In 2015, a facility for washing down cars and chemical containers illegally leaked toxic chemicals and herbicides into Yarra River, killing trees and endangering public safety. The facility was situated inside Warrandyte State Park, from where the spillover until June 2015 flowed into the river and downstream towards Melbourne.

Between 2014 and 2017, 1.3 million cigarette butts and 179 tonnes of litter were pulled out from the River.

===Lack of flooding===
Due to damming and the lack of natural flooding, much of the surrounding vegetation is lacking in the silt and soil deposits that would otherwise be provided by the floods. The construction of the Upper Yarra Reservoir in 1957 reduced the river&#x27;s flow by around 50%. This has ultimately led to a lack of healthy understory and saplings, or a lack of saplings completely, which contributes to problems such as reduced habitat, erosion and salinity, issues that ironically affect surrounding agriculture.

===Water colour===

The Yarra River is colloquially known as &quot;the upside down river&quot;, for its golden hue. The muddy brown colour is caused by the easily eroded clay soils of its catchment area. The water was clear at the time of the first European settlements, but intensive land clearing and development since the mid-19th century has resulted in the presence of microscopic clay particles. The particles are kept suspended by the turbulence in some parts of the middle and lower sections of the river. When the river water combines with marine salts as it enters Port Phillip, the suspended particles clump together and sink. The presence of clay particles is not a major factor in the pollution of the river.

===Environmental advocacy===
The Yarra Riverkeeper Association is the largest of many advocacy groups dedicated to protecting the Yarra River and its environs for current and future generations. They are part of the global Waterkeeper Alliance movement and have been involved in forums and discussions pushing for policies to ensure that &quot;the voice&quot; of the river is heard. The Yarra Riverkeeper Association or YRKA for short view the Yarra River as Melbourne&#x27;s greatest natural asset and educate that its preservation and restoration is vital in helping Melbourne become a sustainable city. Since its establishment in 2004, YRKA has delivered hundreds of presentations and lectures, been in over 200 media appearances and provide on-water inspection tours to over 200 community leaders, business leaders, and politicians. It has had successful campaigns in pushing for great environmental flows and in 2010 the Riverkeeper Ian Penrose was awarded the 2010 Melbourne Award for contribution to the environment.

==Geography==

The Yarra River has a detailed and complex geological history, see &quot;Geology&quot;. It was utilised and managed sustainably by the Wurundjeri for around 40,000 years; however, since the European settlement and use of the river in the mid-19th century, its geography has changed substantially reflecting the unsustainable use of the river and surrounding resources. The river is fed by a number of small unnamed creeks and streams in the Yarra Ranges as well as 49 named tributaries, most of which are creeks. The river&#x27;s lower reaches travel through central Melbourne. It is approximately in length, with a mean annual flow of , which is roughly 50% its original flow prior to damming. It is the most westerly snow fed river in Australia. The total catchment area is approximately .

===Tributaries and geographic features===

The Yarra&#x27;s major tributaries are the Maribyrnong River, Moonee Ponds Creek, Merri Creek, Darebin Creek, Plenty River, Mullum Mullum Creek and Olinda Creek. The river hosts many geographical features such as; bends, rapids, lakes, islands, floodplains, billabongs and wetlands. Most features have been named after translated Wurundjeri phrases or have European, particularly British, origins. Some of the river&#x27;s more prominent features include; Coode Island and Fishermans Bend, Victoria Harbour, Herring Island, Yarra Bend, Dights Falls, Upper Yarra Dam and Reservoir and many river flats and billabongs.

==Marine ecology==
The river is home to several species of fish. In the lower reaches of the Yarra mainly southern black bream and jellyfish and in the upper reaches smaller quantities of European perch (redfin), Macquarie perch, brown trout, Murray cod and freshwater catfish. However almost all of the fish are contaminated with heavy metals including arsenic and not fit for human consumption. Dolphins have been known to venture upstream as far as South Yarra, and serve as an example of the increased salinity of the river&#x27;s lower reaches. Platypus are rarely seen as far downstream as Fairfield.

==Course==

===Upper reaches===

The river&#x27;s source is a series of swamps in the upper reaches of the Yarra Ranges National Park, directly to the west of the Mount Baw Baw plateau, a thickly forested subalpine park, which is entirely closed-off to all except the employees of Melbourne Water. The park features extensive stands of mountain ash, a very tall eucalypt, tree ferns, as well as patches of remnant rainforest.

The Upper Yarra Dam, one of a number of dams in the Yarra Catchment that supply a large part of Melbourne&#x27;s water, is the furthest upstream point on the river visible to the general public (though the dam itself is closed off). The first settlement the still-young river passes through is the small town of Reefton, but most of the river is surrounded by hills covered temperate forest until the timber and resort town of Warburton. The Woods Point Road follows the river through this section.

Downstream of Warburton, the Yarra Valley gradually opens out and farms begin to appear, including beef and dairy farms, and by the town of Woori Yallock and the river&#x27;s turn north, increasingly large areas are covered by vineyards, forming the Yarra Valley wine region. At Healesville, the river turns west again and the stream bed becomes increasingly silty, reducing the clarity of the water, and by the commuter town of Yarra Glen it begins to take on the brownish colour that the lower reaches are known for.

===Middle reaches===
The river enters Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs proper at Chirnside Park, but virtually all the river&#x27;s length is surrounded by parkland, much retaining (or having been replanted with) extensive native vegetation. A bicycle and walking trail known as the Main Yarra Trail begins at Warrandyte and becomes the Yarra River Trail, and in the lower reaches, the Capital City Trail. The river is used extensively for kayaking at Templestowe, and canoes can often be seen throughout the suburban section. Whilst the water is not particularly clear, its quality is sufficient for edible fish to swim within it. Some small hobby farms are located in the floodplain area of the river, surprisingly close to central Melbourne and almost completely surrounded by suburbs.

Heidelberg formed the home of the Heidelberg School, widely considered the first European painters to accurately capture the Australian landscape and its distinctive features. The walking trail features placards displaying some of their paintings at the settings they were actually painted; some features depicted remain clearly recognisable today.

===Lower reaches===
Below Dights Falls at Yarra Bend Park in inner Melbourne, the river becomes increasingly estuarine as it passes along the southern side of the central business district. This area forms the venue for the annual &quot;Moomba&quot; festival, which notably features an annual water skiing competition which attracts a huge crowd. The lower stretch of the river from Docklands to the Melbourne Cricket Ground was part of the final path of the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Many of Melbourne&#x27;s private schools, located close to the river, train their rowing crews on it.

The lower reaches feature a number of boat cruises, using especially low-roof boats to go under the many bridges across this section of the Yarra. Herring Island is a small island at South Yarra which has a punt which takes people on to the park. The area in front of old Customs House is a former turning basin for ships. It is the point which was once known as &quot;Freshwater Place&quot; and once had a set of cascades which prevented both salt water and larger ships from going further upstream. This series of rocks, originally used to cross the river, and referred to as the &quot;Yarra Falls&quot; was removed using explosives and divers in 1883.

The final section passes through the Port of Melbourne and under the Bolte Bridge and the West Gate Bridge. The current course dates back to 1886 when a canal devised by British engineer Sir John Coode was cut from west of Flinders Street to below its junction with the Maribyrnong. The resulting island between the new and old courses of the river was named Coode Island, and is now part of the mainland with the former course to the north filled in. The river flows into Port Phillip, the site being extensively altered as part of the Port of Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s busiest seaport.

==Crossings==

Since the first permanent crossing was built over the river in 1844, there are now over 60 places where pedestrians, cars and other vehicles can cross the river. As the river is never wider than around 350m and is on average only around 50m wide, most of the crossings are located in the suburbs of Greater Melbourne. While there are fewer crossings towards the mouth of the river, most notably the West Gate, Bolte and Princes Bridges, and the Burnley and Domain Tunnels. Small historical bridges can be found further downstream including the Banksia Street, Fitzsimons Lane and Warrandyte Bridges. Beyond Warburton there are very few crossings available. Some of the more prominent and historical crossings include;
*West Gate Bridge – 1978
*Bolte Bridge – 1999
*Sandridge Bridge – 1888
*Princes Bridge – 1844, 1850, 1888
*CityLink Tunnels – 1997
*Morell Bridge – 1899
*Johnston Street Bridge – 1858
*Warrandyte Bridge – 1861, 1952

==Parklands==


Several reserves have been set aside adjoining the Yarra, mostly to preserve the natural environment or for recreation, many of these are managed and operated by Parks Victoria, the state government agency responsible for the management of Victoria&#x27;s national parks and other reserves. The largest and most notable of these parklands include: the Royal Botanic Gardens, Birrarung Marr, Yarra Bend Park, Westerfolds Park, Warrandyte State Park and the Yarra Ranges National Park.

===Major parks===
Some of the larger parklands adjoining the river include, from downstream to upstream:
* Birrarung Marr
* Royal Botanic Gardens
* Yarra Bend Park
* Westerfolds Park
* Warrandyte State Park
* Yarra Ranges National Park

===Golf courses===
There are 14 golf courses adjoining the river, these include, from downstream to upstream:
* Burnley Golf Course (9)
* Studley Park Golf Course (9)
* Yarra Bend Public Golf Course (18)
* Latrobe Golf Course (18)
* Green Acres Golf Club (18)
* Kew Golf Club (18)

* Bulleen Driving Range
* Rosanna Golf Club (18)
* The Heritage Golf and Country Club
:* Henly Course (18)
:* St. John Course (18)
* Warburton Golf Club (18)

==Popular culture==
The Yarra is considered an important part of Melbourne&#x27;s culture and a symbol of the city, and as a result, it has been the source of artistic and cultural expression.
*The Yarra has been captured in many famous paintings including some by the Heidelberg School.
*The annual Moomba festival celebrates the Yarra River&#x27;s increasing cultural significance to Melbourne.
*The river has featured in songs by the Whirling Furphies, titled &quot;My Brown Yarra&quot;, and the Coodabeen Champions, titled &quot;By the Banks of the Yarra&quot;.
*A poem entitled &quot;Yara Yara&quot; was written by Greek poet Nikos Kavvadias in 1951.
*A song entitled The Yarra Song was written by Billy Bragg and included on the Australian edition of his 2002 album, &quot;England, Half English.&quot;

==Recreational use==

Throughout its length, the waters of the Yarra River and its banks are used for; boating, rowing, water skiing, kayaking, canoeing, swimming, fishing, cycling, running and walking, amongst other things. In the rivers upper reaches, fishing is most popular. Upstream of Launching Place the river becomes quite narrow and recreational use is limited. In the middle reaches, canoeing and kayaking is popular, there are a few rapids of easy to medium difficulty depending on the water level.

Swimming is also popular in the middle reaches throughout winter, particularly around Warrandyte. Around this area there are submerged mining shafts which can cause undertows that suck swimmers under the surface and into these shafts. In the period 2004–08, 3 people died in this manner in Warrandyte alone. Swimming is safer downstream, but not advisable below Dights Falls due to the high levels of pollution and high boating traffic. The Yarra River once held the world&#x27;s largest swimming event, the Race to Prince&#x27;s Bridge. The course ran in the lower reaches, from Twickenham Ferry (now MacRobertson Bridge) to Princes Bridge. The race often attracted greater than 500 competitors and large numbers of onlookers seeking to experience the spectacle.

In the lower reaches, the river is mostly used for rowing, there are several rowing sheds along the city stretch east of the Princes Bridge and many private schools have rowing clubs with sheds and berths on the river. At certain times of the year, particularly during the Moomba Festival, this stretch of the river is occupied by water skiing courses and jumps. The banks of the Yarra River are popular for cycling, running and walking where most paths are sealed and in good condition. Two major off-road, sealed trails, the Yarra River Trail and Capital City Trail follow the river on its course through the city, while part of the Bayside Trail also connects with the river.

The river is also popular for boating, in the residential suburb of Toorak some of the larger mansions have private boat moorings, whilst newer developments in Melbourne Docklands have larger marinas as does Pier 31 at Fisherman&#x27;s Bend and Newport and Williamstown at the river&#x27;s mouth. Boating is difficult beyond Hawthorn and impossible past Dights Falls. It is mostly concentrated in central Melbourne where cruises go up and down the river and ferries operate.

=== Navigation ===
The river can be used by any member of the public provided they abide by the rules of Parks Victoria who administer the river upstream of Bolte Bridge and the Port of Melbourne Corporation who administer the area downstream of Bolte Bridge. There is a maximum speed limit of for all boats operating on the river upstream from Bolte Bridge. Sections of the river are occasionally closed for public events such as Moomba, New Year&#x27;s Eve and Rowing events.

The river is navigable by most boats from its entrance in Hobsons Bay to Dights Falls, a stretch of , and is subject to tidal variations and submerged objects. There are four bridges on the Yarra River with limited height clearances at high tide:
* Charles Grimes Bridge – 
* Spencer Street Bridge – (can be less than at extreme high tides – once a month)
* Kings Bridge – 
* Queens Bridge –

<text>Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its &quot;conclusion&quot; must be false. It is also called argument to logic (argumentum ad logicam), the fallacy fallacy, the fallacist&#x27;s fallacy, and the bad reasons fallacy.

==Form==
An argument from fallacy has the following general argument form:

Thus, it is a special case of denying the antecedent where the antecedent, rather than being a proposition that is false, is an entire argument that is fallacious. A fallacious argument, just as with a false antecedent, can still have a consequent that happens to be true. The fallacy is in concluding the consequent of a fallacious argument has to be false.

That the argument is fallacious only means that the argument cannot succeed in proving its consequent. But showing how one argument in a complex thesis is fallaciously reasoned does not necessarily invalidate its conclusion if that conclusion is not dependent on the fallacy.

==Examples==


Both of Bob&#x27;s rebuttals are arguments from fallacy. Ginger may or may not be a cat, and Alice may or may not be English. The fact that Alice&#x27;s argument was fallacious is not, in itself, proof that her conclusion is false.

That one can invoke the argument from fallacy against a position does not prove one&#x27;s own position either, as this would also be an argument from fallacy, as is the case in Charlie&#x27;s argument.

==Further==
&quot;Argumentum ad logicam&quot; can be used as an &quot;ad hominem&quot; appeal: by impugning the opponent&#x27;s credibility or good faith, it can be used to sway the audience by undermining the speaker rather than by addressing the speaker&#x27;s argument.

William Lycan identifies the fallacy fallacy as the fallacy &quot;of imputing fallaciousness to a view with which one disagrees but without doing anything to show that the view rests on any error of reasoning&quot;. Unlike ordinary fallacy fallacies, which reason from an argument&#x27;s fallaciousness to its conclusion&#x27;s falsehood, the kind of argument Lycan has in mind treats another argument&#x27;s fallaciousness as obvious without first demonstrating that any fallacy at all is present. Thus in some contexts it may be a form of begging the question, and it is also a special case of ad lapidem.

<text>In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as (1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus and; (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as &quot;wrist joints&quot;. This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, bracelet lines, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum.

As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist.

== Structure==
The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is a pivot joint located between the distal ends of the radius and ulna, which make up the forearm. Formed by the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of the radius, the DRUJ is separated from the radiocarpal (wrist) joint by an articular disk lying between the radius and the styloid process of the ulna. The capsule of the joint is lax and extends from the inferior sacciform recess to the ulnar shaft. The DRUJ works with the proximal radioulnar joint (at the elbow) for pronation and supination.

The radiocarpal (wrist) joint is an ellipsoid joint formed by the radius and the articular disc proximally and the proximal row of carpal bones distally. The carpal bones on the ulnar side only make intermittent contact with the proximal side — the triquetrum only makes contact during ulnar abduction. The capsule, lax and un-branched, is thin on the dorsal side and can contain synovial folds. The capsule is continuous with the midcarpal joint and strengthened by numerous ligaments, including the palmar and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments, and the ulnar and radial collateral ligaments.
The parts forming the radiocarpal joint are the lower end of the radius and under surface of the articular disk above; and the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral bones below. The articular surface of the radius and the undersurface of the articular disk form together with a transversely elliptical concave surface, the receiving cavity. The superior articular surfaces of the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum form a smooth convex surface, the condyle, which is received into the concavity.

Carpal bones of the hand: 
* &quot;Proximal:&quot; A=Scaphoid, B=Lunate, C=Triquetrum, D=Pisiform
* &quot;Distal:&quot; E=Trapezium, F=Trapezoid, G=Capitate, H=Hamate

In the hand proper a total of 13 bones form part of the wrist: eight carpal bones—scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate— and five metacarpal bones—the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metacarpal bones.

The midcarpal joint is the S-shaped joint space separating the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones. The intercarpal joints, between the bones of each row, are strengthened by the radiate carpal and pisohamate ligaments and the palmar, interosseous, and dorsal intercarpal ligaments. Some degree of mobility is possible between the bones of the proximal row while the bones of the distal row are connected to each other and to the metacarpal bones —at the carpometacarpal joints— by strong ligaments —the pisometacarpal and palmar and dorsal carpometacarpal ligament— that makes a functional entity of these bones. Additionally, the joints between the bases of the metacarpal bones —the intermetacarpal articulations— are strengthened by dorsal, interosseous, and palmar intermetacarpal ligaments.

The earliest carpal bones to ossify are capitate bone and hamate bone in the first six months of an infant life.

=== Articulations ===
The radiocarpal, intercarpal, midcarpal, carpometacarpal, and intermetacarpal joints often intercommunicate through a common synovial cavity.
==== Articular surfaces ====
It has two articular surfaces named, proximal and distal articular surfaces respectively. The proximal articular surface is made up of the lower end of the radius and a triangular articular disc of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. On the other hand, the distal articular surface is made up of proximal surfaces of the scaphoid, triquetral and lunate bones.

== Function ==

===Movement===
The extrinsic hand muscles are located in the forearm where their bellies form the proximal fleshy roundness. When contracted, most of the tendons of these muscles are prevented from standing up like taut bowstrings around the wrist by passing under the flexor retinaculum on the palmar side and the extensor retinaculum on the dorsal side. On the palmar side the carpal bones form the carpal tunnel, through which some of the flexor tendons pass in tendon sheaths that enable them to slide back and forth through the narrow passageway (see carpal tunnel syndrome).

Starting from the mid-position of the hand, the movements permitted in the wrist proper are (muscles in order of importance):

* Marginal movements: radial deviation (abduction, movement towards the thumb) and ulnar deviation (adduction, movement towards the little finger). These movements take place about a dorsopalmar axis (back to front) at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints passing through the capitate bone.
** Radial abduction (up to 20°): extensor carpi radialis longus, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis longus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor pollicis longus
** Ulnar adduction (up to 30°): extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi
* Movements in the plane of the hand: flexion (palmar flexion, tilting towards the palm) and extension (dorsiflexion, tilting towards the back of the hand). These movements take place through a transverse axis passing through the capitate bone. Palmar flexion is the most powerful of these movements because the flexors, especially the finger flexors, are considerably stronger than the extensors.

* Extension (up to 60°): extensor digitorum, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor indicis, extensor pollicis longus, extensor digiti minimi, extensor carpi ulnaris
* Palmar flexion (up to 70°): flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor pollicis longus, flexor carpi radialis, abductor pollicis longus
* Intermediate or combined movements

However, movements at the wrist can not be properly described without including movements in the distal radioulnar joint in which the rotary actions of supination and pronation occur and this joint is therefore normally regarded as part of the wrist.

==Clinical significance==

Wrist pain has a number of causes, including carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglion cyst, tendinitis, and osteoarthritis. Tests such as Phalen&#x27;s test involve palmarflexion at the wrist.

The hand may deviate at the wrist in some conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Ossification of the bones around the wrist is one indicator used in taking a bone age.

A wrist fracture typically refers to a distal radius fracture. It is more common in non-Hispanic women and is associated with factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking, high serum phosphate levels, osteoporosis, and obesity.

==History==

===Etymology===
The English word &quot;&quot; is etymologically derived from the Proto-Germanic word &quot;wristiz&quot; from which are derived modern German &quot;Rist&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;wrist&quot;) and modern Swedish &quot;&quot; (&quot;instep&quot;, &quot;&quot;). The base &quot;writh-&quot; and its variants are associated with Old English words &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The &quot;wr-&quot; sound of this base seems originally to have been symbolic of the action of twisting.

<text>D.C. United is an American professional soccer club based in Washington, D.C. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. Domestically, the club has won four MLS Cups (league championships), four Supporters&#x27; Shields (league regular season), three U.S. Open Cups (domestic cups), and six Eastern Conference championships. In international competitions, the club has one CONCACAF Champions Cup title and one Copa Interamericana, the only United States team to win the latter. In terms of trophies won, it is the joint-most successful overall club in American soccer (tied with the New York Cosmos and LA Galaxy).

Founded in 1994, the club was an inaugural franchise in Major League Soccer, playing in the league since its first season in 1996. The club played a majority of its matches at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium from 1996 until 2017 before moving to the soccer-specific stadium, Audi Field, in 2018, where it has played since. D.C. United was one of the premier franchises in Major League Soccer, and in American soccer in the late 1990s, where it won the bulk of its trophies. Players such as Raúl Díaz Arce, Marco Etcheverry, Roy Lassiter, Jaime Moreno, Ben Olsen, and Eddie Pope, along with head coach, Bruce Arena, helped the club win eight of their 12 major titles from 1996 through 2000. The club would win an MLS Cup, a U.S. Open Cup, and two Supporters&#x27; Shield titles under Piotr Nowak and Tom Soehn in the mid-to-late 2000s. In 2013, under the management of Ben Olsen, the club won the U.S. Open Cup, its most recent major trophy.

Throughout the 2010s, and into the early 2020s, the club managed by Ben Olsen, went through mediocrity, with only one major trophy, and several missed playoff appearances, including two last place finishes in the league. During this time, some high-profile acquisitions joined United, including Wayne Rooney, and several homegrown players began making impacts on the United squad including Bill Hamid, Andy Najar, and Kevin Paredes. After a string of poor seasons, Olsen was fired in 2020, after a ten-year tenure as head coach. Olsen was replaced by Hernán Losada, who managed the club until 2022, when he was replaced by former player Wayne Rooney. Rooney was fired in October 2023 after a poor managerial effort, and was replaced in January 2024 with former New York Red Bulls manager Troy Lesesne who manages the club as of May 2024.

==History==

Before the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the United States Soccer Federation fulfilled its promise to FIFA by aiding in the foundation of a new professional league, which would become Major League Soccer (MLS). On June 15, 1994, MLS selected Washington, D.C. out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the league&#x27;s first seven franchises, with three more added before the league&#x27;s launch. The team&#x27;s name was chosen as a reflection of the names of European clubs, such as Manchester United or Leeds United, as well as being the capital of the United States.

The team&#x27;s colors and original logo, along with those of the other ten original teams, were announced in October 1995, during a presentation in New York City. Black and white were announced D.C. United&#x27;s primary colors, and red was announced as the club&#x27;s secondary color.

=== Early years and dynasty (1996–1999) ===

The club&#x27;s first season was in 1996. Ahead of the season, United hired Bruce Arena, who had led the University of Virginia men&#x27;s soccer program to five NCAA College Cup titles, to be the head coach of the club. Under Arena, the club quickly established itself as one of the flagship franchises in MLS, winning two MLS Cup (league championship) titles, a U.S. Open Cup (domestic cup) title, a Supporters&#x27; Shield (regular season winner), a CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (continental championship), and a Copa Interamericana (intercontinental championship) all within the club&#x27;s first two seasons. During this late 1990&#x27;s dynasty, the club was led by its &quot;magic triangle&quot; of Jaime Moreno, Marco Etcheverry, and Raul Diaz Arce. Additionally, the club had several U.S. international stars at the time including Eddie Pope, John Harkes, and Jeff Agoos. United&#x27;s inaugural match was played on April 6, 1996, against the then-called San Jose Clash (now Earthquakes) at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California, which also was the first match to ever be played in MLS history. United would lose the match to the Clash, 0–1 off a late match-winner by Eric Wynalda. However, the season was hallmarked by the Arena leading the team to the first domestic double in modern U.S. soccer history by beating the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first MLS Cup and the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the USL First Division in the 1996 U.S. Open Cup. The club&#x27;s early success continued into 1997, repeating as MLS Cup champions, and winning their first Supporters&#x27; Shield, becoming the first club in MLS history to achieve the &quot;league double&quot; by winning both the regular season championship and league championship.

In 1998 the club won the Eastern Conference regular season and postseason championship, but finished runners-up for the Supporters&#x27; Shield, and lost to Chicago Fire in MLS Cup 1998. Despite not winning any domestic titles, the club managed to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (now known as the CONCACAF Champions League), defeating Mexican side, Toluca, in the final thanks to a Pope goal, as well as winning the now-defunct Copa Interamericana (a two-legged aggregate series between the CONCACAF and CONMEBOL club champions). D.C. United became the first American club to win a CONCACAF club championship, and the only American club to have won the Copa Interamericana. As of 2022, only two other American clubs have won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup or Champions League (LA Galaxy in 2000 and Seattle Sounders in 2022).

In October 1998, Arena left D.C. United to accept the head coaching role for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, following their poor performance in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Dutch manager, Thomas Rongen, who had previously coached the New England Revolution was hired to coach United for the 1999 season. With the squad, largely constructed by Arena, United achieved a domestic double, winning MLS Cup 1999 (their third MLS Cup title) against their cross-country rivals, the Los Angeles Galaxy, a rematch of MLS Cup 1996, and winning their second Supporters&#x27; Shield title (off of 57 points). Striker Roy Lassiter led United with 18 goals during the season earning joint Golden Boot honors. United did not fare as well in the 1999 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, losing in the semifinals to eventual champions, Necaxa.

=== Playoff failures (2000–2003) ===

Ultimately, Arena&#x27;s departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team&#x27;s fortunes. After reaching MLS Cup for the club&#x27;s first four seasons, the 2000 season saw the club lose nine of their first twelve matches. United ultimately finished in 11th out of 12 teams in MLS during the 2000 season, missing the 2000 MLS Cup Playoffs altogether, for the first time in franchise history. Outside of MLS play, the club suffered early exits in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, losing in the semifinals to eventual champions, the LA Galaxy, and being knocked out in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Cup by eventual finalists, Miami Fusion.

During the 2001 season, United played in the CONCACAF Giants Cup which was held in March 2001, prior to the start of the MLS regular season. United reached the finals of the Giants Cup, beating Jamaican club, Arnett Gardens, and Guatemalan club, Comunicaciones in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, before losing to Mexican club, América, in the final. During the 2001 MLS regular season United once again, finished in last place in the Eastern Conference and 11 points outside of the playoff picture. Although the offense led by Abdul Thompson Conteh, and Jamie Moreno contributed to 42 goals on the season, the porous United defense let in 50 goals the second worst in the East. The season however, was truncated by three weeks due to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Following the 2001 season, club management decided to fire Rongen, and replace him with English manager Ray Hudson, who had just coached the Miami Fusion to a Supporters&#x27; Shield title.

Hudson signed a two-season contract with United and began the 2002 season participating in the 2002 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, due to their performance in the previous years&#x27; Giants Cup. United suffered their worst loss in CONCACAF play, losing by a four-goal margin to Comunicaciones, a club they had beat the previous year in the Giants Cup. United won the return leg, but by too little of a margin to advance. Their fortunes during the regular season did not fare better than the previous two seasons, where United ultimately finished last in the MLS regular season overall table, their first Wooden Spoon finish in franchise history, and their worst season until 2010. United scored only 31 goals during the season, last in MLS, where Ali Curtis and Bobby Convey were joint top scorers with the club, with only five goals each. However, the season showed signs of promising young talent with then-17 year old, Santino Quaranta, having a breakout season with United, and Nick Rimando, who became the club&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper for the next five years.

Ahead of the 2003 season, United received the first overall draft pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, where they selected University of Virginia standout, Alecko Eskandarian. Additionally, United brought in MLS veterans, Dema Kovalenko and Hristo Stoichkov, from Chicago Fire. After a slow start to the season taking eight matches to win, United gained momentum during the latter half of the season, going 8–5–5 to close out the season. The form allowed United to qualify for the playoffs as the final seed, giving United their first playoff berth since 1999. Despite the berth, United was blanked by Shield winners Chicago Fire 4–0 on aggregate. At the conclusion of the season, despite signs of promise, Hudson was released by D.C. United and Polish manager, Piotr Nowak, replaced him before the start of the 2004 season.

=== Nowak era, return to success (2004–2006) ===

The club&#x27;s first season under Nowak was marred by injuries in the early going, and some players were known to have complained about Nowak&#x27;s methods. During Nowak&#x27;s tenue, United selected Freddy Adu, a 14-year-old soccer prodigy, in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. When Adu entered United&#x27;s regular-season opener as a second-half substitute on April 3, 2004, he became the youngest player in any professional sport in the United States since 1887. That season, Adu, along with the likes of Christian Gómez, Moreno, and Brian Carroll, helped to propel United into the playoffs as the second seed in the East. There they advanced past the New England Revolution in the Eastern Conference Final on penalty kicks in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history. United then defeated the Kansas City Wizards to win MLS Cup 2004, their fourth, and as of 2022, their most recent MLS Cup title. 

Following their 2004 MLS Cup triumph, the club spent the next four seasons as one of the top clubs in MLS. In 2005, the club again made MLS history by becoming the first United States–based team to participate in Copa Sudamericana, entering in the Round of sixteen. In 2006, the MLS All-Star Team, which included eight United players, was managed by United&#x27;s manager Piotr Nowak, defeated English champions Chelsea. In 2006 United won their third consecutive Supporters&#x27; Shield title.

=== Soehn era, U.S. Open Cup title (2007–2009) ===

Nowak left United as head coach to become an assistant under Bob Bradley with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. Nowak was replaced by his assistant Tom Soehn, who coached the club starting in 2007. The 2007 squad, largely built by Nowak, had a historically successful regular season in MLS. Led by the likes of Luciano Emilio, Fred, Ben Olsen, and Christian Gómez, United finished the regular season atop the MLS table, winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield for a then-MLS record fourth time, and for the second consecutive season. Finishing the season with 55 points in 30 games, United set a club record in points per game (1.8), and lead the league in total goals (56). It was the first time in MLS history a franchise won the Shield in consecutive seasons. Outside of MLS play during the 2007 season, the club participated in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, reaching the semifinals; the Copa Sudamericana, being eliminated in the opening round; the North American SuperLiga, reaching the quarterfinals; and the U.S. Open Cup, being eliminated in the third round. In September 2007, Dave Kasper was promoted from the club&#x27;s Technical Director to the team&#x27;s General Manager, which as of 2022, is a position he still holds.

Following the 2007 season, the club failed to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs for five consecutive seasons. During this stretch, United&#x27;s lone major title came in 2008, when they won the U.S. Open Cup. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the tail-end of each season, ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs. Following the end of the 2009 campaign, Soehn resigned as head coach of United, thus ending the Sohen era with two major titles in three seasons. To date, Soehn is the most recent manager at United to win two or more major titles during their tenure as head coach.

=== Olsen era (2010–2020) ===

Following Soehn&#x27;s replacement, the organization hired Curt Onalfo as the head coach. United had approached then University of Akron men&#x27;s soccer head coach, Caleb Porter, but Porter rejected their offer. Recently retired club midfielder, Ben Olsen, joined Onalfo&#x27;s staff as an assistant coach, along with Kris Kelderman, who served as an assistant to Onfalo at Kansas City. Additionally, Soehn&#x27;s assistant coaches of Chad Ashton and Mark Simpson remained on Onalfo&#x27;s coaching staff for the 2010 season. Ahead of the season the club saw the departures of Luciano Emilio and Fred, two key contributors to the club during the late 2000s. The club, marred by injuries, and poor tactics, had a historically poor start to the 2010 MLS season, having a record of 3–12–3 in the clubs first 16 matches.

In August 2010, United fired Onalfo and named Ben Olsen as the club&#x27;s interim manager for the remainder of the 2010 season. The club would finish the season out with a 3–8–1 record, finishing with a historically poor 6–20–4 record, the worst in MLS during the 2010 season. During the 2010 season, the highlights of the season included the rise of two homegrown signings, Bill Hamid, who took over as starting goalkeeper to Troy Perkins during the season, and became the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper throughout the 2010s, along with Andy Najar, who won the MLS Rookie of the Year Award (now Young Player of the Year), becoming the first homegrown player to win the honor. Following the end of the 2010 season, long-time United striker Jamie Moreno retired from professional soccer.

Olsen would ultimately assume full-time managerial duties ahead of the 2011 season, where he kept Ashton on the coaching staff, but dismissed Kelderman from his staff. Olsen brought in recently retired goalkeeper and former Canadian international, Pat Onstad, on to his coaching staff, along with former Dutch international, Sonny Silooy. Throughout Olsen&#x27;s tenure, he employed a defensive style of play, followed by a diamond 4–4–2 formation focused on counter-attacking soccer. Pundits described the play as &quot;Bennyball&quot;, and a soccer-style form of moneyball. During Olsen&#x27;s coaching career, he would qualify for the playoffs six times, with the furthest being the Eastern Conference final, and win one major title, the U.S. Open Cup in 2013. The club qualified for the CONCACF Champions League twice during his tenure, where they reached the quarterfinals each time.

During Olsen&#x27;s first full season in charge the club acquired Perry Kitchen in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft, U.S. international Charlie Davies on loan, and Canadian international Dwayne De Rosario. Additionally, 2010 Designated Player acquisition, Branko Bošković, became healthy for the season. The club experienced a turnaround in contrast to 2010, but ultimately a four-match losing streak and a six-match winless streak to close out the regular season cost the club a chance at the MLS Cup Playoffs. Despite not making the playoffs, De Rosario won the MLS Most Valuable Player Award (now known as the Landon Donovan MVP Award). During the 2011–12 offseason, minority owners of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, Jason Levien and Erick Thohir were named new majority owners, buying Will Chang&#x27;s majority stake in the club. Chang, however, remained part of the ownership group as a minority owner. The goal of Levien and Thohir was to construct a soccer-specific stadium for United.

On the field during the 2012 season, United&#x27;s fortunes fared much better, with new acquisitions Nick DeLeon, Lewis Neal, Maicon Santos, and Hamdi Salihi having immediate contributions to the club. United ultimately finish the 2012 season with a third-place finish, their best since 2007, and a second-place finish in the East, again their best since 2007. The club defeated their rivals, New York Red Bulls in the Conference Semifinals, before advancing to the MLS Eastern Conference final, their first Conference Final since 2005, against Houston Dynamo. United lost the series 2–4 on aggregate ending their season.

During Olsen&#x27;s third season in charge, the new club ownership constrained the teams budget, in part to finance a future soccer-specific stadium. Consequently, the club relied on several reserve players, second-division players, and Academy players to form the core of the team, as well as releasing several key contributors from the 2012 team, in order to stay within budget. As a result, D.C. United tallied a total of only three wins in the 2013 season, setting a record for fewest wins in league history. Despite the team&#x27;s poor showing in league play, D.C. United defeated Real Salt Lake in the U.S. Open Cup final thanks to a late first half goal from Lewis Neal. As of 2022, this is the club&#x27;s most recent major honor. Despite this season, Olsen was retained as head coach, in part, due in part to the fact the club won the Open Cup. The Open Cup title gave United a berth into the 2014–15 CONCACAF Champions League, their first Champions League appearance since 2009.

In 2014, D.C. United executed a historic turnaround by clinching first place in the Eastern Conference, and going undefeated in CONCACAF Champions League group play, the first time an American club went undefeated in Group Stage of the Champions League. The Eastern Conference regular season title earned the team its second consecutive Champions League berth. Despite this, the club was eliminated by their rivals, New York Red Bulls, in the Conference Semifinals of the MLS Cup Playoffs. Notable offseason acquisitions included Steve Birnbaum, Chris Rolfe, Fabian Espindola, Sean Franklin, and Bobby Boswell. At the conclusion of the 2014 season, Olsen won the MLS Coach of the Year Award (now known as the Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year Award). For the turnaround, management extended Olsen&#x27;s contract with United.

During the latter half of Olsen&#x27;s tenure, Olsen saw the club qualify for the playoffs in four of his final six seasons, although the club never went further past the Conference Semifinals in the playoffs. During this time, the club revealed a new crest in 2016, and opened their new soccer-specific, Audi Field, in 2018. Off the field, Chang and Thohir sold their ownership stake to Levien in 2016 and 2018, respectively. In the late 2010s the club signed several notable players such as Wayne Rooney, Luciano Acosta, and Paul Arriola. During the shortened 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, United saw themselves have an early group stage exit during the MLS is Back tournament, coupled with a poor run of play during the fall 2020 segment of the season.

In October 2020, club management relieved Ben Olsen of his coaching duties, after a club-record 10 seasons as the head coach of the team. Olsen became the third-longest tenured head coach for an MLS team in league history, and by far, the longest tenured head coach in United history. While some members of the media felt that the dismissal was necessary, some individuals in the media felt that as long as Kasper was General Manager and Levien owned the franchise that little would change. Following the dismissal, it was reported that Olsen may stay with the United organization in a different role. Ultimately, in September 2021, Olsen was hired as the Club President for the Washington Spirit, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League franchise in the Washington metropolitan area, which he held until May 2022.

=== Since 2021 ===

During the 2021 season, United hired Argentine manager, Hernán Losada, who had previously coached Belgian outfit, Beerschot. The decision came after the ownership decided to not hire Chris Armas as head coach. The media found the hire a unique and ambitious hire. As head coach, Losada moved the team away from a counter-attacking defensive style, and focused more on a high-octane, attacking style, where Losada prioritized fitness and speed, putting intense pressure on the opponents defense. Losada only managed the club for the entirety of the 2021 season, where on the final day of the season, they finished just outside of the playoff spot. Despite this, Losada remained in charge of United for the first two months of the 2022 campaign. However, due to disagreements between the front office and Losada in coaching philosophy, as well as a poor string of league results, Losada was fired in April 2022 after coaching the club for about 14 months.

Several United players later spoke publicly about Losada&#x27;s poor communication with players, and strict dietary regulations, which had caused tension between the players and Losada&#x27;s coaching staff. Management felt that Losada was too critical of the front office, particularly of Dave Kasper and Jason Levien, and that the relationship between coaching staff and the front office staff had been strained. During this time off the field, Mario Mims and Mark Ingram II joined D.C. United Holdings as minority owners.

Losada&#x27;s firing sparked anger from some of D.C. United&#x27;s fans, who felt the dismissal was too premature. Following Losada&#x27;s sacking, long-time assistant coach Chad Ashton took over on interim duties until July 2022, when the club hired former player and former English international player Wayne Rooney to coach the club. The 2022 season ended in United finishing at the bottom of the MLS overall table, resulting in General Manager, Lucy Rushton, being relieved of her duties. During the 2023 season, United&#x27;s record improved, finishing with 40 points on the season, up from 27 the previous season. However, the improvement was not enough to qualify for the 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs, resulting in Rooney&#x27;s dismissal.
On November 20, 2023, United named Ally Mackay as their new GM and Chief of soccer operations.

==Colors and badge==
The team&#x27;s colors and original logo were announced on October 17, 1995, along with those of the other ten original teams during a presentation in New York City. Black and white are D.C. United&#x27;s primary colors, though the team&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;Black-and-Red.&quot; Red is used to accent the home jersey, while white is the main color of the team&#x27;s road uniform. The three stripes along the shoulder – in white at home and black on the road – do not represent the three jurisdictions of the Washington Metropolitan Area (Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia); rather, they represent the fact that the team&#x27;s uniforms are made by Adidas. In 2011, the team introduced a predominantly red third uniform with black accents to be worn four or more times in the season. The team has also previously used white road uniforms with red stripes; white and red are the colors of the flag of Washington, D.C., and the stripes are also reminiscent of those used on the flag.

The team&#x27;s original shield was implemented in 1996, consisting of the team&#x27;s name, D.C. United, above a black bald eagle facing right on a red field, clawing three soccer balls overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region&#x27;s three jurisdictions. The bird, associated with the federal government based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. This second logo design reoriented the eagle facing left and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At the center of the eagle is a single gold-colored star and a soccer ball, which represents the team&#x27;s victory in Major League Soccer&#x27;s inaugural cup in 1996. The logo can also be adorned with four silver stars above it, representing the MLS Cups the team has won.

On December 10, 2015, D.C. United unveiled an updated logo designed by Peter Horridge, featuring a D.C. flag-inspired design across the eagle, an updated wordmark, and more dynamic wings.

===Sponsorship===
Consulting firm Guidehouse was announced as the jersey sponsor in a multi-year partnership on February 15, 2024.

==Stadium==

=== RFK Stadium (1996–2017) ===

Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (RFK) was home to D.C. United, from the club&#x27;s inaugural season in 1996, until the end of the 2017 season. The D.C. United Training Complex is located north of the stadium, and is where the Reserve Division team plays.

RFK was built in 1961 as a dual-use stadium for baseball and American football. Before 1996, it occasionally hosted soccer matches, including the 1980 Soccer Bowl, the 1993 Supercoppa Italiana, and five matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup. When the Washington Nationals baseball team shared the field from 2005 to 2007, there were criticisms about the playing surface and the field&#x27;s dimensions.

=== Audi Field (2018–present)===

Audi Field is a soccer-specific stadium at Buzzard Point in Southwest, Washington, D.C., and has a capacity of 20,000. It hosted its first game against Vancouver Whitecaps FC on July 14, 2018. The stadium&#x27;s naming rights are owned by Audi, who signed a 12-year contract in February 2017. It was designed by Populous and Marshall Moya Design.

Plans for a new stadium dated back to July 2006, when D.C. United proposed building a new stadium along the Anacostia River near Anacostia Park, but disputes with the city government forced the team to consider other sites.

The tentative deal for the stadium was announced on July 25, 2013, which would see a 20,000–25,000-seat stadium built on the site, costing $300 million. It was signed into law on December 30, 2014. Groundbreaking began on February 27, 2017, and the ribbon cutting was on July 9, 2018.

===Other stadiums===
Several regional university stadiums have been used by the team for Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup matches, including Klöckner Stadium in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1996, and George Mason Stadium in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2010. Similarly, the team has also used the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, Maryland, for multiple early-round games in U.S. Open Cup and CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup since it opened in 2001. On April 14, 2018, D.C. United played an MLS game against Columbus Crew SC at the Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, while Audi Field was being constructed. Exhibition games, as well as occasional regular season matches, have also been played in nearby FedExField in Landover, Maryland; the latter have generally been played as part of doubleheaders featuring friendlies between national teams or foreign clubs.

==Club culture==

=== Supporters and mascot ===
D.C. United has six major supporters groups; La Barra Brava, the Screaming Eagles, District Ultras, Rose Room Collective, 202 Unique and La Banda del Distrito. All six groups occupy the safe standing sections together at the north end of Audi Field. La Barra Brava, Spanish for &quot;The Brave Fans&quot;, was founded in 1995 by Latino fans in the Washington, D.C. area, mostly Bolivian immigrants in support of original United players Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno. They seek to bring a South American style to home games.

La Norte (also La Curva Norte or The Northside) was a soccer supporters&#x27; club affiliated with D.C. United from 2001 to 2016. The club was founded in 2001 when members of La Barra Brava left section 135 of RFK Stadium to form a new club. The club was originally situated in section 120 of RFK, as the section sat directly behind the north goal. The club takes its name from their preferred location on the north side of the stadium. La Norte were forced to change sections with the arrival of the Washington Nationals baseball franchise, and the subsequent reconfiguration of RFK&#x27;s seating to accommodate a baseball diamond. La Norte has since merged with the District Ultras and occupied sections 127 and 128 at RFK Stadium prior to the team&#x27;s move to Audi Field.

D.C. United&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Talon&quot;, an anthropomorphic bald eagle.

=== Rivalries ===
D.C. United&#x27;s primary rival is the New York Red Bulls. The two teams compete annually for the Atlantic Cup, a competition instituted by the two clubs. The cup is awarded to the team that gets the most points across the teams&#x27; meetings throughout the season. D.C. United also has a rivalry with the New England Revolution. D.C. United also has a burgeoning rivalry with the Philadelphia Union as the two teams represent two cities separated by only 120 miles. D.C. United is also unique among MLS teams for its rivalry with the Charleston Battery of the United Soccer League, as they compete every time they face one another for the Coffee Pot Cup, a trophy established by the two sides&#x27; supporters.

== Ownership ==
When the league was founded in 1995, billionaire investor George Soros was the primary financial backer and director of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to D.C. United. Kevin Payne, former President of Soccer USA Partners and current CEO of D.C. United, was instrumental in organizing this ownership group. By 1998 the group was looking for new investors. On February 15, 2001, it agreed to sell the team to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), founded by Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, with AEG exercising its option to become the sole investor-operator on January 8, 2002. AEG, who also owned MLS&#x27;s Los Angeles Galaxy and Houston Dynamo, ran the team until 2007.

In May 2007, United entered into an initial one-year strategic partnership with the Brazilian club Atlético Mineiro. The partnership&#x27;s goal is to enhance the sporting and commercial success of the respective clubs by sharing expertise and experience and creating new opportunities for the clubs in both areas.

On January 8, 2007, the operating rights to D.C. United were sold to D.C. United Holdings, a newly formed group venture that included real estate developer Victor MacFarlane, founder of MacFarlane Partners, and William H.C. Chang, chairman of Westlake International Group. Other investors included D.C. United president Kevin Payne and Blue Devil Development, headed by former Duke basketball players Brian Davis and Christian Laettner. In April 2009, Victor MacFarlane sold his share of the team to his partner William Chang after two stadium proposals had fallen through. In October 2009, Chang also bought out Davis and Laettner to control 100% of the team. Chang is also one of the primary investors of Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Francisco Giants. In July 2012, Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir and Washington-area sports executive Jason Levien, minority owners of the Philadelphia 76ers National Basketball Association franchise, joined Chang as partners. Thohir and Levien stated their primary goals are to make United a global brand and build a soccer-specific stadium for the club. In October 2016, Thohir bought out Chang&#x27;s remaining 35% stake. Then in August 2018, Levien bought out Thohir&#x27;s stake, making him the current majority owner of the team.

On June 4, 2021, NFL running back Mark Ingram II joined DC United&#x27;s ownership group as an investor.

In 2021, Rapper Yo Gotti became a minority owner of D.C United. Local investor and entrepreneur Devin Talbott joined the ownership group in 2022.

==Broadcasting==
===Television===
Rights to D.C. United matches not covered by one of MLS national television partners (ESPN, Fox Sports, and Univision) were held by NBC Sports Washington until the end of the 2022 season. Spanish-language coverage aired on TeleXitos affiliate WZDC-DT2 (channel 44.2). Dave Johnson was the longtime the English-language commentator, and WZDC sports anchor Moises Linares was the Spanish-language commentator.

NBCSW also held television rights from the team&#x27;s inception in 1996 through 2015, dating back to its time as Comcast SportsNet and Home Team Sports. In the previous three-year deal, which was not completed until five games into the 2013 season, it was to show a minimum of 16 matches per season. The team became frustrated that late-season and playoff matches were often relegated to the network&#x27;s secondary CSN Plus channel or not televised at all due to scheduling conflicts with the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, leading them to conclude a new deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group for the 2016 season. Sinclair&#x27;s local cable channel WJLA 24/7 News served two stints as D.C. United&#x27;s television partner, covering the 2016 through 2018 seasons as well as 2020.

For the 2019 season, D.C. United sold their local rights to subscription over-the-top service FloSports rather than a television broadcaster. The team signed a $12 million contract for four years, marking the first time it collected a substantial rights fee for its local games. The deal was controversial, as fans and the media balked at the high subscription price and criticized the team for shutting out casual fans and public viewings. Technical issues marred early broadcasts, and FloSports promised additional soccer broadcasts and shoulder programming to justify its subscription fee that largely never materialized. D.C. United canceled the contract before the final match of the 2019 regular season, opting to stream the remaining game on its website for free.

With every MLS game available on Apple TV via their rights deal in 2023, D.C. United games will be broadcast almost exclusively on this service, with exceptions for certain national linear television broadcast partners. This marks the second time United matches will be carried on a streaming service, with the aforementioned 2019 FloSports deal.

===Radio===
Radio rights are held by iHeartMedia. Coverage airs on WTSD and WWDC-HD2. Spanish television audio are also available on iHeartRadio. Longtime former TV play-by-play voice of D.C. United Dave Johnson serves as the English radio play-by-play voice.
D.C. United&#x27;s first radio partner was WMET (1160 AM), which picked up coverage in 2003. For the 2009 season, games moved to WTOP (1050 AM), but the station did not renew its deal and the team went the next four seasons without English-language radio. Tony Limarzi was the commentator.

WACA (1540 AM) broadcast commentary in Spanish from the team&#x27;s founding through the 2009 season. In 2010, coverage moved to WDCN-LP (87.7 FM) through the end of the 2012 season.

Coverage in both languages returned for the 2014 season, as D.C. United entered into a four-year deal with CBS Radio, including English commentary on WJFK-FM (106.7 FM) or WJFK (1580 AM) and Spanish on WLZL-HD2 (107.9 FM-HD2). The contract with CBS Radio expired after the 2017 season.

<doc id="234908" wikidata="Q265955" url="?curid=234908" title="Lilliput and Blefuscu">
<text>Lilliput and Blefuscu are two fictional island nations that appear in the first part of the 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. The two islands are neighbours in the South Indian Ocean, separated by a channel wide. Both are inhabited by tiny people who are about one-twelfth the height of ordinary human beings. Both nations are empires and the capital of Lilliput is Mildendo.

==Location==
Swift gives the location of Lilliput and Blefuscu in Part I of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, both in the text and with a map, though neither correspond to real-world geography, even as it was known in Swift&#x27;s time. The text states that Gulliver&#x27;s ship (the &quot;Antelope&quot;) was bound for the East Indies when it was caught in &quot;a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; (Tasmania). He gives the latitude as 30°2&#x27;S, though the longitude is unspecified. Likewise, the map depicts Lilliput and Blefuscu south of &quot;Hogs Island&quot; (Simeulue), off northwest Sumatra, and northwest of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, though the map is considerably foreshortened; Van Diemen&#x27;s Land is shown south of the Sunda Strait, some 10° (700 miles) east of Hogs Island, whereas Tasmania is actually some 40° (2,500 miles) east of that meridian. Neither the text nor the map make reference to New Holland (Western Australia), which had been discovered in 1644, some 80 years before publication, and was well-documented in the maps of Swift&#x27;s time. While Australia&#x27;s Cocos (Keeling) Islands are in roughly the right map location south-west of Sumatra, have two inhabited islands, and would have been known of in Swift&#x27;s day, they are at entirely the wrong latitude.

Because the area indicated by Swift is actually occupied by Australia, and on the basis of other textual evidence, some authors have concluded that Swift intended to place Lilliput in the Pacific Ocean, to the northeast, not northwest, of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. However, none of the sea routes to the East Indies, Gulliver&#x27;s stated destination, required ships to round Van Diemen&#x27;s Land; the northern routes, via India or Ceylon, avoided Australia altogether, while the southern (Brouwer) route, taking advantage of the Roaring Forties, turned northeast in mid-ocean precisely to avoid New Holland, though the number of shipwrecks on that coast from the period attests to the dangers of overshooting the turning point. Swift was sceptical about the reliability of the travel literature of his day, and it is suggested that the unlikely geographic descriptions parody many of these works (described by Percy Adams as &quot;travel lies&quot;).

==Geography==
Lilliput is said to extend 5,000 &quot;blustrugs&quot;, or 12 miles in circumference. Blefuscu is located northeast of Lilliput, across an 800-yard (730 m) channel. The only cities mentioned by Swift are Mildendo, the capital of Lilliput, and Blefuscu, capital of Blefuscu. However, the map showing Lilliput&#x27;s position depicts the islands as considerably larger, approaching the size of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.

==History and politics==
Lilliput is said to be ruled by an Emperor, Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue. He is assisted by a first minister (who carries a white staff) and several other officials (who bring articles of impeachment against Gulliver on grounds of treason): the &quot;galbet&quot; or high admiral, Skyresh Bolgolam; the lord high treasurer, Flimnap; the general, Limnoc; the chamberlain, Lalcom; and the grand justiciary, Balmuff. Blefuscu is also ruled by an Emperor, who is not named.

Both nations follow the teachings of a prophet, Lustrog, as recorded in their scripture, known as the Blundecral (&quot;which is their Alcoran or Bible, we don&#x27;t really know&quot;). Sectarian divisions exist in the debate between &quot;Little-Endians&quot; and &quot;Big-Endians&quot; (see below).

===Satirical interpretations===
Lilliput and Blefuscu were intended as, and understood to be, satirical portraits of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of France, respectively, as they were in the early 18th century. Only the internal politics of Lilliput are described in detail; these are parodies of British politics, in which the great central issues of the day are belittled and reduced to unimportance.

For instance, the two major political parties of the day were the Whigs and the Tories. The Tories are parodied as the &quot;Tramecksan&quot; or &quot;High-Heels&quot; (due to their adhesion to the high church party of the Church of England, and their exalted views of royal supremacy), while the Whigs are represented as the &quot;Slamecksan&quot; or &quot;Low-Heels&quot; (the Whigs inclined toward low church views, and believed in parliamentary supremacy). These issues, generally considered to be of fundamental importance to the constitution of Great Britain, are reduced by Swift to a difference in fashions.

The Emperor of Lilliput is described as a partisan of the Low-Heels, just as King George I employed only Whigs in his administration; the Emperor&#x27;s heir is described as having &quot;one of his heels higher than the other&quot;, which describes the encouragement by the Prince of Wales (the future George II) of the political opposition during his father&#x27;s life.

The novel further describes an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over the practice of breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor&#x27;s great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the smaller end after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end. The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to &quot;six rebellions ... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown&quot;. The Lilliputian religion says an egg should be broken on the convenient end, which is now interpreted by the Lilliputians as the smaller end. The Big-Endians gained favour in Blefuscu.
The Big-Endian/Little-Endian controversy reflects, in a much simplified form, British quarrels over religion. Less than 200 years previously, England had been a Catholic (Big-Endian) country; but a series of reforms beginning in the 1530s under King Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547), Edward VI (1547–1553), and Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) had converted most of the country to Protestantism (Little-Endianism), in the episcopalian form of the Church of England. At the same time, revolution and reform in Scotland (1560) had also converted that country to Presbyterian Protestantism, which led to fresh difficulties when England and Scotland were united under one ruler, James I (1603–1625).

Religiously inspired revolts and rebellions followed, in which, indeed, one king, Charles I (1625–49) lost his life, and his grandson James II lost his crown and fled to France (1685–1688). Some of these conflicts were between Protestants and Catholics; others were between different branches of Protestantism. Swift does not clearly distinguish between these different kinds of religious strife.

Swift has his Lilliputian informant blame the &quot;civil commotions&quot; on the propaganda of the Emperor of Blefuscu, i.e. the King of France; this primarily reflects the encouragement given by King Louis XIV of France to James II in pursuit of his policies to advance the toleration of Catholicism in Great Britain. He adds that &quot;when (the commotions) were quelled, the (Big-Endian) exiles always fled for refuge to that empire&quot; (Blefuscu/France). This partially reflects the exile of King Charles II on the Continent (in France, Germany, the Spanish Netherlands, and the Dutch Republic) from 1651 to 1660, but more particularly the exile of the Catholic King James II from 1688 to 1701. James II was dead by the time Swift wrote &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, but his heir James Francis Edward Stuart, also Catholic, maintained his pretensions to the British throne from a court in France (primarily at Saint-Germain-en-Laye) until 1717, and both Jameses were regarded as a serious threat to the stability of the British monarchy until the end of the reign of George II. The court of the Pretender attracted those Jacobites, and their Tory sympathizers, whose political activity precluded them staying safely in Great Britain; notable among them was Swift&#x27;s friend, the Anglican Bishop of Rochester Francis Atterbury, who was exiled to France in 1722.

Swift&#x27;s Lilliputian claims that the machinations of &quot;Big-Endian exiles&quot; at the court of the Emperor of Blefuscu have brought about a continuous war between Lilliput and Blefuscu for &quot;six and thirty moons&quot; (Lilliputians calculate time in &quot;moons&quot;, not years; their time-scale, while not one-twelfth the size of normal humans, appears to be somewhat faster, since the emperor was stated to be &quot;past his prime&quot; before he was thirty.) This is an allusion to the wars fought under King William III and Queen Anne against France under Louis XIV, the War of the Grand Alliance (1689–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713). In both cases, the claims of the exiled House of Stuart were marginal to other causes of war, but were an important propaganda point in Great Britain itself, as both James II and James Francis Edward were accused of allying with foreigners to force Catholicism on the British people.

In the novel, Gulliver washes up on the shore of Lilliput and is captured by the inhabitants while asleep. He offers his services to the Emperor of Lilliput in his war against Blefuscu, and succeeds in capturing the (one-twelfth sized) Blefuscudian fleet. Despite a triumphant welcome, he soon finds himself at odds with the Emperor of Lilliput, as he declines to conquer the rest of Blefuscu for him and to force the Blefuscudians to adopt Little-Endianism.

Gulliver&#x27;s position reflects the decision of the Tory government to withdraw from the War of the Spanish Succession. Britain&#x27;s allies considered the important objects of the war to have been met, and that the Whigs&#x27; larger claims were excessive. The withdrawal was seen by the Whigs as a betrayal of British interests. Swift (a Tory) is here engaged in an apology.

Gulliver is, after further adventures, condemned as a traitor by the Council of Lilliput, and condemned to be blinded; he escapes his punishment by fleeing to Blefuscu. This condemnation parallels that issued to the chief ministers of the Tory government that had made peace with France, Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, who was impeached and imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1715 to 1717; and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, who, after his political fall, received vague threats of capital punishment and fled to France in 1715, where he remained until 1723.

==Post-Swift descriptions==
===Early works===
In 1728, John Arbuthnot wrote &quot;An account of the state of learning in the empire of Lilliput: Together with the history and character of Bullum the Emperor&#x27;s Library-Keeper&quot;; this purported to be transcribed from a treatise by Gulliver on the empire of Lilliput alluded to in chapter 4 of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Arbuthnot used this work to satirise Richard Bentley, master of Trinity College, Cambridge but also described the early history of Lilliput and Blefuscu. At one time (Gulliver is told), Blefuscu was a commonwealth and had its own language and an extensive literature. Lilliput, meanwhile, was divided among several petty kingdoms. The first emperor of Blefuscu attacked and subdued Lilliput, but later the Lilliputians won their independence and set up their own emperor.

===20th-century works===
It has been pointed out that the long and vicious war that started after a disagreement about which was the best end on which to break an egg is an example of the narcissism of small differences, a term Sigmund Freud coined in the early 1900s.

In 1946, T. H. White wrote &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot;, which describes the adventures of a girl, Maria, who discovers a group of Lilliputians on a tiny forgotten island in the lake of a ruinous estate in Northamptonshire.

A modernised Lilliput is the setting of a 1958 sequel children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Castaways in Lilliput&quot;, by Henry Winterfeld. This book provides more geographical detail: other cities in addition to Mildendo include Plips (a major city and cathedral town), Wiggywack (a suburb of Mildendo and seat of the Island Council), Tottenham (on the west coast), and Allenbeck (at the mouth of a river on the west coast).
Winterfeld also provides further details of Lilliputian history. The Emperor of Gulliver&#x27;s time, Mully Ully Gue, is said to have reigned 1657–1746. (This contradicts Swift&#x27;s account, in which the Emperor is only 28 years old and has reigned about seven years when Gulliver arrives in 1699.) His descendant, Alice, is the reigning Queen in the 1950s when three Australian children visit the island. The monetary system has apparently also been changed, the &quot;sprug&quot; of Swift&#x27;s novel replaced by the &quot;onze&quot;, equal to ten &quot;dimelings&quot; or 100 &quot;bims&quot;. Technology has kept pace with the outside world, so the Lilliputians have trains, automobiles, helicopters, telephones, and telegraphs.
Winterfeld describes the flag of Lilliput as having blue and white stripes with a golden crown on a red field. These symbols are also painted on the police helicopters.

==Language==
Swift presents a number of Lilliputian words and phrases, and further states that the official languages of Lilliput and Blefuscu are about as far apart as typical European languages. Arbuthnot explains further that Blefuscu originally had its own language and an extensive literature, but during the period when it occupied Lilliput, the Blefuscudian language was much altered by contact with Lilliputian. Blefuscudian remained an old language of scholarship. In T. H. White&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot;, the protagonist Maria studies the Lilliputian language from a book owned by her professor friend. This is a rare copy of Gulliver&#x27;s 1735 treatise: &quot;A General Description of the Empire of Lilliput, from its first Erection, through a long Series of Princes; with a Particular Account of their Wars and Politicks, Laws, Learning, &amp; Religion, their Plants and Animals, their peculiar Manners and Customs, with other Matters very curious and useful, to which is added a Brief Vocabulary of their Language, with its English Correspondencies&quot;. In Winterfeld&#x27;s sequel, English has become the official language, due to a decision of the Council of the Island in 1751.

* Lilliput is reputedly named after the townland of Lilliput on the shores of Lough Ennell near Dysart, just a few miles from Mullingar, in County Westmeath, Ireland. Swift was a regular visitor to the Rochfort family at Gaulstown House. It is said that it was when Dean Swift looked across the expanse of Lough Ennell one day and saw the tiny human figures on the opposite shore of the lake that he conceived the idea of the Lilliputians featured in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. In fact, the townland was known as Nure from ancient times and was renamed Lileput or Lilliput shortly after the publication of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; in honour of Swift&#x27;s association with the area. Lilliput House has stood in the locality since the 18th century.
* Lilliput and Blefuscu were the names used for Britain and France, respectively, in a series of semi-fictional transcripts (with mutated names of people and places) of debates in the British Parliament. This series was written by William Guthrie, Samuel Johnson, and John Hawkesworth, and was printed in Edward Cave&#x27;s periodical &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1738 to 1746.
* The word &quot;&quot; has become an adjective meaning &quot;very small in size&quot;, or &quot;petty or trivial&quot;. When used as a noun, it means either &quot;a tiny person&quot; or &quot;a person with a narrow outlook, who minds the petty and trivial things.&quot;
* The use of the terms &quot;Big-Endian&quot; and &quot;Little-Endian&quot; in the story is the source of the computing term &quot;endianness&quot;.
* Neela Mahendra, the love interest in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;Fury&quot;, is an &quot;Indo-Lilly&quot;, a member of the Indian Diaspora from the politically unstable country of Lilliput-and-Blefuscu.
* Several craters on Mars&#x27;s moon Phobos are named after Lilliputians. Perhaps inspired by Johannes Kepler (and quoting Kepler&#x27;s third law), Swift&#x27;s satire &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; refers to two moons in Part 3, Chapter 3 (the &quot;Voyage to Laputa&quot;), in which the astronomers of Laputa are described as having discovered two satellites of Mars orbiting at distances of 3 and 5 Martian diameters, and periods of 10 and 21.5 hours, respectively.
* Lilliput is mentioned throughout the 2005 &quot;Malplaquet&quot; trilogy of children&#x27;s novels by Andrew Dalton. Taking much of their initial inspiration from T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot;, the books describe the adventures of a large colony of Lilliputians living secretly in the enormous and mysterious grounds of an English country house (Stowe House in Buckinghamshire). Their longed-for return to their ancestral homeland is one of the major themes of the stories.
* In the &quot;Gabby&quot; cartoon shorts, it is the main and only major location mentioned.

<doc id="234918" wikidata="Q1417494" url="?curid=234918" title="Biconical antenna">
<text>In radio systems, a biconical antenna is a broad-bandwidth antenna made of two roughly conical conductive objects, nearly touching at their points.

Biconical antennas are broadband dipole antennas, typically exhibiting a bandwidth of three octaves or more. A common subtype is the bowtie antenna, essentially a flattened version of the biconical design which is often used for short-range UHF television reception. These are also sometimes referred to as butterfly antennas.

Sir Arthur Lodge is the inventor of the biconical antenna.
==Properties==
The biconical antenna has a broad bandwidth because it is an example of a traveling wave structure; the analysis for a theoretical infinite antenna resembles that of a transmission line. For an infinite antenna, the characteristic impedance at the point of connection is a function of the cone angle only and is independent of the frequency.

Practical antennas have finite length and a definite resonant frequency. A simple conical monopole antenna is a wire approximation of the solid biconical antenna and has increased bandwidth (over a simple monopole).

==Applications==

Biconical (or &quot;bicon&quot;) antennas are often used in electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing either for immunity testing, or emissions testing.
==Advantages and drawbacks==
While the bicon is very broadband, it exhibits poor transmitting efficiency at frequencies at the low end of its range, resulting in low field strengths when compared to the input power. Log periodic dipole arrays, Yagi–Uda antennas, and reverberation chambers have shown to achieve much higher field strengths for the power input than a simple biconical antenna in an anechoic chamber.

However, when the goal is to fully characterize a modulated or impulse signal, rather than merely measuring peak and average spectrum energy content, a reverberation chamber is a poor choice for a test environment.

<doc id="234920" wikidata="Q3243903" url="?curid=234920" title="Live Free or Die">
<text>&quot;Live Free or Die&quot; is the official motto of the U.S. state of New Hampshire, adopted by the state in 1945. It is possibly the best-known of all state mottos, partly because it conveys an assertive independence historically found in American political philosophy and partly because of its contrast to the milder sentiments found in other state mottos.

The phrase was adopted from a toast written by General John Stark, New Hampshire&#x27;s most famous soldier of the American Revolutionary War, on July 31, 1809. Poor health forced Stark to decline an invitation to an anniversary reunion of the Battle of Bennington. Instead, he sent his toast by letter:
:&quot;Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.&quot;

By the time Stark wrote this, &quot;Vivre Libre ou Mourir&quot; (&quot;Live free or die&quot;) was a popular motto of the French Revolution and was required as an oath of office for all legislators for the duration of the Constitution of 1791. A possible source of such mottoes is Patrick Henry&#x27;s famed March 23, 1775, speech to the House of Burgesses (the legislative body of the Virginia colony), which contained the following phrase: &quot;Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!&quot;

The motto was enacted at the same time as the New Hampshire state emblem, on which it appears.

==Legal battle==
In 1970, the New Hampshire state legislature mandated that the phrase &quot;LIVE FREE OR DIE&quot; appear on all non-commercial license plates, replacing &quot;Scenic.&quot; Some citizens altered or obscured the phrase, saying it was forced speech, in violation of the First Amendment. One said it was placed on the plates by “jingoistic, sloganeering politicians trying to apply our state motto to the Vietnam War,” in which U.S. troops were involved until 1973. That spurred &quot;a battle between state power to compel citizens to display a message they disagreed with and determined dissenters willing to resist, even to the point of going to jail for their beliefs,&quot; according to the Valley News of West Lebanon, N.H. As the war wound down, the issue faded, but erupted again in November 1974. That&#x27;s when George Maynard, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness (albeit a disfellowshiped member), covered up &quot;or die&quot; from his plate. &quot;By religious training and belief, I believe my &#x27;government&#x27; – Jehovah&#x27;s Kingdom – offers everlasting life. It would be contrary to that belief to give up my life for the state, even if it meant living in bondage.&quot; 

In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2in the case of &quot;Wooley v. Maynard&quot;, 430 U.S. 705, that the state of New Hampshire could not prosecute motorists who chose to hide part or all of the motto. It likened Maynard&#x27;s refusal to accept the state motto with the right of Jehovah&#x27;s Witness children to refuse to say the Pledge of Allegiance in public school, established in the court&#x27;s 1943 decision &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;.

Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority in Maynard:

We begin with the proposition that the right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.

Here, as in &quot;Barnette&quot;, we are faced with a state measure which forces an individual, as part of his daily life indeed constantly while his automobile is in public view to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable.

The fact that most individuals agree with the thrust of New Hampshire&#x27;s motto is not the test; most Americans also find the flag salute acceptable.
The Supreme Court concluded that the state&#x27;s interests paled in comparison to individuals&#x27; free expression rights.

==Similar phrases==
The English romantic poet William Wordsworth composed the line, &quot;We must be free or die, who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spoke.&quot;


Many mottos and slogans around the world and throughout history have contrasted freedom and death. Some examples:

The phrase &quot;Vivre Libre ou Mourir&quot; (&quot;live free or die&quot;) was used in the French Revolution. It was the subtitle of the journal by Camille Desmoulins, titled &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;, written during the winter of 1793–1794.

A medal struck at Matthew Boulton&#x27;s Soho Mint, as tokens of exchange for the Paris firm of Monneron Freres, 1791–1792, has on its obverse the motto &quot;Vivre libres ou mourir&quot; (&quot;Live free or die&quot; in French).

During the Siege of Barcelona (25 August 1713 – 11 September 1714) the Barcelona defenders and the Maulets used black flags with the motto &quot;Live free or die&quot;, in Catalan &quot;Viurem lliures o morirem&quot;. It is now used as a symbol of Catalan independentism.

The phrase &quot;Antes morrer livres que em Paz sujeitos&quot; (English: Rather die free than in peace be subjugated) is contained in a 1582 letter reply to King Philip II of Spain from the Portuguese governor of the Azores, Ciprião de Figueiredo. It has been adopted as the Azores motto and is present in the autonomous region&#x27;s coat of arms.

The Declaration of Arbroath of 1320, the document in which the Scottish nobility appealed to Pope John XXII to recognise Scotland&#x27;s independence from England, contains an oft-cited line, &quot;It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.&quot;

On January 1, 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines proclaimed Haiti, then a French slave colony, to be free and independent. He is said to have torn the white section from the French tricolor flag and to have shouted, &quot;Vivre libre ou mourir!&quot; That means &quot;live free or die!&quot;

The first Convention of the Delegates of the Scottish Friends of the People in Edinburgh on 11–13 December 1792 used the phrase &quot;live free or die&quot; and referred to it as a &quot;French oath.&quot;

*&quot;Свобода или смърт&quot; (Svoboda ili smart – &quot;Freedom or death&quot;) was the motto of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee during the struggle for national independence in the 19th century. The motto is displayed on most revolutionary flags during the April uprising of 1876.

=== National mottos ===
* &quot;Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος&quot; (&quot;Eleutheria i thanatos&quot; – &quot;Freedom or death&quot;) is the national motto of Greece and comes from the motto of the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830).

*&quot;Eala Frya Fresena&quot; – &quot;Rise up, Free Frisians,&quot; according to Tilemann Dothias Wiarda (1777), was spoken at the Upstalsboom in Aurich during the Late Middle Ages. Since the mid-19th century, Frisian nationalists tend to answer it with &quot;Lewwer duad üs Slaav&quot;, or &quot;Better dead than a slave.&quot;
*&quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la mort&quot; – &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death&quot; was the early motto of the French Revolution. Later versions dropped &quot;&quot;ou la mort&quot;.&quot; The full motto is still displayed above the entrance of the city hall of Troyes.
* The Romanian national anthem, &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot;, contains the line &quot;&quot;‘Viața-n libertate ori moarte!&quot;’ strigă toți&quot;&quot;, meaning Life in freedom or death!&#x27; shout all&quot;.
* &quot;Ӏожалла я маршо&quot; (&quot;Jozhalla ya marsho&quot; &quot;Death or Freedom&quot;) was the national anthem and the slogan of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (1991–1996).
* &quot;Bolje grob nego rob, Bolje rat nego pakt&quot; – &quot;Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact&quot; was the motto of Yugoslav demonstrators during the 1941 Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état of 1941, after the Yugoslav government had signed a pact with the Axis powers.
* &quot;Воля України або смерть&quot; (&quot;Volya Ukrayiny abo smert&quot; &quot;Freedom of Ukraine or death&quot;) was a motto of the Ukrainian rebels of the Kholodny Yar Republic during the Ukrainian War of Independence and later became a motto that was adopted by the protesters of Euromaidan. The phrase was mentioned by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in a September 2014 speech to the U.S. Congress.

==Other uses==

The motto is one of the 101 reasons cited by the Free State Project, a libertarian organization, for the choice of New Hampshire as their destination.
&quot;Live Free or Die&quot; is popular among Unix users, a group which also cherishes its independence. The popularity dates to the 1980s, when Armando Stettner of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) had a set of Unix license plates printed up and given away at a USENIX conference. They were modeled on the license plates in New Hampshire, where DEC&#x27;s Unix Engineering Group was headquartered. Stettner lived in New Hampshire at the time and used the vanity license plate UNIX. When DEC came out with its own Unix version, Ultrix, they printed up Ultrix plates that were distributed at trade shows.

<text>Mobile payment, also referred to as mobile money, mobile money transfer and mobile wallet, is any of various payment processing services operated under financial regulations and performed from or via a mobile device. Instead of paying with cash, cheque, or credit card, a consumer can use a payment app on a mobile device to pay for a wide range of services and digital or hard goods. Although the concept of using non-coin-based currency systems has a long history, it is only in the 21st century that the technology to support such systems has become widely available.

Mobile payments began adoption in Japan in the 2000s and later all over the world in different ways. The first patent exclusively defined &quot;Mobile Payment System&quot; was filed in 2000.

In a developing country, mobile payment solutions can be deployed as a means of extending services of financial institutions to the community known as the &quot;unbanked&quot; or &quot;underbanked&quot;, which is estimated to be as much as 50 percent of the world&#x27;s adult population, according to the Financial Access 2009 Report &quot;Half the World is Unbanked&quot;. Such payment networks are often used for micropayments. The use of mobile payments in developing countries has attracted public and private funding by organizations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development, and Mercy Corps.

Mobile payments are becoming a key instrument for payment service providers (PSPs) and other market participants, in order to achieve new growth opportunities, according to the European Payments Council (EPC). The EPC states that &quot;new technology solutions provide a direct improvement to the operations efficiency, ultimately resulting in cost savings and in an increase in business volume&quot;.

== Models ==
There are four primary models for mobile payments:

* Bank-centric model
* Operator-centric model
* Collaborative model
* Independent service provider (ISP) model

In models connected to a bank or operator, a bank/operator is the central node of the model, manages the transactions and distributes the property rights. In collaborative model, the financial intermediaries and telephonic operators collaborate in the managing tasks and share cooperatively the proprietary rights. In ISP model, a third party of confidence operates as an independent and “neutral” intermediary between financial
agents and operators. Apple Pay or PayPal are the providers the most frequently associated to this model.

There can also be combinations of two models.

* Operator/bank co-operation, emerging in Haiti.

Financial institutions and credit card companies as well as Internet companies such as Google and a number of mobile communication companies, such as mobile network operators and major telecommunications infrastructure such as w-HA from Orange and smartphone multinationals such as Ericsson and BlackBerry have implemented mobile payment solutions.

== Mobile wallets ==

A mobile wallet is an app that contains the user&#x27;s debit and credit card information, letting the user pay for goods and services digitally with a mobile device. Notable mobile wallets include:

*Alipay
*Amazon Pay
*Apple Wallet
*BHIM
*Cloud QuickPass
*GCash
*Google Wallet
*Gyft
*LG Pay
*Line Pay
*Mi Pay
*Mir Pay
*Paytm
*PhonePe
*Samsung Wallet
*Touch &#x27;n Go eWallet
*Venmo
*WeChat Pay
== Credit card ==
A simple mobile web payment system can also include a credit card payment flow allowing a consumer to enter their card details to make purchases. This process is familiar but any entry of details on a mobile phone is known to reduce the success rate (conversion) of payments.

In addition, if the payment vendor can automatically and securely identify customers then card details can be recalled for future purchases turning credit card payments into simple single click-to-buy giving higher conversion rates for additional purchases.

However, there are concerns regarding information and payment privacy when cards are used during online transactions. If a website is not secure, for example, then personal credit card info can leak online.

== Carrier billing ==
The consumer uses the mobile billing option during checkout at an e-commerce site—such as an online gaming site—to make a payment. After two-factor authentication involving the consumer&#x27;s mobile number and a PIN or one-time password (often abbreviated as &quot;OTP&quot;), the consumer&#x27;s mobile account is charged for the purchase. It is a true alternative payment method that does not require the use of credit/debit cards or pre-registration at an online payment solution such as PayPal, thus bypassing banks and credit card companies altogether. This type of mobile payment method, which is prevalent in Asia, provides the following benefits: 
*&quot;Security&quot; – two-factor authentication and a risk management engine prevents fraud.
*&quot;Convenience&quot; – no pre-registration and no new mobile software is required.
*&quot;Easy&quot; – It is just another option during the checkout process.
*&quot;Fast&quot; – most transactions are completed in less than 10 seconds.
*&quot;Proven&quot; – 70% of all digital content purchased online in some parts of Asia uses the direct mobile billing method

=== Remote payment by SMS and credit card tokenization ===

Even as the volume of Premium SMS transactions have flattened, many cloud-based payment systems continue to use SMS for presentment, authorization, and authentication, while the payment itself is processed through existing payment networks such as credit and debit card networks. These solutions combine the ubiquity of the SMS channel, with the security and reliability of existing payment infrastructure. Since SMS lacks end-to-end encryption, such solutions employ a higher-level security strategies known as &#x27;tokenization&#x27; and &#x27;target removal&#x27; whereby payment occurs without transmitting any sensitive account details, username, password, or PIN.

Point-of-sales mobile payment solutions have not relied on SMS-based authentication as a payment mechanism, but remote payments such as bill payments, seat upgrades on flights, and membership or subscription renewals are commonplace.

In comparison to premium short code programs which often exist in isolation, relationship marketing and payment systems are often integrated with CRM, ERP, marketing-automation platforms, and reservation systems. Many of the problems inherent with premium SMS have been addressed by solution providers. Remembering keywords is not required since sessions are initiated by the enterprise to establish a transaction specific context. Reply messages are linked to the proper session and authenticated either synchronously through a very short expiry period (every reply is assumed to be to the last message sent) or by tracking session according to varying reply addresses and/or reply options.

=== Direct operator billing ===
Direct operator billing, also known as mobile content billing, WAP billing, and carrier billing, 
requires integration with the mobile network operator. It provides certain benefits:
*Mobile network operators already have a billing relationship with consumers, the payment will be added to their bill.
*Provides instantaneous payment
*Protects payment details and consumer identity
*Better conversion rates
*Reduced customer support costs&quot; for merchants
*Alternative monetization option in countries where credit card usage is low

One of the drawbacks is that the payout rate will often be much lower than with other mobile payments options. Examples from a popular provider:
* 92 percent with PayPal
* 85 to 86 percent with credit card
* 45 to 91.7 percent with operator billing in the US, UK and some smaller European countries, but usually around 60%

More recently, direct operator billing is being deployed in an in-app environment, where mobile application developers are taking advantage of the one-click payment option that direct operator billing provides for monetising mobile applications. This is a logical alternative to credit card and Premium SMS billing.

In 2012 Ericsson and Western Union partnered to expand the direct operator billing market, making it possible for mobile operators to include Western Union mobile money transfers as part of their mobile financial service offerings. Given the international reach of both companies, the partnership is meant to accelerate the interconnection between the m-commerce market and the existing financial world.

== Contactless near-field communication ==
Near-field communication (NFC) is used mostly in paying for purchases made in physical stores or transportation services. A consumer using a special mobile phone equipped with a smartcard waves their phone near a reader module. Most transactions do not require authentication, but some require authentication using PIN, before transaction is completed. The payment could be deducted from a pre-paid account or charged to a mobile or bank account directly.

Mobile payment method via NFC faces significant challenges for wide and fast adoption, due to lack of supporting infrastructure, complex ecosystem of stakeholders, and standards. Some phone manufacturers and banks, however, are enthusiastic. Ericsson and Aconite are examples of businesses that make it possible for banks to create consumer mobile payment applications that take advantage of NFC technology.

NFC vendors in Japan are closely related to mass-transit networks, like the Mobile Suica used since 28 January 2006 on the JR East rail network. The mobile wallet Osaifu-Keitai system, used since 2004 for Mobile Suica and many others including Edy and nanaco, has become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard method for mobile payments in Japan. Its core technology, Mobile FeliCa IC, is partially owned by Sony, NTT DoCoMo and JR East. Mobile FeliCa utilize Sony&#x27;s FeliCa technology, which itself is the de facto standard for contactless smart cards in the country. NFC was used in transports for the first time in the world by China Unicom and Yucheng Transportation Card in the tramways and bus of Chongqing on 19 January 2009, in those of Nice on 21 May 2010, then in Seoul after its introduction in Korea by the discount retailer Homeplus in March 2010 and it was tested then adopted or added to the existing systems in Tokyo from May 2010 to end of 2012. After an experimentation in the metro of Rennes in 2007, the NFC standard was implemented for the first time in a metro network, by China Unicom in Beijing on 31 December 2010.

Other NFC vendors mostly in Europe use contactless payment over mobile phones to pay for on- and off-street parking in specially demarcated areas. Parking wardens may enforce the parking by license plate, transponder tags, or barcode stickers.

In Europe, the first experimentations of mobile payment took place in Germany during 6 months, from May 2005, with a deferred payment at the end of each month on the tramways and bus of Hanau with the Nokia 3220 using the NFC standard of Philips and Sony.

In France the immediate contactless payment was experimented during 6 months, from October 2005, in some Cofinoga shops (Galeries Lafayette, Monoprix) and Vinci parkings of Caen with a Samsung NFC smartphone provided by Orange in collaboration with Philips Semiconductors (for the first time, thanks to &quot;Fly Tag&quot;, the system allowed to receive as well audiovisual informations, like bus timetables or cinema trailers from the concerned services). From 19 November 2007 to 2009, this experimentation was extended in Caen to more services and three additional mobile phone operators (Bouygues Telecom, SFR and NRJ Mobile) and in Strasbourg and on 5 November 2007, Orange and the transport societies SNCF and Keolis associated themselves for a 2 months experimentation on smartphones in the metro, bus and TER trains in Rennes. After a test conducted from October 2005 to November 2006 with 27 users, on 21 May 2010, the transport authority of Nice &quot;Régie Lignes d&#x27;Azur&quot; was the first public transport provider in Europe to add definitely to its own offer a contactless payment on its tramways and bus network either with a NFC bank card or smartphone application notably on Samsung Player One (with the same mobile phone operators than in Caen and Strasbourg), as well as the validation aboard with them of the transport titles and the loading of these titles onto the smartphone, in addition to the season tickets contactless card. This service was as well experimented then respectively implemented for NFC smartphones on 18 and 25 June 2013 in the tramways and bus of Caen and Strasbourg. In Paris transport network, after a 4 months testing from November 2006 with Bouygues Telecom and 43 persons and finally with users from July 2018, the contactless mobile payment and direct validation on the turnstile readers with a smartphone was adopted on 25 September 2019 in collaboration with the societies Orange, Samsung, Wizway Solutions, Worldline and Conduent.

Other vendors use a combination of both NFC and a barcode on the mobile device for mobile payment, because many mobile devices in the market do not yet support NFC.

== Other mobile payment methods ==
=== QR code payments ===

QR code is a square two-dimensional bar code. QR codes have been in use since 1994. Originally used to track products in warehouses, QR codes were designed to replace the older one-dimensional bar codes. The older bar codes just represent numbers, which can be looked up in a database and translated into something meaningful. QR, or &quot;quick response&quot;, bar codes were designed to contain the meaningful information directly in the bar code.

QR codes can be of two main categories:
* The QR code is presented on the mobile device of the person paying and scanned by a POS or another mobile device of the payee
* The QR code is presented by the payee, in a static or one time generated fashion and it is scanned by the person executing the payment

Mobile self-checkout allows for one to scan a QR code or barcode of a product inside a brick-and-mortar establishment in order to purchase the product on the spot. This theoretically eliminates or reduces the incidence of long checkout lines, even at self-checkout kiosks.

=== Cloud-based mobile payments ===
Google, PayPal, GlobalPay and GoPago use a cloud-based approach to in-store mobile payment. The cloud based approach places the mobile payment provider in the middle of the transaction, which involves two separate steps. First, a cloud-linked payment method is selected and payment is authorized via NFC or an alternative method. During this step, the payment provider automatically covers the cost of the purchase with issuer linked funds. Second, in a separate transaction, the payment provider charges the purchaser&#x27;s selected, cloud-linked account in a card-not-present environment to recoup its losses on the first transaction.

=== Audio signal-based payments ===
The audio channel of the mobile phone is another wireless interface that is used to make payments. Several companies have created technology to use the acoustic features of cell phones to support mobile payments and other applications that are not chip-based. The technologies like near sound data transfer (NSDT), data over voice and NFC 2.0 produce audio signatures that the microphone of the cell phone can pick up to enable electronic transactions.

=== Direct carrier and bank co-operation ===
In the T-Cash model, the mobile phone and the phone carrier is the front-end interface to the consumers. The consumer can purchase goods, transfer money to a peer, cash out, and cash in. A &#x27;mini wallet&#x27; account can be opened as simply as entering *700# on the mobile phone, presumably by depositing money at a participating local merchant and the mobile phone number. Presumably, other transactions are similarly accomplished by entering special codes and the phone number of the other party on the consumer&#x27;s mobile phone.

In Switzerland, TWINT offers the same function.

=== Magnetic secure transmission ===

In magnetic secure transmission (MST), a smartphone emits a magnetic signal that resembles the one created by swiping a magnetic credit card through a traditional credit card terminal. No changes to the terminal or a new terminal are required.

=== Bank transfer systems ===
Swish is the name of a system established in Sweden. It was established through a collaboration from major banks in 2012 and has been very successful, with 66 percent of the population as users in 2017. It is mainly used for peer-to-peer payments between private people, but is also used by churches, street vendors, and small businesses. A person&#x27;s account is tied to his or her phone number and the connection between the phone number and the actual bank account number is registered in the internet bank. The electronic identification system &quot;mobile BankID&quot;, issued by several Swedish banks, is used to verify the payment. Users with a simple phone or without the app can still receive money if the phone number is registered in the internet bank. Like many other mobile payment system, its main obstacle is getting people to register and download the app, but it has managed to reach a critical mass and it has become part of everyday life for many Swedes.

Swedish payments company Trustly also enables mobile bank transfers, but is used mainly for business-to-consumer transactions that occur solely online. If an e-tailer integrates with Trustly, its customers can pay directly from their bank account. Unlike Swish, users don&#x27;t need to register a Trustly account or download software to pay with it.

The Danish MobilePay and Norwegian Vipps are also popular in their countries. They use direct and instant bank transfers, but also for users not connected to a participating bank, credit card billing.

In India a new direct bank transfer system has emerged called as Unified Payments Interface. This system enables users to transfer money to other users and businesses in real-time directly from their bank accounts. Users download UPI supporting app from app stores on their Android or iOS device, link and verify their mobile number with the bank account by sending one outgoing SMS to app provider, create a virtual payment address (VPA) which auto generates a QR code and then set a banking PIN by generating OTP for secure transactions. VPA and QR codes are to ensure easy to use &amp; privacy which can help in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions without giving any user details. Fund transfer can then be initiated to other users or businesses. Settlement of funds happen in real-time, i.e. money is debited from payer&#x27;s bank account and credited in recipient&#x27;s bank account in real-time. UPI service works 24x7, including weekends and holidays. This is slowly becoming a very popular service in India and is processing monthly payments worth approximately $10 billion as in October 2018.

In Poland the Blik mobile payment system was established in February 2015 by the Polish Payment Standard (PSP) company. To pay with Blik, you need a smartphone, a personal account and a mobile application of one of the banks that cooperate with it. The principle of operation is to generate a 6-digit code in the bank&#x27;s mobile application. The Blik code is used only to connect the parties to the transaction. It is an identifier that associates the user and a specific bank at a given moment. For two minutes, it points to a specific mobile application to which - through a string of numbers - a request to accept a transaction in a specific store or ATM is sent. Blik allows you to pay in online and stationary stores. By the Blik, we can also make transfers to the phone or withdraw money from ATMs.

<doc id="234930" wikidata="Q131276" url="?curid=234930" title="ISSN">
<text>An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit to uniquely identify a periodical publication (periodical), such as a magazine. The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSNs are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.

The ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975. ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard.

When a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in print and electronic media. The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN (p-ISSN) and electronic ISSN (e-ISSN). Consequently, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN (ISSN-L), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.

== Code format ==
An ISSN is an eight-digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers. The last digit, which may be zero through nine or an X, is a check digit, so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits. Formally, the general form of the ISSN (also named &quot;ISSN structure&quot; or &quot;ISSN syntax&quot;) can be expressed as follows:

where codice_1 is in the set {&quot;0,1,2...,9&quot;}, a decimal digit character, and codice_2 is in {&quot;0,1,2...,9,X&quot;}; or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) regular expression:
For example, the ISSN of the journal &quot;Hearing Research&quot;, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is codice_2=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used:

To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number, counting from the right. (If the check digit is X, add 10 to the sum.) The remainder of the sum modulo 11 must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.

=== In EANs ===

ISSNs can be encoded in EAN-13 bar codes with a 977 &quot;country code&quot; (compare the 978 country code (&quot;bookland&quot;) for ISBNs), followed by the 7 main digits of the ISSN (the check digit is not included), followed by 2 publisher-defined digits, followed by the EAN check digit (which need not match the ISSN check digit).

== Code assignment, maintenance and look-up ==

ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in Paris. The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government.

=== Linking ISSN ===
&quot;ISSN-L&quot; is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media. As defined by &quot;ISO 3297:2007&quot;, the &quot;linking ISSN (ISSN-L)&quot; provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource. The &quot;ISSN-L&quot; is one of a serial&#x27;s existing ISSNs, so does not change the use or assignment of &quot;ordinary&quot; ISSNs; it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the &quot;ISSN-L&quot;.

With &quot;ISSN-L&quot; is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use of &quot;ISSN-L&quot; facilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like OpenURL, library catalogues, search engines or knowledge bases.

=== Register ===
The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the &quot;ISDS Register&quot; (International Serials Data System), otherwise known as the &quot;ISSN Register&quot;. the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items. The Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription.

* The print version of a serial typically will include the ISSN code as part of the publication information.
* Most serial websites contain ISSN code information.
* Derivative lists of publications will often contain ISSN codes; these can be found through on-line searches with the ISSN code itself or serial title.
*WorldCat permits searching its catalog by ISSN, by entering &quot;issn:&quot; before the code in the query field. One can also go directly to an ISSN&#x27;s record by appending it to &quot;&quot;, e.g. n2:1021-9749 – Search Results. This does not query the ISSN Register itself, but rather shows whether any WorldCat library holds an item with the given ISSN.
== Comparison with other identifiers ==
ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individual books. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change.

=== Extensions ===
Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial, other identifiers have been built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components (like the table of contents): the Publisher Item Identifier (PII) and the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI).

=== Media versus content ===
Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media (except reproduction microforms). Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs, and CD-ROM versions and web versions require different ISSNs. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats (e.g. PDF and HTML) of the same online serial.

This &quot;media-oriented identification&quot; of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider only &quot;content&quot;, independent of media. This &quot;content-oriented identification&quot; of serials was a repressed demand during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials&#x27; contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application, the digital object identifier (DOI), an ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.

Only later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard (ISO 3297:2007) as an &quot;ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media&quot;.

== Use in URNs ==
An ISSN can be encoded as a uniform resource name (URN) by prefixing it with &quot;&quot;. For example, &quot;Rail&quot; could be referred to as &quot;&quot;. URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps. If the checksum digit is &quot;X&quot; then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN.

=== Problems ===
The URNs are content-oriented, but ISSN is media-oriented:

* ISSN is not unique when the concept is &quot;a journal is a set of contents, generally copyrighted content&quot;: the same journal (same contents and same copyrights) may have two or more ISSN codes. A URN needs to point to &quot;unique content&quot; (a &quot;unique journal&quot; as a &quot;set of contents&quot; reference).
:Example: Nature has an ISSN for print, 0028-0836, and another for the same content on the Web, 1476-4687; only the oldest (0028-0836) is used as a unique identifier. As the ISSN is not unique, the U.S. National Library of Medicine needed to create, prior to 2007, the NLM Unique ID (JID).
* ISSN does not offer resolution mechanisms like a digital object identifier (DOI) or a URN does, so the DOI is used as a URN for articles, with (for historical reasons) no need for an ISSN&#x27;s existence.
:Example: the DOI name &quot;10.1038/nature13777&quot; can be represented as an HTTP string by codice_4, and is redirected (resolved) to the current article&#x27;s page; but there is no ISSN online service, like codice_5, to resolve the ISSN of the journal (in this sample 1476-4687).

A unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular, search systems and knowledge databases. ISSN-L (see Linking ISSN above) was created to fill this gap.

== Media category labels ==
The two standard categories of media in which serials are most available are &quot;print&quot; and &quot;electronic&quot;. In metadata contexts (e.g., JATS), these may have standard labels.

=== Print ISSN ===
&quot;p-ISSN&quot; is a standard label for &quot;Print ISSN&quot;, the ISSN for the print media (paper) version of a serial. Usually it is the &quot;default media&quot; and so the &quot;default ISSN&quot;.

=== Electronic ISSN ===
&quot;e-ISSN&quot; (or &quot;eISSN&quot;) is a standard label for &quot;Electronic ISSN&quot;, the ISSN for the electronic media (online) version of a serial.

<doc id="234931" wikidata="Q979470" url="?curid=234931" title="Seine-et-Oise">
<text>Seine-et-Oise () is a former department of France, which encompassed the western, northern and southern parts of the metropolitan area of Paris. Its prefecture was Versailles and its administrative number was 78. Seine-et-Oise was disbanded in 1968 as part of the reorganisation of the departments of the Paris metropolitan area. The newly created Yvelines department inherited the 78 number.

==General characteristics==
Seine-et-Oise was created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution. Its name comes from the two main rivers (Seine River and Oise River) flowing through it. It completely surrounded the Seine department (which included Paris itself), although it was at its narrowest just east of Seine between that department and the Seine-et-Marne department, which still exists today.

At the time of its abolition in 1968, Seine-et-Oise consisted of 688 suburban and rural communes. It had an area of 5,658 km2 (2,184 sq. miles). The division of Seine-et-Oise into arrondissements changed many times; the final change aligned arrondissement borders with those of its successor departments. For the last two decades of its existence before the preparations for its dissolution, it has five arrondissements: Corbeil, Mantes, Pontoise, Le Raincy, Rambouillet, and Versailles. At the moment of its dissolution it had ten arrondissements: Étampes, Évry, and Palaiseau, designated to form the Essonne department; Argenteuil, Montmorency, and Pontoise, designated to form the Val-d&#x27;Oise department; and Mantes, Rambouillet, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and Versailles, designated to form the Yvelines department.

==Abolition==

At the first French census in 1801, Seine-et-Oise had 421,535 inhabitants. With the growth of the Paris suburbs, the population of Seine-et-Oise increased markedly, and by 1968 it had reached 2,943,350 inhabitants. It was judged that Seine-et-Oise, along with the Seine department, had become too large and ungovernable. On 1 January 1968, it was split into three smaller departments: Yvelines, Val-d&#x27;Oise, and Essonne. A small part of Seine-et-Oise was also merged with parts of the Seine department (also disbanded on the same date) to create the three new departments of Hauts-de-Seine, Val-de-Marne, and Seine-Saint-Denis.

In detail, the splitting up of the Seine-et-Oise department was carried out thus: 262 communes in the central part of the department became the Yvelines department, with Versailles as the prefecture. The official number 78, which was used for Seine-et-Oise, was given to the new Yvelines department, which is the largest of the three (40% of the area of Seine-et-Oise). There were 198 communes in the south of Seine-et-Oise (32% of the area of Seine-et-Oise) that became part of the Essonne department, and the official number 91 was assigned to this department, a number that had been previously used for the Alger department in French Algeria). There were 184 communes in the north of Seine-et-Oise (22% of the area of Seine-et-Oise) that became part of the Val-d&#x27;Oise department, and the official number 95 was assigned to this department, a number that had never been used.

Of the remaining 6% of Seine-et-Oise, 18 communes were grouped with 29 communes of the Seine department to create the Val-de-Marne department, 16 communes of Seine-et-Oise were grouped with 24 communes of the Seine department to create the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and the last 9 communes of Seine-et-Oise were grouped with 27 communes of the Seine department to create the Hauts-de-Seine department.

Thus, Yvelines, Val-d&#x27;Oise, and Essonne together are smaller than the former Seine-et-Oise department (5,658 km2 for the Seine-et-Oise department vs. 5,334 km2 for the three departments).
The three departments of Yvelines, Essonne, and Val-d&#x27;Oise, plus the Seine-et-Marne department, are altogether known in France as the (&#x27;large crown&#x27; or &#x27;large wreath&#x27;, as opposed to the &#x27;small wreath&#x27; of suburbs closer to Paris).

==Population==
At the 1999 French census, the population of the former department of Seine-et-Oise was 4,554,426 inhabitants, its highest figure ever, as people relocated more and more from the center to the distant suburbs of the metropolitan area of Paris. Of the new departments created in 1968 from Seine-et-Oise, Yvelines was the most populous in 1999 with 1,354,304 residents. Seine-Saint-Denis and Hauts-de-Seine are more populous than Yvelines, but only a small part of their territory is made up of the former Seine-et-Oise.

<text>Speyer (, ; ; ), historically known in English as Spires, is a city in Rhineland-Palatinate in the western part of the Federal Republic of Germany with approximately 50,000 inhabitants. Located on the left bank of the river Rhine, Speyer lies south of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim, and south-west of Heidelberg. Founded by the ancient Romans as a fortified town on the northeast frontiers of their Roman Empire, it is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest cities. Speyer Cathedral, a number of other churches, and the (&quot;old gate&quot;) dominate the Speyer landscape. In the cathedral, beneath the high altar, are the tombs of eight Holy Roman Emperors and German kings.

The city is famous for the 1529 Protestation at Speyer. One of the ShUM-cities which formed the cultural center of Jewish life in Europe during the Medieval / Middle Ages, Speyer and its Jewish courtyard was inscribed on the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage List in 2021.

==History==
The first known names were &quot;Noviomagus&quot; and &quot;Civitas Nemetum&quot;, after the Teutonic tribe, Nemetes, settled in the area. The name &quot;Spira&quot; is first recorded in the 7th century, taken from &quot;villa Spira&quot;, a Frankish settlement situated outside of &quot;Civitas Nemetum&quot;.

===Timeline===
* In 10 BC, the first Roman military camp is established (situated between the town hall and the episcopal palace), guarding the northeast frontier of the Roman Empire against Germanic barbarian tribes across the river to the east in Germania
* In AD 150, the town appears as Noviomagus on the world map of the Greek geographer Ptolemy.
* In 346, a Western Christian / Roman Catholic bishop for the town is mentioned for the first time.
* 4th century, &quot;Civitas Nemetum&quot; appears on the Peutinger Map.
* 5th century, &quot;Civitas Nemetum&quot; is destroyed.
* 7th century, the town is re-established, and named &quot;Spira&quot; after a nearby Frankish settlement.
* In 1030, emperor Conrad II starts the construction of Speyer Cathedral, today one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Also in the 11th century, the first city wall is built.
* In 1076, emperor Henry IV of the Holy Roman Empire embarks from Speyer, his favourite town, for Canossa.
* In 1084, establishment of the first Jewish community in Speyer.
* In 1096, as Count Emicho&#x27;s Crusader army on their journey in the First Crusade (also known as the People&#x27;s Crusade) to the Muslim-occupied Holy Land, rages across the Rhineland slaughtering innocent Jewish communities in the Rhineland massacres. Speyer&#x27;s Bishop John, with the local leader Yekutiel ben Moses, manages to secure the community&#x27;s members inside the episcopal palace and later leads them to even stronger fortifications outside the town. It was ruled that anyone harming a Jew would have his hands chopped off.
* In 1294, the Roman Catholic bishop loses most of his previous rights, and from now on Speyer is a Free Imperial Town of the Holy Roman Empire.
* In 1349, the Jewish community of Speyer is wiped out in a persecution pogrom.
* Between 1527 and 1689, Speyer is the seat of the Imperial Chamber Court.
* During the 16th century Protestant Reformation era in 1526, at the first Diet of Speyer (1526) interim toleration of Lutheran teaching and worship is decreed by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.
* In 1529, at the second Diet of Speyer (1529) the Evangelical Lutheran states and supporting princes / electors of the Holy Roman Empire protest against the anti-Reformation resolutions (19 April 1529 Protestation at Speyer, hence the beginnings of the use of the descriptive term &quot;Protestantism&quot; / &quot;Protestants&quot;).
* In 1635, Marshal of France Urbain de Maillé-Brézé, together with Jacques Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force, conquers Heidelberg and Speyer at the head of the Army of Germany.
* In 1689, the town is heavily damaged by invading Royal French troops.
* Between 1792 and 1814, Speyer during the long period of the French Revolutionary Wars and subsequent Napoleonic Wars is under French occupation and jurisdiction under the First French Republic and following First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte (Emperor Napoleon I), continuing earlier during the 18th century, by Royal French troops of the Kingdom of France, after the Battle of Speyerbach, a century before in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714).
* In 1816, (following the fall of Napoleon), Speyer becomes the seat of administration of the Palatinate and of the government of the Rhine District of the Kingdom of Bavaria (later called the Bavarian Palatinate), and remains so for 129 years until the end of World War II in 1945.
* In 1861, Albert Edward was introduced to Alexandra by Crown Princess Victoria.
* Between 1883 and 1904, the Memorial Church is built in remembrance of the Protestation of 1529 at the Diet of Speyer
* In 1947, during post-World War II western Allied Powers-occupied Germany, the State Academy of Administrative Science is founded (later renamed German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer).
* In 1990, Speyer celebrates its 2000th anniversary, on the eve of a reunified Federal Republic of Germany, following the ebbing close of the Cold War.

<doc id="234935" wikidata="Q1169771" url="?curid=234935" title="The Ministry of Silly Walks">
<text>&quot;The Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; is a sketch from the Monty Python comedy troupe&#x27;s television show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, series 2, episode 1, which is entitled &quot;Face the Press&quot;. The episode first aired on 15 September 1970. A shortened version of the sketch was performed for &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;.

A satire on bureaucratic inefficiency, the sketch involves John Cleese as a bowler-hatted civil servant in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through grants. Cleese, throughout the sketch, walks in a variety of silly ways. It is these various silly walks, more than the dialogue, that have earned the sketch its popularity. Cleese has cited the physical comedy of Max Wall, probably in character as Professor Wallofski, as important to its conception.

Ben Beaumont-Thomas in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;Cleese is utterly deadpan as he takes the stereotypical bowler-hatted political drone and ruthlessly skewers him. All the self-importance, bureaucratic inefficiency and laughable circuitousness of Whitehall is summed up in one balletic extension of his slender leg.&quot;

According to research, published in British Medical Journal a &#x27;silly walk&#x27; would take about 2.5 times as much energy as normal walking.

==Sketch==
The sketch as originally depicted in the series begins with John Cleese playing Mr. Teabag, a civil servant who, after purchasing &quot;The Times&quot; from the newsagent in the previous sketch, walks through the streets of London (at the crossing of Thorpebank Road and Dunraven Road) in a very peculiar manner. He eventually arrives at his place of business: The Ministry of Silly Walks, on the northern end of Whitehall. In the hallway, he passes other employees all exhibiting their own silly walks before arriving at his office (the Hollywood Bowl performance omits this preamble). Once there, he finds Mr Putey (Michael Palin) waiting for him and apologizes for the delay, explaining that his walk has become particularly silly of late and it takes longer for him to reach his destination.

Putey explains that he has a silly walk he wishes to develop with grant money. He demonstrates his walk which, to Teabag, isn&#x27;t particularly silly (&quot;The right leg isn&#x27;t silly at all, and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half-turn every alternate step.&quot;). He tells Putey that he does not believe the ministry can help him, as Putey&#x27;s walk is not silly enough and funding is short. The government, he explains (whilst walking around his office in increasingly silly ways), is supposed to give equally to Defence, Social Security, Health, Housing, Education, and Silly Walks, but recently spent less on Silly Walks than on national defence. After a visit by his secretary Mrs. Two-Lumps, Mr. Teabag shows Mr Putey a film on silly walks. (The segment is a parody of early 20th-century cinema, with Michael Palin dressed up as Little Tich; this film is also shown as part of the Hollywood Bowl performance of the sketch.) After tossing the projector offstage, Teabag offers Putey a grant that will allow him to work on the Anglo-French Silly Walk, &quot;La Marche Futile&quot; (a parody of Concorde&#x27;s Anglo-French development), which is then demonstrated by a man (Terry Jones) dressed in a mixture of stereotypical English and French outfits, with a sped-up version of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; playing.

Mrs. Two-Lumps, presumably the minister&#x27;s secretary, makes a brief appearance, bringing in coffee with full silly walk. As she enters, the cups fall all over the tray, completely spilling their contents. The minister looks at the tray, says &quot;Thank you, lovely&quot; and she exits again, taking the tray with her, complete with upended cups. In the Hollywood Bowl version, Carol Cleveland plays Mrs. Two-Lumps, and spills some of the coffee on Cleese during the sketch.

As the years went by amid repeated requests to do the sketch, Cleese found it increasingly difficult to perform these walks. He would say, when told about a new Python tour, &quot;I&#x27;m not doing silly walks.&quot; Accordingly, the sketch was not performed during &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, the troupe&#x27;s 2014 reunion show. It was replaced by &quot;The Silly Walks Song&quot;, which was performed by a group of (younger) dancers who mimicked Cleese&#x27;s original walks while wearing bowler hats and carrying briefcases.

==Reception==
In 2005, the sketch was chosen in a poll taken by Channel 4 in Britain as the 15th greatest comedy sketch of all time (and one of five Monty Python sketches in the top 50).

== Mobile game ==

In 2014, an official video game adaption of the sketch was released for Android and iOS. It features Cleese, as the minister of silly walks, leaving his office and walking through London. It takes the form of an endless runner game, except with an appropriately absurd walking animation. The game includes voice acting from John Cleese.

==References in popular culture==
*In the 1988 Warhammer Fantasy Battle rulebook, Realm of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness, one of the possible mutations a creature might get is a &quot;silly walk&quot;, which is considered widely by many to be a reference to this sketch, as early Warhammer products were considerably more comedic in tone, and contained many references to then-contemporary British culture.
*In the 1994 Beastie Boys &quot;Sure Shot&quot; music video, Adam Yauch demonstrates a Silly Walk step for Adam Horovitz. John Berry later reminisced of a teenage Yauch, &quot;He was really into Monty Python, especially the Silly Walk skit.&quot;
*In 2000, an episode of &quot;Mission Hill&quot;, &quot;Andy and Kevin Make a Friend (or One Bang for Two Brothers)&quot;, referenced the sketch when one of the characters attempts to impress a girl by showing how he does a &quot;great silly walk&quot; from the Ministry of Silly Walks.
*A reference is made to the Silly Walk in an episode of the WB&#x27;s &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; when Rory says &quot;Please, don&#x27;t walk away like that&quot;, and Dean responds with &quot;Sorry, I&#x27;d do a silly walk, but I&#x27;m not feeling very John Cleese right now.&quot;
*In the video game &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot;, an image of a man doing John Cleese&#x27;s silly walk can be seen on one of the computer monitors in the game.
*In an issue of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Bongo Comic, when the British invade Springfield, it shows John Cleese doing the goosestep and labels him as &quot;the Minister of Silly Walks&quot;.
*On an episode of &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War On Everything&quot;, Andrew Hansen and Chris Taylor do a sketch called &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s British Comedy Sketch&quot;, filled with various Monty Python cliches, which climaxes with Andrew screaming &quot;I&#x27;m going to do something so totally bizarre it will be imitated verbatim by comedy nerds for decades to come!&quot; He then does a silly walk, doing imitations of Pepperpots, until a 16-ton weight falls on his head.
*In November 2007, as the Eurostar duration between Brussels and London was reduced to 1 hour and 51 minutes, the &quot;Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; appeared in an ad campaign in Belgium. The adverts were all on building corners, showing two workers carrying a large glass pane walking towards the corner on one side. Walking towards them on the other side, a John Cleese look-alike performs a Silly Walk. The tagline read &quot;Warning! London is just around the corner!&quot;.
*In the Season 6 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; entitled &quot;All the Presidents Heads&quot;, Dr. Zoidberg performs a silly walk.
*In the 25th anniversary reunion episode of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, John Cleese consents to appear on the show on condition that he be allowed to do the Silly Walk; the other cast members are dubious about the comedic impact of doing the Walk on radio, but they ultimately give in after Cleese puts on a show of hurt feelings. Near the end of the show, Cleese presents the Silly Walk, rendered on radio as a series of loud, slow footsteps.
*In the video game &quot;Destroy All Humans! 2&quot;, if you read a hippie&#x27;s mind in the Albion level, one of the thoughts is, &quot;I hope I can get a job at the Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; (This video game is known for spoofing popular culture of the decade in which it is set).
*In a standup comedy routine in &quot;Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One For the Road&quot;, Larry the Cable Guy, referring to strange people who go to Wal-Mart in the middle of the night, says that it &quot;turns into Monty Python&#x27;s Ministry of Silly Walks.&quot;
*In Improv Everywhere&#x27;s 2010 MP3 experiment, participants were asked to walk in a silly manner. After the silly walk session was finished, &#x27;Mark (the omnipotent voice from above)&#x27; stated: &quot;Excellent silly walks. Those belong in the Ministry hall of fame&quot;.
*A segment in &quot;The Beano&quot; comic book featured Minnie the Minx as the &quot;Minnie-ster of Silly Walks&quot;.
*In the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Germans&quot;, Basil (John Cleese), after grandly announcing, &quot;I&#x27;ll do the funny walk&quot;, performs a goose step, reminiscent of a silly walk.
*In the second issue of Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s comic book &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot;, the &quot;Minister&quot; can be seen performing the silly walk in the background in London, passing the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
*In the Czech city of Brno, a Silly Walk City March is held annually since 2012.
*The small town of Ørje, Norway found a way to spice up one of its crosswalks—pedestrians wishing to cross must do so using a silly walk. The town&#x27;s mayor didn&#x27;t seem to mind the silliness. &quot;Clearly, one should listen to the authorities, but this kind of fun should be allowed&quot;, the mayor said. &quot;You cannot just be square, right?&quot;
* The 4 July 2016 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; features a parody of the silly walk on its cover, a reference to Brexit, in which several men in the likeness of John Cleese&#x27;s character do the silly walk off the edge of a cliff.
* The 22 January 2017 episode of Zondag met Lubach mentions Minister Jetta Klijnsma being a disabled politician from the Ministry of Silly Walks, so U.S. President Donald Trump can make fun of her.
* In the video game &quot;West of Loathing&quot;, there is an option for &quot;stupid walking&quot;, which allows the player to &quot;walk in silly ways&quot;. The entire game can be completed this way.
* In the video game &quot;Payday 2&quot;, the safe house butler Aldstone, voiced by John Cleese, has a rare chance of walking this way for a few seconds.
* On 28 October 2019, while celebrating the Ohi Day, a group of participants to the national military parade performed a silly walk as an anti-military demonstration in Nea Filadelfeia, Greece.
* The LaTeX package &quot;Sillypage&quot; was developed by Phelype H. Oleinik and Paulo R. M. Cereda to use the Cleese walk silhouettes as page numbers in a document.
* The 2017 video game &quot;Destiny 2&quot; has an emote featuring the silly walk, titled &quot;Bureaucratic Walk&quot;.

== COVID-19 pandemic ==
Unofficial signs stating that certain sidewalks are under the jurisdiction of The Ministry of Silly Walks have been placed along sidewalks worldwide, including the United States, Canada, and England as a way to allow pedestrians to laugh in a stressful time.

<doc id="234938" wikidata="Q1781074" url="?curid=234938" title="Rolfing">
<text>Rolfing () is a form of alternative medicine originally developed by Ida Rolf (1896–1979) as Structural Integration. Rolfing is marketed with unproven claims of various health benefits, is recognized as pseudoscience and has been characterized as quackery.
It is based on Rolf&#x27;s ideas about how the human body&#x27;s &quot;energy field&quot; can benefit when aligned with the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field.

Rolfing is typically delivered as a series of ten hands-on physical manipulation sessions sometimes called &quot;the recipe&quot;. Practitioners combine superficial and deep manual therapy with movement prompts. The process is sometimes painful. The safety of Rolfing has not been confirmed. The principles of Rolfing contradict established medical knowledge, and there is no good evidence Rolfing is effective for the treatment of any health condition.

== Conceptual basis ==
Professor of Complementary Medicine Edzard Ernst has offered this definition: &quot;Rolfing is a system of bodywork invented by Ida Pauline Rolf (1896–1979) employing deep manipulation of the body&#x27;s soft tissue allegedly to realign and balance the body&#x27;s myofascial structures.&quot; Rolfing is based on the unproven belief that such alignment results in improved movement, breathing, pain reduction, stress reduction, and emotional changes.

Rolf described the body as organized around an axis perpendicular to the earth, pulled downward by gravity, and she believed the function of the body was optimal when it was aligned with that pull. In her view, gravity tends to shorten fascia, leading to disorder of the body&#x27;s arrangement around its axis and creating imbalance, inefficiency in movement, and pain. Rolfers aim to lengthen the fascia in order to restore the body&#x27;s arrangement around its axis and facilitate improved movement. Rolf also discussed this in terms of &quot;energy&quot; and said:

Rolfers make a life study of relating bodies and their fields to the earth and its gravity field, and we so organize the body that the gravity field can reinforce the body&#x27;s energy field. This is our primary concept.

The manipulation is sometimes referred to as a type of bodywork, or as a type of massage. Some osteopaths were influenced by Rolf, and some of her students became teachers of massage, including one of the founders of myofascial release.

Rolf claimed to have found an association between emotions and the soft tissue: &quot;Rolfing is not primarily a psychotherapeutic approach to the problems of humans, but [...] many people insist on so regarding it. Rolfing is an approach to the personality through the myofascial collagen components of the physical body.&quot; She claimed Rolfing could balance the mental and emotional aspects of subjects and that &quot;the amazing psychological changes that appeared in Rolfed individuals were completely unexpected.&quot; Rolfers suggest their manipulations can cause the release of painful repressed memories. Rolfers also hold that by manipulating the body they can bring about changes in personality; for example, teaching somebody to walk with confidence will make them a more confident person. The connection between physical structure and psychology has not been proven by scientific studies.

== Technique ==
Rolfing is typically performed in ten sessions, sometimes called &quot;the recipe&quot;, which claim to reorganize the body&#x27;s connective tissues. The first three sessions focus on superficial tissues, the next four focus on deeper tissues and specifically the pelvis, and the final sessions address the whole body. A session typically lasts between 60 and 90 minutes. The recipient wears undergarments and moves between the positions of lying on a table, sitting, and standing. Rolfing treatments can be painful and cause soreness. 

== Effectiveness and reception ==
Because of its dependence on vitalistic concepts and its unevidenced propositions about the connection between physical manipulation and psychology, Rolfing is classified as a pseudoscience, and its practice has been characterized as quackery.

Writing for &quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot;, lawyer Jann Bellamy writes that in the United States of America the public is inadequately protected from bodywork practices such as Rolfing because of the lack of independent oversight; instead regulation is carried out within a &quot;closed loop&quot; system by such bodies as the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork. In 2015 the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published a review of 17 alternative therapies, including Rolfing, which concluded no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian government named Rolfing as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, to ensure the best use of insurance funds. Proponents of Rolfing claim it can be used to alleviate pain. However, Rolfing&#x27;s focus on appropriate &quot;alignment&quot; of structures of the body does not reflect modern science about pain.

The American Cancer Society says the deep soft tissue manipulations such as those used in Rolfing are a concern if practiced on people with cancer near tumor sites.

In 2010 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Rolfing was enjoying a &quot;resurgence&quot; following an endorsement from Mehmet Oz on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

In 2019 a taxonomy of &quot;internet scams&quot; identified Rolfing as having been used for deceptive claims about alleviating gastrointestinal problems by &quot;restructuring&quot; muscle tissue.

== History ==
Ida Rolf began working on clients in New York City in the 1940s with the premise that the human structure could be organized &quot;in relation to gravity&quot;. She developed structural integration with one of her sons and by the 1950s she was teaching her work across the United States. In the mid-1960s she began teaching at Esalen Institute, where she gathered a loyal following of students and practitioners. Esalen was the epicenter of the Human Potential Movement, allowing Rolf to exchange ideas with many of their leaders, including Fritz Perls. Rolf incorporated a number of ideas from other areas including osteopathic manipulation, cranial osteopathy, hatha yoga, and the general semantics of Alfred Korzybski. In 1971 she founded the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration. The school has been based in Boulder, Colorado, since 1972, and as of 2010 included five institutes worldwide.

== The field of Structural Integration ==
Since Rolf&#x27;s death, the field of Structural Integration has branched into various schools. Of these schools, the Rolf Institute is the only one with the use of the trademarked terms &quot;Rolfing&quot; and &quot;Certified Rolfer&quot;. Other programs of Structural Integration certify &quot;Practitioners of the Rolf Method of Structural Integration&quot; including the Guild for Structural Integration, Hellerwork Structural Integration, Aston Patterning, SOMA, KMI, and a dozen other Structural Integration programs. A professional membership organization exists called the International Association of Structural Integration, which has certified practitioners by exam since 2007.

In some states such as New Hampshire and Nevada, there is a separate license for SI. Internationally, some countries have a Board of Health that regulates bodywork while others don&#x27;t. Four Canadian provinces require licensure for bodywork practitioners. Switzerland has separate licensure for complementary therapies including Structural Integration.

<doc id="234944" wikidata="Q553292" url="?curid=234944" title="Jacob De la Gardie">
<text>Field Marshal and Count Jacob Pontusson De la Gardie (20 June 1583 – 22 August 1652) was a and a soldier of the Swedish Empire, and a Marshal from 1620 onward.

He was Privy Councilor from 1613 onward, Governor of Swedish Estonia in 1619–1622, Governor-General of Livonia in 1622–1628 (conquered by the Swedish Empire in 1621, and referred to as Swedish Livonia in 1629–1721), and Lord High Constable from 1620. He introduced reforms based on the then novel Dutch military doctrine into the Swedish army. He commanded the Swedish forces in Russia and against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He also served as one of the five regents jointly ruling Sweden during the minority of Queen Christina.

== Biography ==
Jacob De la Gardie was born in Reval (today Tallinn), Estonia (then part of the Swedish Empire), as a son of Pontus De la Gardie and Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm, the illegitimate daughter of King John III of Sweden. His mother died giving birth, and his father perished two years later in Narva. From his age two onward, Jacob was raised in the Vääksy () manor, Kangasala, Finland (then part of Sweden proper) by his grandmother Karin Hansdotter, the mistress of King John III.

As a young adult, De la Gardie was held prisoner in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for four years, together with Carl Gyllenhielm. After being released, De la Gardie took part of the Dutch Revolt as a volunteer. In 1606–1608, De la Gardie served under the Dutch general Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange. Impressed with the Dutch way of waging war, De la Gardie began introducing Dutch methods into the Swedish army upon his return to the service of Sweden.

=== Prelude to the Jacob de La Gardie Campaign ===
The Tsardom of Russia had been experiencing the Time of Troubles (1598–1613) since the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598, causing widespread political instability and a violent succession crisis for the title of Tsar of Russia by usurpers known as the False Dmitris. In 1605, in the prelude to the Polish–Russian War, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth unofficially invaded Russia in support of False Dmitry I against the unpopular crowned tsar Boris Godunov, seeking to exploit the country&#x27;s weakness for their own gain. Godunov died in June 1605 and was replaced by False Dmitry I, whose popularity among the Russian populace declined rapidly during his reign, and the Polish withdrew when he was eventually murdered during an uprising in Moscow in May 1606.

Despite this, Russia&#x27;s instability continued to the near-total breakdown of order, prompting the Polish to invade again in 1607 in support of the new usurper, False Dmitry II. In 1609, the Tsar of Russia at the time, Vasili IV, approached King Charles IX of Sweden to form a military alliance against False Dmitry II and the Polish occupiers. The two signed the Treaty of Viborg (Finnish: &quot;Viipuri&quot;), in which Russia ceded Kexholm County and the strategic Korela Fortress to Sweden in exchange for military support. This Russian alliance with Sweden, the main rival of Poland, led to King Sigismund III of Poland officially declaring war on Russia in response.

=== Execution of the campaign ===
In 1608–1613, De la Gardie as Sweden&#x27;s Chief Commander in Finland also commanded the Swedish war efforts in Russia. Thus, in accordance with the Swedish-Russian military alliance formed in 1609, he together with Evert Horn now took charge of providing an auxiliary corps to support the Russian forces commanded by Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky.

Although officially the Swedish-Russian alliance was not ratified before July 1609, already in the early spring of 1609 Sweden gathered for this mission to the city of Viborg in Finland (then part of Sweden) c. 5,000 soldiers, consisting mainly of Finns. A Swedish offensive heading towards Moscow – via Novgorod – began from Viborg on 11 March 1609. The operation became known as De la Gardie campaign. It was a joint military campaign by the Tsardom of Russia and Sweden during the Polish-Russian War (1605-1618), a.k.a. Polish–Muscovite War or the &quot;Dimitriads&quot;, lasting officially from April 1609 to 4 June 1610.

A combined Russo-Swedish army of about 10,000 soldiers set out from Novgorod in April 1609 and marched towards Moscow, defeating rebel forces and relieving the Siege of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra on their way. The De la Gardie campaign was successful against False Dmitry II, dispersing his court in Tushino, a former village and town to the north of Moscow, where Dmitry II maintained an alternative court, challenging the authority of Vasili IV. On 12 March 1610, the Russo-Swedish army broke the rebel siege of Moscow and conquered the city.

In June 1610, De la Gardie and Prince Dmitry Shuisky – an uncle and rival of Skopin-Shuisky (who was poisoned at the behest of his uncle) – departed from Moscow, in order to lift the Polish-Lithuanian Siege of Smolensk. The campaign ended with most of De la Gardie&#x27;s forces defecting to the Polish hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski at the Battle of Klushino, causing a defeat to De la Gardie&#x27;s alliance on 4 June 1610. After this, De la Gardie&#x27;s remaining army returned to Viborg during that summer.

=== Ingrian War ===
Not long thereafter, the Ingrian War in 1610–1617 between Sweden and Russia was initiated, during which De la Gardie played a significant role militarily. A new army was rapidly being formed for Jacob De la Gardie, again stationed in Viborg. It this time included four foreign mercenary fighting units, in addition to Finns and Swedes (seven cavalry and two infantry units arrived from Stockholm to Turku on 25 January 1611).

De la Gardie also claimed that Sweden should take advantage of the ongoing turmoil in Russia, later known as the Times of Trouble, and try to place Charles Philip, younger brother of the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus, on the Russian throne. After some negotiating, these plans were abandoned due to lack of engagement from Gustavus Adolphus, and due to uncertainty on the Russian side.

In 1617, De la Gardie became the chief Swedish negotiator at the Treaty of Stolbovo that ended the Ingrian War, whereby the Swedish Empire was able to secure important territorial concessions from Russia, effectively closing off Russia from access to the Baltic Sea.

From July 1619 to 1622, De la Gardie was Governor of the Swedish Estonia. In 1626, he purchased an estate with a medieval castle in Haapsalu, in modern-day Estonia. His time as governor of Estonia was followed by a time as Governor-General of Livonia in 1622–1628 (conquered by the Swedish Empire in 1621, and referred to as Swedish Livonia in 1629–1721).

After 1621, De la Gardie took part in the Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625) against his mother&#x27;s half-brother, King Sigismund III of Poland (a former king of Sweden), in Livonia, but he was recalled after serving as commander in chief between 1626 and 1628. De la Gardie was an advocate of peace with Poland and acted as one of the Swedish negotiators at the Truce of Stuhmsdorf in 1635.

=== Member of the Privy Council ===
De la Gardie became a member of the Swedish Privy Council in 1613. In 1620, he became Lord High Constable and, as such, he was later one of the five regents ruling Sweden during Queen Christina&#x27;s minority (1632–44). His pacifist and pro-French and pro-Polish attitudes often put him at odds with Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who led Sweden&#x27;s war effort in the Thirty Years&#x27; War after the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632.

As De la Gardie supported many of Oxenstierna&#x27;s other policies, eventually the two leaders reconciled after Oxenstierna&#x27;s return to Sweden in 1636. Although the Marshal&#x27;s Office came under criticism that year, De la Gardie continued to operate effectively, making large profits from leasing royal revenues and from loans to the crown.

===Family life===
In 1618, De la Gardie married Ebba Brahe, the love of young Gustavus Adolphus. His marriage with Ebba produced 14 children, seven of whom lived to maturity. None of her children are believed to have been fathered by King Gustavus Adolphus.

===Death and legacy===

Count Jacob De la Gardie died in Stockholm in 1652 and is buried in the Veckholm Church in Uppsala County, Sweden. 
The town of Jakobstad in Finland is named after him. A shopping mall in Old Tallinn is named &quot;De la Gardie&quot; in honor of him. During the Ingrian War, the Finnish soldiers nicknamed their commander &quot;Laiska-Jaakko&quot; (&quot;Lazy Jacob&quot;), due to the unusually lengthy six-year occupation of Novgorod. This name is still widely remembered in Finland. The siege was thus recorded in a folk verse: &quot;Lähti suvi, lähti talvi, vaan ei lähde Laiska-Jaakko.&quot; (&quot;The summer left, the winter left, but Lazy Jacob does not leave.&quot;)

<doc id="234945" wikidata="Q7438044" url="?curid=234945" title="Scottish Workers' Republican Party">
<text>The Scottish Workers Republican Party (SWRP) was formed by the Scottish Marxist activist John Maclean (1879–1923) in 1923. It advocated the political doctrine of communism, whilst also supporting Scottish independence. This dual communist-nationalist doctrine was heavily influenced by the thinking of James Connolly who similarly believed in socialism and independence for Ireland and had set up his Irish Socialist Republican Party in 1896.

MacLean argued that the break-up of the British state and empire would aid the cause of worldwide socialism and thus he supported the idea of an independent Scotland. This inherent nationalism alienated the SWRP from the mainstream British left though. The SWRP carried on its political activity for some time after the death of MacLean in 1923 but never made any real impact politically.

An organisation which resurrected the name Scottish Workers Republican Party was formed in 1974 as a split from the Scottish Republican Socialist Clubs (forerunner of the Scottish Republican Socialist Party). In 1976 most of the members of the SWRP joined Jim Sillars&#x27; Scottish Labour Party and this SWRP Mark II party also became defunct.

The resort&#x27;s parking lot is adjacent to highway M-553.

== History ==
Popular from the start, the ski area opened in late 1957. It was originally known as Cliffs Ridge, as it operated on land leased from the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The first chairlift, a Riblet double, was installed on the skier&#x27;s right side of Rocket Run in the fall of 1972. Previously, there were 2 T-bars (the original Constam on the skier&#x27;s left of Rocket and a newer Hall Ski-Lift on the skier&#x27;s left of Snowfield) and several rope tows. The ski area was renamed &quot;Marquette Mountain&quot; in 1982. In summer of 2020, expansion of the mountain bike trails began.

The National Ski Hall of Fame is in Ishpeming, about west of Marquette.

<doc id="234952" wikidata="Q6970089" url="?curid=234952" title="National Indigenous Peoples Day">
<text>National Indigenous Peoples Day (; formerly National Aboriginal Day) is a day recognizing and celebrating the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Indigenous peoples of Canada.

The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year by then Governor General of Canada Roméo LeBlanc, to be celebrated annually on 21 June. This date was chosen as the statutory holiday for many reasons, including its cultural significance as the Summer solstice, and the fact that it is a day on which many Indigenous peoples and communities traditionally celebrate their heritage. A proposal to rename the day &quot;National Indigenous Peoples Day&quot; was made in 2017. The bill to make that change (C-369) was still being debated by parliament when the legislature was dissolved. The federal Crown has begun referring to the day as National Indigenous Peoples Day, regardless.

This day has been celebrated as a statutory territorial holiday in the Northwest Territories since 2001 and in Yukon since 2017. It is not however, currently considered a statutory holiday across the rest of the country.

==History==
The day came about after a series of calls for such a celebration.

It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across North America.

In 1982, the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations) called for the creation of a National Aboriginal Solidarity Day to be celebrated on 21 June. In 1990, Quebec became the first province or territory to establish the day as a celebration of Indigenous culture.

In 1995, a national conference of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that a National First Peoples Day be officially recognized. 21 June was chosen as the date because it often coincides with the summer solstice, a time when many Indigenous groups celebrate their culture.

In 2001, members of the 14th Legislative Assembly passed the National Aboriginal Day Act making the Northwest Territories the first jurisdiction in Canada to recognise this day as a formal statutory holiday. In 2009, the House of Commons declared June to be National Aboriginal History Month (now National Indigenous History Month).

On 21 June 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement pledging to rename the event National Indigenous Peoples Day. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde supported the proposed change, called it an &quot;important step,&quot; citing the terminology used in the landmark United Nations&#x27; Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.&quot; The private member&#x27;s bill that would have effected the change in name (Bill C-369) reached first reading in the Senate, but died on the order paper when parliament was dissolved on 11 September 2019. The federal Crown still began using the name &quot;National Indigenous People&#x27;s Day&quot; in publications.

In recent years, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network has broadcast an annual cultural gala, &quot;Indigenous Day Live&quot;, on National Indigenous Peoples Day.

<doc id="234953" wikidata="Q5282545" url="?curid=234953" title="Dispatch table">
<text>In computer science, a dispatch table is a table of pointers or memory addresses to functions or methods. Use of such a table is a common technique when implementing late binding in object-oriented programming.

== Perl implementation ==
The following shows one way to implement a dispatch table in Perl, using a hash to store references to code (also known as function pointers).
# Define the table using one anonymous code-ref and one named code-ref
my %dispatch = (
 &quot;-h&quot; =&gt; sub { return &quot;hello\n&quot;; },
 &quot;-g&quot; =&gt; \&amp;say_goodbye
 
sub say_goodbye {
 return &quot;goodbye\n&quot;;
 
# Fetch the code ref from the table, and invoke it
my $sub = $dispatch{$ARGV[0]};
print $sub ? $sub-&gt;() : &quot;unknown argument\n&quot;;
Running this Perl program as codice_1 will produce &quot;hello&quot;, and running it as codice_2 will produce &quot;goodbye&quot;.

== JavaScript implementation ==
Following is a demo of implementing a dispatch table in JavaScript:

const thingsWeCanDo = {
 doThisThing() { /* behavior */ },
 doThatThing() { /* behavior */ },
 doThisOtherThing() { /* behavior */ },
 default() { /* behavior */ }

function doSomething(doWhat) {
 const thingToDo = Object.hasOwn(thingsWeCanDo, doWhat) 
 ? doWhat 
 : &quot;default&quot;;
 return thingsWeCanDo[thingToDo]();


== Virtual method tables ==

In object-oriented programming languages that support virtual methods, the compiler will automatically create a dispatch table for each object of a class containing virtual methods. This table is called a virtual method table or &quot;vtable&quot;, and every call to a virtual method is dispatched through the vtable.

<text>Middle school, also known as intermediate school, junior high school, junior secondary school, or lower secondary school, is an educational stage between primary school and secondary school.
==Afghanistan==
In Afghanistan, middle school includes grades 6, 7, and 8, consisting of students from ages 11 to 14.

==Algeria==
In Algeria, a middle school includes 4 grades: 6, 7, 8, and 9, consisting of students from ages 11–14.

==Argentina==

The of secondary education (ages 11–14) is roughly equivalent to middle school.

==Australia==
No states of Australia have separate middle schools, as students go directly from primary school (for years K/preparatory–6) to secondary school (years 7–12, usually referred to as high school).

As an alternative to the middle school model, some secondary schools classify their grades as &quot;middle school&quot; (years 5,6,7,8 where primary and secondary campuses share facilities or 7,8,9 in a secondary campus) or &quot;junior high school&quot; (years 7, 8 and 9) and &quot;senior high school&quot; (years 10, 11 and 12). Some have three levels, &quot;junior&quot; (years 7 and 8), &quot;intermediate&quot; (years 9 and 10), and &quot;senior&quot; (years 11 and 12). Some schools run a specialised year 9 program separate from the other secondary year levels.

In 1996 and 1997, a national conference met to develop what became known as the National Middle Schooling Project, which aimed to develop a common Australian view of
* early adolescent needs
* guiding principles for educators
* appropriate strategies to foster positive adolescent learning.
The first middle school established in Australia was The Armidale School, in Armidale. Other schools have since followed this trend.

The Northern Territory has introduced a three tier system featuring Middle Schools for years 7–9 (approximate age 13–15) and high school year 10–12 (approximate age 16–18).

Many schools across Queensland have introduced a Middle School tier within their schools. The middle schools cover years 5 to 8.

== Bangladesh ==
In Bangladesh, middle school is not separated as in other countries. Generally, schools are from class 1 to class 10. It means lower primary (1–5), upper primary (6–10). Class 6–8 is thought of as middle school. Grades 1,2,3,4 and 5 are said to be primary school while all the classes from 6 to 10 are considered high school (as middle school and high school are not considered separate) while 11–12 (inclusive) is called college.
* 1–5 is known as primary (Part of Primary School)
* 6–8 is known as lower secondary (Part of High School)
* 9–10 is known as secondary (part of High School)
* 11–12 is known as higher secondary also known as college.

== Bolivia ==
Middle schools in Bolivia have been abolished since 1994. Students aged 11–15 attend the last years of elementary education or the first years of secondary education.

== Brazil ==
In Brazil, middle school is a mandatory stage that precedes High School () called &quot;Ensino Fundamental II&quot; consisting of grades 6 to 9, ages 11 to 14.

==Canada==

In Canada, the terms &quot;middle school&quot; and &quot;junior high school&quot; are both used, depending on which grades the school caters to. Junior high schools tend to include only grades 7, 8, and sometimes 9 (some older schools with the name &#x27;carved in concrete&#x27; still use &quot;Junior High&quot; as part of their name, although grade nine is now missing), whereas middle schools are usually grades 6–8 or only grades 7–8 or 6–7 (i.e. around ages 11–14), varying from area to area and also according to population vs. building capacity.

Another common model is grades 5–8. Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island junior high schools typically include grades 7–9, with the first year of high school traditionally being grade 10. In some places students go from elementary school to secondary school, meaning the elementary school covers to the end of grade 8.

In Ontario, the terms &quot;middle school&quot; and &quot;senior public school&quot; (sometimes just grades 7 and 8) are used, with the latter being used particularly in the Old Toronto and Scarborough sections of Toronto plus in Mississauga, Brampton, and Kitchener-Waterloo. In many smaller Ontario cities and in some parts of larger cities, most elementary schools serve junior kindergarten to grade 8 meaning there are no separate middle schools buildings, while in some cities (such as Hamilton) specific schools do serve the intermediate grades (i.e. grades 6–8 or grades 7–8) but are still called &quot;elementary&quot; or &quot;public&quot; schools with no recognition of the grades they serve in their name.

In the province of Quebec, there is no middle school section; post-elementary grade 6, the secondary level has five grades, called Secondary I to Secondary V (grades 7 to 11).

==Chile==

There is no proper &quot;middle school&quot; in Chile, but rather an analogous that encompasses both elementary and middle schools. includes grades 1 through 8, consisting of students from ages 6 to 14.

==China==

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, primary school covers grades 1–6 and secondary school covers grades 7–12. Secondary schools are further divided into two stages, junior high school ( or , grades 7–9) and senior high school ( or ), grades 10–12). The Chinese junior high school is roughly equivalent to an American middle school, and provides the last 3 years of the nine-year compulsory education required for all Chinese citizens. The senior high school is optional but considered as critical preparation for tertiary education.

The admissions for most students to enrol in senior secondary schools from the junior stage are on the basis of the scores that they get in &quot;Senior High School Entrance Exam&quot;, which are held by local governments. Other students may bypass the exam, based on their distinctive talents, like athletics, leadership merits or excellent coursework performance in junior stage.

==Colombia==

Secondary education is divided into basic secondary (grades 6 to 9) and mid-secondary (grades 10 and 11). The students in basic secondary, roughly equivalent to middle school, are 11 or 12 to 15 or 16 years old.

== Cuba ==

 (basic secondary, seventh through ninth grades) is the approximate equivalent of middle school in Cuba.

==Cyprus==
In Cyprus, the equivalent period to middle school is called ( &#x27;gymnasium&#x27;), which caters to children between the ages 12 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. This is followed by (, &#x27;lyceum&#x27;), for ages 16 to 18.

== Czech Republic ==
In the Czech Republic after completing the nine-year elementary school (compulsory school attendance) a student may apply for high school or grammar school.

Students have the opportunity to enroll in high school from Grade 6 or (less commonly) Grade 8 of elementary school, spending eight or six years respectively at high school that otherwise takes four years. Thus they can spend five years in elementary school, followed by eight in high school. The first four years of the eight-year study program at high school are comparable with junior high school. Gymnasium focuses on a more advanced academic approach to education. All other types of high schools except gymnasiums and conservatories (e.g. lyceums) accept only students that finished Grade 9.

== Ecuador ==

The 4th and last level of (ages 12–14) is roughly equivalent to middle school.

==Egypt==
In Egypt, middle school precedes high school. It is called the preparatory stage and consists of three phases: first preparatory in which students study more subjects than primary with different branches. For instance, algebra and geometry are taught instead of &quot;mathematics.&quot; In the second preparatory phase, students study science, geography, the history of Egypt starting with pharaonic history, including Coptic history, Islamic history, and concluding with modern history. The students are taught two languages, Arabic and English. Middle school (preparatory stage) lasts for three years.

==France==
In France, the equivalent period to middle school is collège, which lasts four years from the (&quot;sixth,&quot; the equivalent of the Canadian and American Grade 6) to the (&quot;third,&quot; the equivalent of the Canadian and American Grade 9), accommodating pupils aged between 11 and 15. Upon completion of the latter, students are awarded a if they obtain a certain number of points on a series of tests in various subjects (French, history/geography, mathematics, physics/chemistry), but also on a series of skills completed during the last year and on oral examinations (e.g. about cross-subject topics on which they work during the final year of collège). They can then enter high school (called ), which lasts three years from the to the until the , and during which they can choose a general or a vocational field of study.

==Georgia==

In Georgia, the equivalent period to middle school covers ages 12 to 15, from the 7th grade to the 9th and guarantees basic educational degree certificate.

==Greece==

In Greece, the equivalent period to middle school is called (), which caters to children between the ages 12 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th, and 9th grade.

==India==

In India, Middle School is classified as Upper Primary (Class 6–8). Each state has its own State Board. Each has its own standards, which might be different from the Central Boards. In some institutions, providing education for 5th to 10th is known as a secondary school.

The levels of education in India are:
* Pre-Primary – Nursery to KG
* Primary (Lower Primary) – Classes I to V
* Middle School (Upper Primary) – Classes VI to VIII
* High school – Classes IX to X
* Higher Secondary (PUC or Intermediate or Plus Two) – Classes XI to XII

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, middle school () covers ages 12 to 15 or grade 7 to grade 9.

Although compulsory education ends at junior high, most pursue higher education. There are around 22,000 middle schools in Indonesia with a balanced ownership between public and private sector.

==Iran==
Iran calls Middle School Guidance School, which caters to children between the ages 12 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th and 9th grade.

==Iraq==
Middle school in Iraq, which is most commonly referred to as Intermediate school, enrolls children between the ages 12 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. Upon completion of the 9th grade, students take the National Intermediate Baccalaureate Examination, which when passed, students get the option to enter either secondary general or vocational school.

==Israel==
In most of the cities in Israel, middle school (Hebrew: ) covers ages 12 to 15 (7th-9th grade).

==Italy==
In Italy the equivalent is the formerly and commonly called lower middle school (), often shortened to middle school (). When the , the equivalent of high school, was formerly called higher middle school (), commonly called Superiori. The Middle School lasts three years from the student age of 11 to age 13. Since 2009, after Gelmini reform, the middle school was renamed (junior secondary school).

== Jamaica ==
Middle school in Jamaica is called &quot;Junior High School.&quot; It is from grade 7–9 but this idea is becoming rare now so these grades are considered lower secondary.

(They also have a primary school (grades 1–6)

==Japan==

Junior high schools () (7th-9th grade) are for children aged twelve through fifteen years old.

==Kosovo==
In Kosovo &quot;middle school&quot; refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). &quot;Gymnasiums&quot; are the most prestigious type of &quot;middle&quot; school.

== Kuwait ==
In Kuwait, middle school is from grade 6–9 and from age 11–14.

==Lebanon==
In Lebanon, middle school or intermediate school consists of grades 7, 8, and 9. At the end of 9th grade, the student is given the National diploma examination.

== Malaysia ==
In Malaysia, the middle school equivalent is called lower secondary school which consists of students from age 13 to 15 (Form 1–3). Usually, these lower secondary schools are combined with upper secondary schools to form a single secondary school which is also known as high school. Students ( formerly ) at the end of their lower secondary studies are required to sit for an examination called PT3 (Form 3. 7 subjects for non-Muslim students and 8 subjects for Muslim students) in order to determine their field of studies for upper secondary (Form 4–5). [PT3 has been replaced by UASA (Ujian Akhir Semester Akademik)]

==Mexico==

In Mexico, the middle school system is called and usually comprises three years, grades 7–9 (ages: 7: 12–13, 8: 13–14, 9: 14–15). It is completed after (Elementary School, up to grade 6: ages 6–12) and before (High School, grades 10–12 ages 15–18).

== New Zealand ==

In New Zealand middle schools are known as &quot;intermediate schools.&quot; They generally cover years 7 and 8 (formerly known as Forms 1 to 2). Students are generally aged between 10 and 13. There are full primary schools which also contain year 7 and 8 with students continuing to secondary school at year 9 (formerly known as Form 3). Some secondary schools also include years 7 and 8.

After 2000 there was an increased interest in middle schooling (for years 7–10) with at least seven schools offering education to this age group opening around the country in Auckland, Cambridge, Hamilton, Christchurch and Upper Hutt.

==Netherlands==

In The Netherlands, middle school is called &quot;Middelbare School.&quot; It has 6 levels: VMBO Basis, VMBO Kader, VMBO-t, HAVO, VWO and Gymnasium. Depending on your level, you&#x27;ll spend 4 to 6 years in middle school. MAVO students can, if they finish their exams, move to the exam year of HAVO. HAVO students can, after they finish their exams, move to the exam year of VWO. 
Gymnasium is the only level to teach Latin and Ancient Greek, as well as KCV, literally translated: classical cultural education.

Most students start middle school after finishing primary school at age 12. Ages of exam candidates range from 16 to 18 depending on level.

==Pakistan==

In Pakistan, middle school is from Grade 6–8.

==Philippines==

Since the implementation of the K–12 education system on April 24, 2012, middle school education in the Philippines is called &quot;Junior High School.&quot; It lasts for 4 years from Grades 7 to 10 for students age 12 to 16. Some schools, such as Miriam College in Loyola Heights as well as Lourdes School of Quezon City in Sta. Mesa Heights, have their Middle Schools from Grades 6 to 8. It is preceded by a 6-year elementary school and followed by a 2-year &quot;senior high school&quot; program.

Until the phaseout of the 1945–2017 K–10 high school system on June 1, 2015, upon the start of SY 2015–2016, there were no official middle school programs implemented and the equivalent years was simply called &quot;High School&quot; which ranged from 1st Year to 4th Year.

==Poland==

Following a 2017 education reform the Polish middle school called was disbanded. After eight years of mandatory primary school, pupils can move on to a high school of choice, each spanning a year more than before.

Middle school in Poland was first introduced in 1932. The education was intended for pupils of at least 12 years of age and lasted four years. They were abolished by the Polish People&#x27;s Republic government in a 1948 reform. The middle schools were then reinstated in 1999, lasting three years after six years of primary school. Pupils entering were usually 13 years old. Middle school was compulsory for all students, and was the final stage of mandatory education. In the final year students would take a standardized test to evaluate their academic skills. Based on the test results, they were then admitted to a high school of their choice.

==Portugal==

In Portugal, the middle school is known as 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education (). It comprises the 5th till 9th year of compulsory education, for children between ten and fifteen years old. After the education reform of 1986, the former preparatory school:
* 1st cycle () – former primary education
** &quot;1st year&quot; (6–7 years old)
** &quot;2nd year&quot; (7–8 years old)
** &quot;3rd year&quot; (8–9 years old)
** &quot;4th year&quot; (9–10 years old)
* 2nd cycle () – former preparatory education
** &quot;5th year&quot; (10–11 years old)
** &quot;6th year&quot; (11–12 years old)
* 3rd cycle ()
** &quot;7th year&quot; (12–13 years old)

==Romania==

Middle school in Romania, or gymnasium (), includes grades 5 to 8 and the students usually share the building with the students of primary school but in different wings/floors. Primary school lessons are taught by a handful of teachers: most are covered by one of them, and more specific areas such as foreign languages, religion or gym may have dedicated teachers. The transition to middle school changes of that to a one teacher per course model where the students usually remain in the same classroom while the teachers rotate between courses. At the end of the eighth grade (usually corresponding to age 14 or 15), students take a written exam that counts for 80% (before, it used to be 50%) of the average needed to enroll in high school. Students then go to high school or vocational school, depending on their final grade. Since 2020, all four years of upper secondary education, up to the twelfth grade, are compulsory. The education process is done in numbered semesters, the first semester lasting 15 weeks between September and December and the second semester lasting 20 weeks between January and June. Since 2022, the school year is divided into 5 modules.

==Russia==

Middle school in Russia covers grades 5 to 9, and is a natural continuation of primary school activities (almost always they are in the same building with both primary and high school, usually located in different wings/floors). Primary school lessons are taught by a handful of teachers: most are covered by one of them, and more specific areas such as English or gym may have dedicated teachers. The transition to middle school changes that to a one teacher per course model, where teachers stay in their classrooms and pupils change rooms during breaks. Examples of courses include mathematics (split from grade 7 into algebra, geometry and physics), visual arts, Russian language, foreign language, history, literature, geography, biology, computer science, chemistry (from grade 8), social theory (in grade 9). The education process is done in numbered quarters, with the first quarter covering September and October, second quarter November and December, third quarter going from mid January to mid March, fourth quarter covering April and May. There are one week long holidays between quarters 1 and 2 as well as 3 and 4, somewhat longer holidays between quarters 2 and 3 to allow for New Year festivities, and a three-month break between the years. At the end of middle school most people stay in school for two more years and get a certificate allowing them to pursue university, but some switch to vocational-technical schools.

Basic education is divided into (first grade through sixth grade), which is the Spanish equivalent of elementary school; and or ESO (seventh through tenth grade), roughly the Spanish equivalent of middle school and (partially) high school. The usual ages in ESO are 12 to 15 years old, but they can range between 11 and 16 depending on the birth date (a student who was born late in the year may start ESO at 11 if he or she will turn 12 before January 1, and a student who was born early in the year may finish ESO after turning 16).

After ESO, students can continue their pre-university education attending to (eleventh and twelfth grade) or choose a (an improved type of vocational school).

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales, local education authorities introduced middle schools in the 1960s and 1970s. The notion of middle schools was mooted by the Plowden Report of 1967 which proposed a change to a three-tier model including first schools for children aged between 5 and 8, middle schools for 8–12 year-olds, and then high schools for 12–16 year-olds. Some authorities introduced middle schools for ideological reasons, in line with the report, while others did so for more pragmatic reasons relating to the raising of the school leaving age in compulsory education to 16, or to introduce a comprehensive system.

Different authorities introduced different age-range schools, although in the main, three models were used:
* 5–8 first schools, followed by 8–12 middle schools, as suggested by Plowden
* 5–9 first schools, followed by 9–13 middle schools
* 5–10 first schools followed by 10–13 middle schools or intermediate schools

In many areas &quot;primary school&quot; rather than first school was used to denote the first tier.

In addition, some schools were provided as combined schools catering for pupils in the 5–12 age range as a combined first and middle school.

Around 2000 middle and combined schools were in place in the early 1980s. However, that number began to fall in the later 1980s with the introduction of the National Curriculum. The new curriculum&#x27;s splits in Key Stages at age 11 encouraged the majority of local education authorities to return to a two-tier system of Primary (sometimes split into Infant schools and Junior schools) and Secondary schools. There are now fewer than 150 middle schools still operational in the United Kingdom, meaning that approximately 90% of middle schools have closed or reverted to primary school status since 1980. The system of 8–12 middle schools has fallen into complete disuse.

Under current legislation, as also at the time of the Plowden report, all schools must be deemed either primary or secondary. Thus, middle schools which have more primary year groups than KS3 or KS4 are termed &quot;deemed primaries&quot; or &quot;middles-deemed-primaries,&quot; while those with more secondary-aged pupils, or with pupils in Y11 are termed &quot;deemed secondaries&quot; or &quot;middles-deemed-secondaries.&quot; For statistical purposes, such schools are often included under primary and secondary categories &quot;as deemed&quot;. Notably, most schools also follow teaching patterns in line with their deemed status, with most deemed-primary schools offering a primary-style curriculum taught by one class teacher, and most deemed-secondary schools adopting a more specialist-centred approach. Legally all-through schools are also considered middle schools (deemed secondary), although they are rarely referred to as such.

Some middle schools still exist in various areas of England. They are supported by the National Middle Schools&#x27; Forum. See List of middle schools in England.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, a similar system to the English one was trialled in Grangemouth middle schools, Falkirk between 1975 and 1987. The label of &quot;junior high school&quot; is used for some through schools in Orkney and Shetland which cater for pupils from 5 up to the age of 14, at which point they transfer to a nearby secondary school.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council area in County Armagh, the Dickson Plan operates, whereby pupils attend a primary school from ages 4 to 10, a junior high school from 11 to 14, and a senior high school or grammar school from 14 to 19.

=== Gibraltar ===
There are four middle schools in Gibraltar, following the English model of middle-deemed-primary schools accommodating pupils aged between 9 and 12 (National Curriculum Years 4 to 7). The schools were opened in 1972 when the government introduced comprehensive education in the territory.

==United States==


In the United States, middle schools are educational institutions for students between the ages of 11 and 14 years and comprise grades six to eight with some including grade five. Junior high schools are educational institutions for students between the ages of 12 and 15 years and comprise grades seven to nine. However, some junior high schools and middle schools have established models for grades seven and eight.

The junior high school concept was introduced in 1909, in Columbus, Ohio. Junior high schools were created for &quot;bridging the gap between the elementary and the high school&quot;, an emphasis credited to Charles W. Eliot. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8 (and 8 or earlier was often the last year of school for many students, who then went to work), and this organization still exists, where some concepts of middle school organization have been adapted to the intermediate grades. As time passed, the junior high school concept increased quickly as new school districts proliferated, or systems modernized buildings and curricula. This expansion continued through the 1960s. Jon Wiles, author of &quot;Developing Successful K–8 Schools: A Principal&#x27;s Guide&quot;, said that &quot;a major problem&quot; for the original model was &quot;the inclusion of the ninth grade&quot;, because of the lack of instructional flexibility, due to the requirement of having to earn high school credits in the ninth grade and that &quot;the fully adolescent eighth grader in junior high school did not seem to belong with the students experiencing the onset of puberty&quot;.

The new middle school model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, &quot;At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced&quot;.

The faculty is organized into academic departments that operate more or less independently of one another.

The middle school format has now replaced the junior high format by a ratio of about ten to one in the United States, but some school districts have incorporated both systems or a mix of the two.

==Uruguay==

In Uruguay public secondary school consists of two stages, one mandatory called &quot;Basic Cycle&quot; or &quot;First Cycle&quot; (&quot;ciclo básico&quot;). This consists of three years, ages 12–13, 13–14 and 14–15 (equivalent to American 7th, 8th, and 9th grades), and one optional called &quot;Second Cycle&quot; (&quot;bachillerato&quot;), ages 15–16, 16–17 and 17–18 (equivalent to American 10th, 11th, and 12th grades). The Second Cycle is divided into 4 options in the Uruguayan 5th grade: &quot;Human Sciences&quot;, &quot;Biology&quot;, &quot;Scientific&quot; and &quot;Arts&quot;, and 7 options in the 6th and last grade: &quot;Law&quot; or &quot;Economy&quot; (if Human Sciences course taken in 5th), &quot;Medicine&quot; or &quot;Agronomy&quot; (if Biological course taken in 5th), &quot;Architecture&quot; or &quot;Engineering&quot; (if Scientific course taken in 5th) and &quot;Arts&quot; (if Arts course taken in 5th).

Both these stages are commonly known as &quot;Liceo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;high school&quot;).

==Venezuela==
In Venezuela, middle schools (, ages 12–15) are from 7th grade to 9th grade.

In some institutions called &quot;Technical Schools&quot; there is an extra grade, for those who want to graduate as &quot;Middle technician&quot; in a certain area. This education would allow them to be hired at a higher level, or get introduced more easily into a college career.

==Vietnam==

Secondary school, or Junior High school, includes grade 6 to 9. After finishing grade 9, students have to take the provincial graduating test, which includes sections on Mathematics, Literature and English. The maximum score for each test is 10, with the first two subjects (called the Core Subjects) multiplied by two for a total possible score of 50. Reward points from a vocational course could also be added to the final score.

Some public schools use graduating exam scores and student transcripts to make their decisions. Many other public and private schools require students who apply for those schools to take their entrance exams. The administration team student transcripts and exam scores to decide whether students are qualified based on their admissions criteria.

<doc id="234961" wikidata="Q244282" url="?curid=234961" title="Pygmy parrot">
<text>Pygmy parrots are the smallest members of the parrot order. The six species of pygmy parrots are all in the genus Micropsitta, which is the only genus in the Micropsittini tribe.

Pygmy parrots are native to the forests of New Guinea and nearby islands. They are tiny birds, fast-moving, and mostly green with bright highlights. A pygmy parrot spends a good deal of time climbing through foliage, using its large feet and beak, and stiffened tail feathers. At a little over long, the buff-faced pygmy parrot is the smallest parrot species.

Pygmy parrots are also among the few species in the order (other examples include &quot;Pyrilia&quot; and &quot;Nannopsittaca&quot; species) that have never been successfully kept, let alone bred, in captivity. All attempts to do so have resulted in the quick deaths of the little birds. Stress and dietary deficiencies are probably to blame. Pygmy parrots are among the few birds that feed on fungi and lichens, which play a major role in their diet. Their precise dietary needs are poorly understood.

==Description==
Pygmy parrots are the smallest parrots and range is size from about . They have long toes and long, curved claws. The shafts of their tail feathers are stiff and form projections at the end of the tail. The cere is prominent. The external appearance of the adult males and adult females differ to varying extents in different species. Juveniles are duller.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was defined by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson in 1831. The name &quot;Micropsitta&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;mikros&quot; meaning small and &quot;psitta&quot; for parrot.

The pygmy parrots consist of six species and several subspecies:

Genus: &quot;Micropsitta&quot; (pygmy parrots)

<doc id="234964" wikidata="Q2357020" url="?curid=234964" title="History of Åland">
<text>The history of [[Åland]] can be traced back to roughly 4000 BC, when humans first reached the archipelago in the Neolithic period. Several Bronze Age villages have been found on Åland. During the Viking Age, six hillforts were built. Sweden controlled the Åland Islands from the 1200s until 1809, during which Kastelholm Castle was the focal point of many battles. In 1809, the Russian Empire took Åland and Finland. In 1854, British and French forces attacked Bomarsund. The Åland Islands were then demilitarised until 1906. In 1918, Swedish and German forces occupied the Åland Islands. After the Finnish Civil War, Åland joined Finland following the Åland Convention of 1921.

==Geology and prehistory==
===Paleolithic period===
Around 18,000 BC, during the Weichselian glaciation, a thick cover of ice stretched over Scandinavia, which eventually receded from the islands around 9000 BC. Around 8000 BC the highest peaks of the then submerged archipelago rose from the Baltic Sea. The sea levels would alternate in the Baltic Sea, but a land bridge to Åland never formed, indicating the first humans came by boat or over the ice.

Due to the post-glacial rebound after the icecaps melted, the area around Åland is still rising several millimeters per year, marginally expanding the archipelago&#x27;s surface.

===Neolithic period===
Artifacts of human remains, pottery and animal bones were found dating as far back as the Middle Neolithic (ca. 4000 BC). These are the oldest findings, denoting human presence on the isles by then. Their cultures were Scandinavian, firstly the Pitted Ware culture and later joined by the Comb Ceramic culture. Around this time is when the first primitive agriculture began.

===Bronze Age===
Many Bronze Age villages have been found on Åland. Ceramics and animal bones have been found on Kökar. Signs of livestock have been found from the Bronze Age on Åland.

==Viking age==
Dense settlements were built on Fasta Åland during this time. Large burial grounds have been found on Åland as well. Arabic mint coins from 400 C.E. have been found on Åland. On Åland, there are six hillforts from this period. There was extensive trade with other areas, as far as Arabia. The first signs of Christianity were found from the Middle Ages.

== Middle Ages ==
The first wooden churches were built on Åland. The Åland Islands might have been occupied by Eric the Saint, other sources claim Åland was already an integral part of Sweden. The first stone churches were built in the 1300s to 1400s on Åland. When construction began on Kastelholm Castle is not exactly known, but it most likely began in the 1380s. Kastelholm is first mentioned in 1388. Many noble families lived on Åland. The Franciscan order founded a monastery on Hamnö in Kökar in the 1400s. Åland joined the Kalmar Union.

== Swedish rule ==
In 1507 the Danish naval officer Søren Norby captured Kastelholm castle. Many battles would take place between the Danish and Swedish over Kastelholm between 1521 and 1523. Gustav Vasa made Åland a royal castle county in 1537. He also established three large breeding farm estates. Catholicism came to an end on Åland. The monasteries were closed, and the churches and monasteries had to give their silver to the state.

Åland became part of the Swedish Empire, and many Ålanders were enrolled for war. The postal service was given a permanent route which went from Stockholm to Turku through Åland.

Between 1665 and 1668 the Kastelholm witch trials took place on Åland. Over 20 women were accused of witchcraft and executed.

The first school was founded on Åland in the 1600s in Saltvik.

During the Great Northern War, many Ålanders fled west from the advancing Russians. The Battle of Grengam took place in Åland during the Great Northern War on 7 August 1720.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Russians occupied Åland in 1808. The Treaty of Fredrikshamn was signed by Russia and Sweden. Finland and Åland were ceded to Russia.

== Russian rule ==
In 1829 the Fortress of Bomarsund began construction. As part of the Crimean War, the Anglo-French invasion of Åland took place. The coalition force attacked and destroyed the fortress of Bomarsund during the Battle of Bomarsund. British Prime Minister Palmerston had protested against this fortification some twenty years prior, without effect. The Treaty of Paris forbade the fortification of the islands after the destruction of Bomarsund.

As the result of abundant &quot;Anopheles claviger&quot; mosquitoes, malaria was endemic in Åland for at least 150 years, with severe outbreaks being recorded in the 18th century, and in 1853 and 1862.

In 1882, Lemströms canal opened to ship traffic. A telegraph cable was in use from Mariehamn to Nystad in 1877. The Önningeby artists&#x27; colony was founded in 1886. The first telephone was installed in Mariehamnin in 1892. A Russian garrison was established in the islands in 1906. Some attention went to the earlier Treaty of Paris when Russia, under pretext of stopping the smuggling of arms into Finland, placed considerable naval and military forces on the islands. The secret Treaty of Björkö (Russia and Germany), which gave Russia a free hand to install military forces on the islands, was signed in 1907. 

=== World War I ===
World War I broke out, and Russia began building fortifications on Åland. Fortifications would be built on Saggö, Börkö, Sålis, Frebbenby, Mellantrop, Kungsö, Korsö, Herrö, Storklobb and Kökar. Many Ålanders wanted to join Sweden. A referendum was held on Åland, and 95% were willing to join Sweden. Finland declared independence from Russia in 1917, and sent troops to take over Åland. Sweden sent troops to Åland on 13 February 1918. The Finnish Whites took Boxö and Saggö. Finnish Reds landed on Åland on 17 February 1918. The Finnish Whites and Reds fought over Godby, and the Whites won. Germans landed on Åland on 28 February 1918.

== Interwar period ==
In 1918 the islanders internationally pled to reunite with Sweden. In 1919 Sweden brought the question before the Paris Peace Conference on 18 March, but the islands remained part of Finland. Also in 1919, the 1919 Ålandic status referendum took place, where the islanders had an unofficial referendum to integrate into Sweden. In 1921 the Åland convention re-established the demilitarised status of the islands.

<doc id="234968" wikidata="Q7868574" url="?curid=234968" title="USS Coronado (PF-38)">
<text>USS &quot;Coronado&quot; (PG-146/PF-38), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy named for Coronado, California, a city adjacent to Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. After World War II service in the U.S. Navy, she served in the Soviet Navy as EK-8 and later in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as Sugi&quot; (PF-5)and Sugi&quot; (PF-285).

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally classified as a patrol gunboat, PG-146, &quot;Coronado&quot; was reclassified as a patrol frigate on 15 April 1943. She was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC Type T. S2-S2-AQ1) on 6 May 1943. She was launched on 17 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. J. R. Crutchfield, and commissioned on 17 November 1943.

==Service history==

===U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944–1945===
&quot;Coronado&quot; sailed from San Diego, California, on 8 February 1944, for convoy escort duty to Nouméa, New Caledonia, and Cairns, Australia, en route to New Guinea, arriving there on 25 March. After escorting troop and cargo transports to Manus to support the landings there, she returned to the New Guinea area for the operations in the western part of that island, taking part in the landings on Biak from 28 May to 17 June, at Cape Sansapor from 15 to 18 August, and on Morotai on 15 September.

&quot;Coronado&quot; sailed from Humboldt Bay on 10 October 1944, to join in the Leyte operation, and served on escort and patrol duty between Leyte and New Guinea until 15 December 1944. She arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 24 January 1945 for an of her main engines and boilers and various modifications, followed by refresher training in Casco Bay, Maine. On 28 March 1945, Escort Division 25, consisting of &quot;Coronado&quot; and her sister ships (the flagship), , , , and , departed Casco Bay bound for Seattle, Washington, via the Panama Canal, arriving at Seattle on 26 April 1945. She was moored at the Lake Union Lumber Company Pier there from 30 April to 16 May 1945, undergoing voyage repairs and further alterations by Pacific Electric contractors. In late May and early June 1945, she underwent tests and loaded ammunition.

The six patrol frigates of Escort Division 25 got underway for Kodiak in the Territory of Alaska on 7 June 1945. &quot;Ogden&quot; had to return to Seattle for repairs, but &quot;Coronado&quot; and the other four frigates arrived at Womens Bay, Kodiak, on 11 June 1945. On 13 June 1945, 43 of her men transferred ashore for reassignment, and later that day &quot;Coronado&quot;, &quot;Long Beach&quot;, &quot;Belfast&quot;, &quot;Glendale&quot;, &quot;San Pedro&quot;, and their sister ships , , , and got underway from Kodiak for Cold Bay, Alaska, where they arrived on 14 June 1945 to participate in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan.

On 16 June 1945, &quot;Coronado&quot;″s ship″s doctor and two of her deck officers transferred ashore for reassignment and, after she passed a material inspection on 17 June, two Soviet Navy officers and 48 Soviet sailors reported aboard for training on 18 June 1945. On 25 June, she received four more Soviet officers – one of them designated to serve as her commanding officer after her transfer to the Soviet Navy – and 45 more Soviet sailors for training, and by 1 July 1945, her entire Soviet crew of 12 officers and 178 enlisted men was aboard. Most of her American crew transferred off the ship at the same time, leaving her with a nucleus American crew of four officers and 44 enlisted men to decommission her.

Training of &quot;Coronado&quot;″s new Soviet Navy crew began on 26 June 1945, and she put to sea with them aboard for the first time on 28 June. Soviet crewmen conducted gunnery practice that day, and the Americans aboard demonstrated fueling, towing at sea, and use of her sonar equipment on 29 June 1945. On 30 June, the Soviet crew took complete control of the operation of the ship. Long days of training continued every day until completed on 8 July 1945. Three days of fueling and provisioning &quot;Coronado&quot; followed in preparation for her formal transfer to the Soviet Navy.

===Soviet Navy, 1945–1949===
&quot;Coronado&quot; was decommissioned 12 July 1945, at Cold Bay, and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with nine of her sister ships, the first group of 10 patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a &quot;storozhevoi korabl&quot; (&quot;escort ship&quot;) and renamed EK-8 in Soviet service. On 15 July 1945, &quot;EK-8&quot; departed Cold Bay in company with her nine sister ships – &quot;EK-1&quot; (ex-&quot;Charlottesville&quot;), &quot;EK-2&quot; (ex-&quot;Long Beach&quot;), &quot;EK-3&quot; (ex-&quot;Belfast&quot;), &quot;EK-4&quot; (ex-&quot;Machias&quot;), &quot;EK-5&quot; (ex-&quot;San Pedro&quot;), &quot;EK-6&quot; (ex-&quot;Glendale&quot;), &quot;EK-7&quot; (ex-&quot;Sandusky&quot;), &quot;EK-9&quot; (ex-&quot;Allentown&quot;), and &quot;EK-10&quot; (ex-&quot;Ogden&quot;) – bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union. &quot;EK-8&quot; served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.

In February 1946, the United States began negotiations with the Soviet Union for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Navy for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, &quot;EK-8&quot; among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships was protracted, but the Soviet Union finally returned &quot;EK-8&quot; to the United States at Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 October 1949.

===Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953–1971===

Returning to her original name, &quot;Coronado&quot; was placed in reserve at Yokosuka until 14 January 1953, when she became one of the first ships the United States loaned to Japan under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program to serve in the Japanese Safety Security Force as . She simultaneously was assigned to the 2nd Fleet, which was created that day, along with her sister ship &quot;Matsu&quot; (ex-, similarly lent to Japan. &quot;Sugi&quot; and &quot;Matsu&quot; were assigned to the Yokosuka District Force. On 1 April 1953, the 2nd Fleet became part of the newly created 1st Fleet Group. The 2nd Fleet later was renamed the 2nd Escort Corps.

In 1954, the Safety Security Force became the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). On 10 May 1957, the 2nd Escort Corps was abolished and its ships became part of the new 1st Training Corps, under which &quot;Sugi&quot; participated in the 1st Training Corps&#x27;s first two oceanic training voyages.&quot;Sugi&quot; was redesignated PF-285 on 1 September 1957 and was transferred to the Kure District Force on 10 December 1964.

The JMSDF decommissioned &quot;Sugi&quot; on 31 March 1969 and returned her to U.S. custody on 9 July 1971. The United States subsequently allocated her to Japan for use as a target ship, and a JMSDF escort ship sank her as a target in the Pacific Ocean south of Nojimazaki on 10 August 1971.

==Awards==
The U.S. Navy awarded &quot;Coronado&quot; four battle stars for her World War II service, for the Bismarck Archipelago operation, the Hollandia operation, the Western New Guinea operation, and the Leyte Gulf operation.

<text>The following is a list of indefinite integrals (antiderivatives) of expressions involving the inverse trigonometric functions. For a complete list of integral formulas, see lists of integrals.

* The inverse trigonometric functions are also known as the &quot;arc functions&quot;.
* &quot;C&quot; is used for the arbitrary constant of integration that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus each function has an infinite number of antiderivatives.
* There are three common notations for inverse trigonometric functions. The arcsine function, for instance, could be written as &quot;sin−1&quot;, &quot;asin&quot;, or, as is used on this page, &quot;arcsin&quot;.

<doc id="234977" wikidata="Q2479292" url="?curid=234977" title="Paul Bernardo">
<text>Paul Kenneth Bernardo (born August 27, 1964), also known as Paul Jason Teale, is a Canadian serial rapist and serial killer dubbed the Scarborough Rapist, the Schoolgirl Killer and, together with his former wife Karla Homolka, one of the Ken and Barbie Killers. He is known for initially committing a series of rapes in Scarborough, Ontario, a district of Toronto, between 1987 and 1990, before committing three murders with Homolka; among these victims was Karla&#x27;s younger sister, Tammy Homolka.

After his capture and conviction, Bernardo was sentenced to life imprisonment and was declared a dangerous offender, thus making it unlikely that he will ever be released from prison. Following his conviction, Bernardo confessed to ten more rapes committed a year before the spree ascribed to the Scarborough Rapist. Homolka was given a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Bernardo as part of a controversial plea bargain; she was released from prison in 2005. Bernardo has been denied parole three times.

==Early life==
Paul Bernardo was born in Scarborough, Ontario, near Toronto, on August 27, 1964, the third and youngest child of Kenneth Walter Bernardo and Marilyn Elizabeth Bernardo (&quot;née&quot; Eastman). Bernardo&#x27;s father often sexually abused his older sister, Debra, in front of other family members, and would eventually be charged with crimes involving voyeurism and pedophilia. Bernardo&#x27;s mother often withdrew from her family due to depression and agoraphobia, eventually moving into the basement.

Bernardo presented himself as being a happy and well-adjusted child despite his family&#x27;s dysfunction, and was an active member of Scouts Canada. Beneath the charming façade, however, he gradually developed pyromaniac inclinations and dark sexual fantasies, one of which involved creating a &quot;virgin farm&quot; where he would breed virgin girls to rape.

After a fight between his parents in 1981, Bernardo, then aged 16, was informed by his mother that he was the result of an extramarital affair and that Kenneth was not his biological father. Repulsed, Bernardo began to call his mother a &quot;slut&quot; and a &quot;whore&quot;; she reciprocated by calling him a &quot;bastard from hell&quot;. Later, after growing weary of his domineering behavior, Bernardo&#x27;s first girlfriend left him for one of his friends. In retaliation, Bernardo set fire to all of her belongings to which he had access.

Bernardo attended Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute and, in 1982, the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), where another notorious Canadian murderer, Russell Williams, was coincidentally two academic years behind him. As his day job, Bernardo worked for Amway, the sales culture of which deeply affected him.

Bernardo and his college friends practised pickup techniques on young women they met in bars and were fairly successful. Bernardo delighted in humiliating his dates in public and engaging in aggressive anal intercourse in bed. His relationships became increasingly violent and unstable, and he threatened to kill his partners if they disclosed the abuse. In 1986, Bernardo was served with restraining orders by two women after he made obscene phone calls.

In October 1987, Bernardo met Karla Homolka while she was visiting Scarborough to attend a pet store conference. The two shared an immediate attraction, as Homolka encouraged Bernardo&#x27;s sadistic sexual behavior.

== Scarborough Rapist cases ==
Between 1987 and 1990, Bernardo committed increasingly vicious serial rapes in and around Scarborough. He attacked most of his victims after stalking them as they got off buses late in the evening. Known incidents are:

* May 4, 1987: Rape of a 21-year-old Scarborough woman in front of her parents&#x27; house after Bernardo followed her home.
* May 14, 1987: Rape of a 19-year-old woman in the backyard of her parents&#x27; house.
* July 17, 1987: Attempted rape of a young woman. Although he beat the victim, Bernardo abandoned the attack when she fought back.
* September 29, 1987: Attempted rape of a 15-year-old girl. Bernardo broke into the victim&#x27;s house and entered her bedroom. He jumped on her back, put his hand over her mouth, threatened her with a knife, bruised the side of her face and bit her ear. Bernardo fled when the victim&#x27;s mother entered the room and screamed. Anthony Hanemaayer was wrongfully convicted of the assault in 1989 and served a sixteen-month prison sentence, but was exonerated after Bernardo admitted to the crime in 2006.
* December 16, 1987: Rape of a 15-year-old girl. The next day, the Toronto Police Service issued a warning to women in Scarborough traveling alone at night, especially those riding buses.
* December 23, 1987: Rape of a 17-year-old girl with a knife he used to threaten his victims. At this point, he began to be known as the Scarborough Rapist.
* April 18, 1988: Attack of a 17-year-old girl.
* May 25, 1988: Bernardo was nearly caught by a uniformed police officer staking out a bus shelter. Although the officer noticed him hiding under a tree and pursued him on foot, Bernardo escaped.
* May 30, 1988: Rape of an 18-year-old woman in Mississauga, Ontario, about southwest of Scarborough.
* October 4, 1988: Attempted rape in Scarborough. Although his intended victim fought him off, Bernardo inflicted two stab wounds to her thigh and buttock which required twelve stitches.
* November 16, 1988: Rape of an 18-year-old woman in the backyard of her parents&#x27; house.
* November 17, 1988: Police formed a task force to capture the Scarborough Rapist.
* December 27, 1988: Attempted rape, with a neighbour chasing Bernardo off.
* June 20, 1989: Attempted rape; the young woman fought, and her screams alerted neighbours. Bernardo fled with scratches on his face.
* August 15, 1989: Rape of a 22-year-old woman.
* November 21, 1989: Rape of a 15-year-old girl Bernardo saw in a bus shelter.
* December 22, 1989: Rape of a 19-year-old woman.
* May 26, 1990: Rape of a 19-year-old woman. The victim&#x27;s vivid recollection of her attacker enabled police to create a computer composite portrait, which was released two days later by police and publicized in Toronto and surrounding areas.

=== Investigation and release ===
In July 1990, two months after police received tips that Bernardo resembled the Scarborough Rapist composite, he was interviewed by two police detectives. From May to September 1990, Toronto police submitted more than 130 suspects&#x27; samples for DNA testing. Investigators received two tips pointing to Bernardo. The first, in June, had been filed by a bank employee. The second was from Tina Smirnis, wife of one of the three Smirnis brothers who were among Bernardo&#x27;s closest friends. Smirnis told detectives that Bernardo &quot;had been &#x27;called in&#x27; on a previous rape investigation – once in December 1987 – but he had never been interviewed&quot;. Bernardo frequently talked about his sex life to Smirnis and said that he liked rough sex. Police interviewed Bernardo on November 20, 1990, for thirty-five minutes. Bernardo voluntarily provided DNA samples for forensic testing. When the detectives asked Bernardo why he thought he was being investigated for the rapes, he admitted that he resembled the composite. Reportedly, detectives found Bernardo more credible than Smirnis.

==Schoolgirl Killer murders==
=== Tammy Homolka ===

By 1990, Bernardo had lost his job as an accountant and was smuggling cigarettes across the nearby Canada–United States border. He spent long periods of time with Homolka&#x27;s family, who liked him and were unaware of his criminal activities. Although he was engaged to Karla, he had become obsessed with her younger sister Tammy, peering into her window and entering her room to masturbate while she slept. Karla helped Bernardo by breaking the windows in her sister&#x27;s room, allowing him access. According to Bernardo&#x27;s testimony at trial, Karla laced spaghetti sauce with crushed valium she had stolen from her employer at an animal clinic. She served it to her sister, who soon lost consciousness. Bernardo then raped Tammy while Karla watched. After one minute, Tammy regained consciousness.

Six months before their 1991 wedding, Karla stole the anesthetic agent halothane from the clinic. On December 23, 1990, Karla and Bernardo administered sleeping pills to 15-year-old Tammy in a rum-and-eggnog cocktail. When Tammy lost consciousness, Karla and Bernardo undressed her and Karla applied a halothane-soaked cloth to her sister&#x27;s nose and mouth. Karla wanted to &quot;give Tammy&#x27;s virginity to Bernardo for Christmas&quot;; according to her, Bernardo was disappointed that he was not Karla&#x27;s first sex partner. With Tammy&#x27;s parents sleeping upstairs, the couple videotaped themselves raping Tammy in the basement. Tammy began to vomit; they tried to revive her and called 9-1-1 after hiding evidence, dressing Tammy and moving her into her bedroom. A few hours later, Tammy was pronounced dead at St. Catharines General Hospital without regaining consciousness.

Despite being observed vacuuming and washing laundry in the middle of the night, and despite a chemical burn on Tammy&#x27;s face, the Regional Municipality of Niagara coroner and Karla&#x27;s family accepted the couple&#x27;s version of events. The official cause of Tammy&#x27;s death was ruled accidental, the result of choking on vomit after consumption of alcohol. After Tammy&#x27;s death, Bernardo and Karla videotaped themselves engaging in sexual intercourse, with Karla wearing Tammy&#x27;s clothing and pretending to be her. They moved out of the Homolka house to a rented bungalow in Port Dalhousie to allow Karla&#x27;s parents to grieve.

During Tammy&#x27;s funeral, it was later reported that Bernardo was seen caressing her body in its open casket. Inside the casket, Bernardo and Karla placed a copy of their wedding invitation, which showed a photo of the couple grinning, along with a note. These items were discovered when Tammy&#x27;s body was exhumed three years later and were removed at the request of the Homolka family.

In 2001, the magazine &quot;Elm Street&quot; published an article in which it implied that forensic evidence proved that Tammy&#x27;s death was not an accident and that her sister had deliberately administered an overdose of halothane. The publication described Karla as a &quot;malignant narcissist&quot; who was so incensed by her fiancé&#x27;s attraction to her sister that she removed Tammy from his affections permanently.

===Leslie Mahaffy===

Early in the morning on June 15, 1991, while detouring through Burlington to steal licence plates, Bernardo came across 14-year-old Leslie Mahaffy. Mahaffy had been locked out of her house for missed curfew after attending a friend&#x27;s wake. Bernardo left his car and approached Mahaffy, saying that he wanted to break into a neighbour&#x27;s house. Unfazed, she asked if he had any cigarettes. When Bernardo led her to his car, he blindfolded her, forced her into the car, drove her to Port Dalhousie, and informed Homolka that they had a victim.

Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing and sexually abusing Mahaffy while they listened to pop music. At one point, Bernardo said, &quot;You&#x27;re doing a good job, Leslie, a damned good job&quot;, adding: &quot;The next two hours are going to determine what I do to you. Right now, you&#x27;re scoring perfect.&quot; On another segment of tape played at Bernardo&#x27;s trial, the assault escalated. Mahaffy cried out in pain and begged Bernardo to stop. In the Crown description of the scene, he was sodomizing her while her hands were bound with twine.

Mahaffy later told Bernardo that her blindfold seemed to be slipping, which signaled the possibility that she could identify her attackers if she lived. The following day, Bernardo claimed, Homolka fed her a lethal dose of Halcion; Homolka claimed that Bernardo strangled her. They put Mahaffy&#x27;s body in their basement the day before Homolka&#x27;s family had dinner at the house.

Following the dinner party, Bernardo and Homolka decided to dismember Mahaffy&#x27;s body and encase each part of her remains in cement. Bernardo bought a dozen bags of cement at a hardware store the following day; he kept the receipts, which were evidence at his trial. After Bernardo cut apart the body using his grandfather&#x27;s circular saw, the couple made a number of trips to dump the cement blocks in Lake Gibson, south of Port Dalhousie. At least one of the blocks weighed 90 kg (200 pounds) and was beyond their ability to sink. It lay near the shore, where it was found on June 29, 1991, coincidentally on Bernardo and Homolka&#x27;s wedding day. Mahaffy&#x27;s orthodontic appliance was instrumental in identifying her.

Several days before Homolka&#x27;s release from prison in July 2005, Bernardo was interviewed by police and his lawyer, Tony Bryant. According to Bryant, Bernardo stated that he had always intended to free the girls he and Homolka had kidnapped. However, when Mahaffy&#x27;s blindfold fell off, Homolka was concerned that Mahaffy would identify Bernardo and report the couple to the police. Bernardo claimed that Homolka planned to murder Mahaffy by injecting an air bubble into her bloodstream, triggering an air embolism.

===Kristen French===

During the after-school hours of April 16, 1992, Bernardo and Homolka drove through St. Catharines to look for potential victims. Although students were still going home, the streets were generally empty. As they passed Holy Cross Secondary School, the couple spotted 15-year-old Kristen French walking home. After they pulled into the parking lot of nearby Grace Lutheran Church, Homolka got out of the car carrying a map, pretending to need assistance. When French looked at the map, Bernardo attacked from behind and forced her into the front seat of the car at knifepoint. From the back seat, Homolka subdued French by pulling her hair.

After French failed to arrive home, her parents became convinced that she met with foul play and notified police. Within twenty-four hours the Niagara Regional Police Service (NRP) assembled a team, searched French&#x27;s after-school route and found several witnesses who had seen the abduction from different locations. French&#x27;s shoe, recovered from the parking lot, underscored the seriousness of the abduction.

Over the Easter weekend, Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing, raping and sodomizing French, forcing her to drink large amounts of alcohol and submit to Bernardo. At his trial, Crown prosecutor Ray Houlahan said that Bernardo always intended to kill French because she was never blindfolded and could identify her captors. The following day, Bernardo and Homolka murdered French before going to the Homolkas&#x27; for Easter dinner. Homolka testified at her trial that Bernardo strangled French for seven minutes while she watched. Bernardo claimed that Homolka beat French with a rubber mallet because she tried to escape, and French was strangled with a noose around her neck which was secured to a hope chest; Homolka then went to fix her hair.

French&#x27;s nude body was found on April 30, 1992, in a ditch in Burlington, about forty-five minutes from St. Catharines and a short distance from the cemetery where Mahaffy is buried. She had been washed and her hair was cut off. Although it was thought that the hair was removed as a trophy, Homolka testified that it was cut to impede identification.

==Additional victims==
In addition to the three confirmed murders ascribed to Bernardo and Homolka, suspicions remain about other possible victims or intended victims:
* Derek Finkle&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;No Claim to Mercy&quot; presented evidence tying Bernardo to the presumed murder of 22-year-old Elizabeth Bain, who disappeared on June 19, 1990. Bain told her mother that she was going to &quot;check the tennis schedule&quot; at UTSC; three days later, her car was found with a large bloodstain on the back seat. Bernardo matched the description of a man in the area where Bain was last seen, and later confessed to at least eight attacks in and around the same location. Bain&#x27;s boyfriend, Robert Baltovich, was convicted of second-degree murder in her death on March 31, 1992. During his trial and subsequent imprisonment, Baltovich and his lawyers repeatedly alleged that Bernardo was the perpetrator. The Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside Baltovich&#x27;s conviction on December 2, 2004, and at his retrial on April 22, 2008, the Crown told the court that no evidence would be called against Baltovich and asked the jury to find him not guilty of second-degree murder. When questioned about Bain in 2007, Bernardo said: &quot;The answer to that is no. But the 800 pound gorilla in the room is that it is a life-to-25 sentence.&quot;
* Shortly after Tammy Homolka&#x27;s funeral, her parents left town and her sister Lori visited grandparents in Mississauga, leaving the house empty. According to author Stephen Williams, during the weekend of January 12, 1991, Bernardo abducted a girl, took her to the house, raped her while Karla watched, and dropped her off on a deserted road near Lake Gibson. Bernardo and Homolka called her &quot;January girl&quot;.
* At about 5:30 a.m. on April 6, 1991, Bernardo abducted a 14-year-old who was training to be a coxswain for a local rowing team. The girl was distracted by a blonde woman who waved at her from her car, enabling Bernardo to drag her into the shrubbery near the rowing club. He sexually assaulted her, forced her to remove her clothes and made her wait five minutes during which he disappeared.
* On June 7, 1991, Homolka invited to their home a 15-year-old girl (known as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; in the trials) she had befriended at a pet shop two years earlier. After being drugged by Homolka, &quot;Doe&quot; was sexually assaulted by the couple, which was videotaped. In August, &quot;Doe&quot; was invited back to the couple&#x27;s residence and was again drugged. Homolka called 9-1-1 for help after the girl vomited and stopped breathing while being raped. The ambulance was recalled after Bernardo and Homolka resuscitated her.
* On July 28, 1991, Bernardo stalked Sydney Kershen, aged 21, after he saw her while driving home from work. On August 9, he resumed stalking her. This time, she took evasive action, stopping at her boyfriend&#x27;s house just prior to his arrival. After spotting Bernardo, the boyfriend gave chase, came across Bernardo&#x27;s gold Nissan, and took note of the licence plate. The couple reported the incident to the Niagara Regional Police (NRP), which established that the car belonged to Bernardo. An NRP officer visited Bernardo&#x27;s house and saw the car parked in the driveway, but did not pursue the matter, nor submit an official police report.
* A newspaper clipping found during the police search of Bernardo&#x27;s house described a rape that occurred in Hawaii during the couple&#x27;s honeymoon there in the summer of 1991. The article, the rape&#x27;s similarity to Bernardo&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;, and its occurrence during the couple&#x27;s presence in Hawaii led police to speculate on Bernardo&#x27;s involvement. Law enforcement officials in both Canada and the U.S. have stated their belief that Bernardo was responsible for this rape, but due to extradition issues, this case was never prosecuted.
* On November 30, 1991, Terri Anderson, a grade nine student at Lakeport Secondary School (adjacent to French&#x27;s Catholic school), vanished less than from the parking lot where French would later be abducted. In April 1992, the NRP said they had no evidence to suggest a link. Anderson&#x27;s body was ultimately found in the water at Port Dalhousie. The coroner saw no evidence of foul play, despite the difficulties of determining such factors in a body that had been in the water for six months. The coroner&#x27;s ruling that her death was by drowning – probably as a result of drinking beer and taking LSD – was controversial in light of the circumstances of the Mahaffy and French murders.
* On March 29, 1992, Bernardo stalked and videotaped sisters Shanna and Kerry Patrich from his car, following them to their parents&#x27; house. The sisters incorrectly recorded his licence plate number; Shanna reported the incident to the NRP on March 31, 1992, and was given an incident number should further information develop. On April 18, 1992, while French was still being held captive, Bernardo was spotted by Kerry while he had gone out to buy dinner and rent a movie. Despite failing to track him to his house, Kerry got a better description of his licence plate and car, which she reported to the NRP. This information, however, was mishandled by police.
* In 2006, Bernardo confessed to at least ten more sexual assaults dating back to March 1986, including the 1987 assault of a 15-year-old girl. Another man, Anthony Hanemaayer, had been convicted of the assault and served a full sentence for it. On June 25, 2008, the Court of Appeal for Ontario overturned the conviction and exonerated Hanemaayer.

==Investigation and arrest==
Homolka and Bernardo were questioned by police several times in connection with the Scarborough Rapist investigation, Homolka&#x27;s death, and Bernardo&#x27;s stalking of other women before French&#x27;s abduction. On May 12, 1992, Bernardo was briefly interviewed by an NRP sergeant and constable, who decided that he was an unlikely suspect despite his admission that he had previously been questioned in connection to the Scarborough Rapist. Three days later, the Green Ribbon Task Force was created to investigate the murders of Mahaffy and French. Bernardo and Homolka had applied to have their names legally changed to Teale, which Bernardo had taken from the serial killer in the 1988 film &quot;Criminal Law&quot;. At the end of May, John Motile, an acquaintance of Smirnis and Bernardo, reported Bernardo as a possible suspect in the murders.

In December 1992, the Centre of Forensic Sciences finally began testing DNA samples provided by Bernardo two years earlier. On December 27, Bernardo severely beat Homolka with a flashlight, leaving multiple bruises. Claiming that she had been in an automobile accident, Homolka returned to work on January 4, 1993. Her skeptical co-workers called her parents, and although they rescued her the following day by physically removing her from Bernardo&#x27;s house, Homolka went back in to frantically search for something. Homolka&#x27;s parents took her to St. Catharines General Hospital, where she gave a statement to the NRP that she was a battered spouse and filed charges against Bernardo. He was arrested, and later released on his own recognizance. A friend who found Bernardo&#x27;s suicide note intervened, and Homolka moved in with relatives in Brampton.

===Arrest===
Twenty-six months after Bernardo submitted a DNA sample, Toronto police were informed that it matched that of the Scarborough Rapist and immediately placed him under 24-hour surveillance. Metro Toronto Sexual Assault Squad investigators interviewed Homolka on February 9, 1993. Despite hearing their suspicions about Bernardo, she focused on his abuse of her. Later that night Homolka told her aunt and uncle that Bernardo was the Scarborough Rapist, that she and Bernardo were involved in the rape and murder of Mahaffy and French, and that the rapes were recorded.

The NRP subsequently reopened its investigation of Tammy Homolka&#x27;s death. Two days later Homolka met with Niagara Falls lawyer George Walker, who sought legal immunity from Crown prosecutor Houlahan in exchange for her cooperation. She was also placed under 24-hour surveillance. The couple&#x27;s name change was approved on February 13, 1993. The next day, Walker met with Crown Criminal Law Office director Murray Segal. After Walker told Segal about the videotapes, Segal advised him that, due to Homolka&#x27;s involvement in the crimes, full immunity was not a possibility.

On February 17, detectives arrested Bernardo on several charges and obtained a search warrant. Because his link to the murders was weak, the warrant was limited; no evidence which was not expected and documented in the warrant could be removed from his property, and all videotapes found by police had to be viewed in the house. Damage had to be kept to a minimum; police could not tear down walls looking for the tapes. The search of the house (including updated warrants) lasted 71 days, and the only tape found by police had a brief segment of Homolka performing oral sex on &quot;Jane Doe&quot;.

During a call from jail, Bernardo told his lawyer, Ken Murray, that the rape videos were hidden in a ceiling light fixture in the upstairs bathroom. Murray found the tapes and hid them from investigators. After Murray resigned as Bernardo&#x27;s lawyer, his new attorney, John Rosen, turned the tapes over to police. On May 5, Walker was informed that the government was offering Homolka a plea bargain of twelve years&#x27; imprisonment which she had one week to accept. If she declined, the government would charge her with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and other crimes. Walker accepted the offer, and Homolka later agreed to it. On May 14, Homolka&#x27;s plea bargain was finalized, and she began giving statements to police investigators. She told police that Bernardo boasted that he had raped as many as thirty women, twice as many as the police suspected.

===Publication ban===
Citing the need to protect Bernardo&#x27;s right to a fair trial, a publication ban was imposed on Homolka&#x27;s preliminary inquiry. The Crown had applied for the ban, which was imposed on July 5 by Francis Kovacs of the Ontario Court of Justice. Through her lawyers, Homolka supported the ban; Bernardo&#x27;s lawyers argued that he would be prejudged by the ban, since Homolka had been portrayed as his victim. Four media outlets and one author also opposed the ban. Some lawyers argued that rumours could damage the future trial process more than the publication of evidence. In February 1994, Homolka divorced Bernardo.

Public access to the Internet effectively nullified the court&#x27;s order, as did proximity to the U.S.-Canada border. American journalists, not subject to the publication ban, published details of Homolka&#x27;s testimony which were distributed by &quot;electronic ban-breakers&quot;. Newspapers in Buffalo, Detroit, Washington, D.C., New York City and the United Kingdom, as well as radio and television stations close to the border, divulged the details. Canadians brought copies of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; across the border, prompting orders to the NRP to arrest all those with more than one copy at the border; extra copies were confiscated. Copies of other newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, were turned back at the border or not accepted by distributors in Ontario. Gordon Domm, a retired police officer who defied the publication ban by distributing details from foreign media, was convicted of two counts of contempt of court.

==Trial, conviction, and incarceration==
Bernardo was tried for the murders of French and Mahaffy in 1995, and his trial included detailed testimony from Homolka and videotapes of the rapes. Bernardo testified that the deaths were accidental, later claiming that Homolka was the actual killer. On September 1, 1995, Bernardo was convicted of a number of offences, including the two first-degree murders and two aggravated sexual assaults, and sentenced to life in prison without parole for at least twenty-five years. He was designated a dangerous offender, making him unlikely to ever be released.

Homolka&#x27;s plea bargain was criticized by many Canadians since Bernardo&#x27;s first defence lawyer, Ken Murray, had withheld the videotapes exposing Homolka&#x27;s culpability for seventeen months. The videotapes were considered crucial evidence, and prosecutors said that they would never have agreed to the plea bargain if they had seen them. Murray was later acquitted of obstruction of justice and faced a disciplinary hearing by the Law Society of Upper Canada.

Although Bernardo was kept in the segregation unit at Kingston Penitentiary for his own safety, he was attacked and harassed; he was punched in the face by another inmate when he returned from a shower in 1996. In June 1999, five convicts tried to storm his segregation range and a riot squad used gas to disperse them.

On February 21, 2006, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Bernardo had admitted sexually assaulting at least ten other women in attacks not previously attributed to him. Most were in 1986, a year before the spree attributed to the Scarborough Rapist. Authorities suspected Bernardo in other crimes, including a string of rapes in Amherst, New York, and the drowning of Terri Anderson in St. Catharines, but he has never acknowledged his involvement. His lawyer, Anthony G. Bryant, reportedly forwarded the information to legal authorities in November 2005.

In 2006, Bernardo gave a prison interview in which he claimed that he had reformed and would make a good parole candidate. He became eligible to petition a jury for early parole in 2008 under the faint hope clause (since he committed multiple murders before the 1997 criminal-code amendment) but did not do so. In 2015, Bernardo applied for day parole in Toronto. According to the victims&#x27; lawyer, Tim Danson, it is unlikely that Bernardo will ever be released in any capacity due to his dangerous offender status. In September 2013, Bernardo was transferred to Millhaven Institution in Bath, where he was reportedly segregated from other inmates. 

In November 2015, Bernardo self-published &quot;A MAD World Order&quot;, a violent, fictional, 631-page e-book on Amazon. By November 15, the book was reportedly an Amazon bestseller, but was removed from the website due to a public outcry. In October 2018, Bernardo had been set to go to trial for possession of a &quot;shank&quot; weapon while incarcerated. However, the prosecution dropped the charges when they determined that there was no reasonable probability of conviction.

Bernardo became eligible for parole in February 2018. On October 17 of that year, he was denied day and full parole by the Parole Board of Canada. His next parole hearing took place on June 22, 2021; it took only one hour of deliberation by the presiding judge for his application to be turned down.

In May 2023, after spending a decade at Millhaven Institution, Bernardo was transferred to La Macaza Institution, a medium-security facility in Quebec, where he will continue to serve his indeterminate sentence. The transfer caused controversy and initially the reason for the transfer was not provided to the public. Bernardo had successfully applied to be moved there. In light of the scandal and dismay raised by the transfer, on June 5, 2023, Correctional Service Canada announced it was to review the decision and on July 20, Commissioner Anne Kelly explained in a 30-minute press conference that the review board found the transfer to be &quot;sound&quot; in view of the passage of Bill C-83, &quot;An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and another Act&quot;.

On July 26, 2023, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino was dropped from cabinet and replaced by Dominic LeBlanc during a cabinet shuffle with the media attributing his demotion to the controversy around the Bernardo transfer. The day after LeBlanc was installed, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote an article covering his opinion that the legislation was inconsequential, while Pierre Poilievre, the Leader of the Opposition, said that this was an example of the soft-on-crime policies of the Trudeau government.

On March 6, 2024, MP Frank Caputo learnt there was an inmate hockey rink on the premises of La Macaza. Caputo said &quot;the cherry on top was seeing this beautiful gymnasium and next to that is a weight room. Much nicer than 95 per cent of Canadians have access to.&quot;

Bernardo&#x27;s next parole hearing was on November 26, 2024. His victims&#x27; families were initially barred from attending the hearing in person because of safety concerns, but that decision was reversed by the parole board. Bernardo was denied parole for a third time by the Parole Board of Canada.

== Law-enforcement review ==
After Bernardo&#x27;s 1995 conviction, the Ontario government appointed Archie Campbell to review the roles played by the police services during the investigation. In his 1996 report, Campbell found that a lack of coordination, cooperation and communications by police and other elements of the judicial system contributed to a serial predator &quot;falling through the cracks&quot;. One of Campbell&#x27;s key recommendations was for an automated case-management system for Ontario&#x27;s police services to use in investigations of homicides and sexual assaults. Ontario is the only place in the world with this type of computerized case-management network. Since 2002, all municipal police services and the Ontario Provincial Police have had access to this network, known as PowerCase.

==Psychology==
Bernardo scored 35 out of 40 on the Psychopathy Checklist, a psychological assessment tool used to assess the presence of psychopathy in individuals. This is classified as clinical psychopathy. Homolka, by contrast, scored 5 out of 40. At his October 17, 2018, parole meeting, evidence from expert psychiatric reports found that he had &quot;deviant sexual interests and [he] met the diagnostic criteria of sexual sadism, voyeurism, and paraphilia not otherwise specified.&quot; The reports furthermore stated that he &quot;met the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder and [met the requirement for] a diagnosis of psychopathy,&quot; meaning he was thereby &quot;more likely to repeat violent sexual offending.&quot; The reports concluded that Bernardo &quot;showed minimal insight into [his] offending, which is consistent with file information that suggests [he] has been keen over the years to come up with [his] own unsubstantiated reasons for [his] criminal behaviour.&quot;

<doc id="234978" wikidata="Q313009" url="?curid=234978" title="Chris Isaak">
<text>Christopher Joseph Isaak (born June 26, 1956) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional actor. Noted for his reverb-laden rockabilly revivalist style and wide vocal range, he is popularly known for his breakthrough hit and signature song &quot;Wicked Game&quot;; as well as international hits such as &quot;Blue Hotel&quot;, &quot;Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing&quot;, and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Crying&quot;.

With a career spanning four decades, Isaak has released 13 studio albums, toured extensively with his band Silvertone, and received numerous award nominations. His sound and image are often compared to those of Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Ricky Nelson, and Duane Eddy.

Isaak has associated with film director David Lynch, who has used his music in numerous films. As an actor, he played supporting roles and bit parts in films such as &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Little Buddha&quot;, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; and Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, and starred in two television series: the sitcom &quot;The Chris Isaak Show&quot; and the talk show &quot;The Chris Isaak Hour&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Isaak was born in Stockton, California, to Dorothy (&quot;née&quot; Vignolo; 1931–2021), and Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Isaak (1929–2012), a forklift driver - respectively of Italian and German ancestry.

Attending Amos Alonzo Stagg High School in Stockton, Isaak was class president all three years, student body president of his senior class, head of the all-male cheer squad, and the class of 1974 valedictorian.

He subsequently attended a local college, San Joaquin Delta Community College, before transferring to the University of the Pacific, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and communications arts in 1981.
He also participated in a Japanese exchange program.

After graduating from college, Isaak put together his first band, Silvertone, a rockabilly group with James Calvin Wilsey (guitar), Jamie Ayres (bass), and John Silvers (drums). Ayres and Silvers were later replaced by Rowland Salley (bass), and Kenney Dale Johnson (drums). The name was borrowed from the guitar brand popularized in the 1950s. The group remained with Isaak as his permanent backing band.

== Career ==

=== Music career ===
In 1985, Isaak signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records and released his first album, &quot;Silvertone&quot;, to critical acclaim, including from John Fogerty. Despite being named after his band, &quot;Silvertone&quot; was mostly recorded with session musicians. The album&#x27;s sound was raw and diverse, mingling country blues with conventional folk ballads. Although the album was a critical success, it failed to sell respectably. Two tracks from the album, &quot;Gone Ridin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; for Your Lover&quot;, featured in David Lynch&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;.

Isaak&#x27;s self-titled follow-up album was released in 1987 and reached the Billboard 200. The album saw Isaak hone his style to sophisticated R&amp;B. The artwork for &quot;Chris Isaak&quot; was photographed by fashion photographer Bruce Weber. Three tracks from the album -- &quot;You Owe Me Some Kind of Love&quot;, &quot;Blue Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Lie to Me&quot; –- were used in Episode 5 of the 1987 TV series &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

Warner Bros. moved Isaak to their Reprise Records label in 1988. That same year, &quot;Suspicion of Love&quot; by Isaak appeared in &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;, a hit movie starring Matthew Modine, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Dean Stockwell.

Isaak&#x27;s best known song is &quot;Wicked Game&quot;. In an interview with Mark Needham, an engineer who worked with Isaak on &quot;Wicked Game&quot;, Needham claimed that it took several years to put the track together. It was first released on the 1989 album &quot;Heart Shaped World&quot;, and an instrumental version of the song was subsequently featured in the 1990 David Lynch film &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. Lee Chesnut, an Atlanta radio station music director who was obsessed with Lynch films, played the vocal version and it became the station&#x27;s most-requested song. Chesnut spread the word to other radio stations and the single became a national top 10 hit in February 1991, peaking at number 6. It also reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The music video for the song was directed by Herb Ritts and was an MTV and VH1 hit; shot in black and white, it featured Isaak and supermodel Helena Christensen in a sensual encounter on the beach, caressing each other and whispering in each other&#x27;s ears. Another less-seen version of &quot;Wicked Game&quot; is directed by David Lynch and comprises scenes from the film &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. &quot;Wicked Game&quot; featured as the backing music in the 2001 TV advertisement for the Jaguar X-Type in the UK.

&quot;Two Hearts&quot; from Isaak&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;San Francisco Days&quot;, was featured in the closing credits of &quot;True Romance&quot;, a 1993 film directed by Tony Scott, written by Quentin Tarantino, and starring Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.

In 1995, Isaak split with longtime guitarist James Calvin Wilsey. That year he released &quot;Forever Blue&quot;, Isaak&#x27;s fifth album, and the accompanying tour featured Hershel Yatovitz on guitar. The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album, and the single &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Crying&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. On March 15, 1996, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing&quot; was featured in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s final film, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, in 1999. The music video for the song was directed by Herb Ritts (his second collaboration with Isaak); it was shot in color and featured Isaak and French supermodel Laetitia Casta in a motel room.

Isaak composed a theme song for U.S. late-night television variety-talk show &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;.

The record producer Erik Jacobsen was instrumental in Isaak&#x27;s sound for 15 years. Jacobsen is known for his production work with The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, as well as on solo albums by Spoonful&#x27;s John Sebastian and Jerry Yester. Isaak ceased working with Jacobsen on his 2002 album &quot;Always Got Tonight&quot;. &quot;Life Will Go On&quot; from this album was featured in &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;, a 2004 film starring Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode.

In 2007, a live performance of Isaak singing Fats Domino&#x27;s hit &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; with Johnny Hallyday at La Cigale was released on Hallyday&#x27;s live album &quot;La Cigale : 12-17 Décembre 2006&quot;. At the end of this recording, one can hear Isaak thanking the French rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-roll star, referring to him as &quot;The King&quot;. Also in 2007, Isaak opened for Stevie Nicks on the first leg of her Crystal Visions Tour.

For his 2009 album &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;, Isaak collaborated with producer John Shanks.

Isaak contributed a cover of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; for a tribute album, &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;, released in September 2011. The next month, he released &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot;, an album of cover songs (except for one original) that was recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Sun Records studio.

Isaak performed at the 2015 AFL Grand Final, along with English singer Ellie Goulding and Canadian musician Bryan Adams.

In 2016, Isaak did the &quot;First Comes the Night Tour&quot;.

==== Guitars ====
Isaak revealed in a 2002 interview with &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; that he uses a one-of-a-kind Gibson:

Isaak also plays a Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, which he uses for songwriting.

=== Acting and other work ===
In addition to his music, Isaak has acted in film and television — as a main character or more often in smaller roles. A few of his larger film roles included David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; in 1992 and in the 1993 Bernardo Bertolucci-directed &quot;Little Buddha&quot;, in which he starred alongside Bridget Fonda and Keanu Reeves. Other motion pictures roles included &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Informers&quot; (2008).

Isaak guest-starred in the special Super Bowl XXX edition of the television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (&quot;The One After the Superbowl, Part One&quot;) in 1996, and in 1998 he co-starred in the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; as astronaut Ed White, who was the first American astronaut to do a spacewalk and who died in the 1967 &quot;Apollo 1&quot; fire.

From March 2001 to March 2004, Isaak starred in his own television show, &quot;The Chris Isaak Show&quot;. It aired in the United States on the cable television network Showtime. This adult sitcom featured Isaak and his band playing themselves, and the episode plots were based on fictional accounts of the backstage world of Isaak—the rock star next door.

In 2009, The Biography Channel aired &quot;The Chris Isaak Hour&quot;, a one-hour music interview and performance show hosted by Isaak. The series premiere featured Trisha Yearwood and included their first-ever performance of &quot;Breaking Apart&quot;, a song from Isaak&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; that the two recorded as a duet for his 2009 album &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;. The guests on the remaining seven episodes of the series were: Stevie Nicks, Glen Campbell, Michael Bublé, Chicago, The Smashing Pumpkins, Yusuf Islam, and Jewel.

In April 2010, Isaak was the special guest during Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour performance at the Nob Hill Masonic Center in San Francisco, California.

On September 29, 2011, Isaak received the Stockton Arts Commission STAR Award in his hometown of Stockton, California.

In 2014, Isaak voiced the character of Enoch, the apparent ruler of the town of Pottsfield, in the second episode of the animated television miniseries &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;.

On May 3, 2015, Isaak was confirmed to be replacing Natalie Bassingthwaighte as a judge on the seventh season of &quot;The X Factor Australia&quot;. He joined James Blunt and returning judges Guy Sebastian and Dannii Minogue.

== Personal life ==
Isaak is close friends with Stevie Nicks and the late film director David Lynch.

Isaak is a lifelong bachelor. Regarding his bachelor status, Isaak stated, 

Isaak enjoys drawing and exploring salvage shops and secondhand stores.

During the 1995 MTV Awards, Isaak forcibly attempted to kiss Cameron Diaz against her will, saying &quot;come on baby&quot; and &quot;I knew you&#x27;d come around.&quot; To which Winner Jim Carey&#x27;s response getting on stage was to forcibly plant a kiss on him. To which the visible discomfort and humiliation was evident as he staggered off wiping his lips.

<text>Psy-Geo-Conflux (better known as Conflux) is an annual New York City festival dedicated to psychogeography, where visual, performance and sound artists, writers, urban adventurers, researchers and the public gather for four days to explore the physical and psychological landscape of the city.

==Founding==
Conflux was co-founded by David Mandl of the Brooklyn Psychogeographical Association and Glowlab&#x27;s Christina Ray. The first Psy-Geo-Conflux event was held in May 2003 at ABC No Rio in New York. Psychogeographers from the U.S., Canada, UK, France and the Netherlands conducted experimental walks using computer code, decks of cards and other systems for navigation; a mobile-phone-guided drift through the streets of New York; a life-sized chess game using humans as pieces; several talks and presentations; a noise parade; an art exhibition; and a night of psychogeography-inspired live music, DJs, and video. Village Voice writer Bryan Zimmerman noted, &quot;The event is centered around a seasoned yet growing field of creative recreation and alt-geographic exploration called psychogeography. Trying to define this obtuse field is an adventure itself, although a relatively straightforward definition includes &quot;the study of the effects of the geographic environment on the emotions and behavior of individuals.&quot; One of the boldest characteristics of psychogeography may be its ability to influence and bring together all kinds of artists, social scientists, philosophers, urban provocateurs and spelunkers, and even traditional geographers, in an entirely accessible venue-public space.&quot;.

==History==
Conflux 2004 featured a full program of events over the course of four days, including experimental walks using altered maps and navigational aids; high-tech drifts through the city using wearable computing devices; a walking presentation of an urban documentary project commissioned by the New Museum of Contemporary Art; a gallery exhibition; a series of temporary installations, lectures, audio and video works and more. The second annual event took place at PARTICIPANT INC non-profit arts center on the Lower East Side, and included over 50 participating international artists and groups.

In 2005, Conflux was replicated by Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies in Providence, Rhode Island in an event known as Provflux. An additional Conflux-related event titled &quot;Open Lab&quot; was held at Art Interactive in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The 3rd annual Conflux festival was held in Brooklyn for the first time on September 14–17 2006. McCaig-Welles Gallery in Williamsburg served as Conflux headquarters, with events taking place in and around the gallery. The 4th annual festival was held at in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the 5th annual festival at the Center for Architecture in lower Manhattan, the 6th annual festival at New York University in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development on September 18-20th, and the 7th annual festival was held on October 8–10 at NYU Steinhardt&#x27;s Barney Building, in 2010.

<text>A social movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular goal, typically a social or political one. This may be to carry out a social change, or to resist or undo one. It is a type of group action and may involve individuals, organizations, or both. Social movements have been described as &quot;organizational structures and strategies that may empower oppressed populations to mount effective challenges and resist the more powerful and advantaged elites&quot;. They represent a method of social change from the bottom within nations. On the other hand, some social movements do not aim to make society more egalitarian, but to maintain or amplify existing power relationships. For example, scholars have described fascism as a social movement.

Political science and sociology have developed a variety of theories and empirical research on social movements. For example, some research in political science highlights the relation between popular movements and the formation of new political parties as well as discussing the function of social movements in relation to agenda setting and influence on politics. Sociologists distinguish between several types of social movement examining things such as scope, type of change, method of work, range, and time frame.

Some scholars have argued that modern Western social movements became possible through education (the wider dissemination of literature) and increased mobility of labor due to the industrialization and urbanization of 19th-century societies. It is sometimes argued that the freedom of expression, education and relative economic independence prevalent in the modern Western culture are responsible for the unprecedented number and scope of various contemporary social movements. Many of the social movements of the last hundred years grew up, like the Mau Mau in Kenya, to oppose Western colonialism. Social movements have been and continue to be closely connected with democratic political systems. Occasionally, social movements have been involved in democratizing nations, but more often they have flourished after democratization. Over the past 200 years, they have become part of a popular and global expression of dissent.

Modern movements often use technology and the internet to mobilize people globally. Adapting to communication trends is a common theme among successful movements. Research is beginning to explore how advocacy organizations linked to social movements in the U.S. and Canada use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.

==Definitions==
Mario Diani argues that nearly all definitions share three criteria: &quot;a network of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in a political or cultural conflict, on the basis of a shared collective identity&quot;

Sociologist Charles Tilly defines social movements as a series of contentious performances, displays and campaigns by which ordinary people make collective claims on others. For Tilly, social movements are a major vehicle for ordinary people&#x27;s participation in public politics. He argues that there are three major elements to a social movement:

# Campaigns: a sustained, organized public effort making collective claims of target authorities;
# Repertoire (repertoire of contention): employment of combinations from among the following forms of political action: creation of special-purpose associations and coalitions, public meetings, solemn processions, vigils, rallies, demonstrations, petition drives, statements to and in public media, and pamphleteering; and
# WUNC displays: participants&#x27; concerted public representation of worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitments on the part of themselves and/or their constituencies.

Sidney Tarrow defines a social movement as &quot;collective challenges [to elites, authorities, other groups or cultural codes] by people with common purposes and solidarity in sustained interactions with elites, opponents and authorities.&quot; He specifically distinguishes social movements from political parties and advocacy groups.

The sociologists John McCarthy and Mayer Zald define as a social movement as &quot;a set of opinions and beliefs in a population which represents preferences for changing some elements of the social structure and/or reward distribution of a society.&quot;

According to Paul van Seeters and Paul James, defining a social movement entails a few minimal conditions of &#x27;coming together&#x27;: 
==History==

===Beginning===

The early growth of social movements was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including political representation, market capitalization, and proletarianization.

The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure John Wilkes. As editor of the paper &quot;The North Briton&quot;, Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of Lord Bute and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 Treaty of Paris at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Charged with seditious libel, Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a general warrant, a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful – the Lord Chief Justice eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes – people began chanting &quot;Wilkes and Liberty&quot; in the streets.

After a later period of exile brought about by further charges of libel and obscenity, Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at Middlesex, where most of his support was located. When Wilkes was imprisoned in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan &quot;No liberty, no King.&quot;

Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an Alderman of London in 1769, and an activist group called the &quot;Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights&quot; began aggressively promoting his policies. This was the first ever sustained social movement: it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion; it tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement. The force and influence of this social movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement&#x27;s demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, general warrants were declared unconstitutional, and press freedom was extended to the coverage of Parliamentary debates.
A much larger movement of anti-Catholic protest was triggered by the Papists Act 1778, which eliminated a number of the penalties and disabilities endured by Roman Catholics in England, and formed around Lord George Gordon, who became the President of the Protestant Association in 1779. The Association had the support of leading Calvinist religious figures, including Rowland Hill, Erasmus Middleton, and John Rippon. Gordon was an articulate propagandist and he inflamed the mob with fears of Papism and a return to absolute monarchical rule. The situation deteriorated rapidly, and in 1780, after a meeting of the Protestant Association, its members subsequently marched on the House of Commons to deliver a petition demanding the repeal of the Act, which the government refused to do. Soon, large riots broke out across London and embassies and Catholic owned businesses were attacked by angry mobs.

Other political movements that emerged in the late 18th century included the British abolitionist movement against slavery (becoming one between the sugar boycott of 1791 and the second great petition drive of 1806), and possibly the upheaval surrounding the French and American Revolutions. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), &quot;...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it.

===Growth and spread===

From 1815, Britain after victory in the Napoleonic Wars entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. Chartism was the first mass movement of the growing working-class in the world. It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the People&#x27;s Charter of 1838 as its manifesto – this called for universal suffrage and the implementation of the secret ballot, amongst other things. The term &quot;social movements&quot; was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist Lorenz von Stein in his book &quot;Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)&quot; in which he introduced the term &quot;social movement&quot; into scholarly discussions – actually depicting in this way political movements fighting for the social rights understood as welfare rights.
The labor movement and socialist movement of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of communist and social democratic parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the Russian Revolution of 1905 and of 1917, resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the First World War.

In 1945, Britain after victory in the Second World War entered a period of radical reform and change. In the post-war period, feminism, gay rights movement, peace movement, civil rights movement, anti-nuclear movement and environmental movement emerged, often dubbed the new social movements They led, among other things, to the formation of green parties and organisations influenced by the new left. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the anti-globalization movement. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new &quot;type&quot; of social movement is latent—they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a global citizens movement.

===Key processes===
Several key processes lie behind the history of social movements. Urbanization led to larger settlements, where people of similar goals could find each other, gather and organize. This facilitated social interaction between scores of people, and it was in urban areas that those early social movements first appeared. Similarly, the process of industrialization which gathered large masses of workers in the same region explains why many of those early social movements addressed matters such as economic wellbeing, important to the worker class. Many other social movements were created at universities, where the process of mass education brought many people together. With the development of communication technologies, creation and activities of social movements became easier – from printed pamphlets circulating in the 18th century coffeehouses to newspapers and Internet, all those tools became important factors in the growth of the social movements. Finally, the spread of democracy and political rights like the freedom of speech made the creation and functioning of social movements much easier.

== Mass mobilization ==
Nascent social movements often fail to achieve their objectives because they fail to mobilize sufficient numbers of people. Srdja Popovic, author of Blueprint for Revolution, and spokesperson for OTPOR!, says that movements succeed when they address issues that people actually care about. &quot;It&#x27;s unrealistic to expect people to care about more than what they already care about, and any attempt to make them do so is bound to fail.&quot; Activists too often make the mistake of trying to convince people to address their issues. A mobilization strategy aimed at large-scale change often begins with action a small issue that concerns many people.

Popovic also argues that a social movement has little chance of growing if it relies on boring speeches and the usual placard waving marches. He argues for creating movements that people actually want to join. OTPOR! succeeded because it was fun, funny, and invented graphic ways of ridiculing dictator Slobodan Milosevic. It turned fatalism and passivity into action by making it easy, even cool, to become a revolutionary, branding itself within hip slogans, rock music and street theatre. Tina Rosenberg, in &quot;Join the Club, How Peer Pressure can Transform the World&quot;, shows how movements grow when there is a core of enthusiastic players who encourage others to join them.

== Types ==
Sociologists distinguish between several types of social movement:
* Scope:
** reform movement - movements advocating changing some norms or laws. Examples of such a movement would include a trade union with a goal of increasing workers rights, a green movement advocating a set of ecological laws, or a movement supporting introduction of a capital punishment or the right to abortion. Some reform movements may aim for a change in custom and moral norms, such as condemnation of pornography or proliferation of some religion.
** radical movement - movements dedicated to changing value systems in a fundamental way. Examples would include the Civil Rights Movement which demanded full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans, regardless of race; the Polish Solidarity (&quot;Solidarność&quot;) movement which demanded the transformation of a Stalinist political and economic system into a democracy; or the South African shack dwellers&#x27; movement Abahlali baseMjondolo which demands the full inclusion of shack dwellers into the life of cities.
* Type of change:
** innovation movement - movements which want to introduce or change particular norms, values, etc. The singularitarianism movement advocating deliberate action to effect and ensure the safety of the technological singularity is an example of an innovation movement.
** conservative movement - movements which want to preserve existing norms, values, etc. For example, the anti-technology 19th century Luddites movement or the modern movement opposing the spread of the genetically modified food could be seen as conservative movements in that they aimed to fight specific technological changes.
* Targets:
** group-focus movements - focused on affecting groups or society in general, for example, advocating the change of the political system. Some of these groups transform into or join a political party, but many remain outside the reformist party political system.
** individual-focused movements - focused on affecting individuals. Most religious movements would fall under this category.
* Methods of work:
** peaceful movements - various movements which use nonviolent means of protest as part of a campaign of nonviolent resistance, also often called civil resistance. The American Civil Rights Movement, Polish Solidarity movement or the nonviolent, civil disobedience-orientated wing of the Indian independence movement would fall into this category.
** violent movements - various movements which resort to violence; they are usually armed and in extreme cases can take a form of a paramilitary or terrorist organization. Examples: the Rote Armee Fraktion, Al-Qaida.
* Old and new:
** old movements - movements for change have existed for many centuries. Most of the oldest recognized movements, dating to late 18th and 19th centuries, fought for specific social groups, such as the working class, peasants, whites, aristocrats, Protestants, men. They were usually centered around some materialistic goals like improving the standard of living or, for example, the political autonomy of the working class.
** new movements - movements which became dominant from the second half of the 20th century. Notable examples include the American civil rights movement, second-wave feminism, gay rights movement, environmentalism and conservation efforts, opposition to mass surveillance, etc. They are usually centered around issues that go beyond but are not separate from class.
* Range:
** global movements - social movements with global (transnational) objectives and goals. Movements such as the first (where Marx and Bakunin met), second, third and fourth internationals, the World Social Forum, the Peoples&#x27; Global Action and the anarchist movement seek to change society at a global level.
** local movements - most of the social movements have a local scope. They are focused on local or regional objectives, such as protecting a specific natural area, lobbying for the lowering of tolls in a certain motorway, or preserving a building about to be demolished for gentrification and turning it into a social center.

==Identification of supporters==
A difficulty for scholarship of movements is that for most, neither insiders to a movement nor outsiders apply consistent labels or even descriptive phrases. Unless there is a single leader who does, or a formal system of membership agreements, activists will typically use diverse labels and descriptive phrases that require scholars to discern when they are referring to the same or similar ideas, declare similar goals, adopt similar programs of action, and use similar methods. There can be great differences in the way that is done, to recognize who is and who is not a member or an allied group:

* Insiders: Often exaggerate the level of support by considering people supporters whose level of activity or support is weak, but also reject those that outsiders might consider supporters because they discredit the cause, or are even seen as adversaries
* Outsiders: Those not supporters who may tend to either underestimate or overestimate the level or support or activity of elements of a movement, by including or excluding those that insiders would exclude or include.

It is often outsiders rather than insiders that apply the identifying labels for a movement, which the insiders then may or may not adopt and use to self-identify. For example, the label for the levellers political movement in 17th-century England was applied to them by their antagonists, as a term of disparagement. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.

Caution must always be exercised in any discussion of amorphous phenomena such as movements to distinguish between the views of insiders and outsiders, supporters and antagonists, each of whom may have their own purposes and agendas in characterization or mischaracterization of it.

==Dynamics==
Social movements have a life cycle: they are created, they grow, they achieve successes or failures and eventually, they dissolve and cease to exist.

They are more likely to evolve in the time and place which is friendly to the social movements: hence their evident symbiosis with the 19th century proliferation of ideas like individual rights, freedom of speech and civil disobedience. Social movements occur in liberal and authoritarian societies but in different forms. These new movements are activated by a wish for change in social customs, ethics and values which oppress certain communities. The birth of a social movement needs what sociologist Neil Smelser calls an &quot;initiating event&quot;: a particular, individual event that will begin a chain reaction of events in the given society leading to the creation of a social movement. The root of this event must be the result of some common discontent among a community. Hence, making &quot;emergence&quot; the first step to a social movement. This discontent will act as the chain that links common people together, as they share the same experiences and feelings of oppression. &quot;Within this stage, social movements are very preliminary and there is little to no organization. Instead this stage can be thought of as widespread discontent (Macionis, 2001; Hopper, 1950).&quot; Emergence is prior to any sort of organized resistance to the condition of society. Jonathan Christiansen&#x27;s essay on the four stages of social movement dissects further into the historical sociology of how each stage affects the whole movement. The Civil Rights Movement&#x27;s early stages are an example of the public display of protest that is utilized to push a movement into the next stages. &quot;It was not until after the Brown v. the Board of Education Supreme court decision (1954), which outlawed segregation in Public schools, and following the arrest of Rosa Parks in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to comply with segregation laws on city buses by giving up her bus seat to a white man, that the American Civil Rights Movement would proceed to the next stage – coalescence.&quot; The impact of a black woman, Rosa Parks, riding in the whites-only section of the bus (although she was not acting alone or spontaneously—typically activist leaders lay the groundwork behind the scenes of interventions designed to spark a movement). This leads into coalesce because now the common dilemma and source of oppression is being pinned down, allowing for organizations and appearance to the public eye to be established. The Polish Solidarity movement, which eventually toppled the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, developed after trade union activist Anna Walentynowicz was fired from work. The South African shack dwellers&#x27; movement Abahlali baseMjondolo grew out of a road blockade in response to the sudden selling off of a small piece of land promised for housing to a developer. Such an event is also described as a &quot;volcanic model&quot; – a social movement is often created after a large number of people realize that there are others sharing the same value and desire for a particular social change.

This third stage, bureaucratization, is when movements must become more organized, centered around a more systematic model. The set up and system for going about the construct must be more formal, with people taking on specific roles and responsibilities. &quot;In this phase their political power is greater than in the previous stages in that they may have more regular access to political elites.&quot; In this stage, one organization may take over another one in order to obtain a greater status and formal alliance. This &#x27;taking over&#x27; may be a positive or negative move for organizations. Ella Baker, an activist who played a role in the NAACP, had proposed to the students of the student movement to start their own organization. This becomes known as the SNCC, the student nonviolent coordinating committee (1960s). The students could have joined forces with the SCLC, an already existing organization, but that would have been a poor bureaucratizing decision, as they would succumb to old ideologies. New and progressive ideas that challenge prior authority are crucial to social change.

The declining of a social movement does not necessarily mean failure. There are multiple routes in which a movement may take before proceeding into decline. Success of a movement would result in permanent changes within the society and/or government that would result in a loss of need for protest. Failure is often the result of the incapability to keep a common focus, and work towards the goal in mind. &quot;Failure of social movements due to organizational or strategic failings is common for many organizations&quot;. Such a route would result in the gradual breaking up of an organization, and out of the stages of movement. Co-optation results when people or groups are integrated and shift away from the social movement&#x27;s initial concerns and values. Repression is another example, when the movement is slowly wiped away from the public platform through means of an outside force, usually being the government. The last route into declining is going mainstream, which is generally perceived as an overall success. This is when goals of the movement are taken into society as a part of daily life, making it a &#x27;social norm.&#x27; For example, birth control is still a greatly debated topic on a government level, but it has been accepted into social life as a common thing that exists.

It is important to recognize that though movements may disintegrate and cease to be active, the impact that they have in the social realm is success in its own way. It sparks the notion in new generations that the possibility to organize and make change is there.

==Theories==

Sociologists have developed several theories related to social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. Chronologically they include:
* Marxist theory (1880s)
* collective behavior/collective action theories (1950s)
* relative deprivation theory (1960s)
* value-added theory (1960s)
* resource mobilization (1970s)
* political process theory (1980s)
* framing theory (1980s) (closely related to social constructionist theory)
* new social movement theory (1980s)

===Deprivation theory===
Deprivation theory argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s). According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.

There are two significant problems with this theory. First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived. Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular – often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.

===Mass society theory===
Mass society theory argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached. Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.

Very little support has been found for this theory. Aho (1990), in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached. In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.

===Structural strain theory===
Social Strain Theory, is the &quot;proposal that pressure derived from social factors, such as lack of income or lack of quality education, drives individuals to commit crime.&quot;
# structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems
# structural strain - people experience deprivation
# growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads
# precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement
# lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize
# mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done

This theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism. However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.

===Resource mobilization theory===
Resource mobilization theory emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite. The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.

In contrast to earlier collective behavior perspectives on social movements—which emphasized the role of exceptional levels of deprivation, grievance, or social strain in motivating mass protest—Resource Mobilization perspectives hold &quot;that there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots support for a movement if the movement is effectively organized and has at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group&quot; Movement emergence is contingent upon the aggregation of resources by social movement entrepreneurs and movement organizations, who use these resources to turn collective dissent in to political pressure. Members are recruited through networks; commitment is maintained by building a collective identity, and through interpersonal relationships. 

Resource Mobilization Theory views social movement activity as &quot;politics by other means&quot;: a rational and strategic effort by ordinary people to change society or politics. The form of the resources shapes the activities of the movement (e.g., access to a TV station will result in the extensive use TV media). Movements develop in contingent &quot;opportunity structures&quot; that influence their efforts to mobilize; and each movement&#x27;s response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement&#x27;s organization and resources 

Critics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasis on resources, especially financial resources. Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.).

===Political process theory===
Political process theory is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of social structure that is important for social movement development: political opportunities. Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.

Insurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances. The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust. The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.

Organizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.

Political opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge. This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):
* growth of political pluralism
* decline in effectiveness of repression
* elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented
* a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes
* support of organized opposition by elites

One of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements. Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success. The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.

Critics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree. This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.

One advance on the political process theory is the &quot;political mediation model,&quot; which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of collective benefits.

===Framing perspective===
Reflecting the cultural turn in the social sciences and humanities more broadly, recent strains of social movement theory and research add to the largely structural concerns seen in the resource mobilization and political process theories by emphasizing the cultural and psychological aspects of social movement processes, such as collectively shared interpretations and beliefs, ideologies, values and other meanings about the world. In doing so, this general cultural approach also attempts to address the free-rider problem. One particularly successful take on some such cultural dimensions is manifested in the framing perspective on social movements.

While both resource mobilization theory and political process theory include, or at least accept, the idea that certain shared understandings of, for example, perceived unjust societal conditions must exist for mobilization to occur at all, this is not explicitly problematized within those approaches. The framing perspective has brought such shared understandings to the forefront of the attempt to understand movement creation and existence by, e.g., arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an &quot;injustice frame&quot;. An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world. Like a building frame, it holds things together. It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential – what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language. Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture.Important characteristics of the injustice frames include:
* Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.
* People carry around multiple frames in their heads.
* Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.
* All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.
In emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating. In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement. If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits – this is &quot;free-riding&quot;. A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution. Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.

Framing processes includes three separate components:
* Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing
* Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem
* Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a &quot;call to arms&quot; by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem

==Social networking==
For more than ten years, social movement groups have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of social movement-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, and as a result, it has been suggested that the Internet has had a positive impact on the social movements in general. The systematic literature review of Buettner &amp; Buettner analyzed the role of Twitter during a wide range of social movements (2007 WikiLeaks, 2009 Moldova, 2009 Austria student protest, 2009 Israel-Gaza, 2009 Iran green revolution, 2009 Toronto G20, 2010 Venezuela, 2010 Germany Stuttgart21, 2011 Egypt, 2011 England, 2011 US Occupy movement, 2011 Spain Indignados, 2011 Greece Aganaktismenoi movements, 2011 Italy, 2011 Wisconsin labor protests, 2012 Israel Hamas, 2013 Brazil Vinegar, 2013 Turkey).

Many discussions have been generated recently on the topic of social networking and the effect it may play on the formation and mobilization of social movement. For example, the emergence of the Coffee Party first appeared on the social networking site, Facebook. The party has continued to gather membership and support through that site and file sharing sites, such as Flickr. The 2009–2010 Iranian election protests also demonstrated how social networking sites are making the mobilization of large numbers of people quicker and easier. Iranians were able to organize and speak out against the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by using sites such as Twitter and Facebook. This in turn prompted widespread government censorship of the web and social networking sites.

The sociological study of social movements is quite new. The traditional view of movements often perceived them as chaotic and disorganized, treating activism as a threat to the social order. The activism experienced in the 1960s and 1970s shuffled in a new world opinion about the subject. Models were now introduced to understand the organizational and structural powers embedded in social movements.

<text>Imperial Reform (, ) is the name given to repeated attempts in the 15th and 16th centuries to adapt the structure and the constitutional order () of the Holy Roman Empire to the requirements of the early modern state and to give it a unified government under either the Imperial Estates or the emperor&#x27;s supremacy.

== First attempts ==
From 1434 to 1438, at imperial diets in Eger and Nuremberg, the first attempts at Imperial Reform were undertaken, partly on the initiative of Emperor Sigismund, partly by the prince-electors. Feuds were banned, and discussions were held on a revision of the rights of coinage and escort () and an administrative division of the Empire into imperial circles. All the proposals foundered, however, on the opposing interests of emperor and imperial princes.

Both parties were striving to create a more workable government of the empire, but they were working in opposite directions. The emperor was interested in strengthening his central control; the princes wanted collegiate, corporate leadership in which they could participate. The journals of the time, including publications like the , show that the educated classes that represented the small territorial lordships of the counts and barons () as well as the imperial knights but also the imperial cities and the smaller ecclesiastical territories supported the emperor having a powerful position, because it offered better protection against the demands of their own lords. The emperor himself, however, who from the time of Sigismund&#x27;s successor, Albert II, almost always came from the House of Habsburg, used imperial politics generally only if it served to support his own personal base of power at home.

== Reform measures from 1495 ==
In 1495, an attempt was made at an Imperial Diet in the City of Worms to give the disintegrating Holy Roman Empire a new structure, commonly referred to as Imperial Reform. 
The fundamental idea of the reform was largely based on the theory of political concordance between the emperor and the Imperial States, developed by Nicholas of Kues.

After the fall of the House of Hohenstaufen in the mid-13th century, the power of the emperors gradually declined in favour of the Estates of the Realm, especially of the prince-electors assigned by the Golden Bull of 1356. The autonomous estates had nevertheless become painfully aware of the disadvantages of the absence of a centralised authority on the occasions of threats and armed conflicts like the Hussite Wars.

Maximilian I of Austria was elected King of the Romans from 1486. At the 1495 Diet, Maximilian asked the representatives of the estates not only for contributions but also for an imperial tax to be raised and for troops to be committed for his wars against the Ottomans in the East and the French in Italy. The deputies, led by Chancellor Bertold von Henneberg-Römhild, the Archbishop of Mainz, agreed in principle to a Common Penny tax paid directly to the Empire, but in return set conditions:

# The constitution of an Imperial Government, which placed power in the hand of the princes, with the emperor as a honorary chairman. Maximilian refused this restriction of his authority from outset, and did not consent until the Diet of Augsburg, 1500, after the states had conceded their own Landsknecht troops to him, only to abolish the Government two years later.
# The Perpetual Public Peace established the Empire as a single body of law that excluded feuds as means of politics between the vassals.
# Reception of Roman law: Roman law was adopted as the official law for the whole Empire
# The related installation of the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; (Imperial Chamber Court), a supreme court for all of the Empire&#x27;s territory. This Court originally had its seat at Frankfurt am Main; it moved to Speyer in 1523 and finally to Wetzlar in 1693

Maximilian generally opposed the institutions that weakened his power, but he supported the Land Peace, adoption of Roman law, sounder administrative procedures, better record-keeping, qualifications for offices, etc. Responding to the proposal that an Imperial Council (the later Reichsregiment) should be created, he agreed and welcomed the participation of the Estates, but he alone should be the one who appointed members, and the council should function only during his campaigns. He supported modernizing reforms (which he himself pioneered in his Austrian lands) but also wanted to tie them to his personal control, above all by permanent taxation, which the Estates consistently opposed. In 1504, when he was strong enough to propose his own ideas for such a Council, the cowered Estates tried to resist. At his strongest point, though, he still failed to find a solution for the common tax matter, which led to disasters in Italy later. Meanwhile, he explored Austria&#x27;s potential as a base for Imperial power and built his government largely with officials drawn from the lower aristocracy and burghers in Southern Germany.

=== Reception of Roman Law ===
At the 1495 Diet, the Reception of Roman Law was accelerated and formalized. The Roman Law was made binding in German courts, except in the case it was contrary to local statutes. In practice, it became the basic law throughout Germany, displacing Germanic local law to a large extent, although Germanic law was still operative at the lower courts. Other than the desire to achieve legal unity and other factors, the adoption also highlighted the continuity between the Ancient Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. To realize his resolve to reform and unify the legal system, the emperor frequently intervened personally in matters of local law, overriding local charters and customs. This practice was often met with irony and scorn from local councils, who wanted to protect their local codes.

The legal reform seriously weakened the ancient Vehmic court (&quot;Vehmgericht&quot;, or Secret Tribunal of Westphalia, traditionally held to be instituted by Charlemagne but this theory is now considered unlikely.), although it would not be abolished completely until 1811 (when it was abolished under the order of Jérôme Bonaparte).

== Further development ==

In 1500 six (from 1512 on: ten) Imperial Circles were established with their own Circle Diets. The Circles, originally meant as constituencies of the Imperial Government, enabled a more uniform administration of the Empire to better execute the Perpetual Public Peace, taxation, and the raising of troops. The establishment of the Imperial Circles was a long-overdue response to the administrative impotence of the Empire at the local level regarding the questions of levies, implementation of justice, customs, beggars, poor people, and healthcare (implemented by medical police, or , who took care of the drinking water supply and protection against epidemics). After some time, they also took responsibility for the construction of cross-border highways and roads, as well as many other matters in the early modern civilization process. Wolfgang Wüst opines that even if some aspects remained incomplete, the formation of the Imperial Circles proved to be an essential influence on the development of Early Modern Europe.

Maximilian responded to the by establishing the concurrent Aulic Council (, ) in 1497. Throughout the modern period, the Aulic Council remained by far the faster and more efficient among the two Courts. The on the other hand was often torn by matters related to confessional alliance. Around 1497-1498, as part of his administrative reforms, he restructured his Privy Council (), a decision which today induces much scholarly discussion. Apart from balancing the with the , this act of restructuring seemed to suggest that, as Westphal quoting Ortlieb, the &quot;imperial ruler – independent of the existence of a supreme court – remained the contact person for hard pressed subjects in legal disputes as well, so that a special agency to deal with these matters could appear sensible&quot; (as also shown by the large number of supplications he received).

According to Thomas Brady Jr. and Jan-Dirk Müller, the most important governmental changes targeted the heart of the regime: the chancery. Early in Maximilian&#x27;s reign, the Court Chancery at Innsbruck competed with the Imperial Chancery (which was under the elector-archbishop of Mainz, the senior Imperial chancellor). By referring the political matters in Tyrol, Austria as well as Imperial problems to the Court Chancery, Maximilian gradually centralized its authority. The two chanceries became combined in 1502. Jan-Dirk Müller opines that this chancery became the decisive government institution since 1502. In 1496, the emperor created a general treasury () in Innsbruck, which became responsible for all the hereditary lands. The chamber of accounts () at Vienna was made subordinate to this body. Under , the was entrusted with not only hereditary lands&#x27; affairs, but Maximilian&#x27;s affairs as the German king too.

Maximilian tried to direct the reform according to his monarchical-centralization agenda. Whaley notes that the real foundation of his Imperial power lay with his networks of allies and clients, especially the less powerful Estates, who helped him to recover his strength in 1502 – his first reform proposals as King of the Romans in 1486 were about the creation of a network of regional unions. According to Whaley, &quot;More systematically than any predecessor, Maximilian exploited the potential of regional leagues and unions to extend imperial influence and to create the possibility of imperial government in the Reich.&quot; To the Empire, the mechanisms involving such regional institutions bolstered the Eternal Land Peace () declared in 1495 as well as the creation of the &quot;Imperial Circles&quot; between 1500 and 1512, although they were only fully functional some decades later.

The Swiss Confederacy did not accept the resolutions of the Imperial Diet and explicitly refused to pay the Common Penny, one of the circumstances leading to the Swabian War of 1499 and the Confederacy&#x27;s exemption from imperial legislation. Due to the obstinate resistance of several States, the collection of the tax was finally suspended in 1505.

The reform was more or less concluded with the Imperial Execution Order of 1555, part of the Peace of Augsburg, which regulated more details of the responsibilities of the Imperial Circle Estates.

==Emergence of a national political culture==

Maximilian and Charles V (despite the fact both emperors were internationalists personally) were the first who mobilized the rhetoric of the Nation, firmly identified with the Reich by the contemporary humanists. With encouragement from Maximilian and his humanists, iconic spiritual figures were reintroduced or became notable. The humanists rediscovered the work &quot;Germania&quot;, written by Tacitus. According to Peter H. Wilson, the female figure of Germania was reinvented by the emperor as the virtuous pacific Mother of Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Whaley further suggests that, despite the later religious divide, &quot;patriotic motifs developed during Maximilian&#x27;s reign, both by Maximilian himself and by the humanist writers who responded to him, formed the core of a national political culture.&quot;

Maximilian&#x27;s reign also witnessed the gradual emergence of the German common language, with the notable roles of the imperial chancery and the chancery of the Wettin Elector Frederick the Wise. The development of the printing industry together with the emergence of the postal system (the first modern one in the world), initiated by Maximilian himself with contribution from Frederick III and Charles the Bold, led to a revolution in communication and allowed ideas to spread. Unlike the situation in more centralized countries, the decentralized nature of the Empire made censorship difficult.

Terence McIntosh comments that the expansionist, aggressive policy pursued by Maximilian I and Charles V at the inception of the early modern German nation (although not to further the aims specific to the German nation per se), relying on German manpower as well as utilizing fearsome Landsknechte and mercenaries, would affect the way neighbours viewed the German polity, although in the longue durée, Germany tended to be at peace.

==Evaluation==
The Reform&#x27;s purpose and its level of success have been interpreted differently depending on the period and the scholar. 

Duncan Hardy notes that, &quot;The earliest historians to engage with this topic, who coined and popularized the notion of &#x27;imperial reform&#x27; (Reicksreform), judged it as a well-intentioned partial failure. For Leopold von Ranke and Erich Molitor, imperial reform was a missed opportunity: an attempt to impose nation-statehood on the Empire from above, inspired by &#x27;patriotic&#x27; reform-minded polemicists, which foundered on the particularistic ambitions of the monarchy and the princes, but nevertheless engendered
substantial constitutional shifts.&quot; In his influential 1984 study of Reichsreform, Heinz Angermeier took a less top—down view, but also saw the reformist initiatives as &quot;the product of a dialectic between the Empire&#x27;s un-state-like constitution and the state-forming ambitions of its constituent authorities&quot;. 

More recently, Georg Schmidt, also tying the matter of statehood to the Reform, argues that the Empire&#x27;s early modern development was a kind of state formation, and that the reforms of 1495 &#x27;directed the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation onto the path towards statehood&#x27;.
Another scholar whose approach is close to Schmidt&#x27;s is Joachim Whaley with his 2012 work &quot;Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia 1493-1648.&quot; opines that Whaley brings out many compelling arguments but there are also certain problems: &quot;Indeed, from the 1650s and then in particular the 1740s onwards, this reviewer finds that Whaley&#x27;s attempt to downplay the problems of addressing the Empire as &#x27;state&#x27; has an increasing price.&quot;

According to Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger, different sides in the Reform sought different goals and had different strategies. Maximilian sought to raise revenues to repulse the Ottomans in the East and the French in Italy and at the same time wanted to assert central authority and his ascension provided the direct incentive for the Reform. The Estates on the other hand wanted to make sure they had a voice in the government if they were to provide him with money. Berthold von Henneberg played a crucial role in coording the formulation of Reform laws in the Diet of 1491. Stollberg-Rilinger remarks that Henneberg&#x27;s political platform was remarkably coherent. In the end though, the political frame and future-oriented structures that emerged after the Reform was not the product of a carefully laid out plan by any side, but the result of compromises on practical issues. Stollberg-Rilinger notes that, &quot;Maximilian I&#x27;s rule set the stage for the structural evolution of the Empire in the following three hundred years.&quot; Stollberg also links the development of the Reform to the concentration of supranational power in the Habsburgs&#x27; hand, which manifested in the successful dynastic marriages of Maximilian and his descendants (and the successful defense of those lands, notably the rich Low Countries) as well as Maximilian&#x27;s development of a revolutionary post system that helped the Habsburgs to maintain control of their territories.

Duncan notes that Peter Moraw joins Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger in presenting &quot;the accelerated change and consolidation within the Empire around 1495/1500 as pragmatic responses to intensified consolidation and interconnection within the Empire, which were in turn the products of wider forces (greater military and fiscal demands and demographic growth, among others). While the reforms of this period ushered in a new &#x27;constitutional&#x27; arrangement, in which power was formally divided between the monarchy and the estates, their long-term effects were unintended, and their implementation was presented as a restoration of (imagined) good old customs and order. The notion that structural change was founded upon a unified reform programme contained in fifteenth-century treatises and polemics has also been called into question.&quot;

Brady Jr. notes that, the Empire, now the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, gained most of its institutions, that endured until its final demise in the nineteenth century. Thomas Brady Jr. opines that the Imperial Reform was successful, although perhaps at the expense of the reform of the Church, partly because Maximilian was not really serious about the religious matter.

According to Brady Jr., the Empire, after the Imperial Reform, was a political body of remarkable longevity and stability, &quot;resembled in some respects the monarchical polities of Europe&#x27;s western tier, and in others the loosely integrated, elective polities of East Central Europe.&quot; The new corporate German Nation, instead of simply obeying the emperor, negotiated with him.

Wilson tied the Reform to the territorial and power expansion of the Habsburgs: &quot;The family&#x27;s territorial expansion coincided with the high point of imperial reform around 1520, accelerating and transforming that process. The material power that made the dynasty the obvious choice as emperors, also threatened German liberties. The emperor assumed a Janus-faced position as the Empire&#x27;s sovereign and its most powerful prince. The imperial Estates appreciated a strong emperor capable of repelling the Ottomans, and were prepared to relinquish some of their cherished liberties to institutions they believed would bind the Habsburgs to performing their imperial duties. The Habsburgs accepted greater constitutional checks on prerogatives as the price for a more potent infrastructure to mobilize the additional resources from the imperial Estates needed to meet their own ambitions and commitments.&quot; He calls the post-Reform Empire &quot;a mixed monarchy in which the emperor shared power with an increasingly finely graduated hierarchy of princes, lords and cities collectively known as the imperial Estates&quot;. The institutions and structures developed by Imperial Reform mostly served German lands, while the Habsburg monarchy &quot;remained closely entwined with the Empire&quot;, but deliberately refrained from including their other territories in its framework. &quot;Instead, they developed their own institutions to manage what was, effectively, a parallel dynastic-territorial empire and which gave them an overwhelming superiority of resources, in turn allowing them to retain an almost unbroken grip on the imperial title over the next three centuries.&quot;
