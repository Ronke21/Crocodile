<text>The St. Croix River ( ; ) is a tributary of the Mississippi River, about long, in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. The lower of the river form the border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The river is a National Scenic Riverway under the protection of the National Park Service. A hydroelectric plant at the Saint Croix Falls Dam supplies power to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

== Geography and hydrography ==
The St. Croix River rises in the northwestern corner of Wisconsin, out of Upper St. Croix Lake in Douglas County, near Solon Springs, approximately south of Lake Superior. It flows south to Gordon, then southwest. It is joined by the Namekagon River in northern Burnett County, where it becomes significantly wider. A few miles downstream the St. Croix meets the boundary between Minnesota and Wisconsin, which it demarcates for another until its confluence with the Mississippi River.

Other major tributaries include the Kettle River, Snake River, and Sunrise River joining from the west, and the Apple River, Willow River, and Kinnickinnic River joining from the east. Just below Stillwater, Minnesota the river widens into Lake St. Croix, and eventually joins the Mississippi River at Prescott, Wisconsin, approximately southeast of St. Paul, Minnesota.

===Geomorphology===
The presence of older glacial deposits within the St. Croix River basin proves that the Laurentide Ice Sheet has repeatedly glaciated this region during the Pleistocene Epoch. Within this region these older deposits consist of gray calcareous tills associated with glaciofluvial yellowish-brown sand and gravel and glacial lacustrine silts and clays of the Pierce Formation and overlying reddish-brown tills and associated sand and gravel of the River Falls Formation. Any glacial landforms associated with these earlier glacial deposits have been destroyed by erosion. These earlier deposits occur as erosional remnants either capping hills or buried by the latest advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet over this area during the Last Glacial Maximum.

The drainage basin of the St. Croix River last deglaciated between about 19,000 and 14,000 BP calibrated (16,000 and 12,000 14C uncalibrated). During this time, the Superior Lobe retreated from the maximum extent of the Superior Lobe at the Emerald moraine northeastward to Thompson and Nicherson moraine complex at the edge of the Lake Superior basin. During the retreat of the Superior Lobe, a blanket of reddish-brown tills containing beds of fine sand and silt was left behind by the melting of the retreating ice sheet. During glacial retreat, meltwater drainage from the intermediate St.Croix moraine established the precursor to the St. Croix River.

The retreat of the Superior lobe into the Lake Superior basin created small, proglacial lakes. Later, these lakes coalesced to form a large proglacial lake called proglacial Lake Duluth, within the western Superior basin. The multiple lake levels of proglacial Lake Duluth included the Duluth level and an older and smaller epi-Duluth level. At first, glacial meltwater drained from the epi-Duluth level and a smaller precursor proglacial lake, named Lake Nemadji through the Moose Lake (Portage) outlet into the Kettle River and into the St. Croix River. The flow of glacial meltwater from glacial Lake Nemadji and Lake epi-Duluth during the retreat of the Superior Lobe caused the rapid entrenchment of the St. Croix River and formation of a strath terrace, known as the &quot;Chengwatana surface&quot;. As the Superior Lobe retreated, the Duluth level was established when another outlet, the Brule outlet, opened and the Moose Lake outlet was abandoned. The opening of the Brule outlet allowed a massive and sudden outflow of glacial meltwater through the Brule outlet and down St. Croix River and excavation of a deep inner channel, which includes &quot;the Dalles&quot;, into the Chengwatana surface. This massive flow of meltwater also created the giant potholes of Interstate Park between 10,800 and 10,600 BP calibrated. The Brule outlet was abandoned when Lake Superior Lobe retreated from the Keweenaw Peninsula and opened lower eastward draining outlets. This caused the Duluth level to drop abruptly to post-Duluth levels and water to cease flowing into Brule outlet and down the St. Croix River. The cessation of water outflow through the Brule outlet disconnected the St. Croix River from the Lake Superior basin and created the northward flowing Bois Brule River.

==Conservation efforts==
The St. Croix River was one of the original eight rivers to have significant portions placed under protection by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. The upper reaches of the river in Wisconsin below the St. Croix Flowage, downstream from its source, as well as the Namekagon River, are protected as the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. The free-flowing nature of the river is interrupted only by the hydroelectric Saint Croix Falls Dam operated by the Northern States Power Company at St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.

The lower below the dam, including both sides of the river along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, were protected as part of the Lower St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. This area includes the Dalles of the St. Croix River, a scenic gorge located near Interstate Park, south of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.

Although the addition of an interstate bridge connected to MN Highway 36 was objected to by residents, nearby communities, conservation groups, and the National Park Service, construction of the bridge was authorized by amending the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Light and noise pollution are concerns of those opposed to the bridge, who cites the original act that kept such activity to the south along the Interstate 94 corridor. The St. Croix Crossing bridge was ultimately completed in August 2017.

The Wild Rivers Conservancy of the St. Croix &amp; Namekagon is a watershed-wide non-profit advocating for conservation throughout the watershed. Founded in 1911 as an all-volunteer citizens group, it has evolved into a staffed, mature nonprofit organization and official &quot;friends group&quot; of the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. Its mission is to inspire stewardship to forever ensure the rare ecological integrity of the St. Croix and Namekagon Riverway.
==Naming==

Father Louis Hennepin wrote in 1683, from information probably provided by Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut: &quot;There is another River which falls ... into the Meschasipi ... We named it &quot;The River of the Grave&quot;, or &quot;Mausoleum&quot; because the Savages buried there one of their Men ... who was bitten by a Rattlesnake.&quot; In the original French, this is translated as &quot;Rivière Tombeaux&quot;.

Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin&#x27;s 1688 map recorded a &quot;Fort St. Croix&quot; on the upper reaches of the river. The name &quot;Rivière de Sainte-Croix&quot; was applied to the river sometime in 1688 or 1689, and this more auspicious name supplanted Father Hennepin&#x27;s earlier designation.

On &quot;&quot; (1718) by Guillaume Delisle and on &quot;A Map of North America &quot; (1768) by John Blair, the St. Croix River—more specifically what was then known as the east branch of the St. Croix River (known today as the Namekagon River)—is shown as the &quot;Ouasisacadeba&quot;, a French representation of the Dakota name for the St. Croix River. On the 1778 Mitchell Map, the river is simply titled &quot;Ouadeba&quot;, which represents the Dakota &quot;watpá&quot; meaning &quot;river&quot;.

The upper portion of the river—originally called the north branch of the St. Croix River—was known to the Ojibwa as &quot;Manoominikeshiinh-ziibi&quot; (Ricing-Rail River). Downstream of its confluence with the Namekagon, the Ojibwa renamed the river as &quot;Gichi-ziibi&quot; (Big River) or &quot;Okijii-ziibi&quot; (Pipestem River)

At the time of the European settlement of the valley, Dakota and Ojibwe were engaged in a long and deadly war with each other. Consequently, the portion of the river below the confluence with Trade River is called &quot;Jiibayaatig-ziibi&quot; (Grave-marker River) in the Ojibwe language, reinforcing the earlier &quot;Rivière Tombeaux&quot; name in their language.

On &quot;Map of the Territories of Michigan and Ouisconsin&quot; (1830) by John Farmer, the St. Croix River is shown as the &quot;Chippewa River&quot;. However, by 1843, Joseph Nicollet&#x27;s &quot;Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi River&quot; reinforced the name provided by Franquelin&#x27;s 1688 map.

==History==
The river is the result of geologic forces going back 1.1 billion years. At that time, the Mid-Continent Rift rendered the middle of North America apart, creating a volcanic zone. The lava spewed forth cooled into hard basalt. That basalt is what today creates the dramatic cliffs around the Interstate State Parks. About 500 million years ago, a shallow sea covered the area, laying down layers of sand and minerals that make up much of the sandstone bluffs now seen along the river. In the last 20,000 years, glaciers have scraped the landscape and released torrents of meltwater, which carved the St. Croix River&#x27;s course.

The river has been home to people for thousands of years. A bison kill site in May Township, Washington County, Minnesota is believed to be about 4,000 years old. An Oneota village from about 1200 A.D. has been studied by archaeologists.

At the time of European arrival in the region, the river valley and the surrounding area was occupied by the semi-nomadic Ojibwe, Dakota and nine other American Indian tribes. The Indians lived mainly on wild rice, fish, and game. By the 18th century, the Ojibwe and Dakota were the two primary tribes that inhabited the area, until around 1745, when the Dakota have driven out from the St. Croix Valley as a result of the Battle of Kathio.

===Fur trade===
The first Europeans to arrive in the area were Sieur du Lhut and his men in the fall and winter of 1679–1680. For the next eighty years, the area was primarily under French influence, and the fur trade grew throughout the first half of the 18th century, with beaver pelts as the prize trade good. French trade in the upper valley was dominated by the Ojibwe and tied to Lake Superior traders, whereas in the lower valley the Dakota assisted in trading with merchants based out of St. Louis downstream. After the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, British traders entered the area and grew in numbers and influence with the help of the powerful North West Company.

===Logging===
The 1837 Treaty of St. Peters with the Ojibwe was signed at St. Peters (now Mendota) which ceded to the United States government a vast tract of land in what today is north central Wisconsin and central Minnesota, roughly bounded by the Prairie du Chien Line in the south, Mississippi River in the west, St. Croix and Chippewa River watersheds in the north, and a 25-mile parallel east of the Wisconsin River in the east. This opened the region to logging. The river was important to the transportation of lumber downstream, from the areas where it was being cut to the sawmills that processed it. During the 1840s, important sawmills were located at St. Croix Falls and Marine on St. Croix, but as the 1850s progressed Stillwater became the primary lumber destination. During this time the population of Stillwater boomed, several additional sawmills were opened, and the town saw an influx of capital, primarily from lumber companies based downriver in St. Louis, Missouri.
In 1856 construction began on a booming site two miles north of Stillwater, which was used to store and sort the lumber floating downstream and remained in operation for over fifty years. The St. Croix Boom Site is now a wayside rest and National Historic Landmark along Minnesota State Highway 95.

The vast white pine forests in the upper valley provided the forest products that built the towns along with Lake St. Croix, Minneapolis, and St. Paul; the St. Croix along with the forest reserves in the river valleys of the nearby Red Cedar, Chippewa, and Rum provided supplies for the building of Winona, Minnesota, Davenport, Iowa, Rock Island, Illinois, and St. Louis.

The lumber industry continued to grow throughout the latter half of the 19th century, with progressively larger spring drives and consequent dangers to navigation on the river above Stillwater. Logs were frequently caught in log jams at the narrow Dalles of the St. Croix River, and in 1883 the blockade was so severe it took almost two months before the flow of logs was re-established. The 1886 jam, described as the &quot;jammedest jam&quot;, required the use of steamboats and dynamite to clear. At its peak in 1890, logging in the St. Croix River valley produced of lumber and logs. The lumber industry continued until the last major log drive in 1912 marked the end of the rich white pine forests of the area.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the St. Croix River competed with the St. Louis River as a candidate for a canal linking the Mississippi River with the Great Lakes. The US Army Corps of Engineers ultimately concluded in 1913 that such a canal would be &quot;inadvisable, infeasible, and impractical&quot;.

It was along the banks of the St. Croix, in the milltown of Stillwater, that the state of Minnesota was first proposed in 1848.

<doc id="229543" wikidata="Q43255" url="?curid=229543" title="Rio Grande do Norte">
<text>Rio Grande do Norte (, , ) is one of the states of Brazil. It is located in the northeastern region of the country, forming the northeasternmost tip of the South American continent. The name literally translates as &quot;Great Northern River&quot;, referring to the mouth of the Potenji River.

The state is divided into 167 municipalities and the capital and largest city is Natal. The state has 410 km (254 mi) of sandy beaches and contains Rocas Atoll, the only atoll in the Atlantic Ocean. The main economic activity is tourism, followed by the extraction of petroleum (the second largest producer in the country), agriculture, fruit growing and extraction of minerals, including considerable production of seasalt, among other economic activities. The state is home to 1.7% of the Brazilian population and produces 1% of the country&#x27;s GDP. In 2017, the murder rate rose by 655%, making Rio Grande do Norte the state with the highest murder rate in Brazil: 63.9 per 100,000.

Tourist attractions in the state include the Cashew of Pirangi (the world&#x27;s largest cashew tree), the dunes and the dromedaries of Genipabu, the beaches of Ponta Negra, Maracajaú and Pipa, the Carnatal, Natal&#x27;s carnival, the sixteenth-century Forte dos Reis Magos fortification, the hills and mountains of Martins, the Natal Dunes State Park, and others. The folklorist Luís da Câmara Cascudo was born and worked in the state. The state is the closest part of mainland Brazil to the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha.

==Geography==
Rio Grande do Norte is dominated by its coastline. The state is famed for its beaches and sand dunes, and the air is, according to NASA, the second-cleanest in the world after Antarctica.

Two climates predominate: humid tropical, in the oriental littoral, and semi-arid, in the remaining (most part) of the State (including the North coast).
The rainforest which once covered most of Brazil&#x27;s coast had its northern end in the south of Rio Grande do Norte; the area north of Natal, the capital, is under dunes, a kind of formation associated with semi-arid climate. The semi-arid climate is characterized not only by the low level but also the irregularity of rainfall; some years can go by with no or very little rain; most of the interior of the State is part of the Polygon of Droughts (an area which receives special attention from the federal government). There are also many mangroves in the state, and the interior is dominated by rainforest. Rocas Atoll in the Atlantic Ocean, 260 km Northeast of Natal, also belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is contained in the fully protected Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve.

==History==

The first European to reach the region may have been the Spaniard Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The northeastern tip of South America, Cape São Roque, to the north of Natal, was first officially visited by European navigators in 1501, in the 1501–1502 Portuguese expedition led by Amerigo Vespucci, who named the spot after the saint of the day. The Vespucci expedition also named the Potengi (Tupi for &quot;River of Shrimps&quot;) river, whose considerably large mouth contrasted with the nearby bodies of water, &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Great River&quot;), after which the Captaincy, Province, and State were named. For decades thereafter, no permanent European settlement was established in the area, inhabited by the Potiguar tribe.

In the 16th century (between 1535 and 1598), it was explored by French pirates in search for brazilwood. In 1598, the Portuguese built the &quot;Forte dos Reis Magos&quot; and, in the following year, founded the city of Natal. Raising cattle and sugarcane plantation lifted the local development and economy.

In 1633, the area became a battleground between the expansionist Portuguese, seeking to take more land for their Brazilian territories, and the Dutch, who gained a foothold in South America.

After a short period of peace and prosperity in Olinda and Recife, the sugar prices went down in the market of Amsterdam and the region entered into a serious economic crisis. The economic problems led the Portuguese settlers and native Brazilians to revolt against the Dutch in what is known today as the massacres of Cunhaú and Uruaçu.

The religious confrontations (the Portuguese-Brazilian Catholicism and the Dutch Calvinism), Portugal&#x27;s restoration of the throne in 1640 and the reconquest of Maranhão in 1643, lead the Portuguese-Brazilians to undertake the 1645 uprising, led by André Vidal de Negreiros and João Fernandes Vieira. The governor of Bahia promised new Portuguese troops, but most of the rebels were Africans and Amerindians. In 1654, the Dutch were finally cast out.

During World War II, Rio Grande do Norte was used as an Allied airbase from which to launch air raids on German-occupied North Africa.

In 1964, Latin America&#x27;s first space launch site was constructed in Rio Grande do Norte; &quot;Barreira do Inferno&quot; (Hell&#x27;s Barrier), which was often referred to as the &quot;Brazilian NASA&quot;.

==Demographics==
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates that the population of Rio Grande do Norte was 3,568,765 on 1 December 2021, a 14.76% increase since the 2000 census. As of the 2022 census, multiracial people make up 50.9% of the total population. The second largest group composed by white people was 39.5% of the total population, followed by black people (9.2%), indigenous people 0.3% and Asian people (0.2%).

77,916 Migrants arrived in the state between 2000 and 2010, while 71,287 people left the state between 2000 and 2010.

===Largest cities===
=== Education ===

Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools, but English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

====Educational institutions====
* Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte);
* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Norte (UERN) (State University of Rio Grande do Norte);
* Universidade Potiguar (UnP) (Potiguar University);
* Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (Ufersa) (Rural Federal University of Semi-Arid);
* Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN) (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte);
* and many others.

==Economy==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 65.2%, followed by the industrial sector at 30.2%. Agriculture represents 4.6% of GDP (2021). Rio Grande do Norte exports: fish and crustacean 30.5%, fruits 19.3%, woven of cotton 12.3%, petroleum 10.8%, cashew 8.5%, sugar 5.3%, chocolate 3.9%, sea salt 3.7% (2002).

Share of the Brazilian economy: 1.9% (2021).

Historically, Rio Grande do Norte has relied upon sugar and cattle for its livelihood. However, since the 1980s, the state government has realised that tourism is a lucrative industry, and more money is being poured into the construction of tourist resorts, and restoring colonial buildings in major cities.

Fruit is also grown in Rio Grande do Norte, with the state supplying 70% of Brazil&#x27;s melons, and the state is famed for its mango and cashew fields. The world&#x27;s largest cashew tree is located in the state; it has a circumference of 500 metres and occupies an area of 7,300 cm2, making it 70 times the size of average cashew trees. Rio Grande do Norte is also one of three Brazilian states that together produce the world&#x27;s entire supply of carnauba wax.
==Infrastructure==
According to research by Fundação Dom Cabral, Rio Grande do Norte is the state with the second-best infrastructure in the Northeast Region and ninth in the country.
===International Airport===
Augusto Severo Airport has ceased to be Greater Natal International Airport since summer 2014. The new airport, situated outside the city, is in São Gonçalo do Amarante.
Located virtually at sea level (169 ft), with favorable weather and geographic conditions, Augusto Severo International Airport in Parnamirim is 18 kilometers from Natal (RN). It takes its name from Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhão, a native son of that state who died in an accident in France in 1902. The airport has a total area of 11.3 thousand square meters and capacity for 1.2 million passengers a year. The installations and passenger terminals are air conditioned with equipment that can put out 630 tons of cooled air. With an area of 5.5 million square meters, the airport complex operates with 16,482 square meters of passenger and cargo terminals and administrative and maintenance installations. There are 6,224 meters of runways and 61.5 square meters of apron space, providing connections from the greater Natal region to the main centers of the world.
The airport is the only one in the Northeast Region to receive charter flights from Scandinavia.

==Culture==
===Saint John&#x27;s Day===

Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John&#x27;s day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the tropical winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of St Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets. Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil it is largely an urban festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Similar to during Carnival, these festivities involve costume-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on Midsummer and St John&#x27;s Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

==Sports==

Natal, the capital of the state, was one of 12 cities to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil.

The three main football clubs in Natal are ABC, Alecrim and América Futebol Clube. ABC and America are the biggest rivals, and their match is often referred as Clássico Rei (King Classic).

The state is one of the member states of the World Sports Alliance.

==Flag==

The flag of Rio Grande do Norte was adopted on 3 December 1957. It is based on a design by Luís da Câmara Cascudo. In the middle of the flag is the coat of arms of the state, which was adopted on 1 July 1909. It shows a sailing boat at the coast in the middle, representing the fishing and salt industries. Above it is a bar which shows two flowers on the sides and two cotton bolls in the center. To the sides of the shield are a coconut palm to the right and a carnauba palm to the left, connected by two branches of sugar cane. The star above represents the state as part of Brazil.

<text>Phan Thị Kim Phúc (; born April 6, 1963), referred to informally as the girl in the picture and the napalm girl, is a South Vietnamese-born Canadian woman best known as the nine-year-old child depicted in the Pulitzer Prize–winning photograph, titled &quot;The Terror of War&quot;, taken at Trảng Bàng during the Vietnam War on June 8, 1972.

The image, taken for the Associated Press by a 21-year-old Vietnamese-American photographer named Nick Ut, shows her at nine years of age running naked on a road after being severely burned on her back by a South Vietnamese napalm attack.

She later founded the Kim Phúc Foundation International to provide aid to child victims of war.

==Vietnam War napalm attack==
Phan Thi Kim Phúc and her family lived in Trảng Bàng in South Vietnam. On June 8, 1972, South Vietnamese planes dropped napalm on Trảng Bàng, which had been attacked and occupied by North Vietnamese forces. Phúc joined a group of civilians and South Vietnamese soldiers who were fleeing from the Caodai Temple to the safety of South Vietnamese-held positions. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilot flying an A-1E Skyraider mistook the group for enemy soldiers and diverted to attack. The bombing killed two of Phúc&#x27;s cousins and two other villagers. Phúc received third degree burns after her clothing was burned by the fire.

===Images and rescue===
Associated Press photographer Nick Ut took a photograph of Phúc running naked amid other fleeing villagers, South Vietnamese soldiers, and other press photographers. In an interview many years later, she recalled she was yelling, &quot;Nóng quá, nóng quá&quot; (&quot;So hot, so hot&quot;) in the picture. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editors were at first hesitant to consider the photo for publication because of the nudity, but they eventually approved it. A cropped version of the photo—with the press photographers to the right removed—was featured on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day. It later earned a Pulitzer Prize and was chosen as the World Press Photo of the Year for 1973.

After snapping the photograph, Ut took Phúc and the other injured children to Barsky Hospital in Saigon, where it was determined that her burns were so severe that she probably would not survive. However, after a 14-month hospital stay and 17 surgical procedures, including skin grafts, she was able to return home. A number of the early operations were performed by Finnish plastic surgeon . It was only after treatment at a special hospital in Ludwigshafen, West Germany, in 1982, that Phúc was able to properly move again. Ut continued to visit Phúc until he was evacuated to the United States during the fall of Saigon.

Less publicized is the film, shot by British television cameraman Alan Downes for the British Independent Television News (ITN) and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Phuc Dinh, who was working for the American television network NBC, which shows the events just before and after the photograph was taken In the top-left frame, a man stands and appears to take photographs as a passing airplane drops bombs. A group of children, Phúc among them, run away in fear. After a few seconds, she encounters the reporters dressed in military fatigues, including Christopher Wain (top-right frame), who gave her water and poured some over her burns. As she turns sideways, the severity of the burns on her arm and back can be seen (bottom-left frame). A crying woman, Phúc&#x27;s grandmother, Tao, runs in the opposite direction holding her badly burned grandchild, 3-year-old Danh, Phúc&#x27;s cousin, who died of his injuries (bottom-right frame). Sections of the film shot were included in &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; (1974), the Academy Award-winning documentary about the Vietnam War directed by Peter Davis.

===Controversy===
Audio tapes of President Richard Nixon, in conversation with his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman in 1972, reveal that Nixon mused, &quot;I&#x27;m wondering if that was fixed&quot;, after seeing the photograph. After the release of this tape, Ut commented, &quot;Even though it has become one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on 12 June 1972... The picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo was as authentic as the Vietnam War itself. The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed. That terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo. That moment thirty years ago will be one Kim Phúc and I will never forget. It has ultimately changed both our lives.&quot;

Carl Robinson, a former Associated Press photo editor in Saigon, alleges that the bureau&#x27;s chief of photos Horst Faas had ordered him to change credit for the image and &quot;make it Nick Ut&quot;. In the 2025 documentary film &quot;The Stringer&quot;, directed by Bao Nguyen, a group of journalists and investigators claim that the &#x27;Napalm Girl&#x27; photograph was taken by Vietnamese photo stringer Nguyen Than Nghe.

==Adult life==
Phúc was removed from her university as a young adult studying medicine and used as a propaganda symbol by the communist government of Vietnam. Due to constant pain, she considered suicide, but in 1982 she found a New Testament in a library that led her to become a Christian and towards forgiveness. In 1986, she was granted permission to continue her studies in Cuba, where she learned Spanish and was trained as a pharmacist. Phúc met Ut for the first time in fourteen years in Havana in 1989, and the two have been meeting and speaking over telephone regularly ever since. Prime Minister of Vietnam Phạm Văn Đồng became her friend and patron. After arriving in Cuba, she met Bui Huy Toan, another Vietnamese student, whom she married in 1992.

In 1993, on the way to their honeymoon in Moscow, they left the plane during a refuelling stop in Gander, Newfoundland, and asked for political asylum in Canada, which was granted. The couple now live in Ajax, Ontario, and have two children. In 1996, Phúc met the surgeons who had saved her life. The following year she became a Canadian citizen.

In 2015, it was reported that she was receiving laser treatment, provided free of charge at a hospital in Miami, US, to reduce the scarring on her left arm and back.

===Activism===
In 1997, she established the first Kim Phúc Foundation in the U.S., with the aim of providing medical and psychological assistance to child victims of war. Later, other foundations were set up, with the same name, under an umbrella organization, Kim Phúc Foundation International.

In 2004, Phúc spoke at the University of Connecticut about her life and experience, learning how to be &quot;strong in the face of pain&quot; and how compassion and love helped her heal.

On December 28, 2009, National Public Radio broadcast her spoken essay, &quot;The Long Road to Forgiveness&quot;, for the &quot;This I Believe&quot; series. In May 2010, Phúc was reunited by the BBC with ITN correspondent Christopher Wain, who helped to save her life. On May 18, 2010, Phúc appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;It″s My Story&quot;. In the programme, Phúc related how she was involved through her foundation in the efforts to secure medical treatment in Canada for Ali Abbas, who had lost both arms in a rocket attack on Baghdad during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

In a December 21, 2017, article for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Phúc wrote that the physical trauma she suffered in the napalm strike still required treatment, but that &quot;even worse than the physical pain was the emotional and spiritual pain.&quot; This led directly to her conversion to Christianity, which she credits with healing the psychological trauma of living over forty years being known to the world as &quot;Napalm Girl&quot;. &quot;My faith in Jesus Christ is what has enabled me to forgive those who had wronged me,&quot; she wrote, &quot;no matter how severe those wrongs were.&quot;

In July 2022, Phúc in person welcomed 236 Ukrainian refugees with children aboard a special flight, arranged by an organization called Solidaire, from Warsaw to Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, in an airplane displaying her iconic 1972 photo on its side.

==Recognition==
On November 10, 1994, Phúc was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. In 1996, Phúc gave a speech at the United States Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Veterans Day. In her speech, she said that one cannot change the past, but everyone can work together for a peaceful future. John Plummer, a pastor and Vietnam veteran who said he took part in coordinating the air strike with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, met with Phúc briefly and was publicly forgiven. Plummer later admitted he had lied, saying he was &quot;caught up in the emotion at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the day Phuc spoke&quot;. Canadian filmmaker Shelley Saywell made a documentary about their meeting.

Her biography, &quot;The Girl in the Picture&quot;, was written by Denise Chong and published in 1999.

In 2003, Belgian composer Eric Geurts wrote the song &quot;The Girl in the Picture&quot;, dedicated to Phúc. It was released on Flying Snowman Records, with all profits going to the Kim Phúc Foundation, and re-released in 2021 as part of Eric&#x27;s album &quot;Leave a Mark&quot;.

===Awards===
On October 22, 2004, Phúc was made a member of the Order of Ontario, and received an honorary Doctorate of Law from York University for her work supporting child victims of war around the world. On October 27, 2005, she was awarded an honorary degree in Law from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario. On June 2, 2011, she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Lethbridge. On May 19, 2016, she was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law, Honoris Causa by Saint Mary&#x27;s University (Halifax).

On February 11, 2019, Phúc was awarded the 2019 in recognition of her work with UNESCO and as an activist for peace.

==Retrospective works==
&quot;The Girl in the Picture: The Kim Phúc Story, the Photograph and the Vietnam War&quot;, by Denise Chong, is a 1999 biographical and historical book tracing the life story of Phúc. Chong&#x27;s historical coverage emphasizes the life, especially the school and family life, of Phúc from before the attack, through convalescence, and into the present time. The book deals primarily with Vietnamese and American relationships during the Vietnam War, while examining themes of war, racism, immigration, political turmoil, repression, poverty, and international relationships through the lens of family and particularly through the eyes and everyday lives of women. Phúc and her mother, Nu, provide the lens through which readers of &quot;The Girl in the Picture&quot; experience war, strife, and the development of communism in Vietnam. Like Chong&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Girl in the Picture&quot; was shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language non-fiction.

<text>Rondônia () is one of the 26 states of Brazil, located in the northern subdivision of the country (central-western part). It is bordered by Acre in the west, 
Amazonas in the north, Mato Grosso in the east, and Bolivia in the south. Rondônia has a population of 1,815,000 as of 2021. It is the fifth least populated state. Its capital and largest city is Porto Velho, bathed by the Madeira River. The state was named after Cândido Rondon, who explored the north of the country during the 1910s. The state, which is home to c. 0.7% of the Brazilian population, is responsible for c. 0.3% of the Brazilian GDP.

The state has 52 municipalities and occupies an area of 237,590.547 km2, equivalent to the territory of Romania and almost five times larger than Croatia. In addition to this, there are other important cities such as Ariquemes, Cacoal, Guajará-Mirim, Ji-Paraná, Rolim de Moura and Vilhena.

==Geography==
Rondonia used to be home to over 200,000 km2 of rainforest, but has become one of the most deforested places in the Amazon. By 2003 around 70,000 km2 of rainforest had been cleared.

The area around the Guaporé River is part of the Beni savanna ecoregion.

The Samuel Dam is located in the state, on the Jamari River.

==History==

=== Pre-colonial ===
Before the Portuguese discovery of Brazil, the region where the present state of Rondônia is situated was populated by indigenous peoples, who are known to have included the following:

Arawan speaking peoples
* Aruás

Chapachuran speaking peoples
* Oro-uins

Macro-Je speaking peoples
* Jabutis

Nambikwaran speaking peoples
* Nambikwara

Panoan speaking peoples
* Kaxarari
* Karipuna

Tupian speaking peoples
* Cinta Larga
* Gavião
* Paiter
* Amondauas
* Macurap
* Sakurabiat
* Caritianas
* Araras-caros

Isolated peoples
* Kanoê
* Kwazá

=== Colonial Period ===
The Spaniard Ñuflo de Chávez was the first European explorer to reach the valley of the Guaporé River between 1541 and 1542, although he only passed through. Bandeirantes arrived in the region around 1650, with the goal of exploiting the gold and other minerals of the territory. In the same period, Jesuit priests came to the region and founded the first village.

As a consequence of the discovery of gold on the right bank of the Guaporé River, the Portuguese Crown founded the Captaincy of Mato Grosso in 1748 with as governor. On March 19, 1752, the governor designated Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade as the capital, from where he commanded the border demarcation following the Treaty of Madrid (1750). In 1753, he installed a surveillance post in the village of Santa Rosa Velha, built by the Spanish on the right bank of the Guaporé, and thus in Brazilian lands. In 1759, the Spanish governor of Santa Cruz de la Sierra requested that the post be evacuated. Instead, Rolim de Moura built a fort to replace it, which became known as the . Due to the climate and the incursions of the Spanish, the Presidio was soon in ruins. It was rebuilt in 1769 by Governor Luís Pinto de Sousa Coutinho, and renamed as Forte de Bragança. Ruined again, in 1776 the Forte Príncipe da Beira was built in its place. In 1772, led an expedition from Belém which reached the Madeira River, the Mamoré River and the Guaporé River, reaching Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The decline of mining and the proclamation of the First Brazilian Republic caused the region to lose its economic importance until the end of the nineteenth century, when the exploitation of rubber entered its peak.

=== Postcolonial history ===
In April 1878, following to the Treaty of Ayacucho, the border between Bolivia and Brazil was mapped by cartographic teams and agreed in 1879. The Treaty of Petrópolis in 1903 led to the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad, leading to increased settlement.

Decree-Law No. 5812 (13 of September 1943) established the was created from parts of the states of Amazonas and Mato Grosso. By the law of February 17, 1956, the region became known as the Federal Territory of Rondônia, in honor of Marshal Cândido Rondon. The exploitation of brazil nuts and rubber was the main economic activity until the discovery of cassiterite deposits, which accelerated the development and settlement of the region. This development led to the territory achieving the status of a state in 1982, with 13 constituent municipalities, including the capital, Porto Velho. These are: Guajará-Mirim, Ji-Paraná, Vilhena, Ariquemes, Jaru, Pimenta Bueno, Colorado do Oeste, Cacoal, Ouro Preto do Oeste, Presidente Médici, Espigão d&#x27;Oeste and Costa Marques.

The development of agricultural activities has transformed the area into one of the main agricultural frontiers in the country and one of the most prosperous and productive regions in northern Brazil. The state stands out in the production of coffee (largest producer in the North and 5th largest in Brazil), cocoa (2nd largest producer in the North and 3rd largest in Brazil), beans (2nd largest producer in the North), maize (2nd largest producer in the North region), soybean (3rd largest producer in the North region), rice (3rd largest producer in the North region) and cassava (4th largest producer in the North region). Despite the large volume of production and the small territory by the region&#x27;s standards (7 times smaller than Amazonas and 6 times smaller than Pará), Rondônia still has more than 60% of its territory fully preserved.

In coffee production, Rondônia was, in 2019, the 5th largest producer in the country, being the 2nd largest producer of Coffea canephora, getting a total of 2.3 million bags of 60 kg of coffee (near 138 thousand tons) this year.

Rondônia is the 3rd largest cocoa producer in the country, with 18 thousand tons harvested in 2017.

In 2017, the state had a cattle herd of 14,098,031 head of cattle (73,37% for beef and the rest for dairy), second largest herd in the North, second only to Pará, being the 6th largest in the country, 5th in meat exports and 8th in milk production. The state&#x27;s milk production in 2018 was around 800 million liters, the largest producer in the North.

In 2017, Rondônia had 0.62% of the national mineral participation (8th place in the country). Rondônia had production of tin (10,9 thousand tons at a value of R$333 million), gold (1 ton at a value of R$125 million), niobium (in the form of columbita-tantalita) (3.5 thousand tons at R$24 million), and zinc in gross form (26 thousand tons at R$27 million) In addition, in gemstones, the state has some production of garnet.

<doc id="229553" wikidata="Q170282" url="?curid=229553" title="Hooke's law">
<text>In physics, Hooke&#x27;s law is an empirical law which states that the force () needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance () scales linearly with respect to that distance—that is, where is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), and is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring. The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin anagram. He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: (&quot;as the extension, so the force&quot; or &quot;the extension is proportional to the force&quot;). Hooke states in the 1678 work that he was aware of the law since 1660.

Hooke&#x27;s equation holds (to some extent) in many other situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, and a musician plucking a string of a guitar. An elastic body or material for which this equation can be assumed is said to be linear-elastic or Hookean.

Hooke&#x27;s law is only a first-order linear approximation to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces. It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, or stretched beyond a maximum size, without some permanent deformation or change of state. Many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke&#x27;s law well before those elastic limits are reached.

On the other hand, Hooke&#x27;s law is an accurate approximation for most solid bodies, as long as the forces and deformations are small enough. For this reason, Hooke&#x27;s law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics. It is also the fundamental principle behind the spring scale, the manometer, the galvanometer, and the balance wheel of the mechanical clock.

The modern theory of elasticity generalizes Hooke&#x27;s law to say that the strain (deformation) of an elastic object or material is proportional to the stress applied to it. However, since general stresses and strains may have multiple independent components, the &quot;proportionality factor&quot; may no longer be just a single real number, but rather a linear map (a tensor) that can be represented by a matrix of real numbers.

In this general form, Hooke&#x27;s law makes it possible to deduce the relation between strain and stress for complex objects in terms of intrinsic properties of the materials they are made of. For example, one can deduce that a homogeneous rod with uniform cross section will behave like a simple spring when stretched, with a stiffness directly proportional to its cross-section area and inversely proportional to its length.

==Formal definition==
===Linear springs===
Consider a simple helical spring that has one end attached to some fixed object, while the free end is being pulled by a force whose magnitude is . Suppose that the spring has reached a state of equilibrium, where its length is not changing anymore. Let be the amount by which the free end of the spring was displaced from its &quot;relaxed&quot; position (when it is not being stretched). Hooke&#x27;s law states that formula_1 or, equivalently, formula_2
where is a positive real number, characteristic of the spring. A spring with spaces between the coils can be compressed, and the same formula holds for compression, with and both negative in that case. 

According to this formula, the graph of the applied force as a function of the displacement will be a straight line passing through the origin, whose slope is .

Hooke&#x27;s law for a spring is also stated under the convention that is the restoring force exerted by the spring on whatever is pulling its free end. In that case, the equation becomes formula_3 since the direction of the restoring force is opposite to that of the displacement.

===Torsional springs===
The torsional analog of Hooke&#x27;s law applies to torsional springs. It states that the torque (τ) required to rotate an object is directly proportional to the angular displacement (θ) from the equilibrium position. It describes the relationship between the torque applied to an object and the resulting angular deformation due to torsion. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

: formula_4
Where:
* τ is the torque measured in Newton-meters or N·m.
* k is the torsional constant (measured in N·m/radian), which characterizes the stiffness of the torsional spring or the resistance to angular displacement.
* θ is the angular displacement (measured in radians) from the equilibrium position.

Just as in the linear case, this law shows that the torque is proportional to the angular displacement, and the negative sign indicates that the torque acts in a direction opposite to the angular displacement, providing a restoring force to bring the system back to equilibrium.

===General &quot;scalar&quot; springs===
Hooke&#x27;s spring law usually applies to any elastic object, of arbitrary complexity, as long as both the deformation and the stress can be expressed by a single number that can be both positive and negative.

For example, when a block of rubber attached to two parallel plates is deformed by shearing, rather than stretching or compression, the shearing force and the sideways displacement of the plates obey Hooke&#x27;s law (for small enough deformations).

Hooke&#x27;s law also applies when a straight steel bar or concrete beam (like the one used in buildings), supported at both ends, is bent by a weight placed at some intermediate point. The displacement in this case is the deviation of the beam, measured in the transversal direction, relative to its unloaded shape.

===Vector formulation===
In the case of a helical spring that is stretched or compressed along its axis, the applied (or restoring) force and the resulting elongation or compression have the same direction (which is the direction of said axis). Therefore, if and are defined as vectors, Hooke&#x27;s equation still holds and says that the force vector is the elongation vector multiplied by a fixed scalar.

===General tensor form===
Some elastic bodies will deform in one direction when subjected to a force with a different direction. One example is a horizontal wood beam with non-square rectangular cross section that is bent by a transverse load that is neither vertical nor horizontal. In such cases, the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the displacement will be proportional to the magnitude of the force , as long as the direction of the latter remains the same (and its value is not too large); so the scalar version of Hooke&#x27;s law will hold. However, the force and displacement &quot;vectors&quot; will not be scalar multiples of each other, since they have different directions. Moreover, the ratio between their magnitudes will depend on the direction of the vector .

Yet, in such cases there is often a fixed linear relation between the force and deformation vectors, as long as they are small enough. Namely, there is a function from vectors to vectors, such that , and for any real numbers , and any displacement vectors , . Such a function is called a (second-order) tensor.

With respect to an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system, the force and displacement vectors can be represented by 3 × 1 matrices of real numbers. Then the tensor connecting them can be represented by a 3 × 3 matrix of real coefficients, that, when multiplied by the displacement vector, gives the force vector:

formula_5

That is, formula_6 for . Therefore, Hooke&#x27;s law can be said to hold also when and are vectors with variable directions, except that the stiffness of the object is a tensor , rather than a single real number .

=== Hooke&#x27;s law for continuous media ===

The stresses and strains of the material inside a continuous elastic material (such as a block of rubber, the wall of a boiler, or a steel bar) are connected by a linear relationship that is mathematically similar to Hooke&#x27;s spring law, and is often referred to by that name.

However, the strain state in a solid medium around some point cannot be described by a single vector. The same parcel of material, no matter how small, can be compressed, stretched, and sheared at the same time, along different directions. Likewise, the stresses in that parcel can be at once pushing, pulling, and shearing.

In order to capture this complexity, the relevant state of the medium around a point must be represented by two-second-order tensors, the strain tensor (in lieu of the displacement ) and the stress tensor (replacing the restoring force ). The analogue of Hooke&#x27;s spring law for continuous media is then formula_7 where is a fourth-order tensor (that is, a linear map between second-order tensors) usually called the stiffness tensor or elasticity tensor. One may also write it as formula_8 where the tensor , called the compliance tensor, represents the inverse of said linear map.

In a Cartesian coordinate system, the stress and strain tensors can be represented by 3 × 3 matrices

formula_9

Being a linear mapping between the nine numbers and the nine numbers , the stiffness tensor is represented by a matrix of real numbers . Hooke&#x27;s law then says that
formula_10
where .

All three tensors generally vary from point to point inside the medium, and may vary with time as well. The strain tensor merely specifies the displacement of the medium particles in the neighborhood of the point, while the stress tensor specifies the forces that neighboring parcels of the medium are exerting on each other. Therefore, they are independent of the composition and physical state of the material. The stiffness tensor , on the other hand, is a property of the material, and often depends on physical state variables such as temperature, pressure, and microstructure.

Due to the inherent symmetries of , , and , only 21 elastic coefficients of the latter are independent. This number can be further reduced by the symmetry of the material: 9 for an orthorhombic crystal, 5 for an hexagonal structure, and 3 for a cubic symmetry. For isotropic media (which have the same physical properties in any direction), can be reduced to only two independent numbers, the bulk modulus and the shear modulus , that quantify the material&#x27;s resistance to changes in volume and to shearing deformations, respectively.

== Analogous laws ==
Since Hooke&#x27;s law is a simple proportionality between two quantities, its formulas and consequences are mathematically similar to those of many other physical laws, such as those describing the motion of fluids, or the polarization of a dielectric by an electric field.

In particular, the tensor equation relating elastic stresses to strains is entirely similar to the equation relating the viscous stress tensor and the strain rate tensor in flows of viscous fluids; although the former pertains to static stresses (related to &quot;amount&quot; of deformation) while the latter pertains to dynamical stresses (related to the &quot;rate&quot; of deformation).

==Units of measurement==
In SI units, displacements are measured in meters (m), and forces in newtons (N or kg·m/s2). Therefore, the spring constant , and each element of the tensor , is measured in newtons per meter (N/m), or kilograms per second squared (kg/s2).

For continuous media, each element of the stress tensor is a force divided by an area; it is therefore measured in units of pressure, namely pascals (Pa, or N/m2, or kg/(m·s2). The elements of the strain tensor are dimensionless (displacements divided by distances). Therefore, the entries of are also expressed in units of pressure.

== General application to elastic materials ==
Objects that quickly regain their original shape after being deformed by a force, with the molecules or atoms of their material returning to the initial state of stable equilibrium, often obey Hooke&#x27;s law.

Hooke&#x27;s law only holds for some materials under certain loading conditions. Steel exhibits linear-elastic behavior in most engineering applications; Hooke&#x27;s law is valid for it throughout its elastic range (i.e., for stresses below the yield strength). For some other materials, such as aluminium, Hooke&#x27;s law is only valid for a portion of the elastic range. For these materials a proportional limit stress is defined, below which the errors associated with the linear approximation are negligible.

Rubber is generally regarded as a &quot;non-Hookean&quot; material because its elasticity is stress dependent and sensitive to temperature and loading rate.

Generalizations of Hooke&#x27;s law for the case of large deformations is provided by models of neo-Hookean solids and Mooney–Rivlin solids.

==Derived formulae==
=== Tensional stress of a uniform bar ===
A rod of any elastic material may be viewed as a linear spring. The rod has length and cross-sectional area . Its tensile stress is linearly proportional to its fractional extension or strain by the modulus of elasticity :
formula_11

The modulus of elasticity may often be considered constant. In turn,
formula_12
(that is, the fractional change in length), and since
formula_13
it follows that:

formula_14

The change in length may be expressed as

formula_15

=== Spring energy ===
The potential energy stored in a spring is given by formula_16 which comes from adding up the energy it takes to incrementally compress the spring. That is, the integral of force over displacement. Since the external force has the same general direction as the displacement, the potential energy of a spring is always non-negative. Substituting formula_17 gives formula_18

This potential can be visualized as a parabola on the -plane such that . As the spring is stretched in the positive -direction, the potential energy increases parabolically (the same thing happens as the spring is compressed). Since the change in potential energy changes at a constant rate:
formula_19
Note that the change in the change in is constant even when the displacement and acceleration are zero.

=== Relaxed force constants (generalized compliance constants) ===
Relaxed force constants (the inverse of generalized compliance constants) are uniquely defined for molecular systems, in contradistinction to the usual &quot;rigid&quot; force constants, and thus their use allows meaningful correlations to be made between force fields calculated for reactants, transition states, and products of a chemical reaction. Just as the potential energy can be written as a quadratic form in the internal coordinates, so it can also be written in terms of generalized forces. The resulting coefficients are termed compliance constants. A direct method exists for calculating the compliance constant for any internal coordinate of a molecule, without the need to do the normal mode analysis. The suitability of relaxed force constants (inverse compliance constants) as covalent bond strength descriptors was demonstrated as early as 1980. Recently, the suitability as non-covalent bond strength descriptors was demonstrated too.

=== Harmonic oscillator ===

A mass attached to the end of a spring is a classic example of a harmonic oscillator. By pulling slightly on the mass and then releasing it, the system will be set in sinusoidal oscillating motion about the equilibrium position. To the extent that the spring obeys Hooke&#x27;s law, and that one can neglect friction and the mass of the spring, the amplitude of the oscillation will remain constant; and its frequency will be independent of its amplitude, determined only by the mass and the stiffness of the spring:
formula_20
This phenomenon made possible the construction of accurate mechanical clocks and watches that could be carried on ships and people&#x27;s pockets.

=== Rotation in gravity-free space ===
If the mass were attached to a spring with force constant and rotating in free space, the spring tension () would supply the required centripetal force ():

formula_21
Since and , then:
formula_22
Given that , this leads to the same frequency equation as above:
formula_20

== Linear elasticity theory for continuous media ==

=== Isotropic materials ===

Isotropic materials are characterized by properties which are independent of direction in space. Physical equations involving isotropic materials must therefore be independent of the coordinate system chosen to represent them. The strain tensor is a symmetric tensor. Since the trace of any tensor is independent of any coordinate system, the most complete coordinate-free decomposition of a symmetric tensor is to represent it as the sum of a constant tensor and a traceless symmetric tensor. Thus in index notation:

formula_24
where is the Kronecker delta. In direct tensor notation:
formula_25

where is the second-order identity tensor.

The first term on the right is the constant tensor, also known as the volumetric strain tensor, and the second term is the traceless symmetric tensor, also known as the deviatoric strain tensor or shear tensor.

The most general form of Hooke&#x27;s law for isotropic materials may now be written as a linear combination of these two tensors:

formula_26
where is the bulk modulus and is the shear modulus.

Using the relationships between the elastic moduli, these equations may also be expressed in various other ways. A common form of Hooke&#x27;s law for isotropic materials, expressed in direct tensor notation, is
formula_27
where and are the Lamé constants, is the second-rank identity tensor, and I is the symmetric part of the fourth-rank identity tensor. In index notation:
formula_28

The inverse relationship is

formula_29

Therefore, the compliance tensor in the relation is

formula_30

In terms of Young&#x27;s modulus and Poisson&#x27;s ratio, Hooke&#x27;s law for isotropic materials can then be expressed as

formula_31

This is the form in which the strain is expressed in terms of the stress tensor in engineering. The expression in expanded form is
formula_32
where is Young&#x27;s modulus and is Poisson&#x27;s ratio. (See 3-D elasticity).
In matrix form, Hooke&#x27;s law for isotropic materials can be written as
formula_33
where is the engineering shear strain. The inverse relation may be written as
formula_34
which can be simplified thanks to the Lamé constants:
formula_35
In vector notation this becomes
formula_36
where is the identity tensor.

==== Plane stress ====
Under plane stress conditions, . In that case Hooke&#x27;s law takes the form
formula_37

In vector notation this becomes
formula_38

The inverse relation is usually written in the reduced form
formula_39

==== Plane strain ====
Under plane strain conditions, . In this case Hooke&#x27;s law takes the form
formula_40

=== Anisotropic materials ===
The symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor () and the generalized Hooke&#x27;s laws () implies that . Similarly, the symmetry of the infinitesimal strain tensor implies that . These symmetries are called the minor symmetries of the stiffness tensor c. This reduces the number of elastic constants from 81 to 36.

If in addition, since the displacement gradient and the Cauchy stress are work conjugate, the stress–strain relation can be derived from a strain energy density functional (), then
formula_41
The arbitrariness of the order of differentiation implies that . These are called the major symmetries of the stiffness tensor. This reduces the number of elastic constants from 36 to 21. The major and minor symmetries indicate that the stiffness tensor has only 21 independent components.

==== Matrix representation (stiffness tensor) ====
It is often useful to express the anisotropic form of Hooke&#x27;s law in matrix notation, also called Voigt notation. To do this we take advantage of the symmetry of the stress and strain tensors and express them as six-dimensional vectors in an orthonormal coordinate system () as
formula_42
Then the stiffness tensor (c) can be expressed as
formula_43

and Hooke&#x27;s law is written as

formula_44
Similarly the compliance tensor (s) can be written as
formula_45

==== Change of coordinate system ====
If a linear elastic material is rotated from a reference configuration to another, then the material is symmetric with respect to the rotation if the components of the stiffness tensor in the rotated configuration are related to the components in the reference configuration by the relation

formula_46
where are the components of an orthogonal rotation matrix . The same relation also holds for inversions.

In matrix notation, if the transformed basis (rotated or inverted) is related to the reference basis by

formula_47

then

formula_48
In addition, if the material is symmetric with respect to the transformation then
formula_49

==== Orthotropic materials ====
Orthotropic materials have three orthogonal planes of symmetry. If the basis vectors () are normals to the planes of symmetry then the coordinate transformation relations imply that

formula_50
The inverse of this relation is commonly written as
formula_51
where
* is the Young&#x27;s modulus along axis 
* is the shear modulus in direction on the plane whose normal is in direction 
* is the Poisson&#x27;s ratio that corresponds to a contraction in direction when an extension is applied in direction .

Under &quot;plane stress&quot; conditions, , Hooke&#x27;s law for an orthotropic material takes the form
formula_52
The inverse relation is
formula_53
The transposed form of the above stiffness matrix is also often used.

==== Transversely isotropic materials ====
A transversely isotropic material is symmetric with respect to a rotation about an axis of symmetry. For such a material, if is the axis of symmetry, Hooke&#x27;s law can be expressed as
formula_54

More frequently, the axis is taken to be the axis of symmetry and the inverse Hooke&#x27;s law is written as

formula_55

==== Universal elastic anisotropy index ====
To grasp the degree of anisotropy of any class, a universal elastic anisotropy index (AU) was formulated. It replaces the Zener ratio, which is suited for cubic crystals.

== Thermodynamic basis ==

Linear deformations of elastic materials can be approximated as adiabatic. Under these conditions and for quasistatic processes the first law of thermodynamics for a deformed body can be expressed as
formula_56
where is the increase in internal energy and is the work done by external forces. The work can be split into two terms
formula_57
where is the work done by surface forces while is the work done by body forces. If is a variation of the displacement field in the body, then the two external work terms can be expressed as
formula_58
where is the surface traction vector, is the body force vector, represents the body and represents its surface. Using the relation between the Cauchy stress and the surface traction, (where is the unit outward normal to ), we have
formula_59
Converting the surface integral into a volume integral via the divergence theorem gives
formula_60
Using the symmetry of the Cauchy stress and the identity
formula_61
we have the following

formula_62
From the definition of strain and from the equations of equilibrium we have
formula_63
Hence we can write
formula_64
and therefore the variation in the internal energy density is given by
formula_65
An elastic material is defined as one in which the total internal energy is equal to the potential energy of the internal forces (also called the elastic strain energy). Therefore, the internal energy density is a function of the strains, and the variation of the internal energy can be expressed as
formula_66
Since the variation of strain is arbitrary, the stress–strain relation of an elastic material is given by
formula_67
For a linear elastic material, the quantity is a linear function of , and can therefore be expressed as
formula_68
where c is a fourth-rank tensor of material constants, also called the stiffness tensor. We can see why c must be a fourth-rank tensor by noting that, for a linear elastic material,
formula_69
In index notation
formula_70

The right-hand side constant requires four indices and is a fourth-rank quantity. We can also see that this quantity must be a tensor because it is a linear transformation that takes the strain tensor to the stress tensor. We can also show that the constant obeys the tensor transformation rules for fourth-rank tensors.

<text>Sergipe (), officially State of Sergipe, is a state of Brazil. Located in the Northeast Region along the Atlantic coast of the country, Sergipe is the smallest state in Brazil by geographical area at , larger only than the Federal District. Sergipe borders Bahia to the south and west and Alagoas to the north. Aracaju is the capital and the largest city in the state; the state is divided into 75 municipalities. The state has 1.1% of the Brazilian population and produces only 0.6% of the Brazilian GDP.

==Geography==
As with most of the states in northeastern Brazil, inland Sergipe is almost entirely savanna (&quot;caatinga&quot;), and its coastline is characterized by mangroves, swamps and sandy beaches. A small strip of tropical rainforest runs down the coast.
The São Francisco River forms its northern boundary, and the drainage of the northern part of the state is northward and eastward to that river. The southern half of the state slopes eastward and is drained directly into the Atlantic through a number of small rivers, the largest of which are the Irapiranga (whose source in the state of Bahia is called Vaza Barris), the Real and the Cotinguiba. These streams are navigable for short distances, but are obstructed by sandbars at their mouths; because of these, there are no good ports on the coast. The surface of the state resembles, in part, that of Bahia, with a zone of forested lands near the coast and beyond this forested zone lies a higher zone of rough open country, called &quot;agreste&quot;. There is a sandy belt along the coast, and the western frontier is slightly mountainous. The land in between is very fertile, especially in the forested region where rainfall is abundant. Further inland, the year is divided into wet and dry seasons with occasional prolonged droughts. These are pastoral areas, and the lower fertile lands are cultivated.

The capital of the state is Aracaju (pop. 479 767 in 2003), on the lower course or estuary of the Cotinguiba River, near the coast. The sandbar at the entrance to this river is exceptionally dangerous, and the port is frequented only by coasting vessels of light draught. The city is found on a sandy plain, and there are sand dunes within the city limits. In 1911, the main public buildings included a large plain church with unfinished twin towers, the government palace, the legislative halls, a public school and public hospital.

The other principal towns are Estância - pop. 62,218 (in 2005) on the Rio Real river in the southern part of the state and a center for the manufacturing of cotton-based textiles, cigars, cigarettes and soap as well as an active trade center; Laranjeiras - pop. 26,452 (in 2005), located in a highly productive sugar-growing district north of the capital; Capela - pop. 27,403 (in 2005); Simão Dias - pop. 39,706 (in 2005); Lagarto - pop. 90,345 (in 2005); São Cristóvão, formerly Sergipe d&#x27;el-Rey - pop. 75,353 (in 2005), which was also the old colonial capital near the mouth of the Irapiranga.

==History==

Present-day Sergipe was home to numerous indigenous peoples, including the Kanindé (Canindé), Aratus, and Tupi peoples. Gaspar de Lemos briefly landed in the region in 1501, and the Portuguese Crown declared the region part of the Captaincy of Bahia. The area of Sergipe was one of the last coastal regions of Brazil whose indigenous population (consisting of Tupinambá tribes) resisted subjugation to Portuguese colonial rule. The area was fully brought under Portuguese rule after approximately two decades of warfare during which thousands of natives were murdered and thousands more enslaved to work on sugar plantations. São Cristóvão was the site of the first Portuguese settlement, in 1591, at Sergipe D&#x27;El-Rey.

As with other states in the northeast, Sergipe was invaded numerous times by the Dutch, and frequently raided by French buccaneers. During the 17th century, the state was known throughout the Americas for its king-wood, a prized commodity that was the primary attraction during the buccaneer raids, and probably a factor in Dutch military expeditions. From 1641 to 1645, the territory belonged to Dutch-controlled Brazil (New Holland). The Dutch built a fort, the first in the region, between the rivers São Francisco and Sergipe.

The Portuguese regained control in 1645. By the 18th century, the Portuguese military had driven off the pirates permanently. Sergipe remained a part of the state of Bahia, and was responsible for a third of Bahia&#x27;s sugar production by 1723. Sugarcane culture was established in the valleys of the São Francisco, Japaratuba, Sergipe, Vaza-Barris, Piauí and Real rivers. Areas unsuitable for sugarcane plantations on the coast and in the hinterland were developed for livestock; Sergipe subsequently became a supplier of draft animals for the farms of Bahia and Pernambuco. The region was also a significant producer of leather. John VI of Portugal signed a decree to separated Sergipe from Bahia on July 8, 1820, and Brigadier Carlos César Burlamárqui was named the state&#x27;s first governor.

Sergipe retained its separation from Bahia after the Independence of Brazil in 1822, first briefly as the Captaincy of Sergipe, then as the Province of Sergipe. Economic development was low during the Empire of Brazil in the 19th century, other than a brief cotton boom in the second half of the century. The provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital from inland São Cristóvão to coastal Aracaju on the coast on March 17, 1855. Sergipe became a state under the proclamation of the Republic of Brazil in 1892.

===20th century===

The state saw bitter political disputes in the early 20th century, notably between Fausto Cardoso (1864-1906) and Olímpio Campos. Sergipe became notorious for its outlaws in the 1930s, including Virgolino Ferreira da Silva, better known as Lampião, the &quot;King of Bandits&quot;, who terrorized the state for almost a decade until his beheading by the Brazilian police in 1938. His head was later displayed on a pole in a village square.

Coastal Sergipe was attacked by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II in response to the rupture of relations between Brazil and the Axis powers. The German submarine U-507, commanded by Harro Schacht, attacked the Baependi, Araraquara, and off Sergipe between August 15 and 16, 1942. The shipwrecks caused approximately 600 civilian deaths, and German and Italian immigrants communities in Sergipe were persecuted after the attack by mobs. The attacks of the U-507 prompted President Getúlio Vargas to declare war on Germany and Italy on August 22 of the same year.

==Infrastructure==
===Airport===
Aracaju–Santa Maria International Airport was inaugurated on October 30, 1952 with a runway only 1200 meters in length; the airport did not have an access road until 1958, so after construction of one operating efficiency increased. In 1961 the runway was extended to 1500 meters and a passenger terminal was built in 1962. In February 1975 control of the airport was handed over to Infraero. The airport&#x27;s runways reached their current configuration of 2,200 meters in length in 1993. The passenger terminal also underwent several changes and, in 1998, Aracaju gained a new building, measuring 10 thousand square meters. Santa Maria Airport began to be managed by Aena Brasil in 2020, after the company won the concessions auction of the National Civil Aviation Agency (Anac), held in 2019.

===Highways===
The main highways in Sergipe are BR-101, BR-235 and BR-349. BR-101, which belongs to the Brazilian Federal Government, has been receiving duplication works since 1997, and 27 years later, in 2024, they have not yet been completed in Sergipe. With 206 kilometers long, BR-101 is considered the main highway for those traveling through the state. It connects states in the Northeast and is one of the most used to reach the capital Aracaju. BR-101 moves the state&#x27;s wealth, as it is the way to transport the sugar cane that is produced in the region, and to transport iron ore that comes from Bahia to the Port of Sergipe.

===Ports===
The Inácio Barbosa Maritime Terminal - TMIB, popularly known as Porto da Barra dos Coqueiros or Porto de Sergipe, is located in the Brazilian municipality of Barra dos Coqueiros, in the Metropolitan Region of Aracaju, in Sergipe. It is the only port terminal in the state. It&#x27;s a private off-shore, mixed-use, general cargo port terminal specialized in grain movement. It has a draft of 10.5 meters and its main advantage is a backport area of 2 million m2 for the installation of new projects, of which 800 thousand m2 are already bonded. In the same region of the port is also located the Barra dos Coqueiros wind farm operated by Statkraft with an installed capacity of 35MW and the Porto de Sergipe Thermoelectric Complex, the largest LNG thermoelectric plant in Brazil and Latin America, operated by Eneva with an installed capacity of 1.6GW.

==Sports==

The state has many professional association football teams, like Club Sportivo Sergipe, Associação Desportiva Confiança from the town of Aracaju and Associação Olímpica de Itabaiana from the town of Itabaiana. Lagarto Futebol Clube is another important club in Sergipe, it&#x27;s from Lagarto, city where the Brazilian-born and Spanish-naturalized footballer Diego Costa was born.

==Tourism and recreation==

===São Cristóvão===

São Cristóvão is the fourth oldest town in the country, and was Sergipe&#x27;s state capital until 1855. It is located some from the current capital Aracaju.

As a planned urban settlement, the town contains churches and religious ensembles dating back to the colonial period. Most of these monuments are concentrated around the São Francisco Square.

In 1939, São Cristóvão was designated as a National Treasure by the Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional — IPHAN (the Brazilian National Historical and Artistical Heritage Institute). More recently, in 2010, São Francisco Square in the Town of São Cristóvão became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Xingó Canyon===
Includes fascinating landscape, rock formations, crystal-clear waters, ecological trails, Caatinga Theme Park, exuberant vegetation and diversified fauna and flora. The Xingó Canyon is located in Canindé do São Francisco, on the banks of the lengthy and well-known São Francisco river. It is the world&#x27;s fifth most navigable river. The river is formed in a valley reaching up to 170 m deep, being 65 km long and at certain locations between 50 and 300 m wide. The water volume of the canyon is about 3.8 billion m3.

To navigate between the rocks of this gigantic cliff, embedded in the middle of Sergipe&#x27;s Alto Sertão, is an unforgettable experience. There are imposing valleys forming a 50 m-high canyon, surrounding a lake that, in certain points, reaches a depth of 190 m. Nests of herons and river islands complete the spectacle. The rocks guard traces of the area&#x27;s first inhabitants who lived there more than 8,000 years ago.

There is also evidence of Lampião&#x27;s stay there, with his gang of outlaws in more modern times. The Angico trail, in Poço Redondo, leads to a cavern by the same name, where Lampião, Maria Bonita and nine other outlaws lost their lives. Located in the town of Canindé do São Francisco, from Aracaju, Xingó Canyon is one of the most famous rock formations in the area, embellishing the landscape of the dry Northeastern backwoods. It is hot all year round, but strong winds blowing from December to January keep temperatures at a very comfortable level. Between May and August, it rains frequently.

===Sergipe Beaches===
Sergipe has an extensive coastline where it is very attractive for tourists from Brazil and the world. The clear and greenish waters, with white sand attract attention. The capital Aracaju also stands out for Praia de Atalaia which is considered the beach with the best beach sidewalk in Brazil. Outside the capital, the coast of Sergipe is highly valued for its distinctive aspect: Praia do Saco (municipality of Estância), a beach located in the south of the state was considered one of the 100 best beaches in the world by the French magazine Les Voyageurs. In it the tourist is faced with sand dunes and an extensive coastal strip that has the peculiarity of Sergipe; Praia da Costa (Barra dos Coqueiros), the Delta of the São Francisco River (Brejo Grande), Praia de Pirambu (Pirambu), are other beaches that enhance the state&#x27;s tourism.

The river beaches, such as the Croa do Goré sandbar and Ilha dos Namorados, which are tourist attractions reached by Catamaran on the Vaza Barris River in Aracaju, can also be highlighted.

==Flag==

The stars on the flag of Sergipe represent the number of river estuaries in the state, and the green and yellow stripes represent Sergipe&#x27;s union with the rest of Brazil. It was designed by José Rodrigues Bastos Coelho, a businessman who felt that Brazilian ships should carry flags to identify their state of origin. It was officially adopted on October 19, 1920.

In 1937, dictator Getúlio Vargas abolished all state flags and symbols, but they were allowed again in 1946. In 1951, when the Sergipe legislature began to consider restoring the state flag, it decided to change the number of stars, so that there would be one for every municipality in the state. In 1952, this new design was scrapped and replaced by the original 5-star design.

<text>Pierre Loti (; pseudonym of Louis Marie-Julien Viaud ; 14 January 1850 – 10 June 1923) was a French naval officer and novelist, known for his exotic novels and short stories.

==Biography==
Born to a Protestant family, Loti&#x27;s education began in his birthplace, Rochefort, Charente-Maritime. At age 17 he entered the naval school in Brest and studied at Le Borda. He gradually rose in his profession, attaining the rank of captain in 1906. In January 1910 he went on the reserve list. He was in the habit of claiming that he never read books, saying to the Académie française on the day of his introduction (7 April 1892), &quot;Loti ne sait pas lire&quot; (&quot;Loti doesn&#x27;t know how to read&quot;), but testimony from friends proves otherwise, as does his library, much of which is preserved in his house in Rochefort. In 1876 fellow naval officers persuaded him to turn into a novel passages in his diary dealing with some curious experiences in Istanbul. The result was the anonymously published &quot;Aziyadé&quot; (1879), part romance, part autobiography, like the work of his admirer, Marcel Proust, after him.

Loti proceeded to the South Seas as part of his naval training, living in Papeete, Tahiti for two months in 1872, where he &quot;went native&quot;. Several years later he published the Polynesian idyll originally titled &quot;Rarahu&quot; (1880), which was reprinted as &quot;Le Mariage de Loti&quot;, the first book to introduce him to the wider public. His narrator explains that the name Loti was bestowed on him by the natives, after his mispronunciation of &quot;roti&quot; (a red flower). The book inspired the 1883 opera &quot;Lakmé&quot; by Léo Delibes. Loti Bain, a shallow pool at the base of the Fautaua Falls, is named for Loti.

This was followed by &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un spahi&quot; (1881), a record of the melancholy adventures of a soldier in Senegal. In 1882, Loti issued a collection of four shorter pieces, three stories and a travel piece, under the general title of &quot;Fleurs d&#x27;ennui&quot; (&quot;Flowers of Boredom&quot;).

In 1883 Loti achieved a wider public spotlight. First, he published the critically acclaimed &quot;Mon Frère Yves&quot; (&quot;My Brother Yves&quot;), a novel describing the life of a French naval officer (Pierre Loti), and a Breton sailor (Yves Kermadec, inspired by Loti companion Pierre le Cor), described by Edmund Gosse as &quot;one of his most characteristic productions&quot;. Second, while serving in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) as a naval officer aboard the ironclad &quot;Atalante&quot;, Loti published three articles in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in September and October 1883 about atrocities that occurred during the Battle of Thuận An (20 August 1883), an attack by the French on the Vietnamese coastal defenses of Hue. He was threatened with suspension from the service for this indiscretion, thus gaining wider public notoriety. In 1884 his friend Émile Pouvillon dedicated his novel &quot;L&#x27;Innocent&quot; to Loti.

In 1886 Loti published a novel of life among the Breton fisherfolk, called &quot;Pêcheur d&#x27;Islande&quot; (&quot;An Iceland Fisherman&quot;), which Edmund Gosse characterized as &quot;the most popular and finest of all his writings.&quot; It shows Loti adapting some of the Impressionist techniques of contemporary painters, especially Monet, to prose, and is a classic of French literature. In 1887 he brought out a volume &quot;of extraordinary merit, which has not received the attention it deserves&quot;, &quot;Propos d&#x27;exil&quot;, a series of short studies of exotic places, in his characteristic semi-autobiographic style. &quot;Madame Chrysanthème&quot;, a novel of Japanese manners that is a precursor to &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, was published the same year.
In 1890 Loti published &quot;Au Maroc&quot;, the record of a journey to Fez in company with a French embassy, and &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un enfant&quot; (&quot;The Story of a Child&quot;), a somewhat fictionalized recollection of Loti&#x27;s childhood that would greatly influence Marcel Proust. A collection of &quot;strangely confidential and sentimental reminiscences&quot;, called &quot;Le Livre de la pitié et de la mort&quot; (&quot;The Book of Pity and Death&quot;) was published in 1891.

Loti was aboard ship at the port of Algiers when news reached him of his election, on 21 May 1891, to the Académie française. In 1892 he published &quot;Fantôme d&#x27;orient&quot;, a short novel derived from a subsequent trip to Constantinople, less a continuation of &quot;Aziyadé&quot; than a commentary on it. He described a visit to the Holy Land in three volumes, &quot;The Desert&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and &quot;Galilee&quot;, (1895–1896), and wrote a novel, &quot;Ramuntcho&quot; (1897), a story of contraband runners in the Basque province. In 1898 he collected his later essays as &quot;Figures et Choses qui passaient&quot; (&quot;Passing Figures and Things&quot;).
In 1899 and 1900 Loti visited British India, with the view of describing what he saw; the result appeared in 1903 in &quot;L&#x27;Inde (sans les anglais)&quot; (&quot;India (without the English)&quot;). During the autumn of 1900 he went to China as part of the international expedition sent to combat the Boxer Rebellion. He described what he saw there after the siege of Peking in &quot;Les Derniers Jours de Pékin&quot; (&quot;The Last Days of Peking&quot;, 1902).

Loti&#x27;s later publications include: &quot;La Troisième jeunesse de Mme Prune&quot; (&quot;The Third Youth of Mrs. Plum&quot;, 1905), which resulted from a return visit to Japan and once again hovers between narrative and travelog; &quot;Les Désenchantées&quot; (&quot;The Unawakened&quot;, 1906); &quot;La Mort de Philae&quot; (&quot;The Death of Philae&quot;, 1908), recounting a trip to Egypt; &quot;Judith Renaudin&quot; (produced at the Théâtre Antoine, 1898), a five-act historical play that Loti presented as based on an episode in his family history; and, in collaboration with Emile Vedel, a translation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, produced at the Théâtre Antoine in 1904. &quot;Les Désenchantées&quot;, which concerned women of the Turkish harem, was based like many of Loti&#x27;s books, on fact. It has, however, become clear that Loti was in fact the victim of a hoax by three prosperous Turkish women.

In 1912 at the Century Theatre in New York City, Loti mounted a production of &quot;The Daughter of Heaven&quot;, a George Egerton adaptation of his French play &quot;La fille du ciel&quot;, commissioned in March 1903 by Sarah Bernhardt, written in collaboration with Judith Gautier and published in 1911. The play was never performed in France, since apparently Bernhardt lost interest when she learned she would have to wear a black wig over her red hair. In New York the title role was performed by Viola Allen.

He died in 1923 in Hendaye and was interred on the island of Oléron with a state funeral.

Loti was an inveterate collector and his marriage into wealth helped him support this habit. His house in Rochefort, a remarkable reworking of two adjacent bourgeois row houses, is preserved as a museum. One elaborately tiled room is an Orientalist fantasia of a mosque, including a small fountain and five ceremoniously draped coffins containing desiccated bodies. Another room evokes a medieval banqueting hall. Loti&#x27;s own bedroom is rather like a monk&#x27;s cell, but mixes Christian, Persian and Muslim religious artifacts. The courtyard described in &quot;The Story of a Child&quot;, with the fountain built for him by his older brother, is still there. There is also a museum in Istanbul named after him located on a hill where Loti used to spend his free time during his sojourn in Turkey.

<text>The First Servile War of 135–132 BC was a slave rebellion against the Roman Republic, which took place in Sicily. The revolt started in 135 when Eunus, a slave from Syria who claimed to be a prophet, captured the city of Enna in the middle of the island with 400 fellow slaves. Soon after, Cleon, a Cilician slave, stormed the city of Agrigentum on the southern coast, slaughtered the population, and then joined Eunus&#x27; army and became his military commander. Eunus even proclaimed himself king, under the name of Antiochus, after the Seleucid emperors of his native Syria.

The former slaves then moved to the eastern coast and took control of Catana and Tauromenium. Their exploit triggered several minor revolts in Italy and as far as Delos in the Aegean Sea. Eunus and Cleon were able to repel several Roman attempts to quell the rebellion until an army commanded by consul Publius Rupilius arrived in Sicily in 134 and besieged the cities controlled by the slaves. The revolt ended in 132 with the fall of Enna and Tauromenium.

== Origins ==
Following the final expulsion of the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War, there were great changes in land ownership in Sicily. Speculators from Italy rushed onto the island, buying up large tracts of land at low prices, or occupied estates which had belonged to Sicilians of the Carthaginian party. These were forfeited to Rome after the execution or flight of their owners.

The newly arrived Roman Sicilians exploited their slaves more brutally than their predecessors. According to Diodorus Siculus, politically influential slave-owners, often Roman equites, did not provide enough food and clothing for their slaves. The Roman conquest of Macedonia, in which thousands of the conquered were sold into slavery, the slave-dealing of the Cretan and Cilician pirates whose activity was practically unchecked at this time, as well as the oppression of corrupt Roman provincial governors, who were known to organize man-hunts after lower-class country provincials (to be sold as slaves)—all contributed to a constant supply of new slaves at very cheap price, which made it more profitable for their masters to wear them out by unremitting labor, harshness, exposure and malnutrition, to be cheaply replaced, than to take proper care for their nourishment, health, and accommodation. Accordingly, the plantation system which took shape in Sicily led to thousands of slaves dying every year of toil in the fields from dawn to dusk with chains around their legs, and being locked up in suffocating subterranean pits by night. For food, the slaves had to turn to banditry to survive. The Roman Senate failed to take measures to curb this dangerous tendency, which converted one of the most beautiful and fertile provinces of the Republic into a horrible den of misery, brigandage, atrocity and death.

== Servile War ==
In 135 BC, the plantation slaves in Sicily finally rose in revolt, having as their head a certain Eunus of Syrian origin, who, as a conjurer and self-proclaimed prophet, had long foretold that he would be king. Recognizing his talents, his plantation master used to employ him as an entertainer at symposia, where he would perform sleight-of-hand magic tricks that included breathing fire. During the performance he kept up a patter—thought humorous by his listeners—saying that Sicilian society would experience a role-reversal, in which his aristocratic audience would be killed or enslaved, and he would become king. To those who gave him tips, Eunus promised that they would be spared once he came into his kingdom. During the revolt, he spared the lives of at least some of those individuals.

The spark which would end up starting the revolt came when a group of slaves, who were suffering under the severe cruelty of their owner Damophilus, sought out Eunus for advice on what to do about their situation. Declaring that his prophecy was now to be fulfilled, Eunus organized about 400 slaves into a band and stormed the prominent city of Enna located in the interior of the island and the home of Damophilus. The unprepared town was captured and savagely sacked by the insurgents, who executed every inhabitant but the iron-forgers, who were chained to their smithies and put to manufacturing arms for their captors. Damophilus was butchered after being insultingly paraded through the local theater, abjectly begging for his life while his wife was tortured to death by her servants. Their daughter, who had once attempted to alleviate the suffering of her family&#x27;s slaves, was spared by the mob and given an honorable escort which was to deliver her to the Roman garrison at Catana.

Upon the capture of Enna, Eunus crowned himself king and subsequently took the name Antiochus, a name used by the Seleucids who ruled his homeland Syria, and he called his followers, who numbered in the tens of thousands, &quot;Syrians&quot;. After the capture of Enna, the revolt quickly spread. Achaeus, a Greek slave, was named commander-in-chief by Eunus, who simultaneously proclaimed himself &quot;king Antiochus&quot;, of Syria. A group of 5,000 slaves on the south side of the island under Cleon rose up and captured Agrigentum, after which they joined Eunus and his forces. The numbers of the slave army swelled rapidly from 10,000 to 70,000 by the lowest number (Livy and Orosius following him), or as many as 200,000 according to Diodorus Siculus, including men and women, possibly counting children as well.

The Praetor Lucius Hypsaeus marched with a body of Sicilian militia to quash the revolt but the slaves routed his army. They then defeated three other praetors in succession and occupied almost the whole island by the end of the year. In 134 the Roman Senate sent Flaccus, the consul for the year, to put an end to the revolt. However, his campaign, the details of which are few and obscure, seems to have ended without a conclusive result. A year later, in 133 the new consul Lucius Calpurnius Piso was given the same task as Flaccus but this time the effort actually gave results. He recaptured Messana and put 8,000 surrendered slaves to death before laying siege to the important town of Tauromenium on the north-east coast, although he was unable to take it. The revolt was finally snuffed out in its entirety the following year by Publius Rupilius. He also laid siege to Tauromenium and captured it with relative ease thanks to the help of traitors from within the slave army defending the town. All the prisoners taken when the town fell were first tortured and then thrown from a cliff. Next he marched on Enna, which had become the center of the entire revolt, where one of the slave leaders, Cleon, had taken refuge. Cleon in turn died of wounds sustained during a desperate sally out of the gates to try to break the Roman siege lines. Enna fell not long after, again helped by traitors inside the walls. The remnants of the slave army on the rest of the island were quickly stamped out, with around 20,000 prisoners being crucified by Rupilius in retribution.

As for Eunus, little is known about his actual participation in the war. Only his enemies left accounts of him, and they gave credit for his victories to his general Cleon. But Eunus must have been a man of considerable ability to have maintained his leadership position throughout the war and to have commanded the services of those said to have been his superiors. Eunus was captured after Tauromenium fell and was found hiding in a pit. He was taken to the city of Morgantina to await punishment, but he died of disease before he could be judged.

The war lasted from 135 until 132 BC. It was the first of three large-scale slave revolts against the Roman Republic; the last and the most famous was led by Spartacus.

<text>Niterói () is a municipality in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in the southeast region of Brazil. It lies across Guanabara Bay, facing the city of Rio de Janeiro and forming part of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area. It was the capital of Rio de Janeiro, as marked by its golden mural crown, from 1834 to 1894 and again from 1903 to 1975. It has an estimated population of 515,317 inhabitants (2020) and an area of , making it the fifth most populous city in the state. It has the highest Human Development Index in the state and the seventh highest among Brazil&#x27;s municipalities in 2010. Individually, it is the municipality with the second highest average monthly household income per capita in Brazil and appears in 13th place among the municipalities of the country according to social indicators related to education. The city has the nicknames of &quot;Cidade Sorriso&quot; (Smile City).

Studies by the Getulio Vargas Foundation in June 2011 classified Niterói as the richest city of Brazil, with 55.7% of the population included in class A. Considering the classes A and B, Niterói also appears in the first place, with 85.9% of the population in these classes. According to 2010 data from IBGE, Niterói&#x27;s nominal gross domestic product was 11.2 billion reais, being the fifth municipality with the highest gross domestic product of the state. The city is the second largest formal employer in the state of Rio de Janeiro, although it occupies the 5th place in terms of the number of inhabitants. The city is one of the main financial, commercial and industrial centers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, being the 12th among the 100 best Brazilian cities to do business.

Niterói was founded on 22 November 1573 by the Tupi chief Arariboia, who later was forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism and was given the Christian name of Martim Afonso, after the Portuguese explorer Martim Afonso de Sousa, making it the only Brazilian city to have been founded by a non-Christian, non-assimilated indigenous person.

The municipality contains part of the Serra da Tiririca State Park, created in 1991.

== Toponym ==
&quot;Niterói&quot; is a term of Tupi origin, with &quot; being its recorded form in the &quot; (), a dictionary of the Tupi language compiled at the end of the 16th century. According to , this term would mean &quot;the (bay) all sinuous&quot;, through the composition of , a reflexive pronoun, , &quot;sinuous&quot; (a term recorded by Antonio Ruiz de Montoya in his ), and , a particle that indicates a customary trait. Edelweiss reinforces this hypothesis through the poem &quot;De Gestis Mendi de Saa&quot;, which calls Rio de Janeiro a &quot;sinuous port&quot; twice, and he suggests that this designation reveals Tupi influence.

==History==
===France Antarctique===
In the year 1555, French navigator Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon allied himself with the Tupinambas Indians who dominated the Guanabara Bay and instituted a French colony in the region, France Antarctique. The region was avoided by the Portuguese because of the hostility of the Tupinamba. The region developed under the command of Villegaignon, who planned to build a city in the region. After a while, Calvinists who had emigrated from France to the colony returned to France, where they accused Villegaignon of prejudice against Protestants and of maladministration. The French navigator had to return to France to explain himself.

Following the absence of the French leader, the Portuguese crown began noticing that the bay of Rio de Janeiro would make a strategic scale for the Atlantic route of ships from Portugal to its colonies in Africa and Asia, as well an important advanced bridgehead for the defense of South Brazil. Fortresses were built and an alliance was formed with nearby native Tupi-Guaraní tribes to defend the settlement against other European invaders. Then, in 1560, the Portuguese leader Mem de Sá attacked and destroyed the French fort that was located in Guanabara Bay, Coligny Fort, without, however, being able to definitively expel the French from the region. Estácio de Sá, Mem de Sá&#x27;s nephew, who would continue to command the war, enlisted the help of the head of the Temiminos Indians, Arariboia, who accepted the governor&#x27;s request to help the Portuguese expel the French from the Guanabara Bay, in the hope to regain the mother island.

With the end of the war in 1567, Estácio de Sá invoked Arariboia and the Temininós Indians to occupy the right side of the entrance to the Guanabara Bay, opposite the city of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro founded by Estácio in 1565, as previously requested by Arariboia a tract of land. Thus, the entrance to the bay would be fully protected from intrusion. The place to be occupied by Arariboia was known as &quot;Banda D&#x27;Além&quot; (the land beyond), in the eastern side of the bay, from &quot;River Marui&quot; to the &quot;Red Barriers&quot; between &quot;Gragoata&quot; and &quot;Boa Viagem&quot; beaches. This area corresponded to what is nowadays the northwestern part of the municipality of Niterói, which includes the central and northern zones of its urban area. There, in the &quot;Land Beyond&quot;, Arariboia founded the Town of Saint Lawrence of the Indians (in Portuguese, &quot;Vila de São Lourenço dos Índios&quot;), the embryo for the future city of &quot;Niterói&quot;, a Tupi name that means &quot;Hidden Waters&quot;.

===Imperial era===

The village was visited by the King of Brazil, John VI, in 1816, who also decreed its emancipation from Rio de Janeiro on 10 May 1819 and gave the new-created municipality a new name, &quot;Vila Real da Praia Grande&quot; (Royal Town of Great Beach).

In 1834, the city of Rio de Janeiro, capital of the newly established Empire of Brazil, was detached from the rest of Rio de Janeiro Province; Vila Real da Praia Grande was then chosen as the new capital of that province, while the city of Rio de Janeiro itself was converted into a &quot;neutral municipality&quot;, following the Ato Adicional. Niterói served the function of capital until the year of 1975 – except for the period between 1894 and 1903 when it was temporarily transferred to the city of Petrópolis.

Vila Real da Praia Grande was officially renamed &quot;Nictheroy&quot; (Tupi for &quot;hidden waters&quot;) on 6 March 1835. This old spelling persisted until the mid-20th century, when the current spelling–Niterói–was adopted. The capital condition has brought a number of urban developments such as the steam boat, public lighting to whale oil, water supply and new means of transport to connect the city to the interior of the province. Nine years later, the Emperor D. Pedro II granted the city of Niterói the title of Imperial City. The appointment was given to the most important cities, giving them some autonomy and regional power.

At the end of the 19th century, around 1885, some tram systems were founded, which allowed the expansion of the city to Icaraí, Ponta d&#x27;Areia and Itaipu districts.

===Republican era===

In 1890, the Brazilian provinces began being called states and the neutral municipality (Rio de Janeiro city) had its status changed to &quot;Federal District&quot; (or simply DF, the Portuguese acronym for &quot;Distrito Federal&quot;).

The monarchist navy revolt in 1893 damaged productive activities and forced the transfer of the capital&#x27;s headquarters to Petrópolis. In 1903, Niterói returned to be the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. This brought about a new impulse to modernize the city with the construction of squares, decks, parks, waterway station and sewage network, as well as widening of the streets and main avenues.

A circus fire in the city killed 323 people on 17 December 1961; the fire was later found to have been deliberately set by disgruntled circus employees. It is one of the worst tragedies in Brazilian history and the most fatal in the annals of world circus show history.

Following the transference of Brazil&#x27;s capital to Brasília in 1960, the city of Rio de Janeiro became a city-state named Guanabara. This state was merged with Rio de Janeiro State in 1975; since then, Niterói lost its condition of the state&#x27;s capital in favor of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

On 8 April 2010; the mudslide triggered due to heavy rainfall cost at least 200 lives. At least 11,000 people were forced to flee homes due to further mudslides.

==Geography==
Niterói has an area of 129,375 square kilometers located between the Guanabara Bay (west), the Atlantic Ocean (south), Maricá (east) and São Gonçalo (north).

There are a number of beaches in the area, including Praia de Fora and Praia do Imbuí, with their historical values; Piratininga Beach, Camboinhas Beach, Itaipu Beach and Itacoatiara Beach, the most visited; Praia do Sossego, Praia Adam and Eve and Prainha. It has two saltwater lagoons: Piratininga and Itaipu. The first is linked to the second by means of the Camboatá Canal, opened by the National Department of Sanitation Works in 1946. The Itaipu Lagoon, in turn, connects to the sea through the Itaipu Canal, which was built in 1979.

The relief consists of crystalline terrains, divided into massifs and coastal hills. The massifs predominate in the south and form the mountains of Malheiro, Calaboca and Tiririca, where is the Stone of the Elephant, the highest point of the municipality, 412m high.

The coastal plains are composed of sediments, obviously located near the sea. The most extensive area covers the entire area of Piratininga and Itaipu lagoons.

===Climate===
Niterói has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical monsoon climate, with warm to hot temperatures year round as well as relatively frequent rainfall.

==Politics==

In Niterói, executive power is represented by the mayor and cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, prescribe that the public administration should give the population effective tools to exercise participatory democracy. Thus, the city is divided into regional secretariats (although it has already been divided into regional administrations), each headed by a secretary appointed by the mayor.

The legislative power is constituted to the Municipality of Niterói (CMN), composed of 21 elected councilors for mandates of four years (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Federal Constitution, which governs a minimum and maximum number for municipalities according to with number of inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws to the administration and to the Executive, especially the participative budget (Budgetary Guidelines Law).

The current mayor of Niterói is Axel Grael of the Democratic Labour Party, who was elected in 2020 amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in Brazil; he was ex-mayor Rodrigo Neves&#x27; deputy for the 2012–2016 term and Secretary of Planning during the 2017–2020 term.

==Economy==

Niteroi is one most important financial and commercial centers in Rio de Janeiro State, like a modern city, with modern buildings and several shopping malls. Its economy is centered on its trading and commerce services, like real-estate corporations, graphic design, web design and publicity.
It also hosts industries of food (especially seafood), clothes, candles, and marine objects.

The city is located 25 minutes away from Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s downtown region. Niterói boasts the title of fourth richest city in Rio de Janeiro State, and the third in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area.
The Niterói Contemporary Art Museum, the city&#x27;s main landmark, was designed by the famous Brazilian modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. The landscape of the central urban area of the city is dominated by the Niterói Tower, a tall cylindrical office building belonging to the Niterói Shopping Mall.

===Growth===
By the time of its emancipation, the urban area of Niteroi corresponded to its central zone and São Domingos only. The south zone – Icarai, Santa Rosa, Vital Brazil – began to be urbanized in 1841, when the Santa Rosa farm was divided into estates, while Jurujuba evolved from an old fishermen colony. São Francisco and Charitas, sites named after the Catholic Church built in honor to Saint Francis by the Jurujuba cove, remained sparsely populated until about 1940. As for the northern zone of Niteroi, its urbanization began in the late 19th century, when a tramway was inaugurated, allowing the expansion of the city to north and northeast, as well boosting the urban growth of the neighbouring municipality of São Gonçalo.

The realm of Itaipu – a former vast zone of farming lands and forests east of Niteroi – was annexed to the municipality in 1943. It has lost its countryside traits and its urban population has grown fast since the late 1960s.

In the early 20th century, Niteroi started its industrialization boom.

==Demographics==
Niteroi is distant from Rio de Janeiro City, to which it is linked by the Rio–Niterói Bridge and two ferryboat services. According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, the city has a population of 487,320 people, making it the fifth most populous city in the state of Rio de Janeiro and the 39th most populous in the country. At the 2010 Census, the population of Niterói grew 9.3% from 2000 to 2010, meaning Niterói had the lowest city population growth in the state of Rio de Janeiro in this period.

The quality of life of the municipality of Niteroi is considered one of the best (third place) among 5,600 other Brazilian municipalities, according to UN indexes (2000 est.).

In the city of Niterói there are several manifest religious doctrines. According to the 2010 census, of the total population of Niterói, there were 258,391 Roman Catholic (53%), 97,759 evangelicals (35%) and 34,484 Spiritists (11%).

According to the division of the Catholic Church in Brazil, Niterói belongs to the Regional Episcopal Council East I of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, and the archiepiscopal seat is in the city of Niterói.

Faetec), Oswaldo Cruz Institute and Escola Canadense de Niterói.

Niterói has the highest Human Development Index (HDI) and best level of literacy in Rio de Janeiro State.

==Transportation==
===Bus===
The urban bus service is the only means of public transportation in the city of Niterói. There are just under fifty active lines, all operated by private companies. Most municipal bus lines have an end point in the center of Niterói (at the João Goulart Bus Terminal), or they pass through the center of Niterói.

===Ferry===

The sea crossing between Niterói and the city of Rio de Janeiro is made by two routes, both having as destination the Praça XV Station. The stations, in Niterói, are located in Arariboia Square, in the center and in the Charitas neighborhood. The crossing between &quot;Praça Arariboia&quot; and &quot;Praça 15 de Novembro&quot; is done by large boats, with capacity for up to 2,000 passengers, in a journey that lasts about twenty minutes.

Since 2006, the boats have been gradually replaced by large catamarans with a lower capacity (up to 1,200 passengers), but with a shorter crossing time of between 12 and 15 minutes. The crossing between the station of Charitas and that of the &quot;Praça 15 de Novembro&quot;× is done by small catamarans, being this service considered selective transport.

===Train===
There was a railway extension for passenger transportation, 33 km long, connecting Niterói to the municipality of Itaboraí, passing through São Gonçalo. Until its deactivation in 2007 the extension was operated by the state-owned company Central. In the end, there were only two daily trips, one in each direction, using an obsolete train of the 1950s. The line is now deactivated and in several sections, the tracks have been removed by the municipalities of São Gonçalo and Niterói. Since in the future there is the proposal to use the bed of this branch for the implementation of part of the projected Line 3 of the Rio Metro between Niterói and Itaboraí.

==Culture==

Niterói is one of the largest historical and cultural centers in Brazil. Its culture is characterized by fishing villages (Jurujuba), forts, museums and futuristic monuments, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art, the symbol of the municipality, built by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the Popular Theater of Niterói. The social culture is based on a very hospitable population, which resulted in the nickname of Niterói: &quot;city-smile&quot;.

The architecture of Niterói is characterized by a contrast between the past and the present. Historic buildings, such as the Niterói State Library, the Justice Palace, the Niterói Post Office Building, the Municipal Theater of Niterói, the Cantareira Station, the Ingá Palace, the Solar do Jambeiro and the Niterói City Hall stand side by side to the side with works of futuristic bond, like, for example, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Square Juscelino Kubitschek. the Popular Theater of Niterói and the rest of the Niemeyer Way. Also known to have the best scout group in Brazil, the 4th GEMAR-Gaviões do Mar.

The Catholic churches also express a lot of niteroiense culture. The São Lourenço dos Índios Church, the foundation of the municipality, the Church of São Sebastião de Itaipu, Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, the Church of Saint Peter the Fisherman, the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist and the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians embellish the streets with their baroque, classic and colonial architectures.

==Sports==

Besides being hometown of stars like Leonardo, Edmundo and Gérson, the city is also homeland of the Canto do Rio Foot-Ball Club, which was founded in 1913 and was the only club outside the city of Rio de Janeiro to participate in the Rio de Janeiro Championship in the 1940s. The club also had its anthem composed by Lamartine Babo, composer of the anthems for every participant of the Rio de Janeiro Championship of 1941 due to a radio campaign. The city is not currently represented in the elite of national football.

Other football clubs in the city are the Fonseca Athletic Club, which recently announced its return to professional football and the Rio Cricket and Athletic Association, which participated in the first championship in Rio, reaching third place and having the championship set in its stadium. Rio Cricket also participated in (possibly) the first rivalry of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s football, with Paissandu Atlético Clube, a club in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which was founded by Rio Cricket founders and has a Rio de Janeiro Championship title.

The city also has the Caio Martins Stadium, which is located in the Santa Rosa neighborhood and has for years been the home of Canto do Rio and more recently Botafogo in the 2000s. In 2007, the stadium&#x27;s gymnasium was the stage of the final of the Feminine Superleague of Volleyball, that finished with victory of the team of Rio de Janeiro. Nowadays, the stadium is used for training of Botafogo and in games scheduled by the FFERJ – Mostly, in championships of inferior divisions.

==Administrative divisions==
From 1943 to the late 1970s, the county of Niteroi comprised two districts only: the district of Niteroi (original area) and the district of Itaipu (acquired in 1943), which barely had an urban continuity or even proper road links to each other and were considered apart areas. The fractioning of Itaipu&#x27;s farms into real estates as well its boom after the building of the Rio-Niterói&#x27;s bridge demanded a better integration between the two sides of the county which led to the improving of the roads and urban facilities and a reformation on the make up of Niteroi&#x27;s administrative division. The county was reorganised into five districts. In the early 1990s, the administrative division of Niterói was altered once again, being the county now divided into twelve administrative, further subdivided into 52 &quot;bairros&quot; (neighborhoods) and 5 &quot;Regiões de Planejamento&quot; (&quot;Planning Regions&quot;):

<text>Michel Ney, 1st Prince de la Moskowa, 1st Duke of Elchingen (; 10 January 1769 – 7 December 1815), was a French military commander and Marshal of the Empire who fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.

The son of a cooper from Saarlouis, Ney worked as a civil servant until 1787 when he enlisted in a cavalry regiment, right before the outbreak of French Revolution. Distinguishing himself as a cavalry officer in the War of the First Coalition, he quickly rose through the ranks and, by the Battle of Hohenlinden (1800), he had been promoted to divisional general. On Napoleon&#x27;s proclamation of the French Empire, Ney was named one of the original 18 Marshals of the Empire. He played an instrumental role during Napoleon&#x27;s subsequent campaigns, seeing action at Elchingen (1805), Jena (1806) and Eylau (1807). Ney commanded the French rearguard during the disastrous invasion of Russia, for which he was lauded &quot;the bravest of the brave&quot; by the emperor.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat by the Sixth Coalition in 1814, Ney pressured the emperor to abdicate and pledged his allegiance to the restored Bourbon monarchy. He rejoined Napoleon during the Hundred Days but met defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (1815), after which he was charged with treason by the restored monarchy and executed by firing squad.

== Early life ==

Ney was born in the town of Sarrelouis, in the French province of Lorraine, along the French–German border. He was the second son of Pierre Ney (1738–1826), a master cooper and veteran of the Seven Years&#x27; War, and his wife Marguerite Greiveldinger.

His hometown at the time of his birth comprised a French enclave in the predominantly German region of Saarland, and Ney grew up bilingual, due to his German roots. He was educated at the Collège des Augustins in Sarrelouis until 1782, when he began working as a clerk in a local notary&#x27;s office, and in 1784 was employed in mines and forges.

== Military career ==

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
Life as a civil servant did not suit Ney, and he enlisted in the Colonel-General Hussar Regiment in 1787. Under the Bourbon monarchy, entry to the officer corps of the French Army was restricted to those with four quarterings of nobility (&quot;i.e.&quot;, two generations of aristocratic birth). However, Ney rapidly rose through the non-commissioned officer ranks.

Following the French Revolution, Ney continued to serve in what was now the French Revolutionary Army, in the Army of the North. In September 1792 he saw action at the Battle of Valmy and in October was commissioned as an officer under the Republic. As an officer he participated in the Battle of Neerwinden in 1793 and was wounded at the Siege of Mainz, also in 1793. in June 1794, he was transferred to Army of Sambre-et-Meuse.

Ney was promoted to brigadier general in August 1796, and commanded cavalry on the German fronts. On 17 April 1797, during the Battle of Neuwied, Ney led a cavalry charge against Austrian lancers trying to seize French cannons. The lancers were beaten back, but Ney&#x27;s cavalry were counter-attacked by heavy cavalry. During the mêlée, Ney was thrown from his horse and captured in the vicinity of the municipality of Dierdorf; on 8 May he was exchanged for an Austrian general. Following the capture of Mannheim, Ney was promoted to &quot;général de division&quot; on 28 March 1799 and was given brief command over the Army of the Rhine from 25 September to 23 October. Later in 1799, Ney commanded cavalry in the armies of Switzerland and the Danube. At Winterthur, Ney received wounds in the thigh and wrist. After recovering he fought at Hohenlinden under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau in December 1800. From September 1802, Ney commanded French troops in Switzerland and performed diplomatic duties.

=== Napoleonic Wars ===
On 19 May 1804, Ney received his marshal&#x27;s baton, emblematic of his status as a Marshal of the Empire, the Napoleonic era&#x27;s equivalent of Marshal of France. In the 1805 campaign, Ney took command of the VI Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and was praised for his conduct at Elchingen. In November 1805, Ney invaded Tyrol, capturing Innsbruck from Archduke John. In the 1806 campaign, Ney fought at Jena and then occupied Erfurt. Later in the campaign, Ney successfully besieged Magdeburg. In the 1807 campaign, Ney arrived with reinforcements in time to save Napoleon from defeat at Eylau. Later in the campaign, Ney fought at Güttstadt and commanded the right wing at Friedland. On 6June 1808, Ney was made &quot;Duke of Elchingen&quot;. In August 1808, he was sent to Spain in command of the VI Corps and saw action in a number of minor engagements. In 1809, he skirmished with an Anglo-Portuguese force under Sir Robert Wilson at Puerto de Baños. In 1810, Ney joined Marshal André Masséna in the invasion of Portugal, where he captured Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, and saw further action on the River Côa, and a defeat at the Bussaco. The French army followed the retreating allies to the Lines of Torres Vedras, a scorched earth trap prepared by Wellington in absolute secrecy. After losing 21,000 men of 61,000 in several months of hunger, Masséna and Ney were forced to retreat due to lack of food and supplies, see also attrition warfare against Napoleon. Ney engaged Wellington&#x27;s forces in a series of rearguard actions (Pombal, Redinha, Casal Novo, and Foz de Arouce) through which he managed to delay the pursuing Coalition forces long enough to allow the main French force to retreat in 1811. He was ultimately removed from his command for insubordination.

===Russia to Fontainebleau===

Ney was given command of the III Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; during the invasion of Russia in 1812. At Smolensk, Ney was wounded in the neck but recovered enough to later fight in the central sector at Borodino. During the retreat from Moscow, Ney commanded the rearguard (and was known as &quot;the last Frenchman on Russian soil&quot; when he passed the Niemen on 14 December). After being cut off from the main army during the Battle of Krasnoi, Ney managed to escape in a heavy fog over the Dnieper River, but not without heavy losses, and to rejoin it in Orsha, which delighted Napoleon. For this action Ney was given the nickname &quot;the bravest of the brave&quot; by the emperor.

===Ney crossing the Dniepr===
Ney lost more than half his strength; almost all the cavalry and all the artillery, with the exception of two guns, had disappeared. The terrible defeat of the III Corps was thorough enough to induce the chivalrous Miloradovich to extend another honorable surrender to Ney. In the early evening during a heavy fog Ney decided to draw back with 3,000 men. Ney escaped passing around the Russian at Mankovo, following the brook Losvinka for two hours, about 13 km north. At midnight he was informed that the enemy was approaching. In the middle of the night Ney decided to cross the Dnieper, supposedly near the remote hamlet Alekseyevka at a spot which could be used in summer to cross the river but with an almost vertical slope. Ney literally got down on all fours. One by one, but not without heavy losses, leaving guns, horses, part of the detachment and wounded who could not go on. The river, 110 m wide and of a depth that could reach up to 2 m, was only frozen for a couple of days, leaving it fragile, and the ice broke in several places. When Ney and his men reached the other bank, they had to climb a twelve feet (3.7 m), very steep slope:. The elements and the Cossacks reduced Ney&#x27;s contingent to only 800 (900, 2,000?) diehards. In the previous 24 hours, 3,000 armed men and 4,000 stragglers had either died or strayed from its ranks. Armand de Briqueville increased the number of abandoned cannons to 6 and increases the number of people who cross to 5–6000.

Ney fought at the Berezina and helped hold the vital bridge at Kovno (modern-day Kaunas), where legend portrays Ney as the last of the invaders to cross the bridge and exit Russia. On 25 March 1813, Ney was given the title of &quot;Prince de la Moskowa&quot;. During the 1813 campaign, Ney fought at Weissenfels, was wounded at Lützen, and commanded the left wing at Bautzen. Ney later fought at Dennewitz and Leipzig, where he was again wounded. In the 1814 campaign in France, Ney fought various battles and commanded various units. At Fontainebleau, Ney became the spokesperson for the marshals&#x27; revolt on 4 April 1814, demanding Napoleon&#x27;s abdication. Ney informed Napoleon that the army would not march on Paris; Napoleon responded, &quot;the army will obey me!&quot; to which Ney answered, &quot;the army will obey its chiefs&quot;.

When Paris fell and the Bourbons reclaimed the throne, Ney, who had pressured Napoleon to accept his first abdication and exile, was promoted, lauded, and made a Peer of France by the newly enthroned King Louis XVIII. Although Ney had pledged his allegiance to the restored monarchy, the Bourbon court looked down on him because he was a commoner by birth.

===Hundred Days===

When he heard of Napoleon&#x27;s return to France, Ney, determined to keep France at peace and to show his loyalty to Louis XVIII, organized a force to stop Napoleon&#x27;s march on Paris. Ney also pledged to bring Napoleon back alive in an iron cage. Aware of Ney&#x27;s plans, Napoleon sent him a letter which said, in part, &quot;I shall receive you as I did after the Battle of the Moskowa.&quot; On 14 March, on the main square in Lons-le-Saulnier (Jura) Ney joined Napoleon with a small army of 6,000 men. 
Ney’s reconciliation with Napoleon was a body blow to the monarchy’s hopes of retaining control of the army and with it, France, and the King abandoned Paris just two days after Ney’s ‘treason’ became known in the capital. 
On 15 June 1815, Napoleon appointed Ney as commander of the left wing of the Army of the North. On 16 June, Napoleon&#x27;s forces split up into two wings to fight two separate battles simultaneously. Ney attacked the Duke of Wellington at Quatre Bras (and received criticism for attacking slowly) while Napoleon attacked Marshal Blücher&#x27;s Prussians at Ligny. Although Ney was criticized for not capturing Quatre Bras early, there is still debate as to what time Napoleon actually ordered Ney to capture the town. At Ligny, Napoleon ordered General Jean-Baptiste d&#x27;Erlon to move his corps (on Napoleon&#x27;s left and Ney&#x27;s right at the time) to the Prussians&#x27; rear in order to cut off their line of retreat. D&#x27;Erlon began to move into position, but suddenly stopped and began moving away, much to the surprise and horror of Napoleon. The reason for the sudden change in movement is that Ney had ordered d&#x27;Erlon to come to his aid at Quatre Bras. Without d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s corps blocking the Prussians&#x27; line of retreat, the French victory at Ligny was not complete, and the Prussians were not routed.

At Waterloo on 18 June, Ney again commanded the left wing of the army. At around 3:30 p.m., Ney ordered a mass cavalry charge against the Anglo-Allied lines. Ney&#x27;s cavalry overran the enemy cannons but found the infantry formed in cavalry-proof square formations which – without infantry or artillery support – he failed to break. The action earned Ney criticism, and some argue that it led to Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo. Debate continues as to the responsibility for the cavalry charge and why it went unsupported. Ney&#x27;s cavalry also failed to spike the enemy cannons (driving iron spikes into the firing holes) while they were under French control (during the cavalry attack, the crews of the cannon retreated into the squares for protection, and then re-manned their pieces as the cavalry withdrew). Ney&#x27;s cavalry carried the equipment needed to spike cannons, and spiking the cannons would probably have made them useless for the rest of the battle. The loss of a large number of cannon would have weakened the army and could have caused the Anglo-Allied Army to withdraw from the battle. Ney was seen during one of the charges beating his sword against the side of a British cannon in furious frustration. During the battle, he had five horses killed under him, and at the end of the day, Ney led one of the last infantry charges, shouting to his men: &quot;Come and see how a marshal of France meets his death!&quot; It was as though Ney was seeking death, but death did not want him, as many observers reported.

== Trial and execution ==


When Napoleon was defeated, dethroned, and exiled for the second time in the summer of 1815, Ney was arrested on 3 August 1815. Marshal Moncey was ordered to assume the presidency of a court-martial convened to try Ney but the marshal declined and was for a time imprisoned for it. The King&#x27;s government then appointed Marshal Jourdan as president and when it finally convened on 9 November 1815, the court-martial comprised the marshals Jourdan, Masséna, Augereau, and Mortier, and the generals Gazan de La Peyriere (instead of Maison who refused), Claparède and Villatte. After long deliberation, the court-martial voted 5-2 to declare itself &quot;non-competent&quot;.

After the court-martial decided on 11 and 12 November that it did not have jurisdiction, Ney was tried on 16 November for treason by the Chamber of Peers. Key evidence in the trial was supplied by Ney&#x27;s subordinate commanders Generals Bourmont, an arch royalist, and General Lecourbe, a republican who had fallen out of favour during the empire and was now in service to the King. Bourmont testified that Ney had been a keen supporter of Napoleon and gave evidence such as the accusation that Ney was wearing an Imperial Eagle decoration minutes after his decision to switch sides - suggesting some element of planning. Ney responded outraged.

While Lecourbe had died, testimony he gave to a magistrate was read at the trial showing he thought the situation lost and that Napoleon&#x27;s 14,000 men could not be practically resisted by the 5,000 men of dubious loyalty under Ney&#x27;s command. Other witnesses failed to corroborate Bourmont&#x27;s claim that Ney had been wearing an Imperial eagle decoration.

In order to save Ney&#x27;s life, his lawyer André Dupin declared that Ney was now Prussian and could not be judged by a French court for treason as Ney&#x27;s hometown of Sarrelouis had been annexed by Prussia according to the Treaty of Paris of 1815. Ney ruined his lawyer&#x27;s effort by interrupting him and stating: &quot;Je suis Français et je resterai Français!&quot; (&quot;I am French and I will remain French!&quot;). On 4 December, when the Peers were called to give their verdict, 137 voted for the death penalty and 17 for deportation; five abstained. Only a single vote, that of the Duc de Broglie, was for acquittal. On 6 December 1815, Ney was condemned, and on 7 December 1815 he was executed by firing squad in Paris near the Luxembourg Gardens. He refused to wear a blindfold and was allowed the right to give the order to fire, reportedly saying:

Ney was buried in Paris at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

== Family ==
Ney married Aglaé Auguié (Paris, 24 March 1782 – Paris, 1 July 1854), daughter of Pierre César Auguié (1738–1815) and Adélaïde Henriette Genet (1758–1794, sister of Henriette Campan and Citizen Genêt), at Thiverval-Grignon on 5 August 1802. they had four sons:
* Joseph Napoléon, 2nd &quot;Prince de la Moskowa&quot; (Paris, 8 May 1803 – Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 25 July 1857). He married Albine Laffitte (Paris, 12 May 1805 – Paris, 18 July 1881) in Paris on 26 January 1828. Albine was the daughter of Jacques Laffitte, Governor of the Bank of France. They had two children, whose male blood line ended. Joseph also had an illegitimate son who was married and died childless.
* Michel Louis Félix, recognized as 2nd Duc d&#x27;Elchingen in 1826 (born 24 August 1804 in Paris – died 14 July 1854 at Gallipoli, during the Crimean War). He married Marie-Joséphine (Lubersac (20 December 1801 – Versailles, 1 July 1889), daughter of Joseph Souham, in Paris on 19 January 1833.
* Eugène Michel (Paris, 12 July 1806 – Paris, 25 October 1845). He died unmarried.
* Edgar Napoléon Henry, recognized as 3rd Prince de la Moskowa 1857 (Paris, 12 April 1812 – Paris, 4 October 1882). He married Clotilde de La Rochelambert (Saint-Cloud, 29 July 1829 – Paris, 1884) in Paris on 16 January 1869. Their marriage was childless and the title of Prince de la Moskowa then reverted to the descendants of Michel Louis Félix.

It is questionable if Ida Saint-Elme, &#x27;Courtisane de la Grande Armée&#x27;, was a lover of Michel Ney.

;Carolina folk culture
Rumors that a school teacher in Rowan County, North Carolina was Marshal Ney in exile circulated in Carolina in 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.

Records in Charleston, South Carolina indicate the arrival of one &quot;Peter Stewart Ney&quot; the year following Michel Ney&#x27;s execution (Michel Ney&#x27;s father was named Peter, and his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Stewart). Peter Ney served as a school teacher in Rowan County until his death on 15 November 1846. According to legend, Peter Ney slashed his throat and almost died upon hearing of the death of Napoleon in 1821. His last words upon his death were reportedly &quot;I am Ney of France&quot;, and he supposedly claimed to be Marshal Ney when drunk, although denying it when sober.

However, there was evidence contradicting this legend, the main being that the execution of Michel Ney is well documented and verified. And Marshal Ney, though fluent in German, is not known to have spoken English. One researcher claims evidence exists that Peter Stewart Ney was one Peter McNee, born in 1788 in Stirlingshire, Scotland.

Peter Stewart Ney&#x27;s body was exhumed twice, in 1887 and 1936, but both times no conclusive proof emerged. A new investigation was made in 2022, and while third exhumation found no usable remains, DNA was extracted from a flute that had belonged to Peter Stewart Ney. According to the researchers, this proved conclusively that Peter Stewart Ney was not Michel Ney, although it is possible that he had believed he was.

<text>La Haye Sainte (, , named either after Jesus&#x27; crown of thorns or a nearby bramble hedge) is a walled farmhouse compound at the foot of an escarpment near Waterloo, Belgium, on the N5 road connecting Brussels and Charleroi. It has changed very little since it played a crucial part in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

La Haye Sainte was defended by about 400 King&#x27;s German Legion troops during the Battle of Waterloo. Being greatly outnumbered by attacking French forces, the defenders held out until the late afternoon when they retired as their ammunition had run out. If Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army had captured La Haye Sainte earlier in the day, he would have almost certainly broken through the allied centre and defeated the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army.

The capture of La Haye Sainte in the early evening then gave the French the advantage of a defensible position from which to launch a potentially decisive attack on the Allied centre. However, Napoleon was too late—by this time, Blücher and the Prussian army had arrived on the battlefield and the outnumbered French army was defeated.

== History ==
La Haye Sainte was originally built before 1536. Much of the complex was rebuilt in the 1700s.

=== Battle of Waterloo ===
The road leads from La Belle Alliance, where Napoleon had his headquarters on the morning of the battle, through where the centre of the French front line was located, to a crossroads on the ridge which is at the top of the escarpment and then on to Brussels. The Duke of Wellington placed the majority of his forces on either side of the Brussels road behind the ridge on the Brussels side. This kept most of his forces out of sight of the French artillery.

Both Napoleon and Wellington made crucial mistakes about La Haye Sainte as it was fought over and around during most of the day. Napoleon failed to allocate enough forces to take the farm earlier in the day while Wellington only realized the strategic value of the position when it was almost too late.

==== Defensive preparations ====
Wellington ordered the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion of the King’s German Legion, commanded by Major Georg Baring, to garrison La Haye Sainte the evening before the battle. Upon arriving at 19:30 amidst heavy rain, Baring ordered the men to begin fortifying the farm complex for defence, in anticipation of an attack the next morning.

Defensive preparations began again before dawn, however it was found the main door to the courtyard of the farm was removed for use as firewood by the occupying troops during the night. In addition, there were few suitable tools to construct defences and Baring&#x27;s pioneers had been sent to aid the fortification of the nearby Hougoumont farmhouse. This meant that the strengthening of the farm’s defences would have to be largely improvised.

The majority of the King&#x27;s German Legion troops were armed with the Baker rifle with rifled barrels, as opposed to the standard smoothbore Brown Bess musket of the British Army. The French troops also used muskets which were quicker to load than the Baker rifle but the latter was more accurate and had about twice the range of a musket.

==== French attacks ====

At 13:00, the French Grand Battery of heavy artillery opened fire before d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Corps (54th and 55th Ligne) marched forward in columns. The French managed to surround La Haye Sainte and despite taking heavy casualties from the garrison, they attacked the centre left of Wellington&#x27;s line. As the centre began to give way and La Haye Sainte became vulnerable, Picton&#x27;s division was sent to plug the gap. As the French were beaten back from La Haye Sainte, the heavy cavalry brigades under Somerset and Ponsonby attacked. This action relieved the pressure on the fortress farm.

At 15:00, Napoleon ordered Marshal Ney to capture La Haye Sainte. While Ney was engaged in the glorious but futile 8,000-man cavalry attack, unsupported by infantry or cannon, on Allied squares on the Brussels side of the ridge, he failed to take La Haye Sainte. During the battle, the KGL were supported by the 1/2 Nassau Regiment and the light company of the 5th Line Battalion KGL.

At 17:30, Napoleon re-issued orders for Ney to take La Haye Sainte. The French had worked up close to the buildings by this time.

==== French capture and final assault ====

At 18:00 Marshal Ney, heavily supported by artillery and some cavalry, took personal command of an infantry regiment (13th Legere) and a company of engineers and captured La Haye Sainte with a furious assault. &quot;The light battalion of the German Legion, which occupied it, had expended all its ammunition&quot; and had to retreat.

Allied forces were unable to counterattack immediately as they were in squares over the ridge. The French brought up guns to fire from its cover however British riflemen of the 1/95 in the &quot;sand pit&quot; to the east of the farm picked off all the gunners, so the guns were ineffective.

At 19:00, thanks to the French garrison in La Haye Sainte, the Imperial Guard was able to climb the escarpment and attack the Allies on the Brussels side of the ridge. This final attack was beaten back and became a rout around 20:10 as the French forces realised that with the arrival of the Prussians from the east, they were beaten. During the French retreat, La Haye Sainte was recaptured by the Allies, some time before 21:00, when Blücher met Wellington at La Belle Alliance.

==Modern La Haye Sainte==
La Haye Sainte has changed very little since the Battle of Waterloo. Today it is privately owned. On the walls are memorials to the King&#x27;s German Legion and the French. Opposite the house is a monument for the officers and the soldiers of the KGL.

<text>Leicester Square () is a London Underground station in the West End of London, within walking distance of Theatreland and Chinatown, as well as the southern reaches of Soho. It is located on Charing Cross Road, a short distance to the east of Leicester Square itself. The station is served by the Northern and Piccadilly lines, and is located in Travelcard Zone 1.

On the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, the station is between Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross stations. On the Piccadilly line, it is between Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden stations.

==History==

On early Tube plans, the station was listed as &quot;Cranbourn Street&quot;, but the present name was used by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway when the station opened on 15 December 1906.

Like other stations on the original sections of the Piccadilly and Northern lines, the station was originally constructed with lifts providing access to the platforms. The increase in passenger numbers in the 1920s as the Northern line was extended north (to Edgware) and south (to Morden) and the expected further increase from the 1930s extensions of the Piccadilly line led to the reconstruction of the station below ground in the early 1930s. New station entrances were constructed to a new sub-surface ticket hall. As with the similar sub-surface ticket hall previously built at Piccadilly Circus, this was excavated partially under the roadway. From there banks of escalators were provided down to both sets of platforms. The redundant lifts were removed but the lift shaft remains in use as a ventilation shaft hidden behind a small door on the first landing of the Cranbourn Street entrance stairs. The redeveloped station opened in 1935.

The escalators down to the Piccadilly line (the longest in the world when opened in 1935) were the longest on the entire Underground network, being 54 m (177 ft) in length, until the rebuilding and reopening of Angel in 1992, which overtook Leicester Square with its 60 m (197 ft) escalators.

Offices above the red terracotta station building on the east side of Charing Cross Road were once occupied by the Northern line management staff but now have other functions in addition to the Northern line management, with Piccadilly line management and support functions on the first floor including a training centre. The building, known as Transad House, was occupied in its early years by the publishers of the Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack and an image of cricket stumps appears above a doorway.
On all four platforms, film sprockets are painted down the entire length and on the top and bottom of the display area (blue on the Piccadilly line platforms, and black on the Northern line platforms), in reference to the four premiere cinemas in Leicester Square.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 24, 29, 176 and night routes N5, N20, N29, N41 and N279 serve the station.

<text>Cajeme is one of the 72 municipalities of the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. It is named after Cajemé, a Yaqui leader. The municipality has an area of 3,312.05 km2 (1,278.79 sq mi) and with a population of 436,484 inhabitants as of 2020. The municipal seat is at Ciudad Obregón.

==History==
Yaqui tribes settled in the region at approximately 1100 and in 1533 had the first contact with the Spanish conquistadors, when Diego de Guzmán arrived at the Yaqui region. The Yaquis defeated the Spanish army. In the 17th century Jesuit missionaries visited the zone to evangelize the Yaqui natives in 1617. In 1619, one of the missionaries, Martín Burgencio, founded Mission San Francisco Buenavista as a of Mission San Francisco Xavier de Cumuripa.

In 1715 El Realito was founded, which is located in the northern region of the current municipio). In the 19th century agriculture developed at the villas of Cumuripa, Buenavista and Cócorit.

Buenavista was the site for the military base of San Carlos de Buenavista during the Spanish colony. It was considered the capital of the Villa de Salvación since 1820 and in the second half of the 19th century it was considered part of the Guaymas district, as well as part of the Yaqui pueblos.

The first inhabitants of Ciudad Obregón established at the Plano Oriente neighborhood when irrigation systems by the Richardson company started functioning in 1910. The train Sudpacífico established a station they called &quot;Cajeme&quot;. Cajeme then was a part of the municipio of Cócorit until it became the capital of the municipio on November 29, 1927. On July 28, 1928, &quot;Ciudad Obregón&quot; was declared as name for the town previously known as &quot;Cajeme&quot; and that it would become the capital of the municipio of &quot;Cajeme&quot;. Previously Cócorit had been dependent on the district of Buenavista during the independent period. According to a law from 1828 for the indigenous governments it was established as a capital of one of their government divisions. On December 26, 1930 it was annexed to the Cajeme municipality.

<doc id="229593" wikidata="Q135515" url="?curid=229593" title="The Sound and the Fury">
<text>The Sound and the Fury is a novel by the American author William Faulkner. It employs several narrative styles, including stream of consciousness. Published in 1929, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; was Faulkner&#x27;s fourth novel, and was not immediately successful. In 1931, however, when Faulkner&#x27;s sixth novel, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, was published—a sensationalist story, which Faulkner later said was written only for money—&quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; also became commercially successful, and Faulkner began to receive critical attention. 

The work has entered the public domain as of January 1, 2025.

== Overview ==
&quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is set in Jefferson, Mississippi, in the first third of the 20th century. The novel centers on the Compson family, former Southern aristocrats who are struggling to deal with the dissolution of their family and its reputation. Over the course of the 30 years or so relayed in the novel, the family falls into financial ruin, loses its religious faith and the respect of the town of Jefferson, and many of them die tragically.

The novel is separated into four narratives. The first, reflecting events occurring and consequent thoughts and memories on April 7, 1928, is written in the voice and from the perspective of Benjamin &quot;Benjy&quot; Compson, an intellectually disabled 33-year-old man. Benjy&#x27;s section is characterized by a disjointed narrative style with frequent chronological leaps.

The second section, taking place on June 2, 1910, focuses on Quentin Compson, Benjy&#x27;s older brother, and the events leading up to Quentin&#x27;s suicide. This section is written in the stream-of-consciousness style and also contains frequent chronological leaps.

In the third section, set a day before the first on April 6, 1928, Faulkner writes from the point of view of Jason, Quentin&#x27;s cynical younger brother. 

In the fourth section, set a day after the first on April 8, 1928, Faulkner introduces a third-person omniscient point of view. This last section primarily focuses on Dilsey, one of the Compsons&#x27; Black servants, and her relations with Jason and &quot;Miss&quot; Quentin Compson (daughter of Quentin&#x27;s sister Caddy), as Dilsey contemplates the thoughts and deeds of everyone in the Compson family.

In 1945, Faulkner wrote a &quot;Compson Appendix&quot; to be included with future printings of &quot;The Sound and the Fury.&quot; It contains a 30-page history of the Compson family from 1699 to 1945.

==Plot==
===Part 1: April 7, 1928===
The first section of the novel is narrated by Benjamin &quot;Benjy&quot; Compson, a source of shame to the family (primarily his mother) due to his diminished mental capacity; the only characters who show genuine care for him are his older sister Caddy and Dilsey, one of the family&#x27;s black servants. His narrative voice is characterized predominantly by its nonlinearity: spanning the period 1898–1928, Benjy&#x27;s narrative is a series of non-chronological events presented in a stream of consciousness. The presence of italics in Benjy&#x27;s section indicates significant shifts in the narrative. Originally Faulkner conceived the use of different colors of ink to signify chronological breaks. This nonlinearity makes the style of this section particularly challenging, but Benjy&#x27;s style develops a cadence that, while not chronologically coherent, provides unbiased insight into many characters&#x27; true motivations. Moreover, Benjy&#x27;s caretaker changes to indicate the time period: Luster in the present, T.P. in Benjy&#x27;s teenage years, and Versh during Benjy&#x27;s infancy and childhood.

In this section we see Benjy&#x27;s three passions: fire, his sister Caddy, and the golf course on land that used to belong to the Compson family. But by 1928 Caddy has been banished from the Compson home after her husband divorced her because her child was not his, and the family has had to sell pastureland to a local golf club to finance Quentin&#x27;s Harvard University education. In the opening scene, Benjy, accompanied by Luster, a servant boy, watches golfers on the nearby golf course as he waits to hear them call &quot;caddie&quot;—the name of his favorite sibling. When one of them calls for his golf caddie, Benjy&#x27;s mind embarks on a whirlwind course of memories of his sister Caddy, focusing on one critical scene. In 1898 when their grandmother died, the four Compson children were forced to play outside during the funeral. To see what was going on inside, Caddy climbed a tree in the yard, and while she looked inside, her brothers — Quentin, Jason and Benjy — looked up and noticed that her underwear was muddy. This is Benjy&#x27;s first memory, and he associates Caddy with trees throughout the rest of his arc, often saying that she smells like trees. Other crucial memories in this section are Benjy&#x27;s change of name (originally &quot;Maury&quot; after his wastrel maternal uncle) upon the discovery of his disability in 1900; the marriage and divorce of Caddy (1910); and Benjy&#x27;s castration, resulting from an attack on a girl that is alluded to briefly within this chapter, wherein a gate is left unlatched and Benjy is out unsupervised.

===Part 2: June 2, 1910===
Quentin, the most intelligent of the Compson children, gives the novel&#x27;s best example of Faulkner&#x27;s narrative technique. We see him as a freshman at Harvard University, wandering the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts, contemplating death, and remembering his family&#x27;s estrangement from his sister Caddy. Like the first section, its narrative is not strictly linear, though the two interweaving threads, of Quentin at Harvard on the one hand, and of his memories on the other, are clearly discernible. Throughout this section, Quentin makes preparations for his suicide by drowning, including leaving letters for classmates. 

Quentin&#x27;s main obsession is Caddy&#x27;s virginity and purity. He is obsessed with Southern ideals of chivalry and is strongly protective of women, especially his sister; he is horrified when she engages in sexual promiscuity. He turns to his father for help and counsel, but the pragmatic Mr. Compson tells him that virginity is invented by men and should not be taken seriously. He also tells Quentin that time will heal all. Quentin spends much of his time trying to prove his father wrong, but is unable to do so. Shortly before Quentin leaves for Harvard in the fall of 1909, Caddy becomes pregnant by a lover she is unable to identify, perhaps Dalton Ames, whom Quentin confronts. The two fight, with Quentin losing disgracefully and Caddy vowing, for Quentin&#x27;s sake, to never speak to Dalton again. Quentin tells his father that they have committed incest, but his father knows that he is lying: &quot;and he did you try to make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldn&#x27;t do any good&quot; (112). Quentin&#x27;s idea of incest is shaped by the idea that, if they &quot;could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us&quot; (51), he could protect his sister by joining her in whatever punishment she might endure. In his mind, he feels a need to take responsibility for Caddy&#x27;s sin.

Pregnant and alone, Caddy marries Herbert Head. Quentin finds him repulsive, but Caddy is resolute: she must marry before she gives birth. Herbert finds out that the child is not his, and sends Caddy and her new daughter away in shame. He also rescinds his offer of a bank job to Caddy&#x27;s brother Jason, who holds Caddy responsible for this misfortune and never forgives her. Quentin&#x27;s wanderings through Harvard as he cuts classes follow the pattern of his heartbreak over losing Caddy. For instance, he meets a small Italian immigrant girl who speaks no English. Significantly, he calls her &quot;sister&quot; and spends much of the day trying to communicate with her, and to care for her by finding her home, to no avail. He thinks sadly of the downfall and squalor of the South after the American Civil War. Tormented by his conflicting thoughts and emotions, Quentin commits suicide by drowning.

===Part 3: April 6, 1928===
The third section is narrated by Jason, the third child and his mother Caroline&#x27;s favorite. Ironically, he is the only child who does not want, need, or return her love. It takes place the day before Benjy&#x27;s section, on Good Friday. Of the three brothers&#x27; sections, Jason&#x27;s is the most straightforward, reflecting his single-minded desire to make money. He worries obsessively about his (bad) investments in the cotton market, which symbolize the financial decline of the South. 

By 1928, Jason&#x27;s father has died and Jason has become the family breadwinner. He supports his mother, Benjy, and Miss Quentin (daughter of Caddy, the family&#x27;s second-born), as well as the family&#x27;s servants. The unjust burden makes him bitter and cynical, with little of the passionate sensitivity of his irresponsible older brother and sister. He goes so far as to blackmail Caddy into making him Miss Quentin&#x27;s sole guardian, then uses that role to steal the support payments that Caddy sends for her daughter, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars over 17 years, stashing thousands in cash in a strongbox. Jason uses the money to maintain a mistress in Memphis and play the stock market. Miss Quentin and her lover later recoup some of the money by climbing through a window and purloining the strongbox. 

This is the first section narrated in a mostly linear fashion, compared with Benjy and Quentin’s disjointed stream of consciousness. It follows the course of Good Friday, a day on which Jason decides to leave work to search for Miss Quentin, who has run away, seemingly in pursuit of mischief. Here we see most immediately the conflict between the two predominant traits of the Compson family, which Caroline attributes to the difference between her blood and her husband&#x27;s: on the one hand, Miss Quentin&#x27;s recklessness and passion, inherited from her mother and Compson’s grandfather; on the other, Jason&#x27;s ruthless cynicism, drawn from his mother&#x27;s side. This section also gives the clearest image of domestic life in the Compson household, with Jason and the servants caring for hypochondriac Caroline and disabled Benjy.

===Part 4: April 8, 1928===
April 8, 1928, is Easter Sunday. This section, the only one without a single first-person narrator, focuses on Dilsey, the powerful matriarch of the Black family servants. She, in contrast to the declining Compsons, draws strength from her faith, standing proud amid a dying family. On this Easter Sunday, Dilsey takes her family and Benjy to the &quot;colored&quot; church. Through her we sense the decay and depravity which have ripened in the Compsons for decades. Dilsey is mistreated and abused, but remains loyal. She and her grandson Luster tend to Benjy as she takes him to church and tries to bring him to salvation. The preacher&#x27;s sermon makes her weep for the Compson family, whose destruction she is now witnessing.

Meanwhile, the tension between Jason and Miss Quentin reaches its inevitable conclusion. The family discovers that Miss Quentin has run away in the night with a carnival worker, having taken the strongbox in which Jason had hidden all his savings, both earned and stolen. Jason complains to the sheriff, who is sympathetic to Miss Quentin and refuses to help. Since much of the money had been embezzled from Miss Quentin, Jason doesn&#x27;t press the issue. He sets off to find her on his own, but loses her trail in nearby Mottson and gives up.

After church, Dilsey allows her grandson Luster to drive Benjy in the family&#x27;s decrepit horse and carriage to the graveyard. Luster, disregarding Benjy&#x27;s set routine, drives the wrong way around a monument, provoking Benjy into hysterical sobbing. Jason suddenly appears, slaps Luster, turns the carriage around, and, in an attempt to quiet the sobbing, hits Benjy and breaks his flower stalk, screaming &quot;Shut up!&quot; After Jason gets off and Luster heads home, Benjy falls silent. Luster turns around to look at Benjy and sees him holding his drooping flower, his eyes &quot;empty and blue and serene again.&quot;

===Appendix: Compson: 1699–1945===
In 1945, Faulkner wrote an appendix to the novel to be published in the then-forthcoming anthology &quot;The Portable Faulkner&quot;, edited by Malcolm Cowley. At Faulkner&#x27;s behest, subsequent printings of &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; frequently contain the appendix at the end of the book; it is sometimes referred to as the fifth part. Written sixteen years after &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, the appendix shows textual differences from the novel, but serves to clarify the novel&#x27;s opaque story.

The appendix is presented as a complete history of the Compson family lineage, beginning with the arrival of their ancestor Quentin Maclachlan in America in 1779 and continuing through 1945, including events that transpired after the novel (which takes place in 1928). In particular, the appendix reveals that Caroline Bascomb Compson died in 1933, at which time Jason had Benjy committed to the state asylum in Jackson, fired the Black servants, sold the last of the Compson land, and moved into an apartment above his farming supply store. It is also revealed that Jason had himself declared Benjy&#x27;s legal guardian many years ago, without their mother&#x27;s knowledge, and used this status to have Benjy castrated.

The appendix also reveals the fate of Caddy, last seen in the novel when her daughter Quentin is still a baby. After marrying and divorcing a second time (to a &quot;minor moving picture magnate&quot; in Hollywood), Caddy moved to Paris, where she lived at the time of the German occupation. In 1943, the librarian of Yoknapatawpha County discovered a magazine photograph of Caddy in the company of a German staff general and attempted separately to recruit Jason and Dilsey to save her: Jason, at first acknowledging that the photo was of his sister, denied it after realizing that the librarian wanted his help, while Dilsey pretended to be unable to see the picture at all. The librarian later realized that while Jason remains cold and unsympathetic towards Caddy, Dilsey simply understands that Caddy neither wants nor needs to be saved from the Germans, because nothing else remains for her.

The appendix concludes with an accounting for the Black family who worked as servants to the Compsons. Unlike the entries for the Compsons themselves, which are lengthy, detailed, and told with an omniscient narrative perspective, the servants&#x27; entries are simple and succinct. Dilsey&#x27;s entry, the final in the appendix, consists of two words: &quot;They endured.&quot;

==Characters==

* Jason Compson III – father of the Compson family, a lawyer who attended the : a pessimist and alcoholic, with cynical opinions that torment his son Quentin. He also narrates several chapters of &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;
* Caroline Bascomb Compson – wife of Jason Compson III: a self-absorbed neurotic who has never shown affection for any of her children except Jason, whom she seems to like only because he takes after her side of the family. In her old age she has become an abusive hypochondriac.
* Quentin Compson III – the oldest Compson child: passionate and neurotic, he commits suicide as the tragic culmination of the damaging influence of his father&#x27;s pessimistic philosophy and his inability to cope with his sister&#x27;s sexual promiscuity. He is also a character in &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; The bridge over the Charles River, where he commits suicide in the novel, bears a plaque to commemorate the character&#x27;s life and death.
* Candace &quot;Caddy&quot; Compson – the second Compson child, strong-willed yet caring. Benjy&#x27;s only real caregiver and Quentin&#x27;s best friend. According to Faulkner, Caddy is the true hero of the novel. Caddy never develops a voice; rather, her brothers&#x27; emotions towards her provide the development of her character.
* Jason Compson IV – the bitter, openly racist third child who is troubled by monetary debt and sexual frustration. He works at a farming goods store owned by a man named Earl and becomes head of the household in 1912. Has been embezzling Miss Quentin&#x27;s support payments for years. To Faulkner, Jason represented &quot;complete evil&quot;.
* Benjamin (nicknamed Benjy, born Maury) Compson – the mentally-disabled fourth child, who is a constant source of shame and grief for his family, especially his mother, who insisted on his name change to Benjamin. Caddy is the only family member who shows any genuine love towards him. Luster, albeit begrudgingly, shows concern for him occasionally, but usually out of obligation. He has an almost animal-like &quot;sixth sense&quot; about people, as he was able to tell that Caddy had lost her virginity just from her smell. The model for Benjy&#x27;s character may have had its beginning in the 1925 New Orleans &quot;Times Picayune&quot; sketch by Faulkner entitled &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot;.
* Dilsey Gibson – the matriarch of the servant family, which includes her own three children — Versh, Frony, and T.P. — and her grandson Luster (Frony&#x27;s son); they serve as Benjamin&#x27;s caretakers throughout his life. An observer of the Compson family&#x27;s decline.
* Miss Quentin Compson – daughter of Caddy, whom the Compsons take in when Herbert divorces Caddy. She is wild and promiscuous and eventually runs away from home. Often referred to as &quot;Quentin II&quot; or &quot;Miss Quentin&quot; by readers to distinguish her from her uncle, for whom she was named.

== Style and structure ==

The novel&#x27;s episodes follow the three days of Easter. The four parts of the novel relate many of the same episodes, each from a different point of view and therefore with emphasis on different themes and events. This interweaving and nonlinear structure makes any true synopsis of the novel difficult, especially since the narrators are all unreliable in their own way, making their accounts not necessarily trustworthy at all times. Also in this novel, Faulkner uses italics to indicate points in each section where the narrative is moving into a significant moment in the past. The use of these italics can be confusing, however, as time shifts are not always marked by the use of italics, and periods of different time in each section do not necessarily stay in italics for the duration of the flashback. Thus, these time shifts can often be jarring and confusing, and require particularly close reading.

=== The Sound and The Fury ===

When Faulkner began writing the story that would develop into &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, it &quot;was tentatively titled ‘Twilight,’ [and] narrated by a fourth Compson child,&quot; but as the story progressed into a larger work, he renamed it, drawing its title from Macbeth&#x27;s famous soliloquy from act 5, scene 5 of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&gt;
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life&#x27;s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Immediately obvious is the notion of a &quot;tale told by an idiot,&quot; in this case Benjy, whose view of the Compsons&#x27; story opens the novel. The idea can be extended also to Quentin and Jason, whose narratives display their own varieties of idiocy. More to the point, the novel recounts &quot;the way to dusty death&quot; of a traditional upper-class Southern family. The last line is, perhaps, the most meaningful: Faulkner said in his Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech that people must write about things that come from the heart, &quot;universal truths.&quot; Otherwise, they signify nothing.

==Reception==
Upon publication the influential critic Clifton Fadiman dismissed the novel, arguing in &quot;The Nation&quot; that &quot;the theme and the characters are trivial, unworthy of the enormous and complex craftsmanship expended on them.&quot; But &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; ultimately went on to achieve a prominent place among the greatest of American novels, playing a role in William Faulkner&#x27;s receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature.

It is nearly unanimously considered a masterpiece by literary critics and scholars, but its unconventional narrative style frequently alienates new readers. Although the vocabulary is generally basic, the stream-of-consciousness technique, which attempts to transcribe the thoughts of the narrators directly, with frequent switches in time and setting and with loose sentence structure and grammar, has made it a quintessentially difficult modernist work.

==Literary significance==
&quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is a widely influential work of literature. Faulkner has been praised for his ability to recreate the thought process of the human mind. In addition, it is viewed as an essential development in the stream-of-consciousness literary technique. 

==Adaptations==
*A film adaptation was released in 1959 directed by Martin Ritt and starring Yul Brynner, Joanne Woodward, Margaret Leighton, Stuart Whitman, Ethel Waters, Jack Warden, and Albert Dekker. The movie bears little resemblance to the novel.
*Another adaptation, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (2014), was directed by James Franco and starred Franco as Benjy Compson, Jacob Loeb as Quentin Compson, Joey King as Miss Quentin, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Compson, Loretta Devine as Dilsey, Ahna O&#x27;Reilly as Caddy Compson, Scott Haze as Jason Compson, Kylen Davis as Luster, Seth Rogen as a Telegraph Operator, Danny McBride as a Sheriff, and Logan Marshall-Green as Dalton Ames. It made its premiere at the 71st Venice International Film Festival, where it screened out-of-competition.

==Limited edition==
In 2012, The Folio Society released an edition, limited to 1480 copies, of &quot;The Sound and the Fury. &quot;This edition is the first to use colored ink to represent different time sequences for the first section of the novel. This limited edition is also sold with a special commentary volume edited by Faulkner scholars Stephen Ross and Noel Polk. According to The Folio Society, &quot;We can never know if this [edition] is exactly what Faulkner would have envisaged, but the result justifies his belief that coloured inks would allow readers to follow the strands of the novel more easily, without compromising the ‘thought-transference’ for which he argued so passionately.&quot;

<text>A SIMM (single in-line memory module) is a type of memory module used in computers from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. It is a printed circuit board on which has random-access memory attached to one or both sides. It differs from a dual in-line memory module (DIMM), the most predominant form of memory module since the late 1990s, in that the contacts on a SIMM are redundant on both sides of the module. SIMMs were standardised under the JEDEC JESD-21C standard.

Most early PC motherboards (8088-based PCs, XTs, and early ATs) used socketed DIP chips for DRAM. As computer memory capacities grew, memory modules were used to save motherboard space and ease memory expansion. Instead of plugging in eight or nine single DIP chips, only one additional memory module was needed to increase the memory of the computer.

==History==
SIMMs were invented in 1983 by James E. Clayton at Wang Laboratories with subsequent patents granted in 1987.
 Wang Laboratories litigated both patents against multiple companies. The original memory modules were built upon ceramic substrates with 64K Hitachi &quot;flip chip&quot; parts and had pins, i.e. single in-line package (SIP) packaging. SIMMs using pins are usually called SIP or SIPP memory modules to distinguish them from the more common modules using edge connectors.

The first variant of SIMMs has 30 pins and provides 8 bits of data (plus a 9th error-detection bit in parity SIMMs). They were used in AT-compatible (286-based, e.g., Wang APC), 386-based, 486-based, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh II, Quadra, Atari STE microcomputers, Wang VS minicomputers and Roland electronic samplers.

The second variant of SIMMs has 72 pins and provides 32 bits of data (36 bits in parity and ECC versions). These appeared first in the early 1990s in later models of the IBM PS/2, and later in systems based on the 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, early Pentium II, and contemporary/competing chips of other brands. By the mid-90s, 72-pin SIMMs had replaced 30-pin SIMMs in new-build computers, and were starting to themselves be replaced by DIMMs.

Non-IBM PC computers such as UNIX workstations may use proprietary non-standard SIMMs. The Macintosh IIfx uses proprietary non-standard SIMMs with 64 pins.

DRAM technologies used in SIMMs include FPM (Fast Page Mode memory, used in all 30-pin and early 72-pin modules), and the higher-performance EDO DRAM (used in later 72-pin modules).

Due to the differing data bus widths of the memory modules and some processors, sometimes several modules must be installed in identical pairs or in identical groups of four to fill a memory bank. The rule of thumb is a &quot;286&quot;, &quot;386SX&quot;, 68000 or low-end 68020 / 68030 (e.g. Atari Falcon, Mac LC) system (using a 16 bit wide data bus) would require two 30-pin SIMMs for a memory bank. On &quot;386DX&quot;, &quot;486&quot;, and full-spec 68020 through 68060 (e.g. Atari TT, Amiga 4000, Mac II) systems (32 bit data bus), either four 30-pin SIMMs or one 72-pin SIMM are required for one memory bank. On Pentium systems (data bus width of 64 bits), two 72-pin SIMMs are required. However, some Pentium systems have support for a &quot;half bank mode&quot;, in which the data bus would be shortened to only 32 bits to allow operation of a single SIMM. Conversely, some 386 and 486 systems use what is known as &quot;memory interleaving&quot;, which requires twice as many SIMMs and effectively doubles the bandwidth.

The earliest SIMM sockets were conventional push-type sockets. These were soon replaced by ZIF sockets in which the SIMM was inserted at an angle, then tilted into an upright position. To remove one, the two metal or plastic clips at each end must be pulled to the side, then the SIMM must be tilted back and pulled out (low-profile sockets reversed this convention somewhat, like SODIMMs - the modules are inserted at a &quot;high&quot; angle, then pushed &quot;down&quot; to become more flush with the motherboard). The earlier sockets used plastic retainer clips which were found to break, so steel clips replaced them.

Some SIMMs support presence detect (PD). Connections are made to some of the pins that encode the capacity and speed of the SIMM, so that compatible equipment can detect the properties of the SIMM. PD SIMMs can be used in equipment which does not support PD; the information is ignored. Standard SIMMs can easily be converted to support PD by fitting jumpers, if the SIMMs have solder pads to do so, or by soldering wires on.

==30-pin SIMMs==
Standard sizes: 256 KB, 1 MB, 4 MB, 16 MB.

30-pin SIMMs have 12 address lines, which can provide a total of 24 address bits. With an 8-bit data width, this leads to an absolute maximum capacity of 16 MB for both parity and non-parity modules (the additional redundancy-bit chip usually does not contribute to the usable capacity).

* Pins 26, 28 and 29 are not connected on non-parity SIMMs.

==72-pin SIMMs==

Standard sizes: 1 MB, 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB (the standard also defines 3.3 V modules with additional address lines and up to 2 GB)

With 12 address lines, which can provide a total of 24 address bits, two ranks of chips, and 32-bit data output, the absolute maximum capacity is 227 = 128 MB.

* Pins 35, 36, 37 and 38 are not connected on non-parity SIMMs.
† /RAS1 and /RAS3 are only used on two-rank SIMMS: 2, 8, 32, and 128 MB.
# These lines are only defined on 3.3 V modules.
x Presence-detect signals are detailed in JEDEC standard.

==Proprietary SIMMs==

===GVP 64-pin===
Several CPU cards from Great Valley Products for the Commodore Amiga used special 64-pin SIMMs (32 bits wide, 1, 4 or 16 MB, 60 ns).

===Apple 64-pin===
Dual-ported 64-pin SIMMs were used in Apple Macintosh IIfx computers to allow overlapping read/write cycles (1, 4, 8, 16 MB, 80 ns).

===HP LaserJet===
72-pin SIMMs with non-standard presence detect (PD) connections.

<doc id="229603" wikidata="Q549497" url="?curid=229603" title="Background process">
<text>A background process is a computer process that runs &quot;behind the scenes&quot; (i.e., in the background) and without user intervention. Typical tasks for these processes include logging, system monitoring, scheduling, and user notification.

On a Windows system, a background process is either a computer program that does not create a user interface, or a Windows service. The former are started just as any other program is started, e.g., via Start menu. Windows services, on the other hand, are started by Service Control Manager. In Windows Vista and later, they are run in a separate session.

On a Unix or Unix-like system, a background process or job can be further identified as one whose process group ID differs from its terminal group ID (TGID). (The TGID of a process is the process ID of the process group leader that opened the terminal, which is typically the login shell. The TGID identifies the control terminal of the process group.) This type of process is unable to receive keyboard signals from its parent terminal, and typically will not send output to that terminal. This more technical definition does not distinguish between whether or not the process can receive user intervention. Although background processes are typically used for purposes needing few resources, any process can be run in the background, and such a process will behave like any other process, with the exceptions given above.

==Windows services==

In Windows NT family of operating systems, a Windows service is a dedicated background process. A Windows service must conform to the interface rules and protocols of the Service Control Manager, the component responsible for managing Windows services.

Windows services can be configured to start when the operating system starts, and to run in the background as long as Windows runs. Alternatively, they can be started manually or by an event. Windows NT operating systems include numerous services which run in context of three user accounts: codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3. These Windows components are often associated with Host Process for Windows Services: svchost.exe. Since Windows services operate in the context of their own dedicated user accounts, they can operate when a user is not logged on.

Before Windows Vista, services installed as &quot;interactive services&quot; could interact with Windows desktop and show a graphical user interface. With Windows Vista, however, interactive services became deprecated and ceased operating properly, as a result of Windows Service Hardening.

The three principal means of managing Windows services are:
# Services snap-in for Microsoft Management Console
# codice_4
# Windows PowerShell

==Daemon==

A daemon is a type of background process designed to run continually in the background, waiting for event(s) to occur or condition(s) to be met. When launched with the &quot;daemon&quot; function, daemons are disassociated from their parent terminal.

==Background jobs in Unix==

From a Unix command line, a background process can be launched using the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator. The &quot;bg&quot; command can resume a suspended job (sending SIGCONT), running it in the background. Using the &quot;fg&quot; command will also reconnect standard input its parent terminal, bringing it into the foreground. The &quot;jobs&quot; command will list all processes associated with the current terminal and can be used to bring background processes into the foreground.

When a login session ends, via explicit logout or network disconnection, all processes, including background processes, will by default be terminated, to prevent them from becoming orphan processes. Concretely, when the user exits the launching shell process, as part of shutdown it sends a &quot;hangup&quot; signal (SIGHUP) to all its jobs, to terminate all the processes in the corresponding process group. To have processes continue to run, one can either not end the session, or end the session without terminating the processes. A terminal multiplexer can be used to leave a session running but detach a virtual terminal from it, leaving processes running as child processes of the session; the user can then reattach session later. Or, termination can be prevented by either starting the process via the nohup command (telling the process to ignore SIGHUP), or by subsequently running codice_5 with the job id, which either removes the job from the job list entirely, or simply prevents SIGHUP from being sent. In the latter case when the session ends, the child processes are not terminated, either because they are not sent SIGHUP or because they ignore it, and thus become orphan processes, which are then adopted by the init process (the kernel sets the init process as their parent), and they continue running without a session, now called &quot;daemons&quot;.

==Smartphones==
Many newer versions of smartphone and PDA operating systems now include the ability to start background processes. Due to hardware limits, background processes on mobile operating systems are often restricted to certain tasks or consumption levels. On Android, CPU use for background processes may be bounded at 5–10%. Applications on Apple&#x27;s iOS are limited to a subset of functions while running in the background. On both iOS and Android, background processes can be killed by the system if they are using too much memory.

<text>The Yaqui, Hiaki, or Yoeme, are an Indigenous people of Mexico and Native American tribe, who speak the Yaqui language, a Uto-Aztecan language. 

Their primary homelands are in Río Yaqui valley in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. Today, there are eight Yaqui Pueblos in Sonora. 

Some Yaqui fled state violence to settle in Arizona. They formed the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, based in Tucson, Arizona, which is the only federally recognized Yaqui tribe in the United States. 

Many Yaqui in Mexico live on reserved land in the state of Sonora. Others live in Sinaloa and other regions, forming neighborhoods in various cities. Individual Yaqui and people of Yaqui descent live elsewhere in Mexico and the United States.

==Language==

The Yaqui language, or Yoem Noki, belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family. Yaqui speak a Cahitan language, a group of about 10 mutually intelligible languages formerly spoken in much of the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. Most of the Cahitan languages are extinct; only the Yaqui and Mayo still speak their language. About 16,000 people speak Yaqui, primarily in Sonora, Sinaloa, and Arizona. Approximately 15,000 Yaqui speakers live in Mexico and 1,000 in the US, mostly in Arizona.

Yaqui is a tonal language, with a tonal accent on either the first or the second syllable of the word. The syllables that follow the tone are all high. This is known as a pitch-accent language.

== Name ==
The Yaqui call themselves &quot;Hiaki&quot; or &quot;Yoeme&quot;, the Yaqui word for person (&#x27; or &#x27; meaning &quot;people&quot;). The Yaqui call their homeland &quot;Hiakim&quot;, from which some say the name &quot;Yaqui&quot; is derived. 

Spanish Jesuit missionary Andrés Pérez de Ribas (1576–1655) first wrote &quot;Yaqui&quot; and &quot;Hiaqui&quot;, later spelled &quot;Hiaki&quot;. Another early 17th-century Jesuit first recorded the term &quot;Cahita&quot;, which refers to the Hiaki, Mayo, and Tehueco. Mid-19th-century Mexican scholars used &quot;Yaqui&quot; and &quot;Hiaqui&quot; interchangeably and broadened the term &quot;Cahita&quot; to refer to more regional peoples.

==History==
===1530s–1820s: Conquistadors and missionaries===
When the Spanish first came into contact with the Yaqui in 1533, the Yaqui occupied a territory along the lower course of the Yaqui River. They were estimated to number 30,000 people living in 80 villages in an area about 60 miles (100 km) long and 15 miles (25 km) wide. Some Yaqui lived near the mouth of the river and lived off of the resources of the sea. Most lived in agricultural communities, growing beans, maize, and squash on land inundated by the river every year. Others lived in the deserts and mountains and depended upon hunting and gathering.

Captain Diego de Guzmán, leader of an expedition to explore lands north of the Spanish settlements, encountered the Yaqui in 1533. A large number of Yaqui warriors confronted the Spaniards on a level plain. Their leader, an old man, drew a line in the dirt and told the Spanish not to cross it. He denied the Spanish request for food. A battle ensued. The Spanish claimed victory, although they retreated. Thus began 40 years of struggle, often armed, by the Yaqui to protect their culture and lands.

In 1565, Francisco de Ibarra attempted, but failed, to establish a Spanish settlement in Yaqui territory. What probably saved the Yaqui from an early invasion by the Spaniards was the lack of silver and other precious metals in their territory. In 1608, the Yaqui and 2,000 indigenous allies, mostly Mayo, were victorious over the Spanish in two battles. A peace agreement in 1610 brought gifts from the Spanish and, in 1617, an invitation by the Yaquis for the Jesuit missionaries to stay and teach them.

The Yaqui lived in a mutually advantageous relationship with the Jesuits for 120 years. Most of them converted to Christianity while retaining many traditional beliefs. The Jesuit rule over the Yaqui was stern but the Yaqui retained their land and their unity as a people. The Jesuits introduced the Yaqui to wheat, cattle, and horses.

The Yaqui prospered and the missionaries were allowed to extend their activities further north. The Jesuit success was facilitated by the fact that the nearest Spanish settlement was 100 miles away and the Yaqui were able to avoid interaction with Spanish settlers, soldiers and miners. Important, too, was that epidemics of European diseases that destroyed many Indigenous populations appear not to have seriously impacted the Yaqui. The reputation of the Yaqui as warriors, plus the protection afforded by the Jesuits, perhaps shielded the Yaqui from Spanish slavers. The Jesuits persuaded the Yaqui to settle into eight towns: Bácum, Benem, Cócorit, , , Rahum, Tórim, and Vícam.

However, by the 1730s, Spanish settlers and miners were encroaching on Yaqui land and the Spanish colonial government began to alter the arms-length relationship. This created unrest among the Yaqui and led to a brief but bloody Yaqui and Mayo revolt in 1740. One thousand Spanish and 5,000 Native Americans were killed and the animosity lingered. The missions declined and the prosperity of the earlier years was never regained. The Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767 and the Franciscan priests who replaced them never gained the confidence of the Yaqui.

An uneasy peace between the Spaniards and the Yaqui endured for many years after the revolt, with the Yaqui maintaining their tight-knit organization and most of their independence from Spanish and, after 1821, Mexican rule.

===1820s–1920s: Yaqui Wars and enslavement===
During Mexico&#x27;s struggle for independence from Spain in the early 19th century, the Yaqui showed that they still considered themselves independent and self-governing. After Mexico won its independence, the Yaqui refused to pay taxes to the new government. A Yaqui revolt in 1825 was led by Juan Banderas. Banderas wished to unite the Mayo, Opata, Pima, and Yaqui into a state that would be autonomous, or independent of Mexico. The combined indigenous forces drove the Mexicans out of their territories, but Banderas was eventually defeated and executed in 1833. This led to a succession of revolts as the Yaqui resisted the Mexican government&#x27;s attempts to gain control of the Yaqui and their lands.

The Yaqui supported the French during the brief reign of Maximilian I of Mexico in the 1860s. Under the leadership of Jose Maria Leyva, known as Cajemé, the Yaqui continued the struggle to maintain their independence until 1887, when Cajeme was caught and executed. The war featured a succession of brutalities by the Mexican authorities, including a massacre in 1868, in which the Army burned 150 Yaqui to death inside a church.

The Yaqui were impoverished by a new series of wars as the Mexican government adopted a policy of confiscation and distribution of Yaqui lands. Some displaced Yaquis joined the ranks of warrior bands, who remained in the mountains carrying on a guerrilla campaign against the Mexican Army.

During the 34-year rule of Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz, the government repeatedly provoked the Yaqui remaining in Sonora to rebellion in order to seize their land for exploitation by investors for both mining and agricultural use. Many Yaqui were sold at 60 pesos a head to the owners of sugar cane plantations in Oaxaca and the tobacco planters of the Valle Nacional, while thousands more were sold to the henequen plantation owners of the Yucatán.

By 1908, at least 5,000 Yaqui had been sold into slavery. At Valle Nacional, the enslaved Yaquis were worked until they died. While there were occasional escapes, the escapees were far from home and, without support or assistance, most died of hunger while begging for food on the road out of the valley toward Córdoba.

At Guaymas, thousands more Yaquis were put on boats and shipped to San Blas, where they were forced to walk more than 200 miles to San Marcos and its train station. Many women and children could not withstand the three-week journey over the mountains, and their bodies were left by the side of the road. The Mexican government established large concentration camps at San Marcos, where the remaining Yaqui families were broken up and segregated. Individuals were then sold into slavery inside the station and packed into train cars which took them to Veracruz, where they were embarked yet again for the port town of Progreso in the Yucatán. There they were transported to their final destination, the nearby henequen plantations.

On the plantations, the Yaquis were forced to work in the tropical climate of the area from dawn to dusk. Yaqui women were allowed to marry only non-native Chinese workers. Given little food, the workers were beaten if they failed to cut and trim at least 2,000 henequen leaves per day, after which they were then locked up every night. Most of the Yaqui men, women, and children sent for slave labor on the plantations died there, with two-thirds of the arrivals dying within a year.

During this time, Yaqui resistance continued. By the early 1900s, after &quot;extermination, military occupation, and colonization&quot; had failed to halt Yaqui resistance to Mexican rule, many Yaquis assumed the identities of other Tribes and merged with the Mexican population of Sonora in cities and on haciendas. Others left Mexico for the United States, establishing enclaves in southern Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

Many Yaqui living in southern Arizona regularly returned to Sonora after working and earning money in the U.S., often for the purpose of smuggling firearms and ammunition to those Yaqui still fighting the Mexican government. Skirmishes continued until 1927, when the last major battle between the Mexican Army and the Yaqui was fought at Cerro del Gallo Mountain. By employing heavy artillery, machine guns, and planes of the Mexican Air Force to shell, bomb, and strafe Yaqui villages, Mexican authorities eventually prevailed.

The objective of the Yaqui and their frequent allies, the Mayo people, remained the same during almost 400 years of interaction with the Jesuits and the Spanish and Mexican governments: independent local government and management of their own lands.

===1920s–1930s: Cárdenas and Yaqui independence===
In 1917, General Lázaro Cárdenas of the Constitutionalist army defeated the Yaqui. But in 1937, as president of the republic, he reserved 500,000 hectares of ancestral lands on the north bank of the Yaqui River, ordered the construction of a dam to provide irrigation water to the Yaqui, and provided advanced agricultural equipment and water pumps. Thus, the Yaqui continued to maintain a degree of independence from Mexican rule.

On 9 January 1918, the U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment was involved in a firefight with Yaqui Indians just west of Nogales, Arizona aka Battle of Bear Valley. E Troop intercepted a group of American Yaquis on their way to render aid to Mexican Yaquis of Sonora, who were in the midst of long running war with the Mexicans. Yaquis had 1 killed and 9 POWs. The Americans claimed victory; however it was a successful Yaqui delaying action.

In 1939, the Yaqui produced 3,500 tons of wheat, 500 tons of maize, and 750 tons of beans; whereas, in 1935, they had produced only 250 tons of wheat and no maize or beans.

According to the official government report on the &quot;sexenio&quot; (six-year term) of Cárdenas, the section of the Department of Indigenous Affairs (which Cárdenas established as a cabinet-level post in 1936) stated the Yaqui population was 10,000; 3,000 were children younger than 5.

Today, the Mexican municipality of Cajeme is named after the fallen Yaqui leader.

==Lifestyle==

In the past, the Yaqui subsisted on agriculture, growing beans, corn and squash (like many of the Indigenous peoples of the region). The Yaqui who lived in the Río Yaqui region and in coastal areas of Sonora and Sinaloa fished as well as farmed. The Yaqui also made cotton products. The Yaqui have always been skillful warriors. The Yaqui Indians have been historically described as quite tall in stature. Yaqui men have an average height of 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) and Yaqui women have an average height of 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m). 

Traditionally, a Yaqui house consisted of three rectangular sections: the bedroom, the kitchen, and a living room, called the &quot;portal&quot;. Floors would be made of wooden supports, walls of woven reeds, and the roof of reeds coated with thick layers of mud for insulation. Branches might be used in living room construction for air circulation; a large part of the day was spent here, especially during the hot months. A home would also have a patio. Since the time of the adoption of Christianity, many Yaquis have a wooden cross placed in front of the house, and special attention is made to its placement and condition during &quot;Waresma&quot; (Lent).

==Yaqui cosmology and religion==
The Yaqui conception of the world is considerably different from that of their European-Mexican and European-American neighbors. For example, many Yoeme believe that the universe is composed of overlapping yet distinct worlds or places, called &quot;aniam&quot;. Nine or more different &quot;aniam&quot; are recognized:
# &quot;sea ania&quot;: flower world, 
# &quot;yo ania&quot;: enchanted world,
# &quot;tenku ania&quot;: a dream world,
# &quot;tuka ania&quot;: night world,
# &quot;huya ania&quot;: wilderness world,
# &quot;nao ania&quot;: corncob world,
# &quot;kawi ania&quot;: mountain world,
# &quot;&quot;: world under the water,
# &quot;teeka ania&quot;: world from the sky up through the universe.

Each of these worlds has its own distinct qualities, as well as forces, and Yoeme relate deer dancing with three of them, since the deer emerges from &quot;yo ania&quot;, an enchanted home, into the wilderness world, &quot;huya ania&quot;, and dances in the flower world, &quot;sea ania&quot;, which can be accessed through the deer dance. Much Yaqui ritual is centered upon perfecting these worlds and eliminating the harm that has been done to them, especially by people. Many Yaqui have combined such ideas with their practice of Catholicism, and believe that the existence of the world depends on their annual performance of the Lenten and Easter rituals.

The Yaqui Religion (1500–present), which is a syncretic religion of old Yaqui beliefs and practices and the Christian teachings of Jesuit missionaries, is considered the earliest revitalisation reform movement within Native American religions. It relies upon song, music, prayer, and dancing, all performed by designated members of the community. They have woven numerous Roman Catholic traditions into the old ways and vice versa. For instance, the Yaqui deer song (&quot;maso bwikam&quot;) accompanies the deer dance, which is performed by a &quot;pascola&quot; (Easter, from the Spanish &quot;pascua&quot;) dancer, also known as a &quot;deer dancer.&quot; Pascolas perform at religio-social functions many times of the year, but especially during Lent and Easter. The Yaqui deer song ritual is in many ways similar to the deer song rituals of neighboring Uto-Aztecan people, such as the Mayo. The Yaqui deer song is more central to the &quot;cultus&quot; of its people and is strongly tied to Roman Catholic beliefs and practices. There are various societies among the Yaqui people who play a significant role in the performance of Yaqui ceremonies, including:
* the prayer leaders,
* &quot;Kiyohteis&quot;, female church assistants,
* &quot;Vanteareaom&quot;, female flag bearers,
* &quot;Anheiltom&quot;, angels, 
* &quot;Kohtumvre Ya’ura&quot;, fariseo society,
* &quot;Kantoras&quot;, female singers,
* &quot;Officios&quot;, &quot;Pahko’ola&quot; and deer dance societies,
* &quot;Wiko Yau’ra&quot;, society, and
* &quot;Matachinim&quot;, matachin society dancers).

Flowers are very important in the Yaqui culture. According to Yaqui teachings, flowers sprang up from the drops of blood that were shed at the crucifixion. Flowers are viewed as the manifestation of souls. Occasionally Yaqui men may greet a close male friend with the phrase &quot;Haisa sewa?&quot; (&quot;How is the flower?&quot;).

==Pascua Yaqui Tribe==
As a result of the wars between Mexico and the Yaqui, many fled to the United States. Most settled in urban barrios, including Barrio Libre and Pascua in Tucson, and Guadalupe and Scottsdale in the Phoenix area. Yaquis built homes of scrap lumber, railroad ties, and other materials, eking out an existence while taking great pains to continue the Easter Lenten ceremonies so important to community life. They found work as migrant farm laborers and in other rural occupations.

In Guadalupe, Arizona, established in 1904 and incorporated in 1975, more than 44 percent of the population is Native American, and many are trilingual in Yaqui, English, and Spanish. A Yaqui neighborhood, Penjamo, is located in South Scottsdale, Arizona.

In the early 1960s, Yaqui spiritual leader Anselmo Valencia Tori approached University of Arizona anthropologist Edward Holland Spicer, an authority on the Yaqui, and asked for assistance in helping the Yaqui people. Spicer, Muriel Thayer Painter, and others created the Pascua Yaqui Association. U.S. Representative Morris Udall agreed to aid the Yaquis in securing a land base. In 1964, the U.S. government granted the Yaqui 817,000 m of land southwest of Tucson, Arizona. It was held in trust for the people. Under Valencia and Raymond Ybarra, the Pascua Yaqui Association developed homes and other infrastructure at the site.

In the late 1960s, several Yaqui in Arizona, among them Anselmo Valencia Tori and Fernando Escalante, started developing of a tract of land about 8 km to the west of the Yaqui community of Hu&#x27;upa, calling it New Pascua (in Spanish, &quot;Pascua Nuevo&quot;). This community has a population (estimated in 2006) of about 4,000; most of the middle-aged population of New Pascua speaks English, Spanish, and a moderate amount of Yaqui. Many older people speak the Yaqui language fluently, and a growing number of youth are learning the Yaqui language in addition to English and Spanish.

Realizing the difficulties of developing the community New Pascua without the benefit of federal Tribal status, Ybarra and Valencia met with U.S. Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) in the early months of 1977 to urge him to introduce legislation to provide complete federal recognition of the Yaqui people living on the land conveyed to the Pascua Yaqui Association by the United States through the Act of October 8, 1964 (78 Stat. 1197).
Senator DeConcini introduced a federal recognition bill, S.1633 on June 7, 1977. After extensive hearings and consideration, it was passed by the Senate on April 5, 1978, and became public law, PL 95-375, on September 18, 1978. The law established a government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, and gave reservation status to Pascua Yaqui lands. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe was the last Tribe recognized prior to the BIA Federal Acknowledgement Process established in 1978.

In 2008, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe counted 11,324 voting members.

== Unrecognized organizations in the United States ==
Many self-identified Yaqui descendants live throughout the Southwestern United States. There are also multiple unrecognized organizations that identify as Yaqui tribes. These include the Yaqui Nation of Southern California in Thousand Palms, California, and the Yaquis of Southern California in Borrego Springs, California, and the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians, based in Lubbock, Texas. They are neither federally or state-recognized tribes. In 2015, the State of Texas passed SR 989, a congratulatory resolution honoring the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians.

== Notable Yaqui == 
* Cajemé (1835–1887), Yaqui military leader from Pesiou, Sonora
* Loretta Lucero Alvarez (1892–1996), a Pascua Yaqui midwife from the 1920s until the 1970s in Tucson, Arizona
* Mario Martinez (Pascua Yaqui), painter living in New York
* Marcos A. Moreno (Pascua Yaqui), public health advocate, medical research scholar and the first Pascua Yaqui citizen to graduate from an Ivy League University. Recipient of the national Morris K. and Stewart L. Udall Foundation award for research in medicine and public health work with under-served communities.
* Anselmo Valencia Tori (Pascua Yaqui), spiritual leader and tribal elder. Led the Tribe through its fight to gain federal recognition from Congress in 1978.

<text>Stanisław Szukalski (13 December 1893 – 19 May 1987) was a Polish sculptor and painter who became a part of the Chicago Renaissance. Szukalski&#x27;s art appears to show influences from ancient cultures, Egypt, Slavs, and Aztecs combined with elements of art nouveau and other currents of early 20th century European modernism - cubism, expressionism, futurism. During the 1920s, he was hailed as Poland&#x27;s &quot;greatest living artist&quot;. His art was dubbed &quot;Bent Classicism&quot;.

He developed a pseudoscientific-historical theory of Zermatism, positing that all human culture was derived from post-deluge Easter Island and that humankind was locked in an eternal struggle with the Sons of Yeti (&quot;Yetinsyny&quot;), the offspring of Yeti and humans.

==Life==
===Between Poland and Chicago===

Szukalski was born in Warta, Congress Poland and was raised in Gidle. He arrived at New York with his mother, Konstancja, and sister, Alfreda, on June 27, 1907; they then went to Chicago to join his father, Dyonizy Szukalski, a blacksmith. A child prodigy in sculpture, he enrolled at age 13 at the Art Institute of Chicago. A year later, Sculptor Antoni Popiel persuaded Szukalski&#x27;s parents to send him back to Poland, to enroll at Kraków&#x27;s Academy of Fine Arts in 1910. There he studied sculpture under Konstanty Laszczka for three years. He returned to Chicago in 1913.

Back in the U.S., Szukalski joined the arts scene in Chicago, becoming a vital part of the &quot;Chicago Renaissance.&quot; In November 1914, he exhibited seven of his sculptures at the Annual Exhibition of American Oil Paintings and Sculpture in the Art Institute&#x27;s galleries. He had two solo exhibitions at the Art Institute, in 1916 and 1917, as well as one at the progressive Arts Club in 1919; he also exhibited regularly in the juried annuals at the Art Institute. In 1922, he married Helen Walker, the artist daughter of Dr. Samuel J. Walker, a prominent member of Chicago society.

===Mickiewicz monument in Vilnius===

The first design proposed for a monument of Adam Mickiewicz (a Polish poet, dramatist and political activist) to be built in the city of Vilnius, was promoted by Zbigniew Pronaszko of Vilnius University (then, Stefan Batory University in the Second Polish Republic). However, in May 1925, a contest was declared for the design of the monument. The period for submitting designs was extended a number of times, with 67 designs ultimately submitted. The jury consisted of Vilnius&#x27;s municipal authorities and representatives of the arts scene, with General Lucjan Żeligowski at the helm.

Szukalski won first prize in the contest. His design for the monument showed Mickiewicz, naked, lying upon a sacrificial altar. The sculpture was to be situated on a large pedestal in the shape of an Aztec pyramid. A White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s national symbol, was perched at the figure&#x27;s side, where it symbolically drank blood from the poet&#x27;s wound.

Szukalski&#x27;s design was highly divisive among Poland&#x27;s intelligentsia, leadership, and art critics, as well as ordinary individuals. The polarized atmosphere led the monument committee to arrange for a new contest, this time limited to concepts by artists who were invited to participate. The winner was Henryk Kuna, whose proposal was then chosen to be built. However, due to a number of problems involving financing as well as a suitable location, the monument&#x27;s construction dragged on. With the outbreak of World War II and the incorporation of Vilnius into Lithuania, the project was abandoned.

=== European travels ===
In 1925, Szukalski participated in the International Exhibition of Modern and Decorative Arts in Paris, where he won numerous awards. However, his success was criticized by the Polish press because Szukalski, representing Poland in the exhibition, did not even live in that country. On June 20, 1926, in Paris, Helen Walker Szukalski gave birth to Szukalski&#x27;s only child, a daughter, Elżbieta Kalina (Kalinka) Szukalski.

After traveling in Europe from 1926 to 1928, Szukalski went to Kraków, Poland, where he had a retrospective exhibition in 1929. In 1929 he was a founder of an artistic movement called Tribe of the Horned Heart (Szczep Rogate Serce), centered on Polish artists who sought inspiration in the pagan or pre-Christian history of Poland.

In 1929, Szukalski published &quot;Projects in Design: Sculpture and Architecture&quot;, containing drawings that ranged from highly detailed ornamental architectural elements (fireplaces, doorways, and windows) to idealized city plans (bridges, tombstones, and monuments) befitting the heroes of Poland. In 1932, he and Helen divorced.

Ben Hecht, who had met Szukalski in 1914, described Szukalski in his 1954 autobiography, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, &quot;For twenty years my friend ... experienced disasters which would have killed off a dozen businessmen. Sickness, poverty and hunger nipped everlasting at his heels. ... during his struggles he heard only the catcalls of critics and the voices of derision. Yet when I saw him in 1934, I saw a man who had feasted on power and whose eyes smiled with triumph.&quot;

In September 1934, in Hollywood, Szukalski married Joan Lee Donovan (b. 1910), who had been his daughter&#x27;s kindergarten teacher in Chicago. The wedding was at the home of screenwriter Wallace Smith, who was the best man.

===Return to Poland ===
In 1936, Szukalski returned to Poland, supported financially by the Minister of the Treasury. He completed several sculptures, most notably the monument of Bolesław Chrobry, and decorated the façade of the Silesian Museum in Katowice, as well as a local government building in that city. Poland declared Szukalski the country&#x27;s greatest living artist. The government gave him a studio, the largest in Warsaw, and proclaimed it the Szukalski National Museum. It contained many of his intricate paintings and massive sculptures, notable for their dramatic mythological imagery; Szukalski had brought much of his lifetime work with him to Poland.

During the siege of Warsaw by the German army in September 1939, Szukalski was hurt in the initial bombing attack on Warsaw, which destroyed much of his studio. With two suitcases, Szukalski and his wife took refuge in the US embassy, since both were American citizens. By early November, they were among about 100 Americans remaining in Warsaw. The two eventually escaped from Poland and were able to make their way back to the United States.

Szukalski had come to Poland with all his unsold works, encouraged by the prospect of building a museum devoted to his art; he left almost all of his work in Poland. Most of what had not been lost in the bombing attacks was destroyed by the occupying Germans.

=== California ===
In 1940, Szukalski and his wife settled in Los Angeles where he did odd jobs in film studios, designing scenery; occasionally sculpting and drawing. 

During the last years of his 75-year-long career, Szukalski&#x27;s major projects in sculpture were &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1943), designed for Paris in homage to French partisans, the &quot;Rooster of Gaul&quot; (1960), a gigantic and complex structure that he wanted the U.S. to give France to reciprocate for the Statue of Liberty. His &quot;Katyn&quot; (1979) is a monument to commemorate the death of more than 20,000 Polish officers and intellectuals killed by the Soviets during World War II; and a monument intended for the city of Venice (1982), featuring the Polish pope John Paul II. None of these projects went much further than Szukalski&#x27;s immediate friends.

In 1971, Glenn Bray, a publisher who had previously specialized in the work of &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; artist Basil Wolverton, befriended Szukalski, and introduced many of his friends to Szukalski. Bray published a book of Szukalski&#x27;s art and philosophy, &quot;A Trough Full of Pearls / Behold! The Protong&quot;, in 1980, and a second volume of his art, &quot;Inner Portraits,&quot; in 1982. Those books led others, including George DiCaprio, Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s father, to contact Szukalski; Di Caprio immediately became a close friend of Szukalski and his wife.

Szukalski&#x27;s second wife, Joan, died in 1980. Following Szukalski&#x27;s death in 1987, a group of his admirers spread his ashes on Easter Island, in the rock quarry of Rano Raraku.

==Zermatism and Protong==
Beginning in 1940, Szukalski devoted most of his time to examining the mysteries of prehistoric ancient history of mankind, the formation and shaping of languages, faiths, customs, arts, and migration of peoples. He tried to unravel the origin of geographical names, gods, and symbols that have survived in various forms in various cultures. Through his research in these subjects, Szukalski claimed to have discovered Polish origins for various ancient places and people, in a language called Protong. According to Szukalski, Protong could be seen in phenomena ranging from the apparent Polish origins of Babylon to Jesus&#x27;s Polish identity. The culmination of this work was a massive book called &quot;Protong&quot; (in Polish, &quot;Macimowa&quot;), its writing continued uninterruptedly for over 40 years. He wrote a manuscript of 42 volumes, totaling more than 25,000 pages, and including 14,000 illustrations. The volumes covered a variety of issues; his pen drawings of artifacts, which he considered &quot;witnesses&quot;, were done to confirm his theories.

Zermatism, Szukalski&#x27;s concept of world history, postulated that all human culture derived from post-deluge Easter Islanders who settled in Zermatt (hence the name) and that in all human languages one could find traces of the original, ancient mother-tongue of mankind (one with archaic Polish origins). In his view, humanity was locked in an eternal struggle with the Sons of Yeti (&quot;Yetinsyny&quot;), the offspring of Yeti and humans, who had enslaved humanity from time immemorial. He claimed that the figures of the god Pan on Greek vases depict creatures that actually existed, the product of Yeti apes raping human women. Szukalski used his considerable artistic talents to illustrate his theories, which, despite their lack of scientific merit, have gained a cult following largely on their aesthetic value.

==Artistic legacy==
Bray and his wife Lena Zwalve maintain Szukalski&#x27;s estate and the great bulk of his existing art under the name &quot;Archives Szukalski.&quot; In 1990, they published &quot;The Lost Tune: Early Works (1913-1930)&quot;, a collection of photographs taken by Szukalski of his own work in that period.

Among Szukalski&#x27;s admirers are Leonardo DiCaprio, who sponsored a retrospective exhibition entitled &quot;Struggle&quot; at the Laguna Art Museum in 2000; the Church of the SubGenius, which incorporates the Yetinsyny elements of Zermatism; Rick Griffin, Richard Sharpe Shaver, Robert Williams, H. R. Giger the band Tool and Ernst Fuchs, who said &quot;Szukalski was the Michelangelo of the 20th century. And probably also of an age to come.&quot;

Szukalski&#x27;s works are on permanent display at the Polish Museum of America in Chicago. None of his work in Warsaw survived the destruction during WWII. In addition to the Laguna retrospective, notable exhibitions of his work include &quot;The Self-Born&quot; at Varnish Fine Art, San Francisco, in 2005, and &quot;Mantong and Protong,&quot; where Szukalski is paired with another unorthodox theorist of earth history, Richard Sharpe Shaver, at Pasadena City College in 2009.

In 2018, Leonardo DiCaprio produced a documentary entitled &quot;&quot;, which was released on Netflix as of December 21, 2018.

<text>La Belle Alliance () is an inn situated a few miles south of Brussels in Belgium, chiefly remembered for its significance in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815).

There are two plaques on the building: one is &quot;In memory of the French Medical Corps who attended the wounded with devotion on 18 June 1815&quot;; and the other commemorates the meeting of the two victorious field marshals at the end of the Battle of Waterloo.

== Contemporary use ==
The building is currently used on Friday and Saturday evenings as a night club.

==Battle of Waterloo==

After the Battle of Waterloo, at around 21:00, Prince Blücher and the Duke of Wellington met close to the inn signifying the end of the fighting. There is a large mural within the Palace of Westminster painted by Daniel Maclise in 1861 that depicts the meeting taking place at La Belle Alliance.
According to page 57 of his 1877 Book &quot;Notes and Reminiscences of a Staff Officer&quot; by Lieutenant Colonel Basil Jackson, writes: Certainly it was a moment when even the Iron Duke might feel excited. I heard him say to Colborne (who had stopped the 52nd and was forming his troops for the Duke to review), as he shook hands on departing, that he would endeavour to send some flour for his men. He then turned his horse towards Waterloo, followed by five persons only.
On nearing the farm of La Belle Alliance, a group of horsemen were seen crossing the fields on our right; on seeing them, the Duke left the road to meet them. They proved to be Marshal Blücher and his suite. The two great chiefs cordially shook hands, and were together about ten minutes; it was then so dark that I could not distinguish Blucher&#x27;s features, and had to ask a Prussian officer whom the Duke was conversing with, although I was quite close to him at the time, but of course not near enough to hear what was said. On leaving Blucher, the Duke rode at a walk towards Waterloo. Darkness shrouded the spectacle of the dead and dying near La Haye Sainte ; but the frequent snorting of our horses as they trod between them showed that the ground, so fiercely contested during the day, was very thickly strewed with bodies of the brave.

Blücher, the Prussian commander, suggested that the battle be remembered as &quot;la Belle Alliance&quot;, to commemorate the European Seventh Coalition of Britain, Russia, Prussia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, and a number of German States which had all joined the coalition to defeat the French Emperor. Wellington, who had chosen the field and commanded an allied army which had fought the French all day, instead recommended Waterloo, the village just north of the battlefield, where he himself had spent the previous night. Nevertheless, in 1815 the &quot;Rondell&quot; plaza in Berlin was renamed Belle-Alliance-Platz to commemorate the victory. There is a single La Belle Alliance Square in the UK, in Ramsgate, Kent.

==Name==
According to J.B. Romberg who published an account of the locations around Brussels in 1820, originally &quot;La Belle Alliance&quot; consisted of three houses, one of which was a tavern, that now bears the name, and two adjacent houses. Some time before the Battle of Waterloo, the publican of the tavern died, and his widow married the occupant of Trimotion, the farm-house opposite; but losing him in a short time afterwards, she consoled herself by taking for her third husband a peasant who lived a house close by (now known as Decoster&#x27;s house); but here again death interrupted her happiness, when she once more embraced the married state it was to marry the new landlord tavern; from which time it obtained the title it now bears.

<doc id="229612" wikidata="Q12766" url="?curid=229612" title="The World at War">
<text>The World at War is a 26-episode British documentary television series that chronicles the events of the Second World War. Produced in 1973 at a cost of £900,000 (), it was the most expensive factual series ever made at the time. It was produced by Jeremy Isaacs, narrated by Laurence Olivier and included music composed by Carl Davis. The book, &quot;The World at War&quot;, published the same year, was written by Mark Arnold-Forster to accompany the TV series.

&quot;The World at War&quot; attracted widespread acclaim and now it is regarded as a landmark in British television history. The series focused on a portrayal of the experience of the conflict: of how life and death throughout the war years affected soldiers, sailors and airmen, civilians, concentration camp inmates and other victims of the war.

== Overview ==
Jeremy Isaacs had been inspired to look at the production of a long-form documentary series about the Second World War following the BBC&#x27;s broadcast of its series &quot;The Great War&quot; in 1964. The BBC series, produced in collaboration with the Imperial War Museum, featured a mix of contemporary film footage from the period and film recreations, which soured relations between the BBC and the Museum. As a consequence, Isaacs was determined to have his programme be as authentic as possible.

&quot;The World at War&quot; was commissioned by Thames Television in 1969. The government had halved its levy on television advertising revenue, with the proviso that the money which the independent television companies saved must be reinvested in programmes. Isaacs persuaded Thames to use the money to pay for the production of his Second World War documentary. The series took four years to produce, at a cost of £900,000 (), a record for a British television series. It was first shown in 1973 on ITV.

The series featured interviews with major members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including witness accounts from civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians. The interviewees included Sir Max Aitken, Joseph Lawton Collins, Mark Clark, Jock Colville, Karl Dönitz, James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Doolittle, Lawrence Durrell, Lord Eden of Avon, Mitsuo Fuchida, Adolf Galland, Minoru Genda, W. Averell Harriman, Sir Arthur Harris, Alger Hiss, Brian Horrocks, Traudl Junge, Toshikazu Kase, Curtis LeMay, Vera Lynn, Hasso von Manteuffel, Bill Mauldin, John J. McCloy, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor, J. B. Priestley, Saburo Sakai, Albert Speer, James Stewart, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Walter Warlimont, Takeo Yoshikawa and historian Stephen Ambrose.

In the programme &quot;The Making of &quot;The World at War&quot;&quot;, included in the DVD set, Isaacs explains that priority was given to interviews with surviving aides and assistants rather than recognised figures. The most difficult person to locate and persuade to be interviewed was Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s adjutant Karl Wolff. During the interview, he admitted to witnessing a mass execution in Himmler&#x27;s presence. Isaacs later expressed satisfaction with the series&#x27;s content, noting that if it had not been secret, he would have added references to British codebreaking at Bletchley Park. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes which was compiled by the British Film Institute during 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;The World at War&quot; ranked 19th, the highest-placed documentary on the list.

== Episodes ==
The series has twenty-six episodes. Isaacs asked Noble Frankland, director of the Imperial War Museum, to list fifteen main campaigns of the war and devoted one episode to each. The remaining eleven episodes are devoted to other matters, such as the rise of Nazi Germany, home life in Britain and Germany, the experience of occupation of the Netherlands, and the Holocaust. Episode one begins with a cold open describing the massacre at the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane by the &quot;Waffen SS&quot;. The same event is referenced again at the end of Episode twenty-six, accompanied by the &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; (Latin for &quot;Grant us peace&quot;) from the Missa Sancti Nicolai, composed by Joseph Haydn. The series ends with Laurence Olivier saying &quot;Remember&quot;. For all but three episodes (&quot;The Desert&quot;, &quot;Home Fires&quot;, and &quot;Remember&quot;), the last scene of each episode either ended as a photograph or would be a freeze-frame shot of a film, and then change to a textured photograph before the credits roll. They would show the textured photograph only when &quot;The World at War&quot; logo appeared in both &quot;The Desert&quot; and &quot;Home Fires&quot; episodes. In the &quot;Remember&quot; episode, it would show the fire used during the title part as the credits roll before extinguishing itself at the end.

== Broadcast history ==
The series was originally transmitted on the ITV network in Britain between 31 October 1973 and 8 May 1974, and has been shown around the world. It was first shown in the US in syndication on various stations in 1974. WOR in New York aired the series in the mid-1970s, although episodes were edited both for graphic content and to include sufficient commercial breaks. PBS station WNET in New York broadcast the series unedited and in its entirety in 1982 as did WGBH in the late 1980s. The Danish channel DR1 first broadcast the series from August 1976 to February 1977 and it was repeated on DR2 in December 2006 and January 2007. The History Channel in Japan began screening the series in its entirety in April 2007. It repeated the entire series again in August 2011. The Military History Channel in the UK broadcast the series over the weekend of 14 and 15 November 2009. The Military Channel (now American Heroes Channel) in the United States aired the series in January 2010, and has shown it regularly since. BBC2 in the UK transmitted a repeat run of the series starting on 5 September 1994 at teatime. In 2011, the British channel Yesterday started a showing of the series and it has been shown continuously since.

The series was shown on SABC in South Africa in 1976, one of the first documentary series broadcast after the launch of the first television service in South Africa in January 1976, but the episode showing the Nazi holocaust was not shown.

The series was shown in Australia in 1975 and has been shown on various TV stations at various times since then. It has also been shown on Australia&#x27;s Pay TV Provider Foxtel in the early 2000s and a number of times since.

Each episode was 52 minutes excluding commercials; as was customary for hour-long ITV episodes at the time, it was originally screened with only one central break. On its original television broadcast in the UK the twentieth episode &quot;Genocide (1941-1945)&quot;, which dealt with Nazi concentration camps and the Holocaust, was shown uninterrupted without a commercial break due to the sensitive nature of its content .

=== Additional episodes ===
So extensive was the amount of footage both shot and meticulously collected by Isaacs and his team that much went unused in the original 26-episode series. As a result, eight further documentaries were commissioned by Thames Television, ranging from 30 minutes to 100 minutes in length. The topics of these additional programmes include the theories and myths surrounding Hitler&#x27;s death, the Auschwitz death camp, Germany under the rule of the Nazis, and a full interview with Hitler&#x27;s personal secretary Traudl Junge. Due to Laurence Olivier being unavailable these additional documentaries were narrated instead by actor Eric Porter. These were released as a bonus to the VHS version and have been included on all DVD and blu-ray sets of the series since.

The additional episodes and their original UK broadcast dates (where known) are:

# The Two Deaths of Adolf Hitler [30 April 1975]
# The Final Solution - Auschwitz: Part One [12 August 1975] 
# The Final Solution - Auschwitz: Part Two [19 August 1975]
# Warrior [11 November 1975]
# Hitler&#x27;s Germany: The People&#x27;s Community (1933–1939) [11 August 1976]
# Hitler&#x27;s Germany: Total War (1939–1945) [18 August 1976]
# Secretary to Hitler 
# From War to Peace

Four further documentaries were created specially for home video releases, these are:

# The Making of the Series: The World at War [1989]
# Making of the Series - A 30th Anniversary Retrospective [2003]
# Experiences of War
# Restoring the World at War

== Home media history ==
The series was released in various territories on VHS video as well as on 13 Laservision long-play videodiscs by Video Garant Amsterdam.

In 2001–2005, DVD box sets were released in the UK and US. In 2010, the series was digitally restored and re-released on DVD and Blu-ray. In the latter case the image is cropped from its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio down to 1.78:1, to better fit modern widescreen televisions. The restored series was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray in its original aspect ratio in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2016.

== Books ==
The original book &quot;The World at War&quot;, which accompanied the series, was written by Mark Arnold-Forster in 1973. In October 2007, Ebury Press published &quot;The World at War&quot;, a new book by Richard Holmes, an oral history of the Second World War drawn from the interviews conducted for the TV series. The programme&#x27;s producers shot hundreds of hours of interviews, but only a fraction of that recorded material was used for the final version of the series. A selection of the rest of this material was published in this book, which included interviews with Albert Speer, Karl Wolff (Himmler&#x27;s adjutant), Traudl Junge (Hitler&#x27;s secretary), James Stewart (USAAF bomber pilot and Hollywood star), Anthony Eden, John Colville (Private Secretary to Winston Churchill), Averell Harriman (US Ambassador to the Soviet Union) and Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris (Head of RAF Bomber Command).

<text>In physics and chemistry, effusion is the process in which a gas escapes from a container through a hole of diameter considerably smaller than the mean free path of the molecules. Such a hole is often described as a &quot;pinhole&quot; and the escape of the gas is due to the pressure difference between the container and the exterior.

Under these conditions, essentially all molecules which arrive at the hole continue and pass through the hole, since collisions between molecules in the region of the hole are negligible. Conversely, when the diameter is larger than the mean free path of the gas, flow obeys the Sampson flow law.

In medical terminology, an effusion refers to accumulation of fluid in an anatomic space, usually without loculation. Specific examples include subdural, mastoid, pericardial and pleural effusions.

== Etymology ==
The word effusion derives from the Latin word, effundo, which means &quot;shed&quot;, &quot;pour forth&quot;, &quot;pour out&quot;, &quot;utter&quot;, &quot;lavish&quot;, &quot;waste&quot;. 

== Into a vacuum ==
Effusion from an equilibrated container into outside vacuum can be calculated based on kinetic theory. The number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time (impingement rate) is given by:
formula_1
assuming mean free path is much greater than pinhole diameter and the gas can be treated as an ideal gas.

If a small area formula_2 on the container is punched to become a small hole, the effusive flow rate will be
formula_3
where formula_4 is the molar mass, formula_5 is the Avogadro constant, and formula_6 is the molar gas constant.

The average velocity of effused particles is
formula_7

Combined with the effusive flow rate, the recoil/thrust force on the system itself is
formula_8

An example is the recoil force on a balloon with a small hole flying in vacuum.

== Measures of flow rate ==
According to the kinetic theory of gases, the kinetic energy for a gas at a temperature formula_9 is
: formula_10
where formula_11 is the mass of one molecule, formula_12 is the root-mean-square speed of the molecules, and formula_13 is the Boltzmann constant. The average molecular speed can be calculated from the Maxwell speed distribution
as formula_14 (or, equivalently, formula_15). The rate formula_16 at which a gas of molar mass formula_4 effuses (typically expressed as the &quot;number&quot; of molecules passing through the hole per second) is then
: formula_18

Here formula_19 is the gas pressure difference across the barrier, formula_2 is the area of the hole, formula_5 is the Avogadro constant, formula_22 is the gas constant and formula_9 is the absolute temperature. Assuming the pressure difference between the two sides of the barrier is much smaller than formula_24, the average absolute pressure in the system (&quot;i.e.&quot; formula_25), it is possible to express effusion flow as a volumetric flow rate as follows:
: formula_26
or
: formula_27
where formula_28 is the volumetric flow rate of the gas, formula_24 is the average pressure on either side of the orifice, and formula_30 is the hole diameter.

== Effect of molecular weight ==
At constant pressure and temperature, the root-mean-square speed and therefore the effusion rate are inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. Gases with a lower molecular weight effuse more rapidly than gases with a higher molecular weight, so that the &quot;number&quot; of lighter molecules passing through the hole per unit time is greater.

=== Graham&#x27;s law ===
Scottish chemist Thomas Graham (1805–1869) found experimentally that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles. In other words, the ratio of the rates of effusion of two gases at the same temperature and pressure is given by the inverse ratio of the square roots of the masses of the gas particles.
: formula_31
where formula_32 and formula_33 represent the molar masses of the gases. 
This equation is known as Graham&#x27;s law of effusion.

The effusion rate for a gas depends directly on the average velocity of its particles. Thus, the faster the gas particles are moving, the more likely they are to pass through the effusion orifice.

== Knudsen cell ==
The Knudsen cell is used to measure the vapor pressures of a solid with very low vapor pressure. Such a solid forms a vapor at low pressure by sublimation. The vapor slowly effuses through a pinhole, and the loss of mass is proportional to the vapor pressure and can be used to determine this pressure. The heat of sublimation can also be determined by measuring the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, using the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.

<doc id="229623" wikidata="Q1834161" url="?curid=229623" title="List of animal names">
<text>In the English language, many animals have different names depending on whether they are male, female, young, domesticated, or in groups.

The best-known source of many English words used for collective groupings of animals is &quot;The Book of Saint Albans&quot;, an essay on hunting published in 1486 and attributed to Juliana Berners. Most terms used here may be found in common dictionaries and general information web sites.


==Generic terms==
The terms in this table apply to many or all taxons in a particular biological family, class, or clade.

==Terms by species or taxon==


==Usage of collective nouns==
&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; writes that most terms of venery fell out of use in the 16th century, including a &quot;murder&quot; for crows. It goes on to say that some of the terms in &quot;The Book of Saint Albans&quot; were &quot;rather fanciful&quot;, explaining that the book extended collective nouns to people of specific professions, such as a &quot;poverty&quot; of pipers. It concludes that for lexicographers, many of these do not satisfy criteria for entry by being &quot;used consistently in running prose&quot; without meriting explanation. Some terms that were listed as commonly used were &quot;herd&quot;, &quot;flock&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, and &quot;swarm&quot;.

Writing for Audubon, Nicholas Lund says that many such terms are not used in actuality. When he interviewed scientists who specialize in studying specific animals, they had not heard of these terms, such as a &quot;bask&quot; of crocodiles or &quot;wisdom&quot; of wombats, being applied in their fields. Lund noted that the common plural nouns for animals were &quot;flock&quot; for birds and &quot;herd&quot; for cows, conceding that for certain animals in small groups, there was currency in usage such as a &quot;pod&quot; of whales or &quot;gaggle&quot; of geese.

<doc id="229634" wikidata="Q263871" url="?curid=229634" title="Operation Ivy">
<text>Operation Ivy was the eighth series of American nuclear tests, coming after &quot;Tumbler-Snapper&quot; and before &quot;Upshot–Knothole&quot;. The two explosions were staged in late 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Proving Ground in the Marshall Islands.

== Background ==
The Operation Ivy test series was the first to involve a hydrogen bomb rather than an atomic bomb, further to the order of President Harry S. Truman made on January 31, 1950, that the US should continue research into all forms of nuclear weapons. The bombs were prepared by the US Atomic Energy Commission and Defense Department aboard naval vessels, and were capable of being detonated remotely from the control ship Estes.

== Tests ==
=== Mike ===
The first &quot;Ivy&quot; shot, codenamed &quot;Mike&quot;, was the first successful full-scale test of a multi-megaton thermonuclear weapon (&quot;hydrogen bomb&quot;) using the Teller-Ulam design. Unlike later thermonuclear weapons, &quot;Mike&quot; used deuterium as its fusion fuel, maintained as a liquid by an expensive and cumbersome cryogenic system. The bomb was detonated on November 1, 1952, on Elugelab Island yielding 10.4 megatons, almost 500 times the yield of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, resulting in the total vaporization of the island. Eight megatons of the yield were from fast fission of the uranium tamper, creating massive amounts of radioactive fallout. The detonation left an underwater crater 6,240 ft (1.9 km) wide and 164 ft (50 m) deep where Elugelab Island had been. Following this successful test, the &quot;Mike&quot; design was weaponized as the EC-16, but it was quickly abandoned for solid-fueled designs after the success of the &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; shot two years later.

The outcome of the test was reported to incoming president Eisenhower by Atomic Energy Commission Chairman, Gordon Dean, as follows: “The island of Elugelab is missing!”

====Sampling mission====
Four USAF F-84G Thunderjets equipped with filters were flown through the mushroom cloud&#x27;s stem to collect radiochemical samples for analysis. &quot;Red Flight&quot; Leader Virgil K. Meroney of the nascent 1211th Test Squadron flew into the stem of the explosion first. In five minutes, he had gathered all the samples he could, and exited. Jimmy Priestly Robinson, age 28, a captain with the 561st Fighter-Day Squadron, was lost near the end of his mission. After re-emerging from the cloud, both he and his wingman, pilot Captain Bob Hagan, encountered difficulties picking up rendezvous and runway navigational beacons due to &quot;electromagnetic after effects&quot; of the detonation. Robinson hit an area of severe turbulence, entering a spin and barely retaining consciousness. He regained control of his plane at 20,000 feet, but the electromagnetic storm had disrupted his instruments. In rain and poor visibility, without working instruments, Hagan and Robinson were unable to find the KB-29 tanker aircraft to refuel. By the time they were successful in finding the signal, they were dangerously low on fuel, and before reaching the runway on Enewetak, both had depleted their reserves. Hagan made a successful dead-stick landing on the runway, but Robinson was too far out and attempted to ditch. His jet crashed and sank 3.5 miles short of the island. Robinson&#x27;s plane flipped and his body was never found. Approximately a year after his disappearance, he was awarded a posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. In 2002, a memorial stone at Virginia&#x27;s Arlington National Cemetery was erected.

As a result of the collection of samples from the explosion by U.S. Air Force pilots, scientists found traces of the isotopes plutonium-246 and plutonium-244, and confirmed the existence of the predicted but undiscovered elements einsteinium and fermium.

=== King ===
The second test, &quot;King&quot;, fired the highest-yield (500 kilotons) nuclear fission (A-bomb) weapon to date using only nuclear fission (no fusion nor fusion boosting). This test used an unretarded free-fall bomb from a B-36 bomber. The bomber suffered minor heat and blast damage and safely returned to base. This &quot;Super Oralloy Bomb&quot; was intended as a backup to the earlier &quot;Mike&quot; test, if the fusion weapon had failed.

==Operation Ivy in popular culture==
In the video game Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI, Operation Ivy is a late game project that the player can construct at one of their cities. Completing the project allows the player to construct thermonuclear devices, which are more powerful than nuclear devices (which are the game&#x27;s version of an atomic bomb).

There was an American punk rock band called Operation Ivy, named after the real-life nuclear tests.

<doc id="229639" wikidata="Q5509359" url="?curid=229639" title="Funny Cide">
<text>Funny Cide (April 20, 2000 – July 16, 2023) was an American Thoroughbred champion racehorse who won the 2003 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. He was the first New York-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. He was a popular horse and remained a fan favorite in retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park.

==Background==
Funny Cide was bred at WinStar Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, but was foaled at the McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbred Farm, owned by Joe and Anne McMahon in Saratoga Springs, New York. His sire is Distorted Humor, who was then an unproven sire at WinStar, struggling to attract good mares. Belle&#x27;s Good Cide, an Oklahoma-bred granddaughter of Seattle Slew, was already at the farm, and was therefore bred to him. She was then shipped to New York so her foal would be eligible for New York-bred races.
Funny Cide was part of Distorted Humor&#x27;s first American crop when his stud fee was $12,500, dropping down the next year to $10,000. Due to the success of Funny Cide and the rest of his first crop, Distorted Humor&#x27;s fee then rose to $20,000 in 2003. It would eventually go as high as $300,000 in 2008 for a live foal. The fee later dropped, and in 2018 was $50,000.

Funny Cide was consigned to the August 2001 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga-preferred yearling auction, where he was inspected by Tony Everard, a &quot;pinhooker&quot; looking for young, undeveloped horses to train and resell in a few months at a profit. Everard liked what he saw, even though the colt was a ridgling with one undescended testicle, and purchased the colt for $22,000. Everard then took the colt to his New Episode Training Center in Ocala, Florida, and made the decision to geld the colt. &quot;With ridglings, it&#x27;s better to go ahead and geld them early,&quot; he would later say. &quot;My experience is once they start training around turns they are moving faster and getting pinched and it hurts them.&quot;

===Barclay Tagg===
Barclay Tagg purchased the gelding for $75,000 in a private transaction in March, 2002 for Sackatoga Stable.

Once a steeplechase jockey, Tagg (who grew up in Abington, Pennsylvania and won his first race in 1972 at Liberty Bell Park) was a journeyman who had been on the racing scene for over 30 years. The victory by Funny Cide made Tagg the first trainer to win the Derby in his first attempt since Neil Drysdale saddled Fusaichi Pegasus to win the 2000 Derby.

Ray Paulick of &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; said of Tagg, &quot;He has some characteristics uncannily like hall-of-famer &quot;Silent&quot; Tom Smith, the trainer of Seabiscuit. He takes care of his horse, doesn&#x27;t rush into anything or run him when he shouldn&#x27;t. I like that about Tagg. Like Tom Smith, he&#x27;s his own man and will put the horse first. I wish we had more trainers out there like him.&quot;

===Sackatoga Stable===

Sackatoga Stable was formed by ten friends from Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, a small town in upstate New York, who purchased their first horse by contributing $5,000 each. The managing partner was Jackson Knowlton, a health care consultant. They coined the name Sackatoga by combining their origins in Sacket&#x27;s Harbor and Saratoga. Knowlton said, &quot;We joined up with Barclay Tagg [in 1999] and he was able to locate a couple of nice horses for us. We claimed Bail Money for $40,000. She won three races and $130,000 for us before she was claimed for $62,500. So that really helped make things easier — we were playing with the house&#x27;s money when we bought Funny Cide for $75,000.&quot;

==Racing career==
===2002: two-year-old season===
The chestnut gelding, ridden by jockey José A. Santos, made his two-year-old racing debut at Belmont Park on September 8, 2002. Running away from the New York field under a hand ride, he easily won the six-furlong race by lengths. Three weeks later, Funny Cide won his first seven-furlong stakes race, the Bertram F. Bongard Stakes, under another hand ride, this time by 8 lengths. In the Bongard, his Beyer Speed Figure was 103: no two-year-old in the country had run faster.

His third winning effort as a two-year-old was his first mile race, the Sleepy Hollow Stakes (also at Belmont Park). Under a hard hold by Santos, he was for the first time challenged for the lead (by Spite the Devil). Despite being bumped several times, Funny Cide won by a neck. Santos believed he had found his Derby horse.

Funny Cide was named the Champion two-year-old New-York bred for 2002, though little attention was paid to him nationally. He was not included on the Experimental Free Handicap, which was led by the champion two-year-old Vindication.

===2003: three-year-old season===
Funny Cide began his three-year-old campaign on January 18, 2003, in the -mile Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park. Breaking from post position 13, he hit the gate and raced wide for the entire trip, eventually finishing fifth behind Offlee Wild. He then shipped to Fair Grounds for the Louisiana Derby on March 9, where he faced Peace Rules, Kafwain, and Badge of Silver. Staying close to the pace, he rallied in the stretch, dropped back, and then came on again along the rail. Finishing third after Peace Rules, he was moved up to second place after the disqualification of Kafwain.

On April 12, he entered the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct as the second betting choice. Empire Maker, conditioned by Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel and ridden by Jerry Bailey, was the odds-on favorite after an impressive win in the Florida Derby. Funny Cide was bumped at the start then moved up to challenge New York Hero on the lead. Empire Maker raced in third, then took the lead as they entered the stretch. Funny Cide fought back gamely, losing by only length. Funny Cide earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 110 for the Wood.

====Kentucky Derby====
Empire Maker was the favorite for the Derby despite suffering a bruised right front hoof that caused him to miss a few days of training: his odds did drift up though from 6–5 on the morning-line to a more lukewarm 5–2. Peace Rules, also trained by Frankel, was the second choice at 6-1 while Funny Cide was sixth choice at 13–1. Bumped again at the start, Funny Cide tracked the early pace set by Peace Rules, and moved to the lead heading into the stretch. Empire Maker then started closing fast but Funny Cide was able to hold on by lengths. &quot;I hit him and he kept digging and digging and he did it,&quot; said Santos. &quot;It was New York pride.&quot; Funny Cide&#x27;s time of 2:01.19 was the tenth fastest time in Kentucky Derby history.

====Preakness Stakes====
Blood-Horse magazine&#x27;s Steven Haskin wrote: &quot;Pimlico stakes coordinator David Rollinson had to go out and recruit Preakness Stakes horses when it looked like only six or seven were going to run. All was calm that first week after the Derby. Then, Empire Maker was officially declared out, leaving only six confirmed starters. Then Midway Road came in. Then all hell broke loose when the Miami Herald&#x27;s bogus story and photo of Santos cheating in the Derby appeared. Empire Maker suddenly jumped back in, his Triple Crown hopes alive once again. Hours later, when the inferno began to subside, he was back out. Then Peace Rules officially came in. Sometime, in between all that, Champali scratched after colicking. Then Kissin Saint and Alysweep came in. Then Indian Express came out. Then Rollinson popped a couple of Advil and braced for week two.&quot; Week two was like week one, now including the in and outs and ins of New York Hero, Ten Cents A Shine, Foufa&#x27;s Warrior, and During. Haskin said, &quot;All this confusion could have been avoided if all involved had known how Funny Cide was going to run in the Preakness.&quot;

Shipped in at the last moment by Tagg and stabled in Mary Eppler&#x27;s barn to keep him calm and away from the press, this time Funny Cide was the betting favorite. On a cold, wet day in May, he broke from post position nine (only Layminister in 1910 and Canonero II in 1971 won from the ninth post) and was the runaway winner of the 2003 Preakness Stakes at Baltimore&#x27;s Pimlico Race Course. His time was 1:55:61 and he took the race by lengths, the second-largest margin in Preakness history.

&quot;I couldn&#x27;t find my horse, so I was watching Funny Cide,&quot; said Bob Baffert, trainer of Senor Swinger, who finished fifth. &quot;It was fun watching and listening to the crowd respond to Funny Cide as he drew off like that.&quot;

Funny Cide earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 114. He was only the third New York-bred to win the Preakness. The other two were Jacobus in 1883 and Margrave in 1896 when the Preakness was run at Gravesend Race Track in Coney Island, New York.

====Belmont Stakes====
With a Triple Crown on the line, Funny Cide and his connections were the center of attention in the weeks leading up to the 2003 Belmont Stakes. Funny Cide posted several fast works: too fast, some worried. Then it rained all day before the Belmont Stakes, the most grueling of the three Triple Crown races and a quarter mile longer than the Kentucky Derby. Regardless, New Yorkers came to the track in near record numbers, hoping to see the New York-bred make history. Funny Cide broke well and rushed to the early lead, but wasted energy struggling against Santos&#x27;s efforts to set a sensible pace down the backstretch. As they rounded the final turn, Empire Maker ranged up on the outside and gradually pulled clear. Funny Cide tried to respond but eventually tired, finishing third. The horses who beat him, Empire Maker and Ten Most Wanted, were both fresher horses, having skipped the Preakness Stakes.

Frankel had said before the race that if everyone hated him after the Belmont Stakes, then he had done his job. Robin Smullen, Tagg&#x27;s assistant and companion, had predicted that win, lose or draw, Funny Cide would remain everyone&#x27;s favorite horse. Both Frankel and Smullen proved to be correct.

Later that year, Island Fashion, trained by Tagg, won the Alabama Stakes. Her victory denied a $2 million Triple Tiara bonus to the owners of Spoken Fur, trained by Frankel.

Funny Cide became the 17th horse to take the Derby and Preakness and then lose the Belmont. Tagg wondered if the sloppy track may have played a role in the loss, despite training over it nearly every day regardless of weather. &quot;I just feel bad for all the people who came out,&quot; Tagg said. &quot;We were beaten by a good horse. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. I am being honest. It is horse racing.&quot;

====Later three-year-old season====
Funny Cide was given a two-month break, then returned on August 3 in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park where he finished third to Peace Rules. His next target was supposed to be the Travers Stakes at Saratoga in a face-off against Empire Maker, but both horses became ill and missed the race. In Funny Cide&#x27;s case it was a respiratory condition, although Tagg didn&#x27;t know whether the gelding had a lung infection or allergies. During a routine gallop, he started making noise so a veterinarian examined his lungs and found them full of mucus. Funny Cide may have been suffering from the same ailment when he finished third in the Haskell: he showed mucus after that race, as well as an elevated temperature.

Funny Cide missed most of the fall racing season but recovered in time to enter the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, held that year at Santa Anita Park on October 25. Facing an excellent field, he raced wide just off the pace before fading on the final turn, finishing ninth behind Pleasantly Perfect. Tagg would say later that Funny Cide didn&#x27;t like the heat.

Funny Cide won the Eclipse Award for 3 Year Old Male of the Year, the first New York-bred to do so. (Saratoga Dew was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly of 1992). The voters had to weigh Empire Maker&#x27;s two wins in their three head-to-head races, versus the brilliance of Funny Cide&#x27;s two Classic wins. As Andrew Beyer put it: &quot;[Funny Cide] performed honorably throughout the series, while stimulating widespread public interest in the sport. Is he less worthy of a title than a rival who won one race, had an excuse in one and skipped one?&quot; Ultimately, Funny Cide prevailed by 150 votes to 92.

===2004: four-year-old season===
On January 10, 2004, Funny Cide returned to the track with a win in allowance company at Gulfstream Park, followed by third-place finishes in the Donn Handicap and New Orleans Handicap. In April, he won the Excelsior Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap at Aqueduct, digging in down the stretch to beat Evening Attire by half a length. His next start was in the 1-mile Metropolitan Handicap where he finished fifth.

In June 2004, the New York Turf Writer&#x27;s Association honoured Funny Cide with its Presidents&#x27; Award as the first New York-bred to win the Kentucky Derby and for how his Triple Crown bid captivated the nation. Jose Santos received the Red Smith &quot;Good Guy&quot; Award for his &quot;grace under pressure&quot; when dealing with a false accusation concerning his ride in the Kentucky Derby.
Funny Cide next started in the Massachusetts Handicap on July 3, 2004, earning a 110 Beyer Speed Figure. The finish was a three-way photo at the wire between runner-up Funny Cide, the winner Offlee Wild, and The Lady&#x27;s Groom. He next ran in the Suburban Handicap, finishing third in another close finish behind old foe Peace Rules. Funny Cide then ran second behind Evening Attire in the Saratoga Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap before a near record crowd of 70,175.

Coming into the Jockey Club Gold Cup, Funny Cide had only two wins in eight starts for the year, but was still co-favorite at 3–1 with Love of Money. The two battled for the lead for the first mile, then Funny Cide fell back as Newfoundland moved to the lead with Love of Money, and The Cliff&#x27;s Edge came closing on the outside. Funny Cide appeared to be struggling, but fought back and began to gradually wear down Newfoundland, finally winning by three-quarters of a length. &quot;I thought he was done,&quot; Tagg said. &quot;Maybe he wanted to take a breather, I don&#x27;t know... I was about ready to get sick then, but he came back running. He always does that. He never gives up. He always comes back running, even in some of his worst races.&quot; The Cliff&#x27;s Edge was third and Evening Attire fourth, as Love of Money dropped out of contention. In the winner&#x27;s circle, Funny Cide appeared exhausted by the effort. In the Gold Cup, he earned a 112 Beyer.

Funny Cide&#x27;s last race of the year was a tenth-place finish in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, held that year at Lone Star Park.

===2005–2007: four to six-year-old season===
Since the middle of his three-year-old campaign, Funny Cide was beset with respiratory problems, perhaps aggravated by racing in the heat at the 2003 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic at Santa Anita when a major forest fire raged nearby. Tagg would call him &quot;fractious&quot;, later saying, &quot;He had a lot of good qualities about him, but he was pretty difficult to train.&quot; During his five-year-old season he had back problems, undiagnosed until he had raced out of the money in the Pimlico Special, Brooklyn Handicap, and Suburban Handicap. Tagg decided to rest Funny Cide for the last half of the season.

Funny Cide returned to the track on January 7, 2006, in the six-furlong Gulfstream Park Handicap, finishing a disappointing seventh. On February 2, 2006, he finished second in a one-mile allowance race at Gulfstream, finishing behind Sir Greeley but ahead of odds-on favorite Sun King, winner of the Pennsylvania and Tampa Bay Derbies. Funny Cide&#x27;s jockey for the race, Edgar Prado, said, &quot;This was not his best distance but he was trying the whole way. He galloped out real strong. I think he&#x27;s back, hopefully.&quot;

On April 1, he again finished second, this time in the Excelsior Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap at Aqueduct. &quot;He ran a fantastic race&quot;, new jockey Richard Migliore said. &quot;Blood and guts all the way to the wire. He&#x27;s a fantastic racehorse. I wasn&#x27;t looking for the lead, but my horse was keen and I didn&#x27;t want to get into a fight with him. When he got alone, he idled better and when company joined him, he fought on again. It was a very game performance.&quot;
On April 30, Funny Cide broke his losing streak by taking the Kings Point Handicap for state-breds at Aqueduct. Funny Cide took the early lead but dropped into second coming into the stretch. Migliore hit him with the stick, which Funny Cide resented. &quot;I turned my stick over and hit him with it before he was ready,&quot; said Migliore. &quot;I kind of took him out of his game. My little bit of worry almost cost us. I should have been more confident.&quot; He followed this with a third-place finish in the William Donald Schaefer Handicap at Pimlico.

On July 1, Funny Cide led all the way to win the Grade III $200,800, -mile Dominion Day Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada. The race attracted many who had come just to see Funny Cide; they crowded the walking ring when he entered the paddock and gave him an ovation during the post parade. His -length win over a strong field brought the crowd to its feet. Funny Cide broke from the inside post and set a fast pace, then held off challenges from Cryptograph, who finished third and Nolan&#x27;s Cat, who finished second. &quot;I kind of figured we&#x27;d be on the lead,&quot; said Migliore. &quot;I knew I had horse. When the challenge came, he met it. He likes to fight. As long as he can see them, they weren&#x27;t going to beat him.&quot; Funny Cide was the first Derby winner to win at Woodbine since Secretariat took the Canadian International Stakes in 1973. He was also the first Kentucky Derby winner to win a graded stakes race at the age of six. He was also one of only two Kentucky Derby winners in 46 years to race at the age of six. (The other was Gato Del Sol, the 1982 winner.)

Funny Cide, foaled in Saratoga Springs, next ran in the Grade I Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on September 2, 2006. The field contained Sun King, the favorite after finishing second in the Whitney, the 2005 Travers winner Flower Alley, and Suave, who won the 2005 Saratoga Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap. But Funny Cide was the star: the New York Thoroughbred Breeders gave out 10,000 Funny Cide posters to his fans. Unfortunately, Funny Cide was not up to the task and faded after chasing the pace while running wide, finishing eighth.

Funny Cide finished 2006 with two losses in the Brooklyn Breeders Cup Handicap and the Empire Cup Handicap. He was given some time off, then returned on April 29, 2007, in the Kings Point Handicap. He chased the pace three-wide but had no rally in the stretch and finished third. In the Wagon Limit Stakes for New York-breds, he went to the early lead but tired and again finished third.

On July 4, 2007, lured to Finger Lakes Race Track by an extra $50,000 added to the purse, Funny Cide took the $100,000 Wadsworth Memorial Handicap by three lengths under Alan Garcia, breaking his six-race winless streak. The track, which could accommodate 2,000 patrons in the clubhouse and another 4,000 in the grandstand, had an attendance of well over 11,000 people, its second-largest crowd since 1962. Funny Cide was only the second winner of a Triple Crown race to run at Finger Lakes in its 46-year history.

==Retirement==
On July 13, 2007, Funny Cide&#x27;s retirement was announced. &quot;We decided that after the great fun and excitement of watching Funny Cide win the Wadsworth Memorial at Finger Lakes at the age of 7, it would be a good note on which to retire the horse,&quot; Tagg said. Jack Knowlton, managing partner for Sackatoga Stable, agreed that Funny Cide&#x27;s future career would be at the track with Tagg. He became a stable pony in the mornings, accompanying younger horses in their training. &quot;He&#x27;ll still be doing what he&#x27;s done the past five years, but he just won&#x27;t be racing in the afternoon,&quot; Knowlton said.

NYRA (the New York Racing Association) held a &quot;Funny Cide Retirement Party&quot; at Saratoga on August 10, 2007.

On December 5, 2008, Funny Cide took up residence at the Kentucky Horse Park alongside Cigar, Da Hoss, and other champions. His work as Barclay Tagg&#x27;s stable pony had begun to give him some discomfort. Shortly after Cigar&#x27;s death in October 2014, Funny Cide was given his stall and paddock.

In August 2012, Funny Cide visited Saratoga&#x27;s racetrack along with the retired jockey Richard Migliore and the trainer Nick Zito in a seminar for prospective racehorse owners. While there, he was a guest of Old Friends farm at Cabin Creek in Greenfield Center.

Funny Cide made several other racetrack appearances during retirement, most notably in August 2015 when he was shipped to Saratoga with American Pharoah. &quot;He and (American Pharoah) were on the same flight with a pony (Smokey) of AP&#x27;s, and it was just really neat to have a Triple Crown winner and a near-Triple Crown winner (together),&quot; Knowlton said. &quot;It was fun. I&#x27;d love for the pony to talk so we knew what those guys were talking about.&quot; Knowlton added, &quot;People still adore him. They remember him and they love him. I have people all the time when I&#x27;m around racetracks (ask me), &#x27;How&#x27;s Funny Cide doing?&#x27; They don&#x27;t know my name, but they know Funny Cide and they know I&#x27;m associated with him. I&#x27;m kind of the human side of Funny Cide.&quot;

==Death==
Funny Cide died due to complications of colic on July 16, 2023, at the age of 23. He resided at the Kentucky Horse Park for the last 15 years of his life.

A portion of Funny Cide&#x27;s ashes were buried behind the clubhouse of Saratoga Race Course on August 27, 2023. Portions of the remains are planned to be buried at McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbred Farm and the Kentucky Horse Park.

==Honors==
Funny Cide was a two-time &quot;New York–bred Horse of the Year&quot;. He retired with 11 wins from 38 starts with six second-place finishes and eight thirds and earnings of $3,529,412. Funny Cide had the highest earnings of any New York-bred racehorse in history. Saratoga Race Course honored him with a stakes race for older New York-breds, the Funny Cide Stakes.

In April 2010, the New York Thoroughbred Breeders voted Funny Cide the New York-bred Horse of the Decade.

In August 2012, a statue of Funny Cide was unveiled in Saratoga Springs. On his saddle blanket is the number 6, his post position at Churchill Downs on the day he won the Kentucky Derby.

==Race record==
==Pedigree==
==In popular culture==
In 2006, Funny Cide appeared in a children&#x27;s book about his life called, &quot;A Horse Named Funny Cide&quot;, written by The Funny Cide Team and illustrated by Barry Moser.

<doc id="229643" wikidata="Q172623" url="?curid=229643" title="Molality">
<text>In chemistry, molality is a measure of the amount of solute in a solution relative to a given mass of solvent. This contrasts with the definition of &quot;molarity&quot; which is based on a given volume of solution.

A commonly used unit for molality is the moles per kilogram (mol/kg). A solution of concentration 1 mol/kg is also sometimes denoted as 1 molal. The unit mol/kg requires that molar mass be expressed in kg/mol, instead of the usual g/mol or kg/kmol.

==Definition==
The molality (&quot;b&quot;), of a solution is defined as the amount of substance (in moles) of solute, &quot;n&quot;solute, divided by the mass (in kg) of the solvent, &quot;m&quot;solvent:

:formula_1.

In the case of solutions with more than one solvent, molality can be defined for the mixed solvent considered as a pure pseudo-solvent. Instead of mole solute per kilogram solvent as in the binary case, units are defined as mole solute per kilogram mixed solvent.

== Origin ==
The term &quot;molality&quot; is formed in analogy to &quot;molarity&quot; which is the molar concentration of a solution. The earliest known use of the intensive property molality and of its adjectival unit, the now-deprecated &quot;molal&quot;, appears to have been published by G. N. Lewis and M. Randall in the 1923 publication of &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energies of Chemical Substances.&quot; Though the two terms are subject to being confused with one another, the molality and molarity of a dilute aqueous solution are nearly the same, as one kilogram of water (solvent) occupies the volume of 1 liter at room temperature and a small amount of solute has little effect on the volume.

== Unit ==
The SI unit for molality is moles per kilogram of solvent.

A solution with a molality of 3 mol/kg is often described as &quot;3 molal&quot;, &quot;3 m&quot; or &quot;3 &quot;m&quot;&quot;. However, following the SI system of units, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States authority on measurement, considers the term &quot;molal&quot; and the unit symbol &quot;m&quot; to be obsolete, and suggests mol/kg or a related unit of the SI.

== Usage considerations ==
=== Advantages ===
The primary advantage of using molality as a measure of concentration is that molality only depends on the masses of solute and solvent, which are unaffected by variations in temperature and pressure. In contrast, solutions prepared volumetrically (e.g. molar concentration or mass concentration) are likely to change as temperature and pressure change. In many applications, this is a significant advantage because the mass, or the amount, of a substance is often more important than its volume (e.g. in a limiting reagent problem).

Another advantage of molality is the fact that the molality of one solute in a solution is independent of the presence or absence of other solutes.

=== Problem areas ===
Unlike all the other compositional properties listed in &quot;Relation&quot; section (below), molality &quot;depends&quot; on the choice of the substance to be called “solvent” in an arbitrary mixture. If there is only one pure liquid substance in a mixture, the choice is clear, but not all solutions are this clear-cut: in an alcohol–water solution, either one could be called the solvent; in an alloy, or solid solution, there is no clear choice and all constituents may be treated alike. In such situations, mass or mole fraction is the preferred compositional specification.

== Relation to other compositional quantities ==
In what follows, the solvent may be given the same treatment as the other constituents of the solution, such that the molality of the solvent of an &quot;n&quot;-solute solution, say &quot;b&quot;0, is found to be nothing more than the reciprocal of its molar mass, &quot;M&quot;0 (expressed in the unit kg/mol):
:formula_2.

For the solutes the expression of molalities is similar:

:formula_3.

The expressions linking molalities to mass fractions and mass concentrations contain the molar masses of the solutes &quot;M&quot;i:

:formula_4.

Similarly the equalities below are obtained from the definitions of the molalities and of the other compositional quantities.

The mole fraction of solvent can be obtained from the definition by dividing the numerator and denominator to the amount of solvent n0:

:formula_5.

Then the sum of ratios of the other mole amounts to the amount of solvent is substituted with expressions from below containing molalities:

:formula_6

:formula_7

giving the result

:formula_8.

===Mass fraction===
The conversions to and from the mass fraction, &quot;w1&quot;, of the solute in a single-solute solution are
:formula_9

where &quot;b1&quot; is the molality and &quot;M1&quot; is the molar mass of the solute.

More generally, for an &quot;n&quot;-solute/one-solvent solution, letting &quot;bi&quot; and &quot;wi&quot; be, respectively, the molality and mass fraction of the &quot;i&quot;-th solute,
:formula_10,

where &quot;Mi&quot; is the molar mass of the &quot;i&quot;th solute, and &quot;w&quot;0 is the mass fraction of the solvent, which is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other mass fractions,
:formula_11.

Substitution gives:

:formula_12.

=== Mole fraction ===
The conversions to and from the mole fraction, &quot;x1&quot; mole fraction of the solute in a single-solute solution are
:formula_13,
where &quot;M&quot;0 is the molar mass of the solvent.

More generally, for an &quot;n&quot;-solute/one-solvent solution, letting &quot;xi&quot; be the mole fraction of the &quot;i&quot;th solute,
:formula_14,

where &quot;x&quot;0 is the mole fraction of the solvent, expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other mole fractions:

:formula_15.

Substitution gives:

:formula_16.

===Molar concentration (molarity)===
The conversions to and from the molar concentration, &quot;c1&quot;, for one-solute solutions are
:formula_17,

where &quot;ρ&quot; is the mass density of the solution, &quot;b1&quot; is the molality, and &quot;M1&quot; is the molar mass (in kg/mol) of the solute.

For solutions with &quot;n&quot; solutes, the conversions are
:formula_18,

where the molar concentration of the solvent &quot;c&quot;0 is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other molarities:
:formula_19.

Substitution gives:

:formula_20,

=== Mass concentration ===
The conversions to and from the mass concentration, &quot;ρ&quot;solute, of a single-solute solution are
:formula_21,

or

:formula_22,

where &quot;ρ&quot; is the mass density of the solution, &quot;b1&quot; is the molality, and &quot;M1&quot; is the molar mass of the solute.

For the general &quot;n&quot;-solute solution, the mass concentration of the &quot;i&quot;th solute, &quot;ρi&quot;, is related to its molality, &quot;bi&quot;, as follows:
:formula_23,

where the mass concentration of the solvent, &quot;ρ&quot;0, is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other mass concentrations:
:formula_24.

Substitution gives:

:formula_25.

=== Equal ratios ===
Alternatively, one may use just the last two equations given for the compositional property of the solvent in each of the preceding sections, together with the relationships given below, to derive the remainder of properties in that set:
:formula_26,

where &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are subscripts representing &quot;all&quot; the constituents, the &quot;n&quot; solutes plus the solvent.

=== Example of conversion ===
An acid mixture consists of 0.76, 0.04, and 0.20 mass fractions of 70% HNO3, 49% HF, and H2O, where the percentages refer to mass fractions of the bottled acids carrying a balance of H2O. The first step is determining the mass fractions of the constituents:
:formula_27.

The approximate molar masses in kg/mol are
:formula_28.

First derive the molality of the solvent, in mol/kg,
:formula_29,

and use that to derive all the others by use of the equal ratios:
:formula_30.

Actually, &quot;b&quot;H2O cancels out, because it is not needed. In this case, there is a more direct equation: we use it to derive the molality of HF:
:formula_31.

The mole fractions may be derived from this result:
:formula_32,
:formula_33,
:formula_34.

=== Osmolality ===
Osmolality is a variation of molality that takes into account only solutes that contribute to a solution&#x27;s osmotic pressure. It is measured in osmoles of the solute per kilogram of water. This unit is frequently used in medical laboratory results in place of osmolarity, because it can be measured simply by depression of the freezing point of a solution, or cryoscopy (see also: osmostat and colligative properties).

== Relation to apparent (molar) properties ==
Molality appears in the expression of the apparent (molar) volume of a solute as a function of the molality &quot;b&quot; of that solute (and density of the solution and solvent):

:formula_35,

:formula_36.

For multicomponent systems the relation is slightly modified by the sum of molalities of solutes. Also a total molality and a mean apparent molar volume can be defined for the solutes together and also a mean molar mass of the solutes as if they were a single solute. In this case the first equality from above is modified with the mean molar mass M of the pseudosolute instead of the molar mass of the single solute:

:formula_37, formula_38

:formula_39, yi,j being ratios involving molalities of solutes i,j and the total molality bT.

The sum of products molalities - apparent molar volumes of solutes in their binary solutions equals the product between the sum of molalities of solutes and apparent molar volume in ternary or multicomponent solution.

:formula_40.

=== Relation to apparent molar properties and activity coefficients ===

For concentrated ionic solutions the activity coefficient of the electrolyte is split into electric and statistical components.

The statistical part includes molality b, hydration index number h, the number of ions from the dissociation and the ratio ra between the apparent molar volume of the electrolyte and the molar volume of water.

Concentrated solution statistical part of the activity coefficient is:
:formula_41.

== Molalities of a ternary or multicomponent solution ==
The molalities of solutes b1, b2 in a ternary solution obtained by mixing two binary aqueous solutions with different solutes (say a sugar and a salt or two different salts) are different than the initial molalities of the solutes bii in their binary solutions:

formula_42,

formula_43,

formula_44,

formula_45.

The content of solvent in mass fractions w01 and w02 from each solution of masses ms1 and ms2 to be mixed as a function of initial molalities is calculated. Then the amount (mol) of solute from each binary solution is divided by the sum of masses of water after mixing:

formula_46,

formula_47.

Mass fractions of each solute in the initial solutions w11 and w22
are expressed as a function of the initial molalities b11, b22:

formula_48,

formula_49.

These expressions of mass fractions are substituted in the final molalitaties:

formula_50,

formula_51.

The results for a ternary solution can be extended to a multicomponent solution (with more than two solutes).

=== From the molalities of the binary solutions ===

The molalities of the solutes in a ternary solution can be expressed also from molalities in the binary solutions and their masses:

formula_52,

formula_53.

The binary solution molalities are:

formula_44,

formula_45.

The masses of the solutes determined from the molalities of the solutes and the masses of water can be substituted in the expressions of the masses of solutions:

formula_56.

Similarly for the mass of the second solution:

formula_57.

One can obtain the masses of water present in the sum from the denominator of the molalities of the solutes in the ternary solutions as functions of binary molalities and masses of solution:

formula_58,

formula_59.

Thus the ternary molalities are:

formula_60,

formula_61.

For solutions with three or more solutes the denominator is a sum of the masses of solvent in the n binary solutions which are mixed:

formula_62,

formula_63,

formula_64.

An &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix is said to be a &quot;Monge array&quot; if, for all formula_1 such that

:formula_2

one obtains

:formula_3

So for any two rows and two columns of a Monge array (a 2 × 2 sub-matrix) the four elements at the intersection points have the property that the sum of the upper-left and lower right elements (across the main diagonal) is less than or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements (across the antidiagonal).

This matrix is a Monge array:
:formula_4

For example, take the intersection of rows 2 and 4 with columns 1 and 5.
The four elements are:
:formula_5

: 17 + 7 = 24
: 23 + 11 = 34

The sum of the upper-left and lower right elements is less than or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements.

==Properties==
*The above definition is equivalent to the statement
:A matrix is a Monge array if and only if formula_6 for all formula_7 and formula_8.

*Any subarray produced by selecting certain rows and columns from an original Monge array will itself be a Monge array.
*Any linear combination with non-negative coefficients of Monge arrays is itself a Monge array.
*Every Monge array is totally monotone, meaning that its row minima occur in a nondecreasing sequence of columns, and that the same property is true for every subarray. This property allows the row minima to be found quickly by using the SMAWK algorithm. If you mark with a circle the leftmost minimum of each row, you will discover that your circles march downward to the right; that is to say, if formula_9, then formula_10 for all formula_8. Symmetrically, if you mark the uppermost minimum of each column, your circles will march rightwards and downwards. The row and column &quot;maxima&quot; march in the opposite direction: upwards to the right and downwards to the left.
*The notion of &quot;weak Monge arrays&quot; has been proposed; a weak Monge array is a square &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix which satisfies the Monge property formula_12 only for all formula_13.
*Monge matrix is just another name for submodular function of two discrete variables. Precisely, &quot;A&quot; is a Monge matrix if and only if &quot;A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;] is a submodular function of variables &quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;.

==Applications==
Monge matrices has applications in combinatorial optimization problems:
*When the traveling salesman problem has a cost matrix which is a Monge matrix it can be solved in quadratic time.
*A square Monge matrix which is also symmetric about its main diagonal is called a &quot;Supnick matrix&quot; (after Fred Supnick). Any linear combination of Supnick matrices is itself a Supnick matrix, and when the cost matrix in a traveling salesman problem is Supnick, the optimal solution is a predetermined route, unaffected by the specific values within the matrix.

<text>Finnish mythology commonly refers of the folklore of Finnish paganism, of which a modern revival is practiced by a small percentage of the Finnish people. It has many shared features with Estonian and other Finnic mythologies, but also with neighbouring Baltic, Slavic and, to a lesser extent, Norse mythologies.

Finnish mythology survived within an oral tradition of mythical poem-singing and folklore well into the 19th century.

Of the animals, the most sacred was the bear, whose real name was never uttered out loud, which was thought to be unfavorable to the hunt. The bear (&quot;karhu&quot; in Finnish) was seen as the embodiment of the forefathers, and for this reason it was called by many circumlocutions: &quot;mesikämmen&quot; (&quot;mead-paw&quot;), &quot;otso&quot; (&quot;browed one&quot;), &quot;kontio&quot; (&quot;dweller of the land&quot;), &quot;metsän kultaomena&quot; (&quot;the golden apple of the forest&quot;). It was not strictly seen as a god.

==History of study==
The first historical mention of Finnish folk religion was by the bishop and Lutheran reformer Mikael Agricola (1510–1555) in the preface to his 1551 Finnish translation of the Psalms. Agricola supplied a list of purported deities of the Häme (in Swedish, Tavastia) and Karjala (Karelia). It detailed twelve deities in each region with their supposed functions briefly set out in verse form. (Some commentators state that only eleven deities were listed for Häme, not counting Agricola&#x27;s mention of &quot;Piru&quot;, the Devil). Due to the lists, Agricola is considered to be the father of the study of Finnish religious history and mythology. Later scholars and students commonly quoted Agricola&#x27;s lists as a historical source; only in the late eighteenth century did scholars begin to critically re-examine Agricola&#x27;s work, finding that most of the figures on his list were not gods, but local guardian spirits, figures from folk mythology or explanatory legends, cultural heroes, Christian saints under alternative names, and, in one case, a harvest-time festival.

Cristfried Ganander&#x27;s &quot;Mythologia Fennica&quot;, published in 1789, was the first truly scholarly foray into Finnish mythology. In the 19th century, research into Finnish folklore intensified. Scholars like Elias Lönnrot, J.F. Cajan, M.A. Castrén, and D.E.D. Europaeus travelled around Finland writing down folk poetry sung by runo (poem) singers, many of whom were &quot;tietäjät&quot; (traditional ritual specialists). The genres they collected included material like the &quot;synnyt&quot; (), which give mythical accounts of the origins of many natural phenomena. From this material Lönnrot edited the &quot;Kalevala&quot; as well as the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;. The wealth of folk poetry collected in the 19th century often deals with pre-Christian pagan themes, and has allowed scholars to study Finnish mythology in more detail.

==The origins and the structure of the world==
The world was believed to have been formed out of a bird&#x27;s egg or eggs. The species of the bird and the number of eggs varies between traditions. In the &quot;Kalevala&quot; the bird is a pochard that lays seven eggs (six of gold and one of iron). Examples from other stories include a swallow, a loon, and a mythical giant eagle, &quot;kokko&quot;. The sky was believed to be the upper cover of the egg; alternately it was seen as a tent, which was supported by a column at the north pole, below the north star.

The movement of the stars was explained to be caused by the sky-dome&#x27;s rotation around the North Star and itself. A great whirl was caused at the north pole by the rotation of a column of sky. Through this whirl, souls could exit the world to the land of dead, Tuonela.

Earth was believed to be flat. At the edges of Earth was , &quot;the home of the birds&quot;, a warm region in which birds lived during the winter. The Milky Way is called Linnunrata, &quot;the path of the birds&quot;, because the birds were believed to move along it to Lintukoto and back. In Modern Finnish usage, the word &quot;lintukoto&quot; means an imaginary happy, warm, and peaceful paradise-like place.

Birds also had other significance. Birds brought a human&#x27;s soul to the body at the moment of birth, and took it away at the moment of death. In some areas, it was necessary to have a wooden bird-figure nearby to prevent the soul from escaping during sleep. This , &quot;the soul-bird&quot;, protected the soul from being lost in the paths of dreams.

Waterfowl are very common in tales, and also in stone paintings and carvings, indicating their great significance in the beliefs of ancient Finns.

==Tuonela, the land of the dead==

Tuonela was the land of dead: an underground home or city for all dead people, without moral judgement. It was a dark and lifeless place, where everybody slept forever. A sufficiently brave shaman could travel to Tuonela in trance to ask for the forefathers&#x27; guidance. This required crossing the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, a boat would come to take them over. Many times, a shaman&#x27;s soul would have to trick the guards of Tuonela into thinking that they were actually dead.

==Ukko, the God of sky and thunder==
Ukko (&quot;old man&quot;) was a god of the sky, weather, and the crops. The Finnish word for thunder, &quot;ukkonen&quot; (little Ukko) or &quot;ukonilma&quot; (Ukko&#x27;s weather), is derived from his name. In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, he is also called &quot;ylijumala&quot; (overgod, Supreme God). He makes all his appearances in myths solely by natural effects.

Ukko&#x27;s origins are probably in Baltic Perkons and the older Finnish sky god Ilmarinen. While Ukko took Ilmarinen&#x27;s position as the Sky God, Ilmarinen&#x27;s destiny was to turn into a smith-hero, or the god of the rock. In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Ilmarinen is credited with forging the stars on the dome of the sky and the magic mill of plenty, the Sampo.

Ukko&#x27;s weapon was a hammer, axe or sword, by which he struck lightning. While Ukko and his wife Akka (&quot;old woman&quot;) mated, there was a thunderstorm. He created thunderstorms by riding his chariot over the clouds. The original weapon of Ukko was probably the boat-shaped stone axe of battle axe culture. Ukko&#x27;s hammer Vasara (lit. &quot;hammer&quot;) probably originally meant the same thing as the boat-shaped stone axe. When stone tools were abandoned in the metal ages, the origins of stone weapons became a mystery. They were believed to be weapons of Ukko left behind after a lightning strike. Shamans collected and held stone axes because they were believed to hold supernatural powers.

<doc id="229652" wikidata="Q1583548" url="?curid=229652" title="Lenovo System x">
<text>System x is a line of x86 servers produced by IBM, and later by Lenovo, as a sub-brand of IBM&#x27;s &quot;System&quot; brand, alongside IBM Power Systems, IBM System z and IBM System Storage. In addition, IBM System x was the main component of the IBM System Cluster 1350 solution.

In January 2014, IBM announced the sale of its x86 server business to Lenovo for $2.3 billion, in a sale completed October 1, 2014.

==History==
Starting out with the &quot;PS/2 Server&quot;, then the &quot;IBM PC Server&quot;, rebranded &quot;Netfinity&quot;, then &quot;eServer xSeries&quot; and finally System x, these servers are distinguished by being based on off-the-shelf x86 CPUs; IBM positioned them as their &quot;low end&quot; or &quot;entry&quot; offering compared to their POWER and Mainframe products.
Previously IBM servers based on AMD Opteron CPUs did not share the &quot;xSeries&quot; brand; instead they fell directly under the &quot;e&quot;Server umbrella. However, later AMD Opteron-based servers did fall under the System x brand.

==Predecessors==
===IBM PS/2 Server===

* IBM PS/2 Server 85 (Type 9585), 1992
* IBM PS/2 Server 95 (Types 8595, 9595, 9595A), 1990–1992
* IBM PS/2 Server 195, 1993
* IBM PS/2 Server 295, 1992

===IBM PC Server===

====PC Server range====
* IBM PC Server 300, 1994
* IBM PC Server 310 (PCI/ISA), 1996
* IBM PC Server 315 (PCI/ISA), 1996
* IBM PC Server 320 (PCI/EISA), 1996
* IBM PC Server 325 (PCI/EISA), 1996
* IBM PC Server 330 (PCI/EISA), 1997
* IBM PC Server 500 (MCA), 1994
* IBM PC Server 520 (PCI/EISA or PCI/MCA), 1995-1996
* IBM PC Server 704 (PCI/EISA), 1996
* IBM PC Server 720 (PCI/MCA), 1995-1996

====Numbering scheme====
* 300 range for high-volume, entry level servers
* 500 range for midrange
* 700 range for high-end.

===IBM Netfinity===

1998–2001 server line; Not to be confused with a software IBM product with a similar name, NetFinity (notice the capital F).

====Netfinity range====
* IBM Netfinity 1000
* IBM Netfinity 3000, 3500
* IBM Netfinity 4000R, 4500R
* IBM Netfinity 5000, 5100, 5500, 5500-M10, 5500-M20, 5600
* IBM Netfinity 6000R
* IBM Netfinity 7000, 7000-M10, 7100, 7600
* IBM Netfinity 8500R

====Numbering scheme====
The numbering scheme started off similar to that of the IBM PC Servers, but additional ranges were added, like the entry-level 1000 model later on. Models ending with an R, are rack-mount.

====KVM cabling scheme====
Some Netfinity servers used IBM&#x27;s C2T cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.

===IBM eServer===

====IBM eServer range====
IBM eServer was a marketing effort to put all of the diverse IBM server platforms under one header. The AS/400 became the IBM eServer iSeries, the RS/6000 became the IBM eServer pSeries, the S/390 mainframe became the IBM eServer zSeries and the Intel processor based IBM Netfinity servers became the IBM eServer xSeries.

A few exceptions were however made
* IBM eServer 325, 326, 326m
* IBM eServer BladeCenter, BladeCenter T, BladeCenter H, BladeCenter HT

=====Numbering scheme=====
For marketing reasons the AMD processor based e325, e326 and e326m and the BladeCenter which supports non-Intel processor products were not branded xSeries, but were instead placed directly under the eServer brand. The xSeries brand was limited to only Intel-based server products.

From a numbering perspective the AMD servers did fit into the xSeries range, under the similar x335 and x336 Intel processor products. These numbers were not re-used in the xSeries range to prevent confusion.

====IBM eServer xSeries====

While most servers used Intel x86 (IA32) processors, the x380, x382, x450 and x455 used the Intel Itanium (IA64) processor.

=====xSeries range=====
* IBM eServer xSeries 100, 130, 135, 150
* IBM eServer xSeries 200, 205, 206, 206m, 220, 225, 226, 230, 232, 235, 236, 240, 250, 255, 260
* IBM eServer xSeries 300, 305, 306, 306m, 330, 335, 336, 340, 342, 345, 346, 350, 360, 365, 366, 370, 380, 382
* IBM eServer xSeries 440, 445, 450, 455, 460

=====Numbering scheme=====
* 100 series are entry-level tower servers
* 200 series are tower servers
* 300 series are rack-mount servers
* 400 series are rack-mount scalable servers

=====KVM cabling scheme=====
Many xSeries servers used IBM&#x27;s C2T cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.

==System x==

===IBM System x range===

* IBM System x3105, x3100, x3100 M3, x3100 M4, x3100 M5
* IBM System x3200, x3200 M2, x3200 M3, x3250, x3250 M2, x3250 M3, x3250 M4, x3250 M5, x3250 M6
* IBM System x3300 M3, x3300 M4
* IBM System x3350
* IBM System x3400, x3400 M2, x3400 M3, x3450, x3455
* IBM System x3500, x3500 M2, x3500 M3, x3500 M4
* IBM System x3530 M3, x3530 M4
* IBM System x3550, x3550 M2, x3550 M3, x3550 M4, x3550 M5
* IBM System x3620 M3
* IBM System x3630 M3, x3630 M4
* IBM System x3650, x3650T, x3655, x3650 M2, x3650 M3, x3650 M4, x3650 M4 HD, x3650 M4 BD, 3650 M5
* IBM System x3690 X5
* IBM System x3750 M4
* IBM System x3755, x3755 M3
* IBM System x3800, x3850, x3850 M2, x3850 X5, x3850 X6
* IBM System x3950, x3950 M2, x3950 X5, x3950 X6

=== Lenovo System x range ===
These systems are effectively the same as the previous IBM branded models, but with a Lenovo badge.
* Lenovo System x3100 M5
* Lenovo System x3250 M5, x3250 M6
* Lenovo System x3500 M5
* Lenovo System x3550 M4, x3550 M5

* Lenovo System x3850 X6
* Lenovo System x3950 X6
* Lenovo NextScale
* Lenovo FlexSystem

Lenovo also had its own ThinkServer family of Intel servers. This family is technically less advanced than System x. At the time of this writing, System x is being discontinued and replaced by the Lenovo ThinkSystem family of Intel servers.

====Enterprise eX5 architecture====
====Enterprise X4 architecture====

====Numbering scheme====
2nd digit increments to show capability

3rd digit is a 0 for tower models, and 5 for rack-mount

4th digit is a 0 for Intel processors, and 5 for AMD Opteron.

Models with a T at the end are meant for Telco purposes.

==IBM iDataPlex==
IBM System x iDataPlex, introduced in 2008, was used by many TOP500 supercomputers (as part of IBM Intelligent Cluster), including SuperMUC, Yellowstone and Stampede. Other smaller installations included SciNet Consortium&#x27;s General Purpose Cluster

It is an unusual form-factor in that you have two columns of 19&quot; rack servers side-by-side in a single rack. This rack, unlike traditional racks, however was very shallow which is where the space saving came from for large installations. As such it only supports specially designed shallow servers. It was typically deployed in combination with a Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx) to cool the exhaust heat with water.

It was replaced with IBM NeXtScale in 2014.

===Components===
iDataPlex could be ordered as preconfigured rack tower (System x iDataPlex Rack with optional Rack management appliance), or as independent nodes.

====Rack====
iDataPlex 100U rack — compact dual rack ((1200x600mm footprint — instead of standard 1280x1050 (2x 42U rack))

====Chassis====
*System x iDataPlex 2U Flex chassis
*System x iDataPlex 3U Flex chassis — same as 2U with another coolers and additional storage.
Chassis also compatible with standard racks (with another rails).

====Nodes====
1U blade servers.
*System x iDataPlex dx320 — 20?
*System x iDataPlex dx340 — 20??
*System x iDataPlex dx360 M1 — 2008, 
*System x iDataPlex dx360 M2 — 2009, 
*System x iDataPlex dx360 M3 — 201?,
*System x iDataPlex dx360 M4 — 2013,

<text>Fielding Lewis Wright (May 16, 1895May 4, 1956) was an American politician who served as the 19th lieutenant governor and 49th and 50th governor of Mississippi. During the 1948 presidential election he served as the vice presidential nominee of the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party (Dixiecrats) alongside presidential nominee Strom Thurmond. During his political career he fought to maintain racial segregation, fighting with President Harry S. Truman over civil rights legislation, and holding other racist views.

Wright grew up in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, where he was educated and later attended Gardner–Webb University and the University of Alabama. During World War I he was sent to France as a captain. Wright served in the 149th Machine Gun Battalion and the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion before being honorably discharged in 1919. Following his service in the United States Army, he joined the Mississippi National Guard.

After entering politics in the 1920s, Wright was elected to the state legislature, where he served in the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Following the death of Speaker Horace Stansel, he rose to the speakership of the state House of Representatives. After a brief absence from politics, Wright was elected as Mississippi&#x27;s lieutenant governor and served until he ascended to the governorship following the death of Thomas L. Bailey on November 2, 1946. During his gubernatorial tenure he made efforts to maintain racial segregation and supported Senator Theodore G. Bilbo, a member of the Ku Klux Klan and segregationist, in his attempt to maintain his seat in the United States Senate.

Wright was elected to a term in his own right in the 1947 election. In his inaugural address, he voiced opposition to Truman&#x27;s support of civil rights and called for Southern Democrats to leave the Democratic Party. He served as a leader of the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party, declining offers to run for the presidential nomination, although he later accepted the vice-presidential nomination. In the presidential election, Thurmond and Wright won multiple Southern states, but failed to prevent Truman from winning the presidential election. Wright completed his gubernatorial term on January 22, 1952, and retired from public service. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the 1955 Mississippi gubernatorial election, and died on May 4, 1956.

==Early life and education==

Fielding Lewis Wright was born on May 16, 1895, in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, to Frances Foote Clements and Henry James Wright and was named after his uncle, Colonel Fielding Lewis. In 1901, he entered elementary school and graduated in 1911, as a member of the school&#x27;s second graduating class. Wright attended Gardner–Webb University and the University of Alabama, graduating with a law degree and was later admitted to the legal bar in September 1916. On July 16, 1917, he married Nan Kelly, with whom he had two children.

===Military===

In April 1918, Wright enlisted into the United States Army and was given the rank of private at Camp Shelby. He served as a member of the 149th Machine Gun Battalion inside the 38th Infantry Division. He later served as the commander of the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion. During World War I he participated in the battles of Belleau Wood and Château-Thierry before being honorably discharged on August 31, 1919. After leaving the army he organized a unit of the Mississippi National Guard in Rolling Fork and was selected to serve as its first captain where he would lead the unit through the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.

==Career==
===Local politics===

During the 1920s Wright served two terms on the Rolling Fork Board of Alderman. In 1927, he was elected to represent the Twentieth district in the state senate and served until 1932. In 1929 he authored a paved highway bill, but it was vetoed by Governor Theodore G. Bilbo due to disputes over the program&#x27;s implementation. In 1930, he was appointed to serve as the assistant director of the state tax commission to aid in the enforcement and administration of the tax laws.

===Mississippi House of Representatives===

In 1932, Wright was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1940. In 1932, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Committee on Highways and Highway Financing. In 1936, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Rules Committee and was also appointed onto the Levees committee and the Joint Committee on Executive Contingent Fund. On March 19, 1936, he introduced a resolution proposing a state constitutional amendment that would allow for the election of highway commission members starting in the 1938 elections, but the resolution failed. Facing opposition from House and statewide leadership for his highway reforms, he helped organize the removal of Speaker Thomas L. Bailey and his replacement by a fellow highway advocate, Horace Stansel. Stansel made Wright chairman of the House Rules Committee.

====Speaker of the House====

In February 1936, Speaker Stansel requested for Wright to be designated as the acting Speaker of the House and the request was accepted. On April 4, Stansel died from a heart attack while Wright was still serving as the acting Speaker and Wright participated in the planning of Stansel&#x27;s funeral.

From June 23 to 27, 1936, Governor Hugh L. White was outside of Mississippi to attend the Democratic national convention causing Lieutenant Governor Jacob Buehler Snider to become the acting governor. When Snider left the state, John Culkin, President pro tempore of the Senate, was elevated to acting governor. If Culkin had left the state the Speaker of the House would have become the acting governor, but Wright was not eligible as he was in an acting role. However, Culkin did not leave the state which prevented a constitutional crisis over the succession of acting governor.

On September 14, 1936, he was nominated by Pearl Stansel and the House of Representatives voted by acclamation, as he faced no opposition despite statements made by John Armstrong and Ira L. Morgan about being interested in running, to formally appoint Wright as the Speaker of the House.

After being appointed to the speakership Wright appointed Hilton Waits to replace him as the chairman of the House Rules committee and appointed R. E. Lee to replace him as the chairman of the Highways and Highway Financing House committee. Waits resigned shortly after being appointed as chairman of the House Rules Committee and Joe Owen was selected by Wright to replace him. Wright would continue to serve as Speaker of the House until 1940.

On March 24, 1938, the House of Representatives voted twenty-one to nineteen in favor of drafting articles of impeachment against Land Commissioner R. D. Moore. Wright appointed a five-man committee of Walter Sillers, John T. Armstrong, Gerald Chatham, Guy B. Mitchell, and Sam Lumpkin to draft the articles of impeachment. Moore criticized the committee as being &quot;stacked&quot; against his favor by Wright.

===Interlude===

Although it was speculated that Wright would run in the lieutenant gubernatorial election in 1939, he announced on July 19, 1938, that he would not seek another term in the House of Representatives and would not seek election to another office.

After leaving the state house he started working for the law firm of John Brunini and Sons in Rolling Fork. In 1942, he represented the Union Producing company at a House Ways and Means committee to argue for Mississippi to place flat taxes on oil producers rather than multiple severance and sales taxes. After the United States entered World War II Wright attempted to rejoin the army, but was rejected due to his poor eyesight.

===Lieutenant gubernatorial===

On November 19, 1942, Wright met with friends in Jackson, Mississippi, and stated that he would be a candidate in the lieutenant gubernatorial election. In January 1943, he formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant gubernatorial election. Walter D. Davis, a former member of the state House of Representatives and attorney in the Department of War, was appointed to serve as his campaign manager.

In the initial primary he won with a plurality of the vote ahead of Paul Spearman and Charles G. Hamilton, who were eliminated, and John Lumpkin, who would continue onto the runoff primary. Wright defeated Lumpkin in the runoff with 155,265 to 108,661 votes winning the Democratic nomination. In the general election he and gubernatorial nominee Thomas L. Bailey faced no opposition.

The state House and Senate passed a resolution allowing for Wright to be inaugurated one day before Bailey and Wright was inaugurated as the Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi on January 17, 1944. On March 21, 1944, he gave his first tie breaking vote, in which he voted in favor, when the state Senate voted nineteen in favor to nineteen against on a bill authorizing chancery clerks to use photostat machines in recording records. In April 1944, Wright became acting governor when Governor Bailey went to Kansas City to attend the Methodist general conference as one of Mississippi&#x27;s two delegates.

In 1946, he attempted to call another session of the state legislature to have the state&#x27;s election laws changed to prevent black voters from participating in the 1947 primaries. In June 1946, he refused to authorize the extradition of George Johnson, a black man facing charges of child abandonment, back to California and refused to commute the death sentence of James Leo Williams, a 25 year old black man convicted for murder, while serving as acting governor. On August 1, 1946, he was made aware of plans by the Department of Justice to investigate the activities of the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi. Wright claimed that he did not know of any activities conducted by the Ku Klux Klan and that the organization had not existed in the state since 1923.

===Gubernatorial===
====First term====

On October 30, 1946, Governor Bailey suffered a stroke and was in poor health for the next four days until he died from a spinal tumor on November 2. Wright was supposed to leave the state for a physical checkup, but remained in Mississippi due to Bailey&#x27;s poor health and succeeded him following his death to fulfill the remainder of his term as the 49th governor. On November 7, he was formally inaugurated by Chief Justice Sydney M. Smith without a ceremony.

The United States Senate, controlled by a Republican majority, refused to seat Senator Theodore G. Bilbo at the request of Senator Glen H. Taylor. Wright threatened to appoint Bilbo to serve as an interim senator if he was not allowed to be seated, for which the Harrison County affiliate of the Bilbo Campaign Committee passed a resolution praising Wright. The issue was resolved when it was proposed that Bilbo&#x27;s credentials remain on the table while he returned home to Mississippi to seek medical treatment for oral cancer. When Bilbo died on August 21, 1947, Wright stated that &quot;He was a long and faithful servant of the state. He was an outstanding official whose loss will be felt by Mississippi.&quot;

On May 20, the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, organized a walkout and strike to improve the wages of bus drivers working for Southern Trailways, the Mississippi affiliate of the Trailways Transportation System. On September 28, a man driving a carnival truck attempted to crash into two Trailway buses and later another driver attempted to crash a bus off a highway near Winona. On October 1, Wright threatened to place members of the Mississippi National Guard onboard every bus with orders to shoot to protect the buses. In November, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation was formed as a temporarily state police force to prevent further violence during the strike, although it was criticized as similar to the Gestapo and the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Hattiesburg passed a resolution calling it fascist, Wright successfully transformed it into a permanent police force.

====1947 election====

On January 25, 1947, Wright announced his intention to seek election to a term in his own right in the 1947 Mississippi gubernatorial election. Paul B. Johnson Jr., the son of former governor and representative Paul B. Johnson Sr., later announced his intention to challenge Wright in the Democratic primary. On June 12, he formally launched his campaign at a campaign rally in Rolling Fork where he showed his twenty-point platform which included support for veteran benefits, road improvements, sales tax exemptions, and stopping outside influence on Mississippi.

On August 5, he won the Democratic primary with over 55% of the popular vote and later received a letter of congratulations from Johnson, who had placed second in the primary. Wright&#x27;s first ballot victory was the second time in Mississippi history that the Democratic gubernatorial nominee won without a runoff being needed, with Theodore G. Bilbo&#x27;s 1915 victory being the first. In the general election he defeated former Nebraskan Governor George L. Sheldon, who ran on the ballot as an Independent Republican and who had stated that he had only expected to receive a few thousand votes against Wright.

====Second term====

On January 20, 1948, Wright was inaugurated as the 50th Governor of Mississippi by Chief Justice Sydney M. Smith. In his inaugural address he called for Southern Democrats to abandon the Democratic Party due to the Fair Employment Practice Committee, and anti-poll tax, anti-lynching, and pro-civil rights measures. He also criticized President Harry S. Truman for his committee on civil rights and support for other &quot;anti-southern&quot; legislation.

His speech and call for Southern Democrats to leave the party was praised by Senator James Eastland and Representatives John Bell Williams and Jamie Whitten who stated that they had been ignored by the party&#x27;s leadership and should not allow the region&#x27;s racial beliefs to be undermined. However, Senators Allen J. Ellender and Claude Pepper, Representative William Madison Whittington, Governor Benjamin Travis Laney, and Alabama Democratic Chairman Gessner T. McCorvey criticized him stating that they should remain in the party to reform it from the inside. On January 21, the state house and senate approved resolutions supporting threats to leave the party if more &quot;anti-southern&quot; legislation was passed.

In April, the state legislature passed the first workers&#x27; compensation bill in Mississippi history and it was later signed into law by Wright. Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach praised the passage of the bill as Mississippi was the last of the then forty-eight states to pass a workers&#x27; compensation bill.

On July 8, Lycurgus Spinks, who had run in the 1947 Democratic gubernatorial primary and was an Imperial Emperor of the United Klans of America, filed a $50,000 lawsuit against Wright claiming that Wright, W.W. Wright, and George Godwin had convinced John L. Dagget to cancel a contract he had with Spinks. On January 11, 1949, Spinks&#x27; lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Sidney Carr Mize of the Southern District Court of Mississippi, but Spinks refiled his lawsuit. On June 29, Spinks removed Wright from his lawsuit, but continued his lawsuit against W. W. Wright and George Godwin.

On September 7, Wright declared a state of emergency as Mississippi had suffered its second highest number of polio cases in its history during 1949.

====Segregation====

In February 1948, a &quot;State-wide Mass Meeting of Negro citizens&quot; organized in Jackson, Mississippi, and called for a biracial committee to oversee the educational improvement project that was started in 1946, but Wright declined their request.

Due to federal threats to force the integration of schools Wright reorganized Mississippi&#x27;s public education system in an attempt to maintain racial segregation. Education funding towards black schools was increased, but still remained inferior to the funding given to white-only schools. In 1951, he opposed attempts by the NAACP to admit black students into white-only colleges and stated that he would &quot;insist on (racial) segregation regardless of the costs or consequences&quot;. At the Southern Governors Conference Wright stated that &quot;regardless of what others may say, we in Mississippi are determined that the segregated educational system shall be maintained.&quot;

===1948 presidential election===
====Democratic====

Wright&#x27;s inaugural address calling for Southerners to abandon the Democratic Party was supported by Senator James Eastland, who was later invited to speak before the state legislature. On January 29, 1948, Senator Eastland gave a speech to a joint session of the Mississippi state legislature where he called for the Solid South to withhold its 127 electoral votes from the Democratic presidential nominee so that &quot;a Southern man would emerge as president of the United States&quot;.

In February, Wright attended the Southern Governors&#x27; Association conference with plans to introduce a resolution calling for the creation of a new Southern party. However, Georgia Governor Melvin E. Thompson gave Wright a copy of a statement condemning his call although Wright stated that he would still introduce his resolution. Alabama Governor Jim Folsom, Maryland Governor William Preston Lane Jr., and Florida Governor Millard Caldwell also criticized Wright while South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond and Texas Governor Beauford H. Jester declined to comment. When he proposed his resolution it was rejected by the eight other governors present and a different resolution calling for a committee to study the effects of recently proposed civil rights legislation was accepted. Although Wright&#x27;s resolution was unsuccessful another resolution proposed by Thurmond calling for the Truman administration to stop attacking white supremacy or the Southern Democrats would leave the party.

After his failure at the Southern Governors&#x27; Association conference Wright went to Little Rock, Arkansas to meet with political leaders. While there almost four hundred Arkansas political leaders voted unanimously in favor of a resolution supporting Wright and in Virginia Governor William M. Tuck called for the state legislature to prevent Truman from appearing on the ballot. On March 13, another Southern governor meeting was held where a resolution against civil rights and the party&#x27;s leadership was supported by the governors of South Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, and Florida while the governors of North Carolina and Louisiana were not at the meeting and the governor of Maryland voted &quot;present&quot;.

The Anti-Truman Democratic Club of Florida, which controlled twenty-eight of Florida&#x27;s delegates to the national convention, formed a presidential draft movement supporting Wright. The organization also passed a resolution where it would support South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond or Arkansas Governor Benjamin Travis Laney if Wright did not run for the presidency. After being informed of the movement Wright stated that he was not interested in running for president. Former Alabama Governor Frank M. Dixon attempted to start another draft movement for Wright, but Wright declined to run for president again.

On May 10, the States&#x27; Rights Democrats conference was held in Jackson, Mississippi, with Wright serving as temporary chairman. The conference was attended by around 2,500 people and a resolution calling for a separate national convention in Birmingham was passed.

On May 25, Wright was elected to serve as one of Sharkey County&#x27;s eight delegates to Mississippi&#x27;s state Democratic convention. On June 23, he was selected to serve as one of the delegates to the national convention.

====Dixiecrat====
Wright and former Governor Hugh L. White led the twenty-two member Mississippi delegation to the Democratic National Convention. At the national convention he and the Mississippi delegation supported Governor Laney for the presidential nomination. An attempt was made by Charles Hamilton to prevent the seating of the Mississippi delegation due to its pledge to leave the party if Truman was nominated or if the platform was pro-civil rights. However, the Credentials Committee voted fifteen to eleven in favor of seating Wright&#x27;s delegation.
On July 14, he led the Mississippi delegation in a walkout of the convention to protest the adoption of a pro-civil rights plank into the party&#x27;s platform. On July 17, the Conference of States&#x27; Rights Democrats in Birmingham, Alabama suggested him as a candidate for the vice presidential nomination of the breakaway States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party and he later accepted the nomination on August 11.

During the election Wright, a supporter of racial segregation, stated that &quot;if any of you [African Americans] have become so deluded as to want to enter our white schools, patronize our hotels and cafes, enjoy social equality with the whites, then true kindness and sympathy requires me to advise you to make your homes in some other state.&quot;

In the general election he and South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond won the popular and electoral votes of the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, and received one faithless electoral vote from Tennessee. Although the party won multiple states it was unsuccessful in its goal of preventing Truman from winning the election as he still managed to defeat Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey without the unanimous support of the Solid South.

The failure to spoil the election against Truman was credited to the Dixiecrats being a third party within the United States&#x27; two-party system, the Republicans&#x27; campaign against Truman in which Dewey did not criticize Truman for his administration&#x27;s scandals, the Progressive presidential nominee Henry A. Wallace focusing on an idealistic foreign policy, remaining support of the New Deal, labor issues voters against the Taft–Hartley Act, and farm issue voters. In 1950, Truman invited every governor from the South to a luncheon, except for Wright and Thurmond, as Truman stated that invitations were given to Democrats only. Wright continued to defend states&#x27; rights and segregation, but conceded that complete obstinance along the lines of the 1948 departure from the Democratic Party would cause Mississippi to lose &quot;its standing with everybody in America.&quot;

==Later life==

Upon leaving gubernatorial office, Wright opened a law practice in Jackson. In 1952, he was selected to serve as Mississippi&#x27;s national committeeman to the Democratic National Committee for a four-year term. During the 1952 presidential election he supported the Democratic presidential ticket of Governor Adlai Stevenson II and Senator John Sparkman and stated that he would not support the Republican presidential ticket of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Senator Richard Nixon.

On October 2, 1954, Wright announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for governor and he selected Gordon Roach, an attorney who had served as Pike County attorney, as his campaign manager. On May 5, 1955, he formally launched his campaign at his home in Rolling Fork with around 3,500 people in attendance. Hoping to build off of white discontent with the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling mandating desegregation in public schools, Wright framed himself as an ardent segregationist. He argued that his involvement in the Dixiecrat foray made him &quot;the man most feared by Negro
leaders who seek to integrate the schools&quot; and pledged to use Mississippi&#x27;s police power to prevent such integration. Though the media reported his chances favorably, Wright placed third in the Democratic primary behind James P. Coleman and Paul B. Johnson Jr., surprising many observers and preventing him from participating in the primary runoff. He thereafter returned to practicing law and Coleman went on to be elected governor.

===Death and legacy===

On May 4, 1956, Wright suffered a heart attack and died forty minutes later at his home in Jackson, Mississippi. Following his death, his son Fielding Wright Jr. was selected to succeed him as the president of the United Cerebral Palsy of Mississippi, Incorporated, a cerebral palsy humanitarian organization. His funeral was held on May 6, and was attended by Senator Strom Thurmond, state senator R. M. Kennedy, Mississippi Governor James P. Coleman, Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Carroll Gartin, and Mississippi Secretary of State Heber Ladner. Thurmond stated that his death was &quot;a tremendous loss to the South and to the nation&quot;. Most state newspaper obituaries focused on his participation in the 1948 Dixiecrat movement and his staunch segregationist pledges in the 1955 gubernatorial race. He was buried at Kelly Cemetery in Rolling Fork.

On November 17, 1960, a section of U.S. Route 61 inside Mississippi was designated as the Fielding L. Wright Memorial Highway. An art center at the Delta State University and a science complex in the Mississippi Valley State University were named after him.

In 1990, former Arkansas Governor Sid McMath stated that Wright and Thurmond&#x27;s nominations were &quot;a racist thing&quot; as &quot;they were against Truman because of his attitude toward race and fair employment and these other things that finally became a matter of course later on, this social legislation.&quot; Historian James Patterson Smith wrote that 
Wright&#x27;s association with the Dixiecrat movement &quot;built the profoundly negative image that has long obscured his substantial achievements as a progressive legislator&quot;. His personal papers were destroyed in a fire shortly after he left office, and he has generally been ignored in historiography or dismissed as a reactionary.

<text>Hugh Lawson White (August 19, 1881September 20, 1965) was an American politician from Mississippi and a member of the Democratic Party. He served two non-consecutive terms as the governor of Mississippi (1936–1940, 1952–1956).

==Early life==
White was born near McComb, Mississippi. He attended Soule&#x27;s Business College, at St. Thomas’ Hall, graduating in 1898. He then attended the University of Mississippi. While at Mississippi, he was a member of the Fraternity of Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall).

== Career ==
White was an industrialist and owned J.J. White Lumber Company.

== Politics ==
White was mayor of Columbia from 1926 to 1936. He convinced the Reliance Manufacturing Company to open a plant in Columbia, helping his community survive the Great Depression.

He was first elected to the governorship in November 1935, and his term started in January 1936. He established the Balance Agriculture With Industry (BAWI) program that sought to develop an industrial base that matched the state&#x27;s agricultural base. Under BAWI, advertising and incentives were deployed in hopes of enticing industries to locate to the state. Local governments could issue bonds to construct factories that could be leased to companies (which were also offered tax breaks). He also increased the number of paved roads in the state.

After leaving office due to term limits, White was a delegate representing Mississippi at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. When Mayor of Minneapolis Hubert Humphrey urged the Democratic Party to &quot;get out of the shadow of states&#x27; rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights&quot;, White and the other delegates from Mississippi and Alabama walked out of the convention. White and these delegates formed the Dixiecrat Party, nominating Strom Thurmond for president.

In 1951, White won a second term, during which the issue of school segregation was a main issue. During the 1940s and early 1950s, federal courts made a series of decisions that indicated that the notion of &quot;separate but equal&quot; schools would soon be declared unconstitutional. Governor White and the state legislature prepared for that possibility by creating plans that sought to improve black schools. Among the proposals were increasing black teacher salaries to match white teachers&#x27; and building black schools on par with white schools. White called one hundred of the state&#x27;s black leaders to a meeting at the capital to ask for their support of the plan. Much to his surprise, they overwhelmingly rejected his &quot;voluntary&quot; segregation plan and instead stated that they wanted only an integrated school system. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court made the famous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision that declared the practice of &quot;separate but equal&quot; to be unconstitutional. On August 28, 1955, towards the end of White&#x27;s term as governor, the infamous lynching of Emmett Till took place. Three months earlier, an African American minister, George W. Lee, had been shot and killed in Mississippi as well. When the story of Till&#x27;s death broke, White decried the violence against Till and promised a full investigation of his murder.

==Tributes==
Hugh White State Park, a Mississippi state park, is named for him. The Keys Hill Historic District, Broad Street, Columbia, was added to the National Register of Historic Places, including White&#x27;s former home, the Hugh Lawson White Mansion, for its association with him.

== Personal ==

White married Judith Wier Sugg. His Spanish revival mansion in Marion County was built between 1925 and 1927 by Claude L. Lindley, a Jackson, Mississippi architect. His property included a formal, sunken Italian garden.

He retired from politics after his term ended in 1956. White died on September 19, 1965, and was buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in McComb, Mississippi.

<text>Anselm Joseph McLaurin (March 26, 1848 – December 22, 1909) was the 34th Governor of Mississippi, serving from 1896 to 1900.

==Life and career==
McLaurin was born on March 26, 1848, in Brandon, Mississippi, the son of Ellen Caroline (née Tullus) and Lauchlin McLaurin III. He married Laura Elvira Rauch and had a daughter, Stella May McLaurin.

He became district attorney at age 21 and was described as &quot;one of the foremost lawyers in the State&quot;. He participated in the convention for the writing of the Mississippi Constitution in 1890 and was described as a free-coinage man. A Democrat, as were most whites in the South through the mid-twentieth century, McLaurin was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate, serving from 1894 to 1895.

He was the first Governor of Mississippi to be elected under the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, which disenfranchised most blacks by raising barriers to voter registration. These changes essentially ended the competitiveness of the Republican Party in the state and severely weakened the Populist Party. The last Confederate veteran elected as governor, McLaurin won the 1895 election, defeating Populist Frank Burkitt. He served from 1896 to 1900.

At Hazlehurst in 1898, McLaurin explained in a speech that one of the causes of the depleted state treasury was inadequate taxation of the railroad corporations.

In October 1898, McLaurin traveled by train to Forest, Mississippi, after white rioting in nearby Harperville. Blacks had resisted the arrest of one of their community, killing one white man. A mob of whites quickly gathered, killing nine blacks by the next day. The county sheriff and a posse arrested some blacks, while the white lynch mob continued to kill blacks on sight. The &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot; said that 11 black men were killed and one white. The sheriff took several black men under armed guard to Meridian, Mississippi, to protect them from the white mobs in Forest.

McLaurin returned to the U.S. Senate in 1901 after being elected by the state legislature to that seat in 1900; he was re-elected on January 19, 1904.

He died of heart disease at age 61 on December 22, 1909, at his home in Brandon, Mississippi. He was sitting in a rocking chair in front of his fireplace.

==Legacy==
A great-great-grandson of McLaurin was actor and comedian Robin Williams, who was given McLaurin as his middle name.

<doc id="229656" wikidata="Q168482" url="?curid=229656" title="Santiago Calatrava">
<text>Santiago Calatrava Valls (born 28 July 1951) is a Spanish-Swiss architect, structural engineer, sculptor and painter, particularly known for his bridges supported by single leaning pylons, and his railway stations, stadiums, and museums, whose sculptural forms often resemble living organisms. His best-known works include the Olympic Sports Complex of Athens, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Turning Torso tower in Malmö, Sweden, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York City, the Auditorio de Tenerife in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge in Dallas, Texas, and his largest project, the City of Arts and Sciences and Opera House in his birthplace, Valencia. His architectural firm has offices in New York City, Doha, and Zurich.

==Early life==
Calatrava was born on 28 July 1951, in Benimàmet, an old municipality now part of Valencia, Spain. His Calatrava surname was an old aristocratic one from medieval times, and was once associated with an order of knights in Spain. He had his primary and secondary schooling in Valencia, and, beginning in 1957, studied drawing and painting at the School of Applied Art. In 1964, as the regime of General Francisco Franco relaxed and Spain became more open to the rest of Europe, he went to France as an exchange student. In 1968, after completing secondary school, he went to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, but he arrived in the midst of student uprisings and turmoil in Paris, and returned home. Back in Valencia, he discovered a book about the architecture of Le Corbusier, which persuaded him that he could be both an artist and an architect. He enrolled in the Higher School of Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. He received his diploma as an architect and then did higher studies in urbanism. At the university he completed independent projects with fellow students, publishing two books on the vernacular architecture of Valencia and Ibiza.

In 1975, he enrolled in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland for a second degree in civil engineering. In 1981, he was awarded a doctorate in the department of architecture, after completing his thesis on &quot;The Pliability of three-dimensional structures.&quot; Speaking of this period, Calatrava told biographer Philip Jodidio:&quot;The desire to start all over at zero was very strong in me. I was fascinated by the concept of gravity and convinced that it was necessary to begin work with simple forms.&quot; Calatrava explained that he was particularly influenced by the work of the early 20th century Swiss engineer Robert Maillart (1872–1940), which taught him that, &quot;with an adequate combination of force and mass, you can create emotion.&quot;

==First projects and international attention==

As soon as Calatrava completed his doctorate in 1981, he opened his own office in Zurich. He designed an exposition hall, a factory, a library, and two bridges, but none were built, Finally in 1983, he began to receive commissions for industrial and transportation structures of increasingly greater size; he designed and built the &quot;Entrepôt Jakem&quot;, a warehouse in Münchwilen, Thurgau, Switzerland, another warehouse in Coesfeld-Lette, Germany, an addition to the main post office in Lucerne, Switzerland; a bus shelter in Saint-Gall, Switzerland (1983–85) the roof of a school in Wohlen, Switzerland (1983–88), and then some major projects; a new hall for the railway station in Lucerne (1983–89) and then an entire train station, the Zürich Stadelhofen railway station in Switzerland (1983–1990). The train station has several of the features that became signatures of his work; straight lines and right angles are rare. The railroad platforms curve, the supporting columns lean, the concrete walls of the modernistic cavern beneath the tracks are everywhere pierced with teardrop shaped skylights, and tilting glass panels provide light and shelter without enclosing the platforms.

In 1984–87, he built his first bridge, the Bac de Roda Bridge in Barcelona, Spain, which for the first time brought him international notice. The bridge, designed for cyclists and pedestrians, connects two parts of the city by crossing a wasteland of railway tracks. It is long, with twin arches which lean at an angle of thirty degrees; a feature which quickly became the stylistic signature of Calatrava. The upper portion of the bridge, composed of steel arches and cables, is light and airy, like a network of lace, anchored to the massive concrete supports and granite pillars below.

His next bridge, the Puente del Alamillo (1987–1992), in Seville, Spain, was even more spectacular and cemented his reputation. Built as part of the 1992 Expo 92, it is long, crossing the Meandro San Jeronimo River. Its main feature is a single pylon high, leaning to 58 degrees, the same angle as the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. The weight of the concrete of the pylon is sufficient to hold up the bridge with just thirteen pairs of cables, eliminating the need for any cables behind it.

==Projects of the 1990s==

At the beginning of the 1990s, Calatrava built several remarkable railway stations and bridges, but broadened his portfolio by designing a wider range of structures, including a Canadian shopping center, a new passenger terminal for Bilbao airport, and his first building in the United States, the new structure of the Milwaukee Art Museum. In 1992, he completed one of his most picturesque and sculptural works, the Montjuïc Communications Tower in Barcelona (1989–92), a -high graceful concrete spire designed for the site of the 1992 Olympics. The concrete pylon leans backwards, and seems to grasp the vertical broadcast antennas. Its form suggests an athlete about to throw a javelin. The circular building at the base of the tower, which contains the broadcast equipment, is clad in white bricks and is equipped with metal resembling an eye which opens and closes. The building has a particularly Catalan touch, borrowed from the park benches of Park Güell of Antonio Gaudi: a decoration of colorful ceramics tiles. The square next to it is laid out like a giant sundial, on which the tower casts its shadow. In 1992, he also finished his first North American project, the Allen Lambert Galleria in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The interior of the shopping mall is covered by a glass roof supported by columns like gigantic trees, a modern version of the Belle Epoque Les Halles market in Paris.

===Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry (1989–1994) and the Eastern Train Station in Lisbon (1992–98)===
Two years later, in 1994, he completed another notable train station, the Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry (1989–1994) at the Lyon airport in Satolas. This building was designed to be both a functional link between the airport and train station, the terminal for the high-speed TGV trains, and a symbol of the Rhone-Alps Region. The station is covered by a giant shell of steel and glass, , suspended at a maximum height of , and weighing . It is connected with the airport terminal by a long glass and concrete bridge. The glass and steel sides and skylights of the terminal from the inside resemble a modernistic cathedral; the glass panels at the top are intended to suggest flight. From the outside, the station has been said to resemble a prehistoric animal, while the glass-and-steel bridge has been compared to a bird or a manta ray.

The Gare do Oriente, or eastern train station, was constructed for the 1998 Lisbon World Exposition, and is located in a former industrial area. It was designed to bridge the wasteland which separated the residential area of the city from the Tagus River. Similar to the galleria he designed in Toronto, but on a grander scale, the interior of the station features a forest of white columns like gigantic trees that support the glass roof, , which covers the eight tracks. The station complex also includes a shopping center, and transport links by tram and metro to the center of the city. With its multiple arches and curves, the structure appears to be moving and ready to take off.

===Bilbao Airport (1990–2000)===
One of his last projects in the 20th century was the Bilbao Airport in Spain, notable both for its unusual control tower, high – made of concrete clad with aluminum, which widens as it grows taller, and which resembles a statue holding its hands in front of it – and for terminal buildings, where the white concrete structures are united with aluminum forms. The terminal buildings themselves lift upwards and seem to be trying to take off, giving them the airport the popular nickname of &quot;The Dove&quot;.

==Museums, concert halls and skyscrapers (2000–2010)==

Following 2000, Calatrava completed a new addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum, a concert hall in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, a twisting skyscraper in Malmö, Sweden, and a City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, Spain. in Sweden, and a wooden castle-like winery in Spain, all in astonishing forms and all seemingly in motion.

===Milwaukee Art Museum (1994–2001)===
The Quadracci Pavilion of the Milwaukee Art Museum (1994–2001) was Calatrava&#x27;s first building in the United States, and his first museum. It displayed the technical innovations and forms he had first used in his railway stations and airports, but with more freedom of form and architectural theatrics. It is an addition to an existing building, constructed by Eero Saarinen in 1957 next to Lake Michigan, with a later addition in 1975 by David Kahler. The purpose of the new pavilion, as defined by the museum board, was to give the museum a new entrance, and especially &quot;to redefine the identity of the museum with a strong image.&quot; Calatrava&#x27;s design was selected after a competition entered by seventy-seven architects. Calatrava&#x27;s solution was a glass and steel entry hall high with a moveable sun screen roof, composed of two large wings made up of twenty-six smaller wings, from in length. The sunscreen, weighing , can be hoisted up by a single pylon, like an enormous bird&#x27;s wing, or lowered when the wind from the lake is stronger than . The interior of the structure has a conference hall, exposition space, shops, and a restaurant overlooking the lake. He also designed a suspension footbridge between the center of the city and edge of the lake.

===Bodegas Ysios winery (1998–2001)===
The Bodegas Ysios winery in Laguardia, Spain (1998–2001) was designed as a symbol of the Rioja wines made by that winery. Built on a sloping site surrounded by vineyards, the long building has an aluminum roof and a facade covered with laminated wood panels, alternating between convex and concave, with a roofline that ripples like a series of waves.

===Auditorio de Tenerife (1991–2003)===
The Auditorio de Tenerife, Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, is a concert hall with 1558 seats and a smaller chamber music hall of 428 seats. With a curving concrete cupola high, crowned by a curving roof like a breaking wave, it dominates the city square and old town below. The shell is covered with ceramic tiles and the pavement and most of the floors are made of the local basalt stone. The unusual sculptural form of the building gives it a completely different appearance depending upon from where it is viewed. 

===Turning Torso (1999–2004)===
The Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, was Calatrava&#x27;s first skyscraper, and was the first twisting skyscraper, a form which later appeared in other cities around the world from Shanghai to Moscow. The building was originally conceived by the architect as a sculpture of &quot;seven cubes stacked on a steel support creating a spiral structure resembling a twisting spinal column.&quot; The tower is high, and twists a full ninety degrees from the base to the top. Each of the nine cubes cube is like a separate five-story building; each floor contains from one to five apartments. The support holding the structure together is the column of elevators and escalators which communicate between the cubes. A system of discreet cross beams on the exterior frame manage the torsion of the twisting building. In 2016, it was the tallest building in Scandinavia.

===Athens Olympic Sports Complex (2001–2004)===
For the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, Calatrava won the commission to cover the existing stadium with a new roof, to make a similar roof for the velodrome, and additionally to build four entrance gateways, a monumental sculpture to symbolize the games, and other architectural features to give harmony and variety to the complex. The roof for the stadium, in the form of bent &quot;leaves&quot; of laminated glass, is designed to reflect 90 percent of the sunlight. The roof covers , and is supported by double-tied arches of tubular steel, with a span of and a height of . It is long and high, suspended by cables from two parabolic arches. The Velodrome has a white cap supported by two concrete arches high, weighing , from which the glass and steel roof is suspended. Calatrava also designed an enormous parabolic arch at the entrance and the Wall of Nations, a mobile sculpture of tubular steel which moves in a wavelike patterns.

===City of Arts and Sciences and Opera House in Valencia (1991–2006)===
The largest group of buildings by Calatrava is found in his birthplace, Valencia, Spain, and was built in over a decade. It includes the City of Arts and Sciences (1991–2000) and the Opera house (1996–2006), all constructed on a plot of 35 hectares between a highway and a river on the east side of the city. The L&#x27;Hemisfèric, like a half-sunken globe, is placed in the centre, next to a large artificial lake, in which it seems to be sinking. The dome is covered by a metal screen which opens and closes, and the entrance opens like a human eye. On one side is the science museum, behind a line of leaning columns, and on the other is the newest structure, the massive shell of the opera house, described by Calatrava as a &quot;monumental sculpture&quot;, which gives the impression of being continually in motion.

===Liège-Guillemins railway station (2009)===
The Liège-Guillemins railway station for high-speed trains in Liège, Belgium is covered with a lace-like roof of glass and steel long and high, covering the nine tracks and five platforms. The transparent roof seems to eliminate the distinction between indoors and outdoors.

== Recent major projects (2011–) ==
===Oviedo Conference Center (2000–2011)===
The conference center and exposition hall in the Spanish city of Oviedo combines two office buildings and a hotel, covered with horizontal bands of glass and steel and perched upon curving concrete pylons, with elliptical conference center, which includes a main theater, exposition hall and seminar rooms. The Center include another signature feature of Calatrava&#x27;s work; a sunscreen that was supposed to be able to fold and unfold, but was never functional. The ceiling of the concert hall is an ascending series of arcs, which echo the curving rows of seats.

===Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge (2007–2012) and Peace Bridge (2008–2012)===
Calatrava constructed a series of extraordinary bridges, the type of structure which originally brought him global attention, for cities around the world that wanted a symbol of modernity and daring. Among the largest and dramatic are three bridges over the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The first of these was the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, opened for traffic in March 2012. The bridge, carrying six lanes of traffic, is long, with the appearance of being suspended from an arc-shaped tubular steel pylon forty stories or high by fifty-eight cables, ranging in length from . In form, the bridge resembles one of three bridges constructed in 2005–2005 on the Autostrada A1 in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Work on the second bridge, the Margaret McDermott Bridge, began in 2011.

The Peace Bridge in Calgary, Canada, built between 2008 and 2012, is a completely different bridge in purpose, scale and design. Built across the Bow River, and designed for pedestrians and cyclists, it is a glass and stew-wrapped tube long. It appears extraordinary long for a bridge with no towers or pylons to hold it up. Calatrava described the form in his own particular engineering vocabulary as &quot;defined by a helicoidal movement, with an ovoid cross section, with two clearly materialized tangential lanes expressing an internal architectural volume.&quot; 

===Florida Polytechnic University (2009–2014)===
The project for the new Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland, Florida (2009–2014) gave Calatrava the opportunity to design an entire campus in a unified style. The site covers of land which once contained phosphorus mines, many of which have been filled with water creating small lakes.Calatrava&#x27;s plan combined several small lakes into a central lake, which serves as a setting for the central structure, the Innovation, Science, and Technology (IST) building. The eye-shaped central building has an area of 200,000 square feet on two floors, and contains all the classrooms, faculty offices laboratories and public spaces until the other buildings are completed. The building has several signature Calatrava features, including an extendable sun scene on the roof, which entirely changes the appearance of the building when deployed, and whose form changes gradually as the sun moves. The terraces of the building are covered by a curving pergola, or screen, of steel, which reduces the direct sunlight by thirty percent. Inside, the corridors and central courtyard are lit by the central skylight. Plans for the building call for the installation of of solar panels on the sunscreen to provide energy for the building. The library of the university is also distinctive; it does not have a single book; all the collection is digitized.

The structure has been called by some journalists a response to the criticism of the high price and technical flaws of some of Calatrava&#x27;s earlier buildings. The review in &quot;&quot; magazine, the journal of the American Institute of Architects, reported: &quot;The building is full of handsome and even some very impressive spaces, but none of the singularly breathtaking ones that have made Calatrava, despite his price tag, so attractive to clients looking for marketing splash to go with their museum wing or train station. It reflects serious attention to detail and the bottom line; this is the work of an architect actively trying to prove, or at least re-emphasize, his bona fides.&quot;

===Museum of Tomorrow, Rio de Janeiro (2010–2015)===
The Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which opened in December 2015, is part of the redevelopment of the waterfront of Rio de Janeiro, and opened in time for the 2016 Summer Olympics in that city. The building is sited on a plaza next to the harbor, and surrounded by reflecting pools. The building is cantilevered over the plaza, and toward the sea. and gives the impression that it is floating on the water. Calatrava wrote, &quot;The idea is that the building feels ethereal, almost floating on the sea, like a ship, a bird or a plant.&quot; The roof is equipped with moveable screens that adjust to the movements of the sun. The interior design is what Calatrava calls &quot;archetypal&quot; and simplified, to allow for exhibits in a greater variety of forms and sizes.

The museum also includes a number of ecological features; water from the sea is used to regulate the temperature inside the building, and to refill the surrounding reflecting pools. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;an other-worldly edifice that looks like a cross between a solar-powered dinosaur and a giant air conditioning unit&quot;, and declared &quot;it must already rank as one of the world&#x27;s most extraordinary buildings.&quot;

===WTC Hub, New York City (2003–2016)===
Calatrava designed the WTC Transportation Hub in New York City at the rebuilt World Trade Center at the site of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The new station connects the regional trains of the new PATH with the subway and other local transportation, and also has a large retail mall, replacing commercial space destroyed in the attack. The above-ground &quot;oculus&quot; of the station, made of glass and steel, is oval-shaped, and is long and high. According to Calatrava, it resembles &quot;a bird flying from the hands of a child&quot;. The &quot;Wings&quot; of the above-ground structure were originally designed to move upward to a maximum height of to form a double screen high, but this feature had to be dropped to meet new security standards. The main hall of the station is underground, and the tracks of the PATH system on another level below. The underground station was originally designed so that its roof would open entirely in good weather, but this feature also had to be dropped due to its cost and space limitations.

The WTC Hub has been controversial because of its cost (4 billion dollars, twice the original estimate, and the most expensive railway station ever built) and its delays (seven years on 3 March 2016, seven years behind schedule). More than $1 billion of its cost went to administrative expenses and the decision to build around the 1 train of the New York City Subway. Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, praised the soaring upward view inside the Oculus, but condemned the building&#x27;s cost, &quot;scale, monotony of materials and color, preening formalism and disregard for the gritty urban fabric.&quot;

==Controversy and criticism==
After years of praise and commendation, in 2013 some of Calatrava&#x27;s projects began to draw criticism on the grounds of their cost, delays, and functional problems. Many of these criticisms were packaged together in an article by Suzanne Daley in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on 13 September 2013, entitled &quot;Santiago Calatrava collects critics as well as fans.&quot;

Daley wrote: &quot;...in numerous interviews, other architects, academics and builders say that Mr. Calatrava is amassing an unusually long list of projects marred by cost overruns, delays and litigation. It is hard to find a Calatrava project that has not been significantly over budget. And complaints abound that he is indifferent to the needs of his clients. In 2013 a Dutch councillor in Haarlemmermeer, near Amsterdam, urged his colleagues to take legal action because the three bridges the architect designed for the town cost twice the budgeted amount and then millions more in upkeep since they opened in 2004.&quot;

Much of the criticism focused on the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, originally budgeted for about $405 million. Ignacio Blanco, the leader of a small opposition party in Valencia, blamed Calatrava of spending nearly three times the original budget, and accused the region of paying him approximately $127 million for his work, though the complex was originally lacking elevators for the disabled, and the opera house had 150 seats with obstructed views. In 2013 Calatrava sued his critic for defamation and won, however because the judge ruled that, although the website presented &quot;objective truths&quot;, its name &quot;Calatrava te la clava&quot; (a rhyme meaning &quot;Calatrava bleeds you dry&quot;) was &quot;insulting and degrading&quot;.
Some of the problems with Calatrava&#x27;s projects have been caused by unusual design choices and insufficient testing. The glass tiles on the floor of his bridge in Bilbao became slippery in the rain, causing an increased number of claims for injuries and forcing the installation of a black anti-slip carpet on the decking, which blocked the view of the river through the walkway. The metal arches he put over some landscaped gardens sometimes overheated in the sunshine, baking the vines that were supposed to grow on them.
The Caja Madrid Obelisk is a kinetic sculpture with an undulating movement.
However the maintenance costs are so high that it has been static since months after its inauguration in 2010.
The aluminum and wood covering of a winery in Spain leaked water, interfering with the winemaking and requiring extensive repairs. The ceramic tiles on the surface of the opera house in Valencia, placed as a tribute to Antonio Gaudi, buckled in the heat because concrete and ceramics expand and contract at different rates when temperatures change. Calatrava was sued for the cost of repairs on the bridge in Venice and has been condemned in court.
Also the tiles of the Tenerife Auditorium buckle and lose adhesion.
The fixing is delayed by disputes between the Calatrava studio and the building companies.

===WTC Hub===
Much of the criticism focused on Calatrava&#x27;s WTC Hub, which was completed in 2016 for a cost of $4 billion, twice what was expected and seven years behind schedule. Calatrava was paid a fee of 80 million dollars. Some of the additional cost and delay was due to additions and modifications to the original plan by the project owners, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, rather than the architect. Calatrava&#x27;s original entry pavilion was scaled back for security reasons and the mechanism for opening the roof to the gallery below was eliminated because of budget and space restraints.

Even before it opened the station was a target of criticism: the &quot;New York Post&quot; described the station in 2014 as it was being built as &quot;a self-indulgent monstrosity&quot; and &quot;a hideous waste of public money&quot;. Michael Kimmelman, architecture critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, referred to the structure as &quot;a kitsch stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine referred to it in 2015 as it neared completion as a &quot;Glorious Boondoggle&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; editorial board also described the station when it opened in 2016 as the &quot;world&#x27;s most obscenely overpriced commuter rail station – and possibly its ugliest&quot;, comparing the Oculus to a &quot;giant gray-white space insect&quot;.

The Hub also had its defenders. Jimmy Stamp of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;I despised the new World Trade Center transportation hub before I even saw it. It&#x27;s $2bn over budget, has suffered from construction problems and design compromises, it&#x27;s seven years late and still incomplete, and its architect, Santiago Calatrava, has left a trail of lawsuits and angry clients around the world...But when I was standing on the marble floors in its enormous, gleaming central concourse two stories below street level, staring up at a clear blue sky between bone-white ribs vaulting 160ft over my head, I, like Jonah in the whale, repented – at least for the moment...We deserve grand expressions of our artistic and technological capabilities. We deserve public spaces that inspire. The Oculus is deeply flawed, but I appreciate its aspiration and grandeur... The Oculus presents a more optimistic vision, one based less on present realities and more on future possibilities. Less &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, more &quot;Star Trek&quot;. By the time we get to that future, whichever one it may be, the delays and the cost and the controversies will be forgotten, but we will be left with a luminous great hall in the heart of downtown New York.&quot;

===Athens Olympic Sports Complex===

In October 2023 the Greek government decided to shut down the Athens Olympic Stadium and Velodrome, which both have a roof built by Calatrava, due to stability issues posing a threat for attendees and workers.

==Style and influences==
Calatrava has never described himself as a follower of any particular school or movement of architecture. Critics have claimed that a number of influences can be seen in his work. In the journal of the American Institute of Architects, Christopher Hawthorne wrote about his design for Florida Polytechnic University, which he called &quot;an example of Calatrava&#x27;s architectural approach and creative sensibility distilled, for better and worse, to its essence. There are all the usual influences on view—the Eero Saarinen forms rendered in the Richard Meier, FAIA, palette—and they are remarkably legible and easy to parse here.&quot; Some other critics see his work as a continuation of expressionism. Asked about critics who classified him into different schools, Calatrava responded, &quot;Architectural critics have not yet passed from a state of perplexity about my work.&quot;

Calatrava himself observed that he was particularly influenced by the work of engineers such as the Swiss Robert Maillart (1872–1940), whose work inspired him to seek simple forms which could create an emotional response. Calatrava defined his objective this way in 2016 in a book about his work: &quot;My major interest is the introduction of a new formal vocabulary, composed of forms adapted to our time.&quot;

Calatrava, a sculptor, has also spoken frequently about the connection between sculpture and architecture in his work. &quot;In sculpture, I have often used spheres, cubes and other simple forms often connected with my knowledge of engineering.&quot; He noted that his Turning Torso building had originally been conceived as a work of sculpture, and he praised the liberties taken by Frank Gehry and Frank Stella in creating sculptural art, but he also noted the differences. In 1997 he wrote that &quot;architecture and sculpture are two rivers in which the same water flows. Think of sculpture as a pure plastic art while architecture is a plastic art which is submitted to function, taking into consideration the human scale.&quot; Calatrava also noted the influence of the sculptor Auguste Rodin, citing Rodin&#x27;s words in his 1914 book &quot;Cathedrals of France&quot;: &quot;The sculptor only achieves the greatness of expression in concentrating his attention on harmonic contrasts of light and shadow, exactly as an architect does.&quot;

Movement is also an important element in the architecture of Calatrava. He noted that many 20th century sculptors, such as Alexander Calder, made sculptures that moved. He wrote his own university thesis on &quot;The Flexibility of three-dimensional structures,&quot; and described how objects, by moving, could shift from three dimensions to two and even to one. Moving elements which folded and expanded became an important element of almost all of his projects. &quot;Architecture itself moves&quot;, he told a biographer, &quot;and, with a little chance, becomes a magnificent ruin&quot;.

==Artworks==
Calatrava is also a sculptor and painter. Some of his architectural works, most notably the Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, were originally works of sculpture. In 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City held a special one-man exhibition of Calatrava&#x27;s drawings, sculpture, and architectural models, entitled &quot;Santiago Calatrava: Sculpture Into Architecture&quot;.

In 2012, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg held an exhibition of his work and this was followed up by an exhibition at the Vatican Museum in Rome. Eight of his sculptures were displayed along Park Avenue in New York City in the spring of 2015, between 52nd and 55th Streets. 

In 2024, the first comprehensive overview of Calatrava’s art was written by Nick Mafi and published by Hirmer.

<text>Dennis Herron Murphree (January 6, 1886February 9, 1949) was an American politician. He served three separate terms as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi and two as Governor of Mississippi.

==Biography==
He was born on January 6, 1886, the son of Thomas F. Murphree and Callie (Cooper) Murphree. He was a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1911 to 1923. In March 1927, he became Governor of Mississippi after the death of incumbent Henry L. Whitfield. He served for about ten months until Theodore G. Bilbo, who defeated Murphree in the Democratic Party primary by 10,000 votes, was sworn into office in January 1928. Defeat has been attributed in part to his having prevented a lynching in Jackson (he mobilized the National Guard and threw up a barbed-wire barricade around the jail). With the death of Gov. Paul B. Johnson Sr. in December 1943, Murphree finished out the three weeks left in Johnson&#x27;s term, serving until the swearing-in of Thomas L. Bailey in January 1944.

Dennis Murphree conceived the idea of the Know Mississippi Better train in 1925 in response to Governor Whitfield&#x27;s wish to create an exposition of Mississippi for the rest of the country. The train was successful and continued to tour annually until at least 1937. The train visited forty-seven other states, Canada, and Mexico, and showcased the state&#x27;s industry, entertainment, and commerce sectors.

<doc id="229661" wikidata="Q911759" url="?curid=229661" title="Pseudophilosophy">
<text>Pseudophilosophy is a philosophical idea or system which does not meet an expected set of philosophical standards. There is no universally accepted set of standards, but there are similarities and some common ground.

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics, the 6th of which has been considered to diminish the credibility of the first 5:
# It has a preference for useless speculation.
# It appeals merely to human authority.
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason.
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition.
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism.
# It is immoral.

According to Michael Oakeshott, pseudo-philosophy &quot;is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry.&quot;

Josef Pieper noted that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a &quot;cosmic formula&quot; is a pseudo-philosophy. In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a &quot;highest principle&quot; from which to develop transcendental idealism, calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.

Nicholas Rescher, in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;, described &quot;pseudo-philosophy&quot; as &quot;deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth.&quot; Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to &quot;those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry.&quot;

==History==
The term &quot;pseudo-philosophy&quot; appears to have been coined by Jane Austen.

Ernest Newman, an English music critic and musicologist, who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 &quot;Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

According to Josef Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy is the human search &quot;oriented toward wisdom such as God possesses&quot;. It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology. Pieper notes:
==Usage==
The term is almost always used pejoratively and is often contentious, due to differing criteria for demarcating pseudophilosophy (see also: Demarcation problem).

===Romanticism===
According to physicist and philosopher of science Mario Bunge,
For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge. According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is &quot;essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving&quot;. Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition, and not on &quot;philosophical work&quot;:
Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, &quot;in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims&quot;.

===Mysticism===
Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute. Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy. In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.

Interest in Eckhart&#x27;s works was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and Idealist philosophers. Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a &quot;mystic&quot;. The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus and other neo-Platonistic thinkers. Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.

===German Idealism===
Arthur Schopenhauer wrote the following about Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel:
A hundred and fifty years after Schopenhauer&#x27;s death, physicist and philosopher of science Mario Bunge recommended &quot;avoiding the pseudo-subtleties of Hegelian dialectics&quot;, and wrote of &quot;Hegel&#x27;s disastrous legacy&quot;: &quot;It is true that Marx and Engels criticized Hegel&#x27;s idealism, but they did not repudiate his cult of nonsense and his rejection of all modern science from Newton on.&quot; Bunge noted,
===Continental philosophy===
Soccio notes that analytically inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy as pseudophilosophy. According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl &quot;scheinphilosophy&quot;.

===Scientism===
Dietrich von Hildebrand used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
===Objectivism===

Journalist Jonathan Chait used the term to criticize the work of Ayn Rand in &quot;Ayn Rand&#x27;s Pseudo-Philosophy&quot;, an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, in which he wrote, &quot;She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon.&quot; Physicist and philosopher of science Mario Bunge classified Rand as a &quot;mercenary&quot;, among those who &quot;seek to defend or propagate a doctrine rather than an analyzing ideas or searching for new truths&quot;, while science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer claimed that &quot;it becomes clear that Objectivism was (and is) a cult, as are many other, non-religious groups&quot;. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; said of Rand, &quot;For all her popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously.&quot;

<doc id="229663" wikidata="Q908792" url="?curid=229663" title="PortAventura World">
<text>PortAventura World is an entertainment resort in Salou and Vila-seca, Tarragona, on the Costa Daurada in Catalonia, Spain. It was built around the PortAventura Park theme park, which attracts around 5.3 million visitors per year, making it the most visited theme park in Spain and the sixth most visited theme park in Europe. 

In 2017, with the opening of a third park, Ferrari Land, the resort rebranded to PortAventura World, which manages all three theme parks, six hotels, a convention center, and an RV park. Reus Airport lies within 15-minute drive, and Barcelona Airport is within an hour. The train station &quot;Salou-Port Aventura&quot; is 750m from the resort entrance and features line R17 trains to Barcelona and Tarragona.

==History==
When Port Aventura opened in 1995 in Salou, The Tussauds Group owned 40.0% of the park, while La Caixa had 33.2%, Anheuser-Busch had 19.9%, and FECSA had 6.7%. In 1998, the majority of Tussauds Group&#x27;s shares in the park were sold to Universal and the park was rebranded as &#x27;Universal&#x27;s Port Aventura&#x27;, which made it the first Universal Studios theme park in Europe.

In 2002, a water park (&quot;Costa Caribe&quot;) and two hotels (&quot;Hotel PortAventura&quot; and &quot;Hotel El Paso&quot;) were constructed, and the resort was further rebranded as &#x27;Universal Mediterranea&#x27;. In 2004, NBCUniversal (Universal Studios&#x27; parent) sold all interest in PortAventura. It is owned and operated by La Caixa Banking Group&#x27;s investment vehicle Criteria,but as of 2005, the Universal name has been dropped from the branding, and the resort was once again named &#x27;PortAventura&#x27; (the space in the name is deliberately left out for trademark reasons). In 2009, the resort hosted 3,310,000 visitors.

In December 2013, private equity firm KKR picked up a 49.9% stake in PortAventura from Investindustrial, which still owned 50.1%. In 2016, the resort was renamed &#x27;PortAventura World Parks &amp; Resort&#x27;. The second theme park, Ferrari Land, was inaugurated on April 7, 2017. PortAventura Dream Village, opened in 2017.

==PortAventura Park==

The park features five theme areas based on civilizations (Mediterrània, Far West, México, China and Polynesia), and one theme area based on Sesame Street. Mediterrània is the main entrance area of the park.

It consistently ranks among the world&#x27;s best roller coasters in polls.

==Ferrari Land==
InvestIndustrial and Ferrari signed a deal to build a new area themed to the Italian sports car brand in the PortAventura resort covering 60,000 m2, including new rides, restaurants, shops and car racing simulators. Ferrari Land is the resort&#x27;s second theme park, separate from PortAventura Park. The park was opened on 7 April 2017, after an investment of more than €100 million.

Its entrance is adjacent to PortAventura Park&#x27;s main entrance. The Mediterranean theme is common to both entrances, as Ferrari Land is inspired by Italy, including recreations of Venice&#x27;s Piazza San Marco and Rome&#x27;s Colosseum. The main ride of Ferrari Land is Red Force, a 112 m tall vertical accelerator coaster that surpassed Shambhala as the tallest coaster in Europe and is also the fastest coaster in Europe. Ferrari Land opened a kids area in 2018.

Ferrari Land is the second amusement centre themed to Ferrari in the world, after Ferrari World Abu Dhabi.

<doc id="229665" wikidata="Q902997" url="?curid=229665" title="Forest of Dean">
<text>The Forest of Dean is a geographical, historical and cultural region in the western part of the county of Gloucestershire, England. It forms a roughly triangular plateau bounded by the River Wye to the west and northwest, Herefordshire to the north, the River Severn to the south, and the City of Gloucester to the east.

The area is characterised by more than of mixed woodland, one of the surviving ancient woodlands in England. A large area was reserved for royal hunting before 1066, and remained as the second largest crown forest in England, after the New Forest. Although the name is used loosely to refer to the part of Gloucestershire between the Severn and Wye, the Forest of Dean proper has covered a much smaller area since the Middle Ages. In 1327, it was defined to cover only the royal demesne and parts of parishes within the hundred of St Briavels, and after 1668 comprised the royal demesne only. The Forest proper is within the civil parishes of West Dean, Lydbrook, Cinderford, Ruspidge, and Drybrook, together with a strip of land in the parish of English Bicknor.

Traditionally the main sources of work have been forestry – including charcoal production – iron working and coal mining. Archaeological studies have dated the earliest use of coal to Roman times for domestic heating and industrial processes such as the preparation of iron ore.

The area gives its name to the local government district, Forest of Dean, and a parliamentary constituency, both of which cover wider areas than the historic Forest. The administrative centre of the local authority is Coleford, one of the main towns in the historic Forest area, together with Cinderford and Lydney.

==Toponym==
The origin of the name is unknown. The prevalence of Welsh place names in the area suggests a possible corruption of &quot;din&quot; (meaning &quot;hillfort&quot;). However, similar or identical elements from Old English exist throughout England. In Welsh, Forest of Dean is .

Gerald of Wales, writing in the 12th century, refers to the area as &quot;Danubia&quot; which may translate as &quot;land of Danes&quot; following the Viking settlements in that era. It is possible that an original name &quot;Dene&quot; developed from this.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The area was inhabited in Mesolithic times, and there are also remains of later megalithic monuments, including the Longstone near Staunton and the Broadstone at Wibdon, Stroat. Barrows have been identified at Tidenham and Blakeney. Bronze Age field systems have been identified at Welshbury Hill near Littledean, and there are Iron Age hill forts at Symonds Yat and Welshbury. There is archaeological evidence of early trading by sea, probably through Lydney. Before Roman times, the area may have been occupied by the British Dobunni tribe, although few of their coins have been found in the area and control may have been contested with the neighbouring Silures.

===Roman Britain===
The area was occupied by the Romans in around AD 50. They were attracted by its natural resources which included iron ore, ochre and charcoal. The coal mining industry was probably established on a small scale in Roman times. The area was governed from the Roman town of Ariconium at Weston under Penyard near Ross-on-Wye, and a road was built from there to a river crossing at Newnham on Severn and port at Lydney. The &quot;Dean Road&quot;, still visible at Soudley, is believed to be a medieval rebuilding of the Roman road, and would have been an important route to transport iron ore and finished metal products. During Roman times there were Roman villas at Blakeney, Woolaston and elsewhere, and towards the end of the Roman period, around AD 370, a major Roman temple complex dedicated to the god Nodens was completed at Lydney. The central parts of the woodlands in the forest are believed to have been protected for hunting since Roman times.

===Medieval===
The area formed part of the &quot;Cantref Coch&quot; and was traditionally considered part of the Brythonic kingdom of Ergyng, centered in modern Herefordshire. Even when the area came under Anglo-Saxon control, the Forest of Dean remained under the auspices of the diocese of Hereford, rather than Gloucester. The Beachley and Lancaut peninsulas east of the Lower Wye remained in Welsh control at least until the 8th century.

Around 790 the Saxon King Offa of Mercia built his dyke high above the Wye, but the area was still claimed by the Kingdom of Gwent and Morgannwg before it was annexed into the kingdom of England by Æthelstan in 926.

Throughout the next few centuries Vikings conducted raids up the Severn, but by the 11th century, the kingdom of Wessex had established civil government. The core of the forest was used by the late Anglo-Saxon kings, and after 1066 the Normans, as their personal hunting ground. The area was kept stocked with deer and wild boar and became important for timber, charcoal, iron ore and limestone.

===Norman era===
The Hundred of St Briavels was established in the 12th century, at the same time as many Norman laws concerning the Forest of Dean were put in place. St Briavels Castle became the Forest&#x27;s administrative and judicial centre. Verderers were appointed to act for the king and protect his royal rights, and local people were given some common rights. Flaxley Abbey was built and given rights and privileges. In 1296, miners from the Hundred of St Briavels supported King Edward I at the siege of Berwick-on-Tweed in the Scottish Wars of Independence by undermining the then Scottish town&#x27;s defences in the first step of his campaign to seize Scotland from John Balliol. As a result, the king granted free mining rights within the forest to the miners and their descendants; the rights continue to the present day. Miners at that time were mainly involved in iron ore mining – although the presence of coal was well known, and limited amounts had been recovered in Roman times. Coal was not used for ironmaking with the methods of smelting then in use. Later the freeminer rights were used mainly for coal mining. The activities of the miners were regulated by the Court of Mine Law. This, and other forms of self-governance, coupled with the Forest&#x27;s geographic isolation between the rivers Severn and Wye, has given rise to a strong sense of cultural identity in those from the area, who are collectively known as &quot;Foresters&quot;. The ancient rights were put on the statute books in the Dean Forest (Mines) Act 1838, the only public act to affect private individuals. Residents of the hundred over 18 can graze sheep in the Forest in accordance with an agreement between Forestry England and the Commoners Association.

In October 2010 a woman won the right to be classified as a Freeminer. Elaine Morman, an employee at Clearwell Caves in the Forest, who had worked as a miner of ochre for a number of years, raised a claim of sexual discrimination against the Forestry Commission. After Mark Harper MP raised the matter in the House of Commons, the Forestry Commission reversed its position and agreed to register her.

===Early modern period===

The forest was used exclusively as a royal hunting ground for the Tudors, and subsequently a source of food for the royal court. Its rich deposits of iron ore led to its becoming a major source of iron. The forest&#x27;s timber was particularly fine, and was regarded as the best material for building ships.

In the 17th century, as a result of King Charles I&#x27;s decision to rule without Parliament, he sought to raise finances through grants of royal forest lands. of the Forest of Dean was disafforested in the 1620s, causing a series of riots in 1631–32; this was part of enclosure riots across the South West commonly known as the Western Rising. In 1639 were disafforested, with going to manorial lords and freeholders in compensation. were to go to the Crown, and be sold on to Sir John Winter. Riots ensued in 1641. Winter&#x27;s claim to the lands was voided by Parliament in March 1642, in part because he had failed to pay. His assets were sequestrated for supporting the Crown during the Civil War. The Protectorate tried to enclose a third of the forest in 1657, leaving two thirds to the Commoners. Although a relatively generous settlement, it caused resistance in April and May 1659, when fences of new enclosures were broken and cattle brought in to graze. Royalists including Edward Massey attempted to bring the discontented to the side of Charles II.

After the restoration Sir John Winter successfully reasserted his right to the Forest of Dean. However forest law was reestablished by Act of Parliament in 1668. In 1672 the King&#x27;s ironworks were closed to reduce pressure on the forest from mining. The Speech House, between Coleford and Cinderford, was built in 1682 to host the Court of Mine Law and &quot;Court of the Speech&quot;, a sort of parliament for the Verderers and Free Miners managing the forest, game, and mineral resources. The Gaveller and his deputy were responsible for leasing gales – areas allocated for mining – on behalf of the Crown. The Speech House has been used as an inn and hotel since the 19th century.

===Georgian era===

The Forest of Dean, with its huge iron ore reserves and ready supply of timber, had been of national importance in the production of iron, using charcoal, for hundreds of years. Despite the abundance of coal, it was not until the last decade of the 18th century that local ironmasters were prepared to invest in the technology needed to produce iron from coke, when coke-fired furnaces at Cinderford, Whitecliff and Parkend were built almost simultaneously.

During the 18th century, squatters established roughly-built hamlets around the fringes of the Crown forest demesne. By about 1800, these settlements were well established at Berry Hill and Parkend.

In 1808 Parliament passed the Dean and New Forests Act 1808, which included the provision to enclose of woodland. This enclosure was carried out between 1814 and 1816.

There were bread riots in 1795 and in 1801. Ordinary Foresters were already poverty-stricken, and their plight had grown worse. They were denied access to the enclosed areas and unable to hunt or remove timber. In particular, they lost their ancient grazing and mining rights.

As unrest grew, a populist leader named Warren James emerged in the riots against the enclosures. Attempts to peaceably resolve the matter failed, and on 8 June 1831, James, leading more than 100 Foresters, demolished the enclosure at Park Hill, between Parkend and Bream. Around 50 unarmed Crown Officers were powerless to intervene. On the Friday, a party of 50 soldiers arrived from Monmouth, but by now the number of Foresters had grown to around 2,000 and the soldiers returned to barracks. Over the next few days more troops arrived from around the country. The Foresters&#x27; resistance crumbled and most of those arrested elected to rebuild the enclosures, rather than be charged with rioting. James was sentenced to death but his sentence was later commuted to transportation. He was sent to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) in October 1831, only to be pardoned five years later, although he never returned home.

Conservatives were disliked in the Forest of Dean; on polling day in 1874, there was a riot in the market town of Cinderford in which the Conservative party headquarters and nearby houses were ransacked and damaged.

===&quot;Who killed the bears?&quot;===
On 26 April 1889, four Frenchmen and their two bears were making their way to Ruardean, having performed in Cinderford. They were attacked by an angry mob, enraged by claims that the bears had killed a child and injured a woman. The bears were killed and the Frenchmen badly beaten.

It soon became clear that the bears had not attacked anyone. Police proceedings followed and a week later 13 colliers and labourers appeared before magistrates at Littledean, charged with ill-treating and killing the bears and assaulting the Frenchmen. All but two were found guilty on one or more charges, with another convicted a week later. A total of £85 () was paid in fines. A subscription was also launched which generously compensated the Frenchmen.

The term &quot;Who killed the bears?&quot; existed for many years as an insult, directed particularly towards the people of Ruardean – despite the fact that all those convicted were from Cinderford.

A fictional version of the incident was used by Dennis Potter for his TV play &quot;A Beast With Two Backs&quot;.

===Rise and fall of industrialisation===

Exploitation of the Forest of Dean Coalfield developed rapidly in the early 19th century with increased demand from local ironworks, and when some of the earliest tramroads in the UK were built here to transport coal to local ports the area was transformed by the growth of mining and the production of iron and steel.

In 1818–19 David Mushet built Darkhill Ironworks, where he experimented with iron and steel making. In 1845, his youngest son, Robert Forester Mushet, took over its management. He perfected the Bessemer Process by solving the quality problems which beset the process. In a second key advance in metallurgy he invented Mushet steel (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was the first true tool steel and the first air-hardening steel. It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel. The remains of Darkhill are preserved as an Industrial Archaeological Site of International Importance and are open to the public.

The Park Gutter pit was renamed Princess Royal after Princess Victoria in 1842. The Princess Royal Colliery Company was founded in 1891 to work Park Gutter and Flour Mill Pits. It reached peak production in the 1930s, employing 1300 men. The pits closed in 1962.

Cinderford was laid out as a planned town in the mid-19th century, but the characteristic form of settlement remained the sprawling hamlets of haphazardly placed cottages. Characteristics shared with other British coalfields, such as a devotion to sport, the central role of miners&#x27; clubs, and the formation of brass bands, created a distinct community identity.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Forest was a complex industrial region with deep coal mines, iron mines, iron and tinplate works, foundries, quarries and stone-dressing works, wood distillation works producing chemicals, a network of railways, and numerous tramroads. The tradition of independence in the area resulted in a great number of smaller and not necessarily economically successful mines. In 1904 the Gaveller oversaw a period of amalgamation of collieries which allowed deeper mines to be sunk. During the early 20th century, annual output from the coalfield rarely fell below 1 million tons.
In 1945 half of the male working population worked in the coal industry but after the Second World War increased pumping costs and other factors made the coalfield less economic. The last commercial iron mine closed in 1946 followed in 1965 by the closure of the last large colliery, Northern United. There are still small private mines in operation, worked by freeminers and Hopewell Colliery is open to the public.

With the decline of the mines, the area has undergone a period of significant change, ameliorated to some extent by a shift to high technology, with companies establishing themselves in the area, attracted by grants and a willing workforce.

===Visitor destination===
Many mines have now been reclaimed by the forest and the area is characterised by picturesque scenery punctuated by remnants of the industrial age and small towns. There remains a number of industrial areas but the focus has been to capitalise on the scenery and to create jobs from tourist attractions and the leisure sector. Significant numbers of residents work outside the area, commuting to Gloucester, Cheltenham, Bristol, Newport and Cardiff.

==Natural history==
===Geology===

The Forest of Dean is formed of a raised basin of palaeozoic rocks folded in the Variscan Orogeny, similar to the South Wales coalfield to the west. Underlain by great thicknesses of the Old Red Sandstone, the basin is filled with Carboniferous limestones, sandstones and coal measures, all of which have contributed to the industrial history of the region. Its highest point is Ruardean Hill ().

===Ecology===
The forest is composed of deciduous and evergreen trees. Predominant is oak, both pedunculate and sessile. Beech is common and sweet chestnut has grown here for many centuries. The forest is home to foxgloves and other wild flowers. Conifers include some Weymouth pine from 1781, Norway spruce, Douglas fir and larch. The deer are predominantly fallow deer and have been present since the second world war (there were no deer from about 1855 when they were removed in accordance with an Act of Parliament). A number of fallow deer in the central area are melanistic. Small numbers of roe deer and muntjac deer have spread in from the east.

The Forest is also home to wild boar. A population in the Ross-on-Wye area on the northern edge of the forest escaped from a wild boar farm around 1999 and are believed to be of pure Eastern European origin; in a second introduction, a domestic herd was dumped near Staunton in 2004, but are not pure bred wild boar. Attempts to locate the source of the illegal dumps were unsuccessful and boar can now be found in many parts of the Forest.

Locally there are mixed feelings about the presence of boar. Problems have included ploughing up gardens and picnic areas, attacking dogs and panicking horses, road traffic accidents, and ripping open rubbish bags. The local authority undertook a public consultation and have recommended to the Verderers that control is necessary. Under its international obligations the UK government is obliged to consider the reintroduction of species made extinct through the activities of man, the wild boar included.

The Forest of Dean is known for its woodland birds; pied flycatchers, redstarts, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpecker, nightjars and hawfinches can be seen at RSPB Nagshead and other parts of the forest. The mixed forest supports one of Britain&#x27;s highest concentrations of goshawks and a viewing site at New Fancy is manned during February and March. However, goshawks are still illegally killed in the area, with a bird found dead with a shotgun wound in June 2022. Peregrine falcons can be seen from the viewpoint at Symonds Yat rock. Mandarin ducks, which nest in the trees, and reed warblers can be seen at Cannop Ponds and Cannop Brook, running from the ponds through Parkend, is famed for its dippers.

Butterflies of note are the small pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and white admiral. Gorsty Knoll is famed for its glowworms and Woorgreens Lake for its dragonflies.

The Forest of Dean is also a stronghold for Britain&#x27;s only venomous snake, the European adder, although its population is now believed to be in dramatic decline.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===
The A40 runs along the northern and northeastern edges of the Forest of Dean. The road provides the Forest with a direct connection to Ross-on-Wye and the M50 in Herefordshire. Westbound, the road runs towards Monmouth and South Wales. To the East, the road links the Forest directly to Gloucester, the M5, Cheltenham and Oxford. North of the Forest, the road is managed by National Highways.

To the southeast of the Forest, the A48 links the region to Chepstow, the M4 and Newport, or Gloucester. This route passes around the Lydney area and follows the course of the River Severn.

Other key routes include:

* the A4136 – Huntley to Monmouth, via Mitcheldean and Coleford
* the A4151 – Westbury-on-Severn to Mitcheldean via Cinderford

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels, measured using roadside diffusion tubes, are generally well below the UK national target for clean air, set at 40 μg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre). In 2017, no roadside monitoring site in the Forest of Dean District failed to meet the UK objective. The most polluted site measured was on Lydney High Street, with a 2017 average NO2 concentration of 36.9 μg/m3.

=== Railways ===

The Forest of Dean once boasted a developed railway network, much of which evolved from plateways built in the early 19th century to facilitate freight traffic to and from mineral workings in the Forest. Many of these lines were part of the Severn &amp; Wye Railway, which ran from the River Severn at Lydney to Cinderford, with branch lines to Lydbrook, where it connected with the Ross &amp; Monmouth Railway, and Coleford, where it linked to the Wye Valley Railway via a line known as the Coleford Railway. The Forest of Dean Railway also ran towards Cinderford and its nearby collieries, branching from the South Wales Railway at Bullo Pill. The less successful Forest of Dean Central Railway attempted to compete with the other lines for coal traffic but was rendered obsolete by the opening of the Mineral Loop, a new line opened by the Severn &amp; Wye to connect a number of pitheads. Most of these railways now cease to exist, with most of the railways in the Forest abandoned by 1968. A section of the Dean Forest Railway between Lydney Junction and Norchard is now a heritage railway.

The Gloucester-Newport line continues to carry passengers. Lydney railway station serves the Forest of Dean, with 0.196 million passenger entries and exits in 2017–18. The station is served by trains operated by Transport for Wales, linking the Forest directly to Cheltenham and Gloucester to the north, and Chepstow, Newport, Cardiff and onward destinations in South Wales. CrossCountry runs limited services to the station, linking the Forest to Birmingham New Street and onward destinations in the Midlands.

<text>Taxila or Takshashila () is a city in the Pothohar region of Punjab, Pakistan. Located in the Taxila Tehsil of Rawalpindi District, it lies approximately northwest of the Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area and is just south of the Haripur District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Established during the Vedic period, Old Taxila was for a time the capital city of ancient Gandhāra. It was situated on the eastern shore of the Indus River—the pivotal junction of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia; it was possibly founded around 1000 BCE. Takshashila and Pushkalavati remained prominent cities in Ghandhāra during the Mahajanapadas.The city was later conquered of the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s and incorporated into the Hindush satrap, between 550 – 326 BCE. In 326 BCE, the city was claimed by Alexander the Great, after overthrowing the Achaemenids, who gained control of the city without a battle since the city was immediately surrendered to the Macedonian Empire. This was followed successively by the Mauryans (~317 – ~200 BCE), the Indo-Greeks (~200 BCE – ~55 BCE), the Indo-Scythians (~80 BCE – ~30 CE), and the Kushan Empire (~ 30 CE – ~375 CE), who destroyed the existing city, in the first century CE, to build their own on a site to the north of the ruins. Owing to its strategic location, Taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries, with many polities vying for its control. When the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed in the 5th century by the invading Hunas. In mid-19th century British India, ancient Taxila&#x27;s ruins were rediscovered by British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham and extensively excavated by Sir John Marshall. In 1980, UNESCO designated Taxila as a World Heritage Site.

By some accounts, the University of ancient Taxila is considered to be one of the earliest universities or education centre in South Asia. Other scholars do not consider it to have been a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in the city. In a 2010 report, the Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites that were &quot;on the verge&quot; of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and armed conflict as primary threats. However, significant preservation efforts have since been carried out by the Pakistani government, which has resulted in the site&#x27;s recategorization as &quot;well-preserved&quot; by different international publications. Because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep, Taxila is one of Punjab&#x27;s popular tourist spots, attracting up to one million tourists every year.

==Etymology==
In ancient times, Taxila was known as in Sanskrit (per IAST) and as in Pali. The city&#x27;s Sanskrit name translates to &quot;City of Cut Stone&quot; or &quot;Rock of Taksha&quot; in reference to a story in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; that states that the city was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of the Hindu deity Rama, and named in honour of Bharata&#x27;s son, Taksha.

The city&#x27;s modern name, however, is derived from the ancient Greek rendering noted in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. The Greek-language transcription of &quot;Taxila&quot; became universally favoured over time, and both the Sanskrit and Pali names fell out of use.

Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who visited the city via the Silk Road, had given its name&#x27;s meaning as &quot;cut-off head&quot;. With the help of a &quot;Jataka&quot;, he had interpreted it to be the place where Gautama Buddha—during a previous birth as &quot;Pusa&quot; or &quot;Chandaprabha&quot;—cut off his head to feed a hungry lion. This tradition still persists with the area in front of Sirkap (also meaning &quot;cut-off head&quot;), which was known in the 19th century as &quot;Babur Khana&quot; (&#x27;House of Tiger&#x27;), alluding to the place where Gautama Buddha had offered his head. In addition, a hill range to south of the Taxila Valley is called &quot;Margala&quot; ().

==In traditional sources==
In Vedic texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, it is mentioned that the Vedic philosopher Uddalaka Aruni (c. 7th century BCE) had travelled to the region of Gandhara. In later Buddhist texts, the 4th - 3rd century BCE Jatakas, it is specified that Taxila was the city where Aruni and his son Shvetaketu each had received their education.

One of the earliest mentions of Taxila is in Pāṇini&#x27;s , a Sanskrit grammar treatise dated to the 4th century BCE.

Much of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, is a conversation between Vaishampayana (a pupil of the sage, Vyasa) and King Janamejaya. It is traditionally believed that the story was first recited by Vaishampayana at the behest of Vyasa during the snake sacrifice performed by Janamejaya at Takshashila. The audience also included Ugrashravas, an itinerant bard, who would later recite the story to a group of priests at an ashram in the Naimisha Forest from where the story was further disseminated. The Kuru Kingdom&#x27;s heir, Parikshit (grandson of Arjuna) is said to have been enthroned at Takshashila.

The Ramayana describes Takshashila as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of Rama. Bharata, who also founded nearby Pushkalavati, installed his two sons, Taksha and Pushkala, as the rulers of the two cities.

In the Buddhist Jatakas, Taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of Gandhara and a great centre of learning with world-famous teachers. The Jatakas mention non-Buddhist institutions and teachers in Taxila. They show the predominance of Vedic and technical disciplines including law, medicine, and military science. The Takkasila Jataka, more commonly known as the Telapatta Jataka, tells the tale of a prince of Benares who is told that he would become the king of Takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the yakshinis who waylaid travellers in the forest. According to the Dipavamsa, one of Taxila&#x27;s early kings was a Kshatriya named Dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons. , mentioned in the Avadanakalpalata, is another king associated with the city.

=== In Jainism ===
Takshashila was closely associated with Jainism. According to the Jaina tradition, Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara, entrusted the region of Ayodhya to his son Bharata and the region of Takshashila to his son Bahubali.

As per canonical Śvetāmbara Jaina texts &quot;Āvaśyaka Cūrṇi&quot; and &quot;Āvaśyaka Niryukti&quot;, Tirthankara Rishabhanatha visited Takshashila while wandering after initiation as a monk millions of years ago. Upon learning of his arrival, Bahubali, who was not in the city at that moment, rushed to the city, but the Rishabhanatha had already departed before Bahubali arrived. His footprints were subsequently consecrated by Bahubali who erected a throne and a dharmachakra (&#x27;wheel of the law&#x27;) over them several miles in height and circumference. The 14th century Vividha Tirtha Kalpa mentions this establishment, stating:
 &quot;तक्षशिलायां बाहुबलीविनिर्मितं धर्मचक्रम् ॥&quot;
 - Ācārya Jinaprabhāsūri in &quot;Vividha Tirtha Kalpa&quot; (p. 85)
As per the canonical Jaina text &quot;Mahanishith Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Dharmachakra Tirtha&quot; established by Bahubali is recognized as the abode of Chandraprabha, and Takshashila is also referred to as &quot;Dharmachakra Bhumi,&quot; marking its significance as a center of Jainism.

While there is limited information about the subsequent period, it is noted that during the medieval era, Takshashila faced challenges due to the proliferation of fraudulent ascetics and a lack of proper sustenance, leading to restrictions on Jaina ascetics&#x27; wandering in the region, as documented in six ancient Jaina texts known as the &quot;Chedasūtras&quot;.

Emperor Samprati built a Jaina temple known as &quot;Kunala Stupa&quot; in honor of his father Kunala. During Samprati&#x27;s rule, the extent of the wandering of Jaina monks developed multifold times, and later also included this region.

According to the Prabhavakacharita, by the second to third century CE, there were approximately 500 Jaina temples in Takshashila, and it was occupied by a significant number of Jainas. However, a devastating plague struck the city, leading to widespread death and chaos. The Jaina community sent a Sravaka named Virchand to Nadol, who conveyed their suffering to Acharya Manadevasuri. Suri gave &quot;&quot;Laghu Shanti Stava&quot;,&quot; stating that reciting it would alleviate the plague. Following the recitation, the plague subsided within a few days. However, in the third year, the Turks devastated the city.

According to Acharya Dhaneswarasuri&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Shatrunjaya Mahatmya&quot;,&quot; Javad Shah, a merchant from Mahuva, renovated Palitana temples in Vikrama Samvat 108. He retrieved an image of Rishabhanatha from Takshashila and established it as the principal deity at the principal shrine amongst Shatrunjaya temples.

Excavations in Takshashila support these traditions. Dr. Sir John Marshall noted that Indo-Greek kings displaced the city from its fortified position and settled it in Sirkap during the early years of the second century BCE. The city remained inhabited through the Greek, Shaka, Pahlava, and Kushan periods. Numerous small and large temples have been discovered along the main road of Sirkap. Dr. Marshall concluded that the temples in blocks &#x27;F&#x27; and &#x27;G&#x27; of Sirkap are Jaina temples due to their architectural similarities with Kankali Tila, a Jaina stupa, found in Mathura. In block &#x27;G,&#x27; located on the right side of the main road, numerous ruins of large buildings have been found, characterized by the presence of small temples alongside these structures, which were accessible to devotees. This evidence strongly supports claims by the Jaina tradition that Takshashila was a significant center for Jainism.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The region around Taxila was settled by the Neolithic era, with some ruins at Taxila dating to 1000 BCE. Ruins dating from the Early Harappan period around 1300 BCE have also been discovered in the Taxila area, though the area was eventually abandoned after the collapse of the Indus Valley civilisation.

The earliest settled occupation in Taxila Valley was found at Sarai Khola, located 2 km to the south-west of Taxila Museum, where three radiocarbon dates from Period I suggest the site was first occupied between the late 4th and early 3rd millennium BCE, with deposits of polished stone celts, chert blades and a distinctive type of highly burnished pottery that shows clear signs of the use of woven baskets in the manufacturing process and the application of a slurry to the exterior surface.

Periods IA and II at Sarai Khola seem to show continuity from Period I, with the appearance of red burnished wares. However, Kot Diji-style wares were found in greater numbers, and the Kot Diji-style forms show signs of having been wheel-thrown, marking a clear technological change from the Period I material. Seven radiocarbon dates were also taken from the earlier and later Period II/Kot Diji, and seem to show this phase dates from the mid-late 3rd to early 2nd millennium BCE.

===Gandhāra kingdom===
Gandhara was an ancient Indo-Aryan kingdom of western South Asia whose existence was attested during the Iron Age. The capital of the kingdom was in Taxila. The first major settlement at Taxila, in Hathial mound, was established around 1000 BCE. By 900 BCE, the city was already involved in regional commerce, as the discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and Puṣkalāvatī.

Later, Taxila was inhabited at Bhir Mound, dated to some time around the period 800-525 BCE with these early layers bearing grooved red burnished ware.

===Achaemenid Empire===

Archaeological excavations show that the city may have grown significantly during the rule of the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE. In 516 BCE, Darius I embarked on a campaign to conquer Central Asia, &quot;Ariana&quot; and &quot;Bactria&quot;, before marching onto what is now Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Emperor Darius spent the winter of 516-515 BCE in the Gandhara region surrounding Taxila, and prepared to conquer the Indus Valley, which he did in 515 BCE, after which he appointed Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to the Suez. Darius then returned to Persia via the Bolan Pass. The region continued under Achaemenid suzerainty under the reign of Xerxes I, and continued under Achaemenid rule for over a century.

Taxila was sometimes ruled as part of the Gandhara kingdom (whose capital was Pushkalavati), particularly after the Achaemenid period, but Taxila sometimes formed its own independent district or city-state.

===Hellenistic===
During his invasion of the Indus Valley, Alexander the Great was able to gain control of Taxila () in 326 BCE without a battle, as the city was surrendered by its ruler, king Omphis (Āmbhi). Greek historians accompanying Alexander described Taxila as &quot;wealthy, prosperous, and well governed&quot;. Arrian writes that Alexander was welcomed by the citizens of the city, and he offered sacrifices and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian contest there.

On Alexander&#x27;s death, in 323 BCE, the province and much of the once Achaemenid territories would pass to his general Seleucus I Nicator and founder of the successor Seleucid Empire.

===Mauryan Empire===
By 303 BCE, the Seleucid Empire&#x27;s satraps in South Asia had been formally annexed by the expanding Mauryan empire, following the Seleucid–Mauryan war, with the provincial capital and center of higher education at Taxila under the control of Chandragupta Maurya. His advisor, Kautilya/Chanakya, was said to have taught at Taxila&#x27;s university. Under the reign of Ashoka the Great, Chandragupta&#x27;s grandson, the city was made a great seat of Buddhist learning, though the city was home to a minor rebellion during this time.

Taxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient &quot;Royal Highway&quot; that connected the Mauryan capital at Pataliputra in Bihar, with ancient Peshawar, Puṣkalāvatī, and onwards towards Central Asia via Kashmir, Bactria, and Kāpiśa. Taxila thus changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control.

===Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Indo-Parthian Kingdoms===
In the 2nd century BCE, Taxila was annexed by the Indo-Greek kingdom of Bactria. Indo-Greeks built a new capital, Sirkap, on the opposite bank of the river from Taxila. During this new period of Bactrian Greek rule, several dynasties (like Antialcidas) likely ruled from the city as their capital. During lulls in Greek rule, the city managed profitably on its own, to independently control several local trade guilds, who also minted most of the city&#x27;s autonomous coinage. In about the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, an Indo-Scythian king named Azilises had three mints, one of which was at Taxila, and struck coins with obverse legends in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.

The last Greek king of Taxila was overthrown by the Indo-Scythian chief Maues around 90 BCE. Gondophares, founder of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, conquered Taxila around 20 BCE, and made Taxila his capital. According to early Christian legend, Thomas the Apostle visited Gondophares IV around 46 CE, possibly at Taxila given that city was Gondophares&#x27; capital city.

===Kushan Empire===
Around the year 50 CE, the Greek Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana allegedly visited Taxila, which was described by his biographer, Philostratus, writing some 200 years later, as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan, similar in size to Nineveh&quot;.&quot; Modern archaeology confirms this description. Inscriptions dating to 76 CE demonstrate that the city had come under Kushan rule by that time, after the city was captured from the Parthians by Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan Empire. The great Kushan ruler Kanishka later founded Sirsukh, the most recent of the ancient settlements at Taxila.

===Gupta Empire===
In the mid-fourth century CE, the Gupta Empire occupied the territories in Eastern Gandhara, establishing a Kumaratya&#x27;s post at Taxila. The city became well known for its trade links, including silk, sandalwood, horses, cotton, silverware, pearls, and spices. It is during this time that the city heavily features in classical Indian literature – both as a centre of culture as well as a militarised border city.

Taxila&#x27;s university remained in existence during the travels of Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited Taxila around 400 CE. He wrote that Taxila&#x27;s name translated as &quot;the Severed Head&quot;, and was the site of a story in the life of Buddha &quot;where he gave his head to a man&quot;.

===Decline===
The Kidarites, vassals of the Hephthalite Empire are known to have invaded Taxila in c. 450 CE. Though repelled by the Gupta Emperor Skandagupta, the city would not recover- probably on account of the strong Hunnic presence in the area, breakdown of trade as well as the three-way war among Persia, the Kidarite State, and the Huns in Western Gandhara.

The White Huns and Alchon Huns swept over Gandhāra and Punjab around 470 CE, causing widespread devastation and destruction of Taxila&#x27;s famous Buddhist monasteries and stupas, a blow from which the city would never recover. From 500 CE to 540 CE, the city languished after falling under the control of the Hunnic Empire ruled by Mihirakula. Mihirakula presided over some destruction of Buddhist sites, monasteries and Hindu temples across northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent.

Xuanzang visited India between 629 and 645 CE. Taxila which was desolate and half-ruined was visited by him in 630 CE, and found most of its sangharamas still ruined and desolate. Only a few monks remained there. He adds that the kingdom had become a dependency of Kashmir with the local leaders fighting amongst themselves for power. He noted that it had some time previously been a subject of Kapisa. By the ninth century, it became a dependency of the Kabul Shahis. The Turki Shahi dynasty of Kabul was replaced by the Hindu Shahi dynasty which was overthrown by Mahmud of Ghazni with the defeat of Trilochanpala.

Al-Usaifan&#x27;s king during the reign of Al-Mu&#x27;tasim is said to have converted to Islam by Al-Biladhuri and abandoned his old faith due to the death of his son despite having priests of a temple pray for his recovery. Said to be located between Kashmir, Multan and Kabul, al-Usaifan is identified with kingdom of Taxila by some authors.

==Centre of learning==
By some accounts, Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world. The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was provided on an individualistic basis. Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.

Taxila became a noted centre of learning (including the religious teachings of Historical Vedic Religion and Buddhism) at least several centuries BCE, and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century. It has been suggested that at its height, Taxila exerted a sort of &quot;intellectual suzerainty&quot; over other centres of learning in India and its primary concern was not with elementary, but higher education. Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The ancient and the most revered scriptures, and the Eighteen &quot;Silpas&quot; or Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. Students came to Taxila from far-off places such as Kashi, Kosala and Magadha, in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo, on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there, all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects. The admission to Takshashila 
was not only limited to the students belonging to the elite 
class, some evidence mentions the sons of kings, nobles, 
merchants, tailors, and even fishermen getting education at 
Takshashila.

===Notable students and teachers===
Taxila had great influence on Hindu culture and the Sanskrit language. It is perhaps best known for its association with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, the strategist who guided Chandragupta Maurya and assisted in the founding of the Mauryan empire. The Ayurvedic healer Charaka also studied at Taxila. He also started teaching at Taxila in the later period. Pāṇini, the grammarian who codified the rules that would define Classical Sanskrit, has also been part of the community at Taxila.

Jīvaka, the court physician of the Magadha emperor Bimbisara who once cured the Buddha, and the Buddhism-supporting ruler of Kosala, Prasenajit, are some important personalities mentioned in Pali texts who studied at Taxila.

No external authorities like kings or local leaders subjected the scholastic activities at Taxila to their control. Each teacher formed his own institution, enjoying complete autonomy in work, teaching as many students as he liked and teaching subjects he liked without conforming to any centralised syllabus. Study terminated when the teacher was satisfied with the student&#x27;s level of achievement. In general, specialisation in a subject took around eight years, though this could be lengthened or shortened in accordance with the intellectual abilities and dedication of the student in question. In most cases the &quot;schools&quot; were located within the teachers&#x27; private houses, and at times students were advised to quit their studies if they were unable to fit into the social, intellectual and moral atmosphere there.

Knowledge was considered too sacred to be bartered for money, and hence any stipulation that fees ought to be paid was vigorously condemned. Financial support came from the society at large, as well as from rich merchants and wealthy parents. Though the number of students studying under a single Guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds, teachers did not deny education even if the student was poor; free boarding and lodging was provided, and students had to do manual work in the household. Paying students, such as princes, were taught during the day, while non-paying ones were taught at night. Gurudakshina was usually expected at the completion of a student&#x27;s studies, but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude - many times being nothing more than a turban, a pair of sandals, or an umbrella. In cases of poor students being unable to afford even that, they could approach the king, who would then step in and provide something. Not providing a poor student a means to supply his Guru&#x27;s Dakshina was considered the greatest slur on a King&#x27;s reputation.

Examinations were treated as superfluous, and not considered part of the requirements to complete one&#x27;s studies. The process of teaching was critical and thorough- unless one unit was mastered completely, the student was not allowed to proceed to the next. No convocations were held upon completion, and no written &quot;degrees&quot; were awarded, since it was believed that knowledge was its own reward. Using knowledge for earning a living or for any selfish end was considered sacrilegious.

Students arriving at Taxila usually had completed their primary education at home (until the age of eight), and their secondary education in the Ashrams (between the ages of eight and twelve), and therefore came to Taxila chiefly to reach the ends of knowledge in specific disciplines.

==Ruins==

The sites of a number of important cities noted in ancient Indian texts were identified by scholars early in the 19th century. The lost city of Taxila, however, was not identified until later, in 1863-64. Its identification was made difficult partly due to errors in the distances recorded by Pliny in his Naturalis Historia which pointed to a location somewhere on the Haro river, two days march from the Indus. Alexander Cunningham, the founder and the first director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, noticed that this position did not agree with the descriptions provided in the itineraries of Chinese pilgrims and in particular, that of Xuanzang, the 7th-century Buddhist monk. Unlike Pliny, these sources noted that the journey to Taxila from the Indus took three days and not two. Cunningham&#x27;s subsequent explorations in 1863–64 of a site at Shah-dheri convinced him that his hypothesis was correct.
Taxila&#x27;s archaeological sites lie near modern Taxila about northwest of the city of Rawalpindi. The sites were first excavated by John Marshall, who worked at Taxila over a period of twenty years from 1913.
The vast archaeological site includes neolithic remains dating to 3360 BCE, and Early Harappan remains dating to 2900–2600 BCE at &quot;Sarai Kala&quot;. Taxila, however, is most famous for ruins of several settlements, the earliest dating from around 1000 BCE. It is also known for its collection of Buddhist religious monuments, including the Dharmarajika stupa, the Jaulian monastery, and the Mohra Muradu monastery.

The main ruins of Taxila include four major cities, each belonging to a distinct time period, at three different sites. The earliest settlement at Taxila is found in the Hathial section, which yielded pottery shards that date from as early as the late 2nd millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE. The Bhir Mound ruins at the site date from the 6th century BCE, and are adjacent to Hathial. The ruins of Sirkap date to the 2nd century BCE, and were built by the region&#x27;s Greco-Bactrian kings who ruled in the region following Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of the region in 326 BCE. The third and most recent settlement is that of Sirsukh, which was built by rulers of the Kushan empire, who ruled from nearby Purushapura (modern Peshawar).

=== World Heritage Site ===
Taxila was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 in particular for the ruins of the four settlement sites which &quot;reveal the pattern of urban evolution on the Indian subcontinent through more than five centuries&quot;. The serial site includes a number of monuments and other historical places of note in the area besides the four settlements at Bhir, Saraikala, Sirkap, and Sirsukh. They number 18 in all:

In a 2010 report, Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most &quot;on the Verge&quot; of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. In 2017, it was announced that Thailand would assist in conservation efforts at Taxila, as well as at Buddhist sites in the Swat Valley.

==Geography==
Taxila is located north-west of the Pakistani capital Islamabad. The city is located approximately above sea level.

===Climate===
Taxila features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa)

==Economy==
===Tourism===

Taxila is one of northern Pakistan&#x27;s most important tourist destinations and is home to the Taxila Museum which holds a large number of artifacts from Taxila&#x27;s excavations. Though the number of foreign visitors to the site drastically declined following the start of an Islamist insurgency in Pakistan in 2007, visitor numbers began to noticeably improve by 2017, after the law and order situation in the region had greatly improved following the start of the 2014 &quot;Zarb-e-Azb&quot; campaign launched by the Pakistani Army against radical Islamist militants.

In 2017, the Pakistani government announced its intention to develop Taxila into a site for Buddhist religious pilgrimage. As part of the efforts, it announced that an exhibition on the Buddhist heritage of the region would be held in Thailand, and that the Thai government would assist in conservation efforts at the site. Relics from Taxila were also sent to Sri Lanka for the 2017 &quot;Vesak&quot; holiday as part of an effort to showcase the region&#x27;s Buddhist heritage. The Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation also announced in 2017 that a tour bus service would be launched between the Taxila Museum and Islamabad.

In addition to the ruins of ancient Taxila, relics of Mughal gardens and vestiges of historical Grand Trunk Road are also found in Taxila. Nicholson&#x27;s Obelisk, named in honor of Brigadier John Nicholson who died during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, is a monument from the British era that welcomes travelers arriving from Rawalpindi/Islamabad.

===Industry===
Taxila is home to Heavy Industries Taxila, a major Pakistani defence, military contractor, engineering conglomerate. The city&#x27;s economy is also closely linked to the large Pakistan Ordnance Factories at nearby Wah Cantt, which employs 27,000 people. Cottage and household industries include stoneware, pottery and footwear. Heavy Mechanical Complex is also located in Taxila city.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
Taxila is served by the Taxila Cantonment Junction railway station. Taxila Junction is served by the Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line, and is the southern terminus of the Khunjerab Railway, which connects Taxila to the Havelian railway station. A planned extension of the railway will eventually connect Taxila to China&#x27;s Southern Xinjiang Railway in Kashgar, as part of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.

===Road===

The ancient Grand Trunk Road is designated as N-5 National Highway, and connects the city to the Afghan border, and northern Punjab. The Karakoram Highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in nearby Hasan Abdal, and connects Taxila to the Chinese border near the Hunza Valley.

The city is linked to Peshawar and Islamabad by the M-1 Motorway, which in turn offers wider motorway access to Lahore via the M-2 Motorway, and Faisalabad via the M-4 Motorway.

=== Air===
The nearest airport to Taxila is Islamabad International Airport located 36.5 kilometers away. Peshawar&#x27;s Bacha Khan International Airport is 155 kilometers away.

==Education==

Taxila is home to many secondary educational institutes including CIIT Wah Campus, and HITEC University. The University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila was established in 1975 as a campus of the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, 
and offers bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees in engineering.

==Ancient ruins==
The Ruins of Taxila include four major cities, each belonging to a distinct time period, at three different sites. The earliest settlement at Taxila is found in the Hathial section, which yielded pottery shards that date from as early as the late 2nd millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE. The Bhir Mound ruins at the site date from the 6th century BCE, and are adjacent to &quot;Hathial&quot;. The ruins of Sirkap date to the 2nd century BCE, and were built by the region&#x27;s Greco-Bactrian kings who ruled in the region following Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of the region in 326 BCE. The third and most recent settlement is that of Sirsukh, which was built by rulers of the Kushan empire, who ruled from nearby &quot;Purushapura&quot; (modern Peshawar).

==Culture==
Modern Taxila is a mix of relatively wealthy urban, and poorer rural environs. Urban residential areas are general in the form of planned housing colonies populated by workers of the heavy mechanical complex &amp; heavy industries, educational institutes and hospitals that are located in the area.

===Museums===

Taxila Museum has one of the most significant and comprehensive collections of stone Buddhist sculpture from the first to the seventh centuries in Pakistan (known as Gandharan art. The core of the collection comes from excavated sites in the Taxila Valley, particularly the excavations of Sir John Marshall. Other objects come from excavated sites elsewhere in Gandhara, from donations such as the Ram Das Collection, or from material confiscated by the police and customs authorities.

<text>Symonds Yat is a village in the Wye Valley in the English counties of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, and is a popular tourist destination. It straddles the River Wye, and is within a few miles of Monmouthshire and the Welsh border.

The two settlements either side of the river are known as Symonds Yat West and Symonds Yat East and are linked by a footbridge and passenger ferries. Nearby is Symonds Yat Rock, a scenic hilltop viewpoint. The Seven Sisters Rocks are an outcrop of rocks forming cliffs above the Wye at Symonds Yat.

== Toponym ==
The first recorded use of &quot;Symonds&quot; &quot;Yat&quot; in connection with the area is in a Patent Roll of 1256, where the place appears as &quot;Symundesyate&quot; and &quot;Symondesyate&quot;. This may contain the Old English personal name &quot;Sigemund&quot;, or a very early surname deriving from it. &quot;Yat&quot; represents the Old English word &quot;geat&quot; (pronounced &quot;yat&quot;), meaning &#x27;gate&#x27; and describing the gorge. Thus overall, a familiar cognate translation of the name might be reconstructed &quot;*Sigmund&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Although a popular local belief, it is not true that the addition of &quot;Symonds&quot; was made in the 17th century in reference to Robert Symonds of Sugwas and Evesfield, High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1685, who was indeed a member of the family who owned the lands from Wormelow near Hereford to the border regions in which surround the Yat. The area is also shown as &quot;Symons Yate&quot; on maps in 1665, &quot;Symons Yat&quot; in 1717 and &quot;Symmonds Gate&quot; in 1830.

==History==
Bones from hyenas, sabre-toothed cats and a mammoth have been found in and around the caves of the Wye valley. Human habitation can be traced back to 12,000 years ago with findings of their tools and clothes.

In the Iron Age the forts on the Great Doward and Yat Rock provided secure, defensible settlements for the local residents. During Roman times these forts became focal points in the region and the importance of the iron here and in the Forest of Dean made this a valuable prize for the conquerors. The 8th-century earthwork Offa&#x27;s Dyke runs close to Symonds Yat.

The Yat Gorge was mined for iron ore and remains of a smelting works are located down stream of the Symonds Yat Rapids. The ironworks at New Weir date from the 1590s and were operated by the White family until 1753, when George White leased the site to John Partridge, an ironmonger from Ross on Wye. Partridge combined the ironworks at New Weir with his forge at Lydbrook which smelted pig iron from his furnace at Bishopswood. The works closed when the lease ran out in 1798 and the adjacent weir and lock buildings were demolished and the lock filled in 1814.

The Old Court Hotel in Symonds Yat West, which was built in the 16th century, was the ancestral home of the Gwillim family and was home to John Graves Simcoe, who was governor and one of the founding fathers of Upper Canada.

The ferry at Symonds Yat has always played a huge part in the life here. In 1800 there were 25 hand ferries between Ross and Chepstow just like those outside Ye Old Ferrie Inn and the Saracen&#x27;s Head today. They were introduced in Roman times to link the forts of the Doward and the Yat and have served military, civilian, tourist and horse traffic over the years.

Symonds Yat originally encompassed all the lands south of Huntsham curve on both sides of Symonds Yat Rock and would have included the area around Coldwell Rocks. The name Symonds Yat used to refer to quite a large area of land and the hamlet of Symonds Yat East, consisting of the Saracen&#x27;s Head Inn, the Fish House, Lockkeepers Cottage and one or two cottages on the hillside, was specifically called New Weir and is seen on maps as such up until 1955.

In April 2009 Herefordshire Archaeology excavated New Weir Iron Works at Symonds Yat West to establish how the iron works functioned between the start of smelting in and the decline of the works in the 1800s. It was found that the works included a &#x27;slitting mill&#x27;, for making wire nails and a rolling mill powered by water wheels.

==Symonds Yat East==
Symonds Yat East is on the eastern side of the river. It has three hotels, WyeDean Canoe and Activity Centre and the Saracens Head Inn (with accommodation). A steep footpath leads from the village up to Symonds Yat Rock. Another footpath and a cycleway, constructed on a former railway line, runs on the eastern bank to Monmouth.

==Symonds Yat West==
Symonds Yat West is on the western side of the river and has a large caravan and camping site. Visitor attractions include the &quot;Amazing Hedge Puzzle&quot; maze built in 1977 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, and the Wye Valley Butterfly Zoo. The main village is Whitchurch with a village shop, The Crown pub and The Potting Shed restaurant, which is in a large 1850s reading room with vaulted ceiling. This was built by Lucy Panter, whose sister Amelia commissioned the, now Grade II listed, clock tower in 1867 of red brick with a hipped pyramidal slate roof.

==River crossings==

Two hand (&quot;pull&quot;) cable ferries enable foot passengers to cross the river, powered by ferrymen who pull the ferry across the river using an overhead cable. The only connection by road is upstream over Huntsham bridge; this is a five-mile trip. One ferry is operated by the Saracens Head Inn and the other by the Ye Old Ferrie Inn.

A suspension bridge, Biblins Bridge, was built over the river by the Forestry Commission using local oak timbers in 1957. Linking Symonds Yat East to the Biblins camp site, the bridge was fully refurbished in 1997 and rotten timbers and the two support towers were replaced. Although it is designed to take up to 30 people, it has signs requesting that no more than 6 cross at a time.

==Geographical features==
===Symonds Yat Rock===
Symonds Yat Rock overlooks a spectacular gorge through which the River Wye snakes. This rock is a good viewpoint from which to watch raptors: a pair of peregrine falcons that nest annually within sight of the rock can be watched through telescopes set up by the RSPB. Buzzards, goshawks and hobbies are also regularly seen and it is sometimes possible to see migrant raptors such as ospreys and European honey buzzards.

===Seven Sisters Rocks===
The Seven Sisters Rocks are an outcrop of rocks forming cliffs above the Wye, between Symonds Yat and Monmouth.

==Local activities==
Tourist activities include boat trips, a maze, stand-up paddle boarding (from Ye Old Ferrie Inn), an oriental garden, and a number of country pubs and guest houses.

Symonds Yat Rapids are a grade 2 man-made feature at Symonds Yat used by canoeists and kayakers for whitewater training and playboating.

There is extensive and popular rock climbing on the cliff faces of Carboniferous limestone, with long single pitches at all grades.

==Railways==

Symonds Yat station, on the east side of the river, was on the Ross and Monmouth Railway that ran from Ross-on-Wye to Monmouth Troy between 1873 and 1959 through the Wye Valley. A trace of this remains at Symonds Yat Tunnel.

<doc id="229668" wikidata="Q1066253" url="?curid=229668" title="Siege of Vicksburg">
<text>The Siege of Vicksburg (May 18 – July 4, 1863) was the final major military action in the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War. In a series of maneuvers, Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Tennessee crossed the Mississippi River and drove the Confederate Army of Mississippi, led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton, into the defensive lines surrounding the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, leading to the successful siege and Confederate surrender.

Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. When two major assaults against the Confederate fortifications, on May 19 and 22, were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After holding out for more than 40 days, with their supplies nearly gone, the garrison surrendered on July 4. The Vicksburg campaign&#x27;s successful ending significantly degraded the Confederacy&#x27;s ability to maintain its war effort. This action, combined with a siege that led to the surrender of the downriver Port Hudson to Major General Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, which held it for the rest of the conflict.

The Confederate surrender on July 4, 1863 is sometimes considered, combined with General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s defeat at Gettysburg by Major General George Meade the previous day, the war&#x27;s turning point. It cut off the Trans-Mississippi Department (containing the states of Arkansas, Texas and part of Louisiana) from the rest of the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the rest of the war. Lincoln called Vicksburg &quot;the key to the war&quot;.

==Background==
===Military situation===

After crossing the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts to stop the Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north, and so had no choice but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and devastated the countryside as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.

The Confederates evacuated Hayne&#x27;s Bluff, which was subsequently occupied by Sherman&#x27;s cavalry on May 19, and Union steamboats no longer had to run the guns of Vicksburg, now being able to dock by the dozens up the Yazoo River. Grant could now receive supplies more directly than by the previous route, which ran through Louisiana, over the river crossing at Grand Gulf and Bruinsburg, then back up north.

Over half of Pemberton&#x27;s army had been lost in the two preceding battles and many in Vicksburg expected General Joseph E. Johnston, in command of the Confederate Department of the West, to relieve the city—which he never did. Large numbers of Union troops were on the march to invest the city. They repaired the bridges over the Big Black River and crossed on May 18. Johnston sent a note to his general, Pemberton, asking him to sacrifice the city and save his troops, something Pemberton would not do. Pemberton, a Northerner by birth, was probably influenced by his fear of public condemnation if he abandoned Vicksburg.

=== Fortifications ===
As the Union forces approached Vicksburg, Pemberton could put only 18,000 troops in his lines. Grant had over 35,000, with more on the way. However, Pemberton had the advantage of terrain and fortifications that made his defense nearly impregnable. The defensive line around Vicksburg ran for approximately , based on terrain of varying elevations that included hills and knobs with steep slopes which would require an attacker to ascend them under fire. The perimeter included many gun pits, forts, trenches, redoubts, and lunettes. The major fortifications of the line included: Fort Hill, on a high bluff north of the city; the Stockade Redan, dominating the approach to the city on Graveyard Road from the northeast; the 3rd Louisiana Redan; the Great Redoubt; the Railroad Redoubt, protecting the gap for the railroad line entering the city; the Square Fort (Fort Garrott); a salient along the Hall&#x27;s Ferry Road; and the South Fort.

==Opposing forces==
=== Union ===
Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Union Army of the Tennessee brought five corps to the siege:
* IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John Parke;
* XIII Corps, under Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand;
* XV Corps, under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman;
* XVI Corps (detachment), under Maj. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn;
* XVII Corps, under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson.

=== Confederate ===

Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton&#x27;s Confederate Army of Mississippi inside the Vicksburg line consisted of four divisions, under Maj. Gens.:
*Carter L. Stevenson;
*John H. Forney;
*Martin L. Smith;
*John S. Bowen.

== Siege ==
=== Assaults ===

Grant wanted to overwhelm the Confederates before they could fully organize their defenses and ordered an assault against the Stockade Redan for May 19. Troops from Sherman&#x27;s corps had a difficult time approaching the position under rifle and artillery fire from the 36th Mississippi Infantry, Brig. Gen. Louis Hébert&#x27;s brigade. They had to negotiate a steep ravine protected by abatis and cross a , ditch before attacking the walls of the redan. This first attempt was easily repulsed. Grant ordered an artillery bombardment to soften the defenses and at about 2 pm, Sherman&#x27;s division under Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair tried again, but only a small number of men were able to advance even as far as the ditch below the redan. The assault collapsed in an exchange of rifle fire and hand grenades lobbing back and forth.

The failed Union assaults of May 19 damaged troop morale, deflating the confidence the soldiers had felt after their string of victories across Mississippi. They were also costly, with 157 killed, 777 wounded, and eight missing, versus Confederate casualties of eight killed and 62 wounded. The Confederates, assumed to be demoralized, had regained their fighting edge.

Grant planned another assault for May 22, but this time with greater care; his troops would first reconnoiter thoroughly and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.

Despite their bloody repulse on May 19, Union troops were in high spirits, now well-fed with provisions they had foraged. On seeing Grant pass by, a soldier commented, &quot;Hardtack&quot;. Soon all Union troops in the vicinity were yelling, &quot;Hardtack! Hardtack!&quot; The Union served hardtack, beans, and coffee the night of May 21. Everyone expected that Vicksburg would fall the next day.

Union forces bombarded the city all night, from 220 artillery pieces and with naval gunfire from Rear Adm. David D. Porter&#x27;s fleet in the river. While causing little property damage, they damaged Confederate civilian morale. On the morning of May 22, the defenders were bombarded again for four hours before the Union attacked once more along a front at 10 am.

Sherman attacked once again down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the forlorn hope detachment) leading the way with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments. They hoped to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back in the face of heavy rifle fire. Blair&#x27;s brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green&#x27;s Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle&#x27;s division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman&#x27;s far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.

McPherson&#x27;s corps was assigned to attack the center along Jackson Road. On their right flank, the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas E. G. Ransom advanced to within 100 yards of the Confederate line, but halted to avoid dangerous flanking fire from Green&#x27;s Redan. On McPherson&#x27;s left flank, the division of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was assigned to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John E. Smith made it as far as the slope of the redan, but huddled there, dodging grenades until dark, when they were recalled. Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson&#x27;s brigade advanced in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. Brig. Gen. Isaac F. Quinby&#x27;s division advanced a few hundred yards, but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.

On the Union left, McClernand&#x27;s corps moved along the Baldwin Ferry Road and astride the Southern Railroad of Mississippi. The division of Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr was assigned to capture the Railroad Redoubt and the 2nd Texas Lunette; the division of Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus was assigned the Square Fort. Carr&#x27;s men achieved a small breakthrough at the 2nd Texas Lunette and requested reinforcements.

By 11 am, it was clear that a breakthrough was not forthcoming and that the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson&#x27;s corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts—&quot;The Stars and Stripes are flying over them.&quot;—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. In fact, more than a dozen members of the 22nd Iowa Infantry Regiment had secured a tenuous foothold in a portion of the fortification known as the Railroad Redoubt, and forced Confederate defenders back from that point, though the Iowans could not advance further. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby&#x27;s division to aid McClernand.
Sherman ordered two more assaults. At 2:15 pm, Giles Smith and Ransom moved out and were repulsed immediately. At 3 pm, Tuttle&#x27;s division suffered so many casualties in their aborted advance that Sherman told Tuttle, &quot;This is murder; order those troops back.&quot; By this time, Steele&#x27;s division had finally maneuvered into position on Sherman&#x27;s right, and at 4 pm, Steele gave the order to charge against the 26th Louisiana Redoubt. They had no more success than any of Sherman&#x27;s other assaults.

In McPherson&#x27;s sector, Logan&#x27;s division made another thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 pm, but met with heavy losses and the attack was called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby&#x27;s division, but with no success. Union casualties for the day totalled 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about evenly divided across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but are estimated to have been under 500. Grant blamed McClernand&#x27;s misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.

=== Siege operations ===
Shelby Foote wrote that Grant &quot;did not regret having made the assaults; he only regretted that they had failed.&quot; Grant reluctantly settled into a siege. On May 25, Lt. Col. John A. Rawlins issued Special Orders No. 140 for Grant: Grant wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I now determined upon a regular siege—to &#x27;out-camp the enemy,&#x27; as it were, and to incur no more losses.&quot;

When the Federal troops started to dig in, they built complicated defenses that soldiers at the time called &quot;ditches.&quot; These went all the way around the city and got closer and closer to the Confederate defenses. With their backs against the Mississippi and Union gunboats firing from the river, Confederate soldiers and citizens alike were trapped. Pemberton was determined to hold his few miles of the Mississippi as long as possible, hoping for relief from Johnston or elsewhere.

A new problem confronted the Confederates. The dead and wounded of Grant&#x27;s army lay in the heat of Mississippi summer, the odor of the deceased men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead on May 25, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.

After this truce, Grant&#x27;s army began to fill the ring around Vicksburg. It soon became clear that even 50,000 Union soldiers would not be able to effect a complete encirclement of the Confederate defenses. Pemberton&#x27;s outlook on escape was pessimistic, but there were still roads leading south out of Vicksburg unguarded by Union troops. Grant sought help from Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, the Union general-in-chief. Halleck quickly began to shift Union troops in the West to meet Grant&#x27;s needs. The first of these reinforcements was a 5,000-man division from the Department of the Missouri under Maj. Gen. Francis J. Herron on June 11. Herron&#x27;s troops, remnants of the Army of the Frontier, were attached to McPherson&#x27;s corps and took up position on the far south. Next came a three division detachment from XVI Corps led by Brig. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn on June 12, assembled from troops at the nearby posts of Corinth, Memphis, and LaGrange. The final significant group of reinforcements to join was the 8,000-man strong IX Corps from the Department of the Ohio, led by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, arriving on June 14. With the arrival of Parke, Grant had 77,000 men around Vicksburg.

In an effort to cut Grant&#x27;s supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker attacked Milliken&#x27;s Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was largely defended by recently enlisted United States colored troops. They repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at heavy cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken&#x27;s Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief other than from the cautious Johnston.

Pemberton was boxed in with plentiful munitions but little food. The poor diet was telling on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other diseases cut their ranks. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.
During the siege, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells into the town and army artillery fire was even heavier. As the barrages continued, suitable housing in Vicksburg was reduced to a minimum. A ridge, located between the main town and the rebel defense line, provided lodging for the duration. Over 500 caves, known locally as &quot;bombproofs&quot;, were dug into the yellow clay hills of Vicksburg. Whether houses were structurally sound or not, it was deemed safer to occupy these dugouts. People did their best to make them comfortable, with rugs, furniture, and pictures. They tried to time their movements and foraging with the rhythm of the cannonade, sometimes unsuccessfully. Because of the citizens&#x27; burrowing, the Union soldiers gave the town the nickname of &quot;Prairie Dog Village&quot;. Despite the ferocity of the Union fire, fewer than a dozen civilians are known to have been killed during the siege.

=== Command changes ===
One of Grant&#x27;s actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. He had received permission to relieve McClernand in January 1863 but waited for an unequivocal provocation; McClernand was relieved on June 18. Grant so carefully prepared his action that McClernand was left without recourse. McClernand&#x27;s XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, who had recovered from an October 1862 wound sustained at Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge. In May 1864, McClernand would be given a command in a remote area of Texas.

Another command change occurred on June 22. In addition to Pemberton in Vicksburg, Grant had to be aware of Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg; both acted as covering forces. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant&#x27;s command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, who was gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would pursue Johnston and recapture Jackson on July 17.

=== Louisiana operations ===
Throughout the siege Union and Confederate forces kept busy in a supporting role on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River. Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, received a telegraph from Pemberton on May 9 requesting that he move against Grant&#x27;s communication lines along the Mississippi River. Grant had established important supply depots at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, Young&#x27;s Point, and Lake Providence, all within Smith&#x27;s jurisdiction, but Smith failed to recognize the importance of Pemberton&#x27;s situation. It was not until June when Smith finally took action on Pemberton&#x27;s request, directing Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor to &quot;do something&quot; in support of the Vicksburg garrison. Taylor commanded the District of Western Louisiana and developed a three-pronged campaign against Grant&#x27;s three supply depots. All three of Taylor&#x27;s assaults were defeated at the Battle of Milliken&#x27;s Bend, the Battle of Young&#x27;s Point, and the Battle of Lake Providence.

In response to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided to dispatch troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker&#x27;s Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid any Confederate attempt to escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet&#x27;s Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower&#x27;s brigade from Sherman&#x27;s corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken&#x27;s Bend. Mower and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker&#x27;s division, which was stationed in the vicinity of Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond was also an important supply line providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and Mower defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond.

Ellet&#x27;s men returned to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron foundry recasting spent Union artillery shells. Construction was begun on June 19, which placed a 20-pounder Parrott rifle in a casemate of railroad iron. The targeted foundry was destroyed on June 25 and the next day a second Parrott gun was added to the battery, which continued to harass the defenders until the garrison&#x27;s surrender.

Additional Confederate activity in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich&#x27;s Landing when they attacked a plantation and an army training center run by former slaves. The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured over a hundred former slaves before disengaging in the face of Ellet&#x27;s Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and demonstrated that the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.

=== Crater at the Third Louisiana Redan ===
Late in the siege, Union troops tunneled under the 3rd Louisiana Redan and packed the mine with 2,200 pounds of gunpowder. The explosion blew apart the Confederate lines on June 25, while an infantry attack made by troops from Logan&#x27;s XVII Corps division followed the blast. The 45th Illinois Regiment (known as the &quot;Lead Mine Regiment&quot;), under Col. Jasper A. Maltby, charged into the diameter, deep crater with ease, but were stopped by recovering Confederate infantry. The Union soldiers became pinned down and the defenders rolled artillery shells with short fuses into the pit with deadly results. Union engineers worked to set up a casemate in the crater in order to extricate the infantry, and soon the soldiers fell back to a new defensive line. From the crater left by the explosion, Union miners worked to dig a new mine to the south. On July 1, this mine was detonated but no infantry attack followed. Pioneers worked throughout July 2 and 3 to widen the initial crater to be large enough for an infantry column of four to pass through for any future assault. However, events the following day negated the need for any further assaults.

=== Capture ===
On July 3, Pemberton sent a note to Grant regarding the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, as he had done at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. He then reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute and starving state, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat to the rest of the Confederacy. In any event, shipping that many prisoners north would have occupied his army and taken months. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman&#x27;s invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges for most of the remainder of the war except for hardship cases. Exchanges wouldn&#x27;t resume until January of 1865. When the captured 26th, 27th, 29th, and 31st Louisiana Infantry Regiments were exchanged in 1863 and 1864, many of the paroled soldiers failed to report for duty and remained at their homes. Those Louisianans who returned to active duty were never again used in combat.

Surrender was formalized by an old oak tree, &quot;made historical by the event&quot;. In his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;, Grant described the fate of this luckless tree:


The surrender was finalized on July 4, Independence Day, a day Pemberton had hoped would bring more sympathetic terms from the United States. Although the Vicksburg campaign continued with some minor actions, the fortress city had fallen and, with the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, the Mississippi River was firmly in Union hands and the Confederacy split in two. President Lincoln famously announced, &quot;The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.&quot;

Union casualties for the battle and siege of Vicksburg were 4,835; Confederate were 32,697, of whom 29,495 had surrendered. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded. In addition to the men under his command, Pemberton turned over to Grant 172 cannons and 50,000 rifles.
== Aftermath ==

Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. The successful ending of the Vicksburg campaign significantly degraded the ability of the Confederacy to maintain its war effort. This action, combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, who would hold it for the rest of the conflict.

The Confederate surrender at 10:00 AM on July 4, 1863, is sometimes considered, when combined with Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s July 3 defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen. George Meade, the turning point of the war. It cut off the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas from the rest of the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war. The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the Trans-Mississippi Department and the balance of the Confederacy.

Folk tradition holds that the Fourth of July (Independence Day) holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until World War II. This claim is inaccurate, for large Independence Day celebrations were held as early as 1907.

== Battlefield preservation ==
The works around Vicksburg are now maintained by the National Park Service as part of Vicksburg National Military Park. The park, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Delta, Louisiana (flanking the Mississippi River), also commemorates the greater Vicksburg campaign which led up to the battle and includes reconstructed forts and trenches. The park includes 1,325 historic monuments and markers, of historic trenches and earthworks, a tour road, a walking trail, two antebellum homes, 144 emplaced cannons, the restored gunboat USS &quot;Cairo&quot; (sunk on December 12, 1862, on the Yazoo River), and the Grant&#x27;s Canal site, where the Union Army attempted to build a canal to let their ships bypass Confederate artillery fire.

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved more than of the Vicksburg battlefield through mid-2023.

In early 2020, torrential rainfalls caused catastrophic damage to Vicksburg National Military Park. Erosion of the park&#x27;s vulnerable loess soil has been an ongoing issue for the park over the decades, but this event was devastating, undermining large swaths of the hilly landscape, buckling miles of the park&#x27;s roads and washing out portions of Vicksburg National Cemetery, endangering the remains.

<text>The American Himalayan Foundation (AHF) is a non-profit organization in the United States that helps Tibetans, Sherpas, and Nepalis living throughout the Himalayas. AHF builds schools, plants trees, trains doctors, funds hospitals, takes care of children and the elderly, and restores sacred sites. The San Francisco-based organization also helps Tibetans rebuild and maintain their culture both in exile and inside Tibet.

It was founded by Richard C. Blum. The late Sir Edmund Hillary was a Director of the foundation for more than 20 years.

==Overview==

The American Himalayan Foundation was established by San Francisco financier Richard Blum after his first trip through the mountains of Nepal in 1968. During this trip, he developed an interest in the local people and the poverty in which they lived. Blum started helping Sherpa children informally, and in 1980 he set up the American Himalayan Foundation (AHF). Because many people in Nepal and Tibet live without healthcare, education, clean water, or bridges connecting remote villages; Blum created the foundation to address these problems.

The foundation&#x27;s first partner was Sir Edmund Hillary, assisting the Sherpas through his Himalayan Trust. Also in the early years, the 14th Dalai Lama requested that AHF help the growing number of Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India. AHF has provided education, healthcare, and basic assistance to Tibetans for over 20 years. As AHF grew, the 501(c)(3) charity continued to work with the Sherpas and Tibetans in exile, but expanded its geographic reach to people throughout Nepal, inside Tibet, and in Bhutan. The foundation helps the most vulnerable: poor children and the elderly, girls in remote villages at risk of being trafficked, disabled children, refugees, and people in need of medical care.

All AHF-supported projects involve community participation, in order to build local capacity and to ensure the foundation is responding to community needs. Funds are not used to pay for western volunteers. All the donations raised by the foundation go directly to helping Sherpas, Nepalis, and Tibetans inside Tibet and in exile.

==Projects==
AHF supports over 150 projects throughout the Himalayas and touches the lives of 300,000 people each year. The foundation provides healthcare through community clinics, the training of local healthcare workers, and the Hospital and Rehabilitation Center for Disabled Children in Banepa. AHF educates over fifteen thousand children a year, including ten thousand girls who would otherwise be vulnerable to being trafficked to brothels in India. The foundation developed the Tibetan Enterprise Fund to help Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India, who lack the same rights as citizens, start income generating businesses. AHF also supports orphanages, day care centers for the very young, care for the disabled, and clean water systems and bridges for nomads in Tibet. Beginning in 1995, the organization was involved with the restoration of 15th century Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the former Kingdom of Mustang and is also extensively involved with humanitarian work in Mustang.

<text>A tug of war tournament was held on 16 July at Catalan Cross, Boulogne Forest in Paris as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. The only match of the tournament was between a mixed team from the Racing Club de France, consisting of five French and one Colombian athlete, and a mixed team consisting of three Danish athletes and three Swedish athletes. The mixed Scandinavian team won the match 2–0.

Originally, the Racing Club team were scheduled to face a team from the United States, but the latter had to withdraw due to a scheduling clash with the hammer throw, which three of their team were competing in. 

The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, with their team composed of five athletes who were competing in other events and one journalist, Edgar Aabye. 

The Scandinavian team won both of the first two pulls against the French/Colombian team in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal.

Due to a second unofficial match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.

==Background==
The modern Olympic Games were first held in Athens in 1896, and travelled to Paris four years later as part of the 1900 Exposition Universelle world&#x27;s fair. The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. 

Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament: Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. 

However, the American team were forced to withdraw after they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled at the same time as the hammer throw, in which three of their team members were competing.

A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt, who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Fredrik Bergh.

==Team composition==

The French team, representing the Racing Club de France, included 3 players who were later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, but this was a case of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría taking part in the tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes each from Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the pole vault and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot put and the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the pole vault, triple jump, standing triple jump and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish pullers took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot put and discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the &quot;Politiken&quot; newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.

==Match==
The match was played as a best-of-three. The mixed Scandinavian team won both of the first two pulls, using their greater weight, particularly that of Söderström and Winckler, to their advantage. The Swedish paper &quot;Ny Tidning för Idrott&quot; reported that the French team &quot;put up desperate resistance&quot; but were unable to cope with their opponents. There are sources that report that the Scandinavian team won by two pulls to one, but the majority record it as a 2–0 victory.

===Confusion===
As late as 1974, the &quot;Olympic Review&quot; listed the United States team of John Flanagan, Robert Garrett, Truxton Hare, Josiah McCracken, Lewis Sheldon and Richard Sheldon as the gold medalists for the 1900 tug of war. A report in the Paris edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; described the tug of war contest at the Olympic Games as being &quot;an object lesson in how not to do a thing&quot;. The report mentioned the Scandinavian team&#x27;s defeat of France, before detailing a second match between an American team and the Scandinavians.

The &quot;New York Herald&quot; recorded that in the second contest, a group of Americans formed a team to take on the victorious Scandinavians, beating them in two pulls, the second of which took over five minutes. In contrast, the &quot;Journal des Sports&quot; suggested that the Americans initially wanted to wear spiked shoes to take part in the match, but were then forced to remove them after protests. They then won the first pull against the mixed Swedish/Danish team, but during the second pull, some of their compatriots joined in pulling the rope to help the tiring team. A fight nearly broke out, but was avoided by the intervention of officials. 

Regardless of the result of this second contest, it was not considered to be part of the official competition, but rather a private contest, so the United States are not considered to have officially taken part.

<text>The Brigach is the shorter of two streams that jointly form the river Danube in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The Brigach has its source at above sea level within St. Georgen in the Black Forest. The Brigach crosses the city Villingen-Schwenningen. from the source, the Brigach joins the Breg in Donaueschingen to form the Danube River.

== Name ==
The name Brigach is of Celtic origin and means &quot;light coloured, pure water&quot;. A relief found here points to the goddess, Abnoba.

== Geography ==
=== Sources ===

One source of the Brigach is impounded in the cellar of a farmhouse in the upper valley near the village of Brigach and may be visited by the public. On the official state water map the Brigach begins, however, at a height of about somewhat below a small pond near this farm in the borough of Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald.

== Course ==
The Brigach flows initially along a gently descending course and roughly east-north-east through the landscape of the Black Forest, which consists here of open fields across the width of the valley with woods on the accompanying heights, before reaching the first large village of Sankt Georgen. From here Baden&#x27;s Black Forest Railway runs down to the mouth of the valley. In Sankt Georgen, the river is already 100 metres below the surrounding highland and it now swings slowly around the woods of the &quot;Röhlinswald&quot; on the right to head southeast through a typical high Black Forest landscape of scattered settlements. By the place where the Brigach is joined from the WNW by its first long tributary, the &quot;Röhlinsbach&quot;, it leaves the parish of Sankt Georgen and enters a valley called the &quot;Groppertal&quot;, a protected landscape about half a square kilometre in area, which lies within the municipality of Unterkirnach and the town of Villingen-Schwenningen. It continues down the valley until it is joined, near Kirnach railway station outside the village of Villingen, by its most important tributary, the Kirnach which has a length of over 12 kilometres and a catchment of 33 km2. In this area the Birgach runs for just under a quarter of a kilometre alongside the railway line which itself runs close to the right side of the valley, below the hillside.

Shortly thereafter, the Brigach leaves the Black Forest behind, about halfway along its course, and enters the much flatter Baar region near Villingen, which is dominated by open countryside, with larger settlements than in its upper reaches. In the middle of the town, it changes direction to the south and receives a number of tributaries from the north, of which two are from the Black Forest to the west and are more than 10 kilometres long: the &quot;Warenbach&quot;, whose confluence is in the borough of Villingen, and the &quot;Holenbach&quot; whose confluence is in the next municipality of Brigachtal. Below the village of Klengen, the Brigach passes over the boundary of the district into the borough of Donaueschingen. Once again, the valley passes through wooded hills, the river develops meanders and then swings left on an easterly course through the urban part of the borough. In the left-hand part of the castle park, a karst spring, which has been regarded as a source of the Danube for centuries and whose upper reaches are called the &quot;Donaubach&quot; (&quot;Danube Stream&quot;) is routed underground through the park into the Brigach. Its confluence is marked by a temple dedicated to the former German Emperor, Kaiser William II. Compared with its two headstreams, this source of the Danube is, however, hydrologically insignificant. A mile and a half east of the &quot;Donaubach&quot; spring, the Brigach unites with the Breg, a river which joins from the right and originates in the High Black Forest, to form the River Danube.

The Brigach descends through more than 250 metres during its course which is approximately 40.5 kilometres long.

== Catchment ==
The Brigach&#x27;s catchment covers an area of 196.7 km2 and lies entirely within the county of Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, almost two-thirds within the Black Forest, the remaining eastern area is part of the Baar. Within its catchment the Brigach flows very close to its northern and then eastern side. Through the centre of the catchment is the Kirnach which flows very consistently towards the south-southeast and rises very close to the source of the Brigach. The watershed, which is close to the Kirnach to the northwest, separates it from the catchment of the Gutach which flows via the Kinzig into the River Rhine and, in its subsequent northeasterly course from the Schiltach to the upper Kinzig. Beyond the long northeastern watershed the upper Neckar and its tributaries also drain into the Rhine. On the remaining outer edge of the catchment, by contrast, precipitation flows into the Danube. In front of the short southeastern boundary there are only a few significant tributaries into this river. Beyond the long southwestern perimeter lies the considerably larger catchment (291.5 km2) of the right-hand Danube tributary, the Breg.

The highest point in the catchment is about a kilometre southwest of the source on the summit of the Kesselberg (). This is the tripoint of the catchments of the Gutach to the northwest, the Brigach to the east and the Breg to the southwest.

<doc id="229679" wikidata="Q3993" url="?curid=229679" title="Jacqueline Cochran">
<text>Jacqueline Cochran (May 11, 1906 – August 9, 1980) was an American pilot and business executive. She pioneered women&#x27;s aviation as one of the most prominent racing pilots of her generation. She set numerous records and was the first woman to break the sound barrier on 18 May 1953. Cochran (along with Nancy Love) was the wartime head of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) (1943–1944), which employed about 1000 civilian American women in a non-combat role to ferry planes from factories to port cities. Cochran was later a sponsor of the Mercury 13 women astronaut program.

==Early life==

Jacqueline Cochran, born Bessie Lee Pittman, in Pensacola, (some sources indicate she was born in DeFuniak Springs) in the Florida Panhandle, was the youngest of the five children of Mary (Grant) and Ira Pittman, a skilled millwright who frequently relocated setting up and reworking sawmills. While her family was not wealthy, Cochran&#x27;s childhood living in small-town Florida was similar to those in other families of the era. Contrary to some accounts, there was always food on the table and she was not adopted, as she often claimed.

Circa 1920, (she would have been 13 or 14), she married Robert Cochran and gave birth to a son, Robert, who died in 1925 at the age of 5. After the marriage ended, she kept the name Cochran and began using Jacqueline or Jackie as her given name. Cochran then became a hairdresser and got a job in Pensacola, eventually moving to New York City. There, she used her looks and driving personality to get a job at a prestigious salon at Saks Fifth Avenue.

Although Cochran denied her family and her past, she remained in touch with them and provided for them over the years. Some of her family moved to her ranch in California after she remarried. They were instructed to always say they were her adopted family. Cochran apparently wanted to hide from the public the early chapters of her life and was successful in doing so until after her death.

Later Cochran met Floyd Bostwick Odlum, founder of Atlas Corp and CEO of RKO in Hollywood. Fourteen years her senior, he was reputed to be one of the 10 wealthiest men in the world. Odlum became enamored of Cochran and offered to help her establish a cosmetics business.

After a friend offered her a ride in an aircraft, Cochran began taking flying lessons at Roosevelt Airfield, Long Island in the early 1930s and learned to fly an aircraft in three weeks. She then soloed and within two years obtained her commercial pilot&#x27;s license. Odlum, whom she married in 1936 after his divorce, was an astute financier and savvy marketer who recognized the value of publicity for her business. Calling her line of cosmetics &quot;Wings to Beauty&quot;, she flew her own aircraft around the country promoting her products. Years later, Odlum used his Hollywood connections to get Marilyn Monroe to endorse Cochran&#x27;s line of lipstick.

==Contributions to aviation==


Known by her friends as &quot;Jackie&quot;, and maintaining the Cochran name, she was one of three women to compete in the MacRobertson Air Race in 1934. In 1937, she was the only woman to compete in the Bendix race and worked with Amelia Earhart to open the race to women. That year, she also set a new women&#x27;s world speed record. By 1938, she was considered the best female pilot in the United States. She had won the Bendix and set a new transcontinental speed record as well as altitude records. Cochran was the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic. She won five Harmon Trophies. Sometimes called the &quot;Speed Queen&quot;, at the time of her death she held more speed, distance, or altitude records in aviation history than any other pilot.

===Ninety-Nines===
Cochran was a friend of Amelia Earhart. Although she was not a founding member of the Ninety-Nines, she was one of their most influential members. She was president of the Ninety-Nines from 1941 to 1943, and was instrumental in ensuring that women pilots would be able to participate in the newly-founded Civil Air Patrol as well as the WASP. In her monthly editorials for the Ninety-Nines Newsletter, she exhorted members to join the CAP or the WASP, and to do what they could to help the war effort.

===Air Transport Auxiliary===
Before the United States joined World War II, Cochran was part of &quot;Wings for Britain&quot;, an organization that ferried American-built aircraft to Britain, becoming the first woman to fly a bomber (a Lockheed Hudson V) across the Atlantic. In Britain, she volunteered her services to the Royal Air Force. For several months she worked for the British Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), recruiting qualified women pilots in the United States and taking them to England where they joined the ATA. Cochran attained the rank of Flight Captain (equivalent to a Squadron Leader in the RAF or a Major in the U.S. Air Force) in the ATA.

===Women Airforce Service Pilots===
In September, 1939, Cochran wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt to introduce the proposal of starting a women&#x27;s flying division in the Army Air Forces. She felt that qualified women pilots could do all of the domestic, noncombat aviation jobs necessary to release more male pilots for combat. She pictured herself in command of these women, with the same standings as Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, who was then the director of the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC). (The WAAC was given full military status on July 1, 1943, thus making them part of the Army. At the same time, the unit was renamed Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC).)

That same year, Cochran wrote a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Robert Olds, who was helping to organize the Air Corps Ferrying Command for the Air Corps at the time. (Ferrying Command was originally a courier/aircraft delivery service, but evolved into the air transport branch of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as the Air Transport Command). In the letter, Cochran suggested that women pilots be employed to fly non-combat missions for the new command. In early 1941, Olds asked Cochran to find out how many women pilots there were in the United States, what their flying times were, their skills, their interest in flying for the country, and personal information about them. She used records from the Civil Aeronautics Administration to gather the data.

In spite of pilot shortages, Army Air Forces commander Lieutenant General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold still needed to be convinced that women pilots were the solution to his staffing problems. He knew that women were being used successfully in the ATA in England so Arnold suggested that Cochran take a group of qualified female pilots to see how the British were doing. He promised her that no decisions regarding women flying for the USAAF would be made until she returned.

When Arnold asked Cochran to go to Britain to study the ATA, Cochran asked 76 of the most qualified female pilots – identified during the research she had done earlier for Olds – to come along and fly for the ATA. Qualifications for these women were high: at least 300 hours of flying time, but most of the women pilots had over 1,000 hours. Those who made it to Canada found out that the washout rate was also high. A total of 25 women passed the tests and, two months later in March 1942 they went to Britain with Cochran to join the ATA.

While Cochran was in England, in September 1942, General Arnold authorized the formation of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) under the direction of Nancy Harkness Love. The WAFS began at New Castle Air Base in Wilmington, Delaware, with a group of female pilots whose objective was to ferry military aircraft. Hearing about the WAFS, Cochran immediately returned from England. Cochran&#x27;s experience in Britain with the ATA convinced her that women pilots could be trained to do much more than ferrying. As she lobbied Arnold for expanded flying opportunities for female pilots, he sanctioned the creation of the Women&#x27;s Flying Training Detachment (WFTD), headed by Cochran. In August 1943, the WAFS and the WFTD merged to create the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) with Cochran as director and Nancy Love as head of the ferrying division.

As director of the WASP, Cochran supervised the training of hundreds of women pilots at the former Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas from August 1943 to December 1944.

===Award of the Distinguished Service Medal===
For her wartime service, she received the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1945. Her award of the DSM was announced in a War Department press release dated March 1, 1945 which stated that Cochran was the first woman civilian to receive the DSM, which was then the highest non-combat award presented by the United States government. (In actuality, however, a few civilian women received the DSM for service during the First World War. These women included Hannah J. Patterson and Anna Howard Shaw of the Council of National Defense, Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army as well as Mary Vail Andress and Jane A. Delano of the American Red Cross.)

==Postwar==

At war&#x27;s end, Cochran was hired by a magazine to report on global postwar events. In this role, she witnessed Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita&#x27;s surrender in the Philippines and was then the first non-Japanese woman to enter Japan after the War. She also attended the Nuremberg Trials in Germany.

On September 9, 1948, Cochran joined the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a lieutenant colonel. She was promoted to colonel in 1969 and retired in 1970. She was probably the first woman pilot in the United States Air Force. During her career in the Air Force Reserve, she received three awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross for various achievements from 1947 to 1964.

===Flying records===
Postwar, Cochran began flying the new jet aircraft, setting numerous records. She became the first woman pilot to &quot;go supersonic&quot;.

In 1952, Cochran, at age 47, decided to challenge the world speed record for women, then held by Jacqueline Auriol. She tried to borrow an F-86 from the U.S. Air Force, but was refused. She was introduced to an Air Vice-Marshal of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) who, with the permission of the Canadian Minister of Defence, arranged for her to borrow 19200, the sole Canadair Sabre 3. Canadair sent a 16-man support team to California for the attempt. On 18 May 1953, Cochran set a new 100 km speed record of 1,050.15 km/h (652.5 mph). Later on 3 June, she set a new 15 km closed circuit record of 1078 km/h (670 mph). Encouraged by then-Major Chuck Yeager, with whom Cochran shared a lifelong friendship, on May 18, 1953, at Rogers Dry Lake, California, Cochran flew the Sabre 3 at an average speed of 652.337 mph. During the course of this run the Sabre went supersonic, and Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier.

Among her many record accomplishments, from August to October 1961, as a consultant to Northrop Corporation, Cochran set a series of speed, distance and altitude records while flying a Northrop T-38A-30-NO Talon supersonic trainer, serial number 60-0551. On the final day of the record series, she set two Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) world records, taking the T-38 to altitudes of 55,253 feet (16,841 m) in horizontal flight and reaching a peak altitude of 56,073 feet (17,091 m).

Cochran was also the first woman to land and take off from an aircraft carrier, the first woman to pilot a bomber across the North Atlantic (in 1941) and later to fly a jet aircraft on a transatlantic flight, the first woman to make a blind (instrument) landing, the only woman ever to be president of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (1958–1961), the first woman to fly a fixed-wing, jet aircraft across the Atlantic, the first pilot to fly above 20,000 feet (6,096 m) with an oxygen mask, and the first woman to enter the Bendix Transcontinental Race. She still holds more distance and speed records than any pilot living or dead, male or female.

Because of her interest in all forms of aviation, Cochran flew the Goodyear Blimp in the early 1960s with Goodyear Blimp Captain R. W. Crosier in Akron, Ohio.

===Mercury 13===
In the 1960s, Cochran was a sponsor of the Mercury 13 program, an early effort to test the ability of women to be astronauts. Thirteen women pilots passed the same preliminary tests as the male astronauts of the Mercury program before the program was cancelled. It was never a NASA initiative, though it was spearheaded by two members of the NASA Life Sciences Committee, one of whom, William Randolph Lovelace II, was a close friend of Cochran and her husband. Though Cochran initially supported the program, she was later responsible for delaying further phases of testing, and letters from her to members of the Navy and NASA expressing concern over whether the program was to be run properly and in accordance with NASA goals may have significantly contributed to the eventual cancellation of the program. It is generally accepted that Cochran turned against the program out of concern that she would no longer be the most prominent female aviator.

On 17 and 18 July 1962, Representative Victor Anfuso (D-NY) convened public hearings before a special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics to determine whether or not the exclusion of women from the astronaut program was discriminatory, during which John Glenn and Scott Carpenter testified against admitting women to the astronaut program. Cochran herself argued against bringing women into the space program, saying that time was of the essence, and moving forward as planned was the only way to beat the Soviets in the Space Race. (None of the women who had passed the tests were military jet test pilots, nor did they have engineering degrees, which were the two basic experiential qualifications for potential astronauts. Women were not allowed to be military jet test pilots at that time. On average, however, they all had more flight experience than the male astronauts.) &quot;NASA required all astronauts to be graduates of military jet test piloting programs and have engineering degrees. In 1962, no women could meet these requirements.&quot; This ended the Mercury 13 program. However, John Glenn and Scott Carpenter, who were part of the Mercury 7, also did not have engineering degrees when they were selected. Both of them were granted a degree after their flights for NASA.

Significantly, the hearings investigated the possibility of gender discrimination a two full years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made that illegal.

==Political activities==
A lifelong Republican, Cochran, as a result of her involvement in politics and the military, became close friends with General Dwight Eisenhower. In the early part of 1952, she and her husband helped sponsor a large rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in support of an Eisenhower presidential candidacy.

The rally was documented on film and Cochran personally flew the film to France for a special showing at Eisenhower&#x27;s headquarters. Her efforts proved a major factor in convincing Eisenhower to run for President of the United States in 1952 and she played a major role in his successful campaign. Close friends thereafter, Eisenhower frequently visited her and her husband at their California ranch and after leaving office, wrote portions of his memoirs there.

Politically ambitious, Cochran ran for Congress in 1956 from California&#x27;s 29th Congressional District as the candidate of the Republican Party. Her name appeared throughout the campaign and on the ballot as Jacqueline Cochran-Odlum. Although she defeated a field of five male opponents to win the Republican nomination, in the general election she lost a close election to Democratic candidate and first Asian-American congressman Dalip Singh Saund. Saund won with 54,989 votes (51.5%) to Cochran&#x27;s 51,690 votes (48.5%). Her political setback was one of the few failures she ever experienced and she never attempted another run. Those who knew Cochran have said that the loss bothered her for the rest of her life, as she reportedly found it difficult to accept losing to &quot;a Hindu&quot;, although Saund was in fact Sikh.

==Legacy==

Cochran died on August 9, 1980, at the home in Indio, California, she had shared with her husband until his death four years earlier. She was a long-time resident of the Coachella Valley and is buried in Coachella Valley Public Cemetery. She regularly utilized Thermal Airport over the course of her long aviation career. The airport, which had been renamed Desert Resorts Regional, was again renamed Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in her honor.

Despite her lack of formal education, Cochran had a quick mind and an affinity for business and her investment in the cosmetics field proved a lucrative one. Later, in 1951, the Boston Chamber of Commerce voted her one of the 25 outstanding businesswomen in America. In 1953 and 1954, the Associated Press named her &quot;Woman of the Year in Business&quot;.

Cochran served on the Board of Trustees for the George Washington University from 1962 until her passing in 1980.

==Military awards==
===Distinguished Service Medal Citation===
&quot;For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a position of great responsibility from June 1943 to December 1944 as Director of Women Pilots, Headquarters Army Air Forces. She directed the planning, programming and administration of all women pilot activities of the Army Air Forces, including the organization, training and operation of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Under her leadership, the WASP performed with the utmost loyalty and efficiency, multiple flying services, in direct and effective support of the Army Air Forces which were of the greatest assistance and support to the war effort and the nation. Further, her achievements in this respect and the conclusions she has carefully and wisely drawn from this undertaking represent a contribution that is of permanent and far-reaching significance to the future of aviation. Her vision, skill and initiative have resulted in services of exceptional value and importance to the country.&quot;

===1st Distinguished Flying Cross Citation===

===3rd Distinguished Flying Cross Citation===
&quot;The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Colonel Jacqueline Cochran, United States Air Force, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight during May and June 1964. During this period, Colonel Cochran established three world speed records in an F-104C Starfighter. Flying a precise circular course, Colonel Cochran set a 25-kilometer record of 1429.297 miles per hour, more than twice the speed of sound. She established a record for the 100-kilometer course by flying at 1302 miles per hour. Colonel Cochran established a third world&#x27;s speed record by achieving 1135 miles per hour over a 500-kilometer course. The professional competence, aerial skill, and devotion to duty displayed by Colonel Cochran reflect great credit upon herself and the United States Air Force.&quot;

==Other awards==
From many countries around the world, Cochran received citations and awards. In 1949, the government of France recognized her contribution to the war and aviation awarding her in 1951 with the French Air Medal. She is the only woman to ever receive the Gold Medal from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. She went on to be elected to that body&#x27;s board of directors and director of Northwest Airlines in the U.S. At home, the Air Force awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit. In 1949, Cochran became the fourth U.S. recipient of the Türk Hava Kurumu&#x27;s (Turkish Aeronautical Association) highest award, the Murassa Brövesi (Diamond Brevet).

An annual air show called the &quot;Jacqueline Cochran Air Show&quot; is named in her honor and takes place at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport near Coachella, California. Cochran also became the first woman to be honored with a permanent display of her achievements at the United States Air Force Academy. In the play &quot;The Fastest Woman Alive&quot;, written by Karen Sunde, Cochran&#x27;s life is chronicled alongside her husband, Floyd, Amelia Earhart, and others.

<doc id="229687" wikidata="Q754570" url="?curid=229687" title="Water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>A water polo tournament was held on the Seine (near Asnières) on 11 and 12 August 1900 as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. Eight teams from four countries, all European, entered the event, although only seven ended up playing. The Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, England, which has been listed with two rosters that are nearly entirely different, became the first Olympic water polo champions by defeating the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club of Belgium. Third place went to the two French-based semi-finalists, Libellule de Paris and Pupilles de Neptune de Lille, the latter of whom entered two teams, but merged them together after the first round.

==Background==
Water polo, and team sport in general, made its Olympic debut at the 1900 Summer Games held in Paris, France. The tournament was to be played by the less violent and more restrictive &quot;English rules&quot;, which, along with the cost of traveling to Paris, deterred any American teams from participating. Seven teams, representing at least four countries, took part in the competition. Four squads were based in the host nation: two from Pupilles de Neptune de Lille and one each from Libellule de Paris and Tritons Lillois. The Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Berliner Swimming Club, and Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester were based in Belgium, Germany, and Manchester, Great Britain respectively. A second squad from the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester was entered, but did not participate.

==Team composition==


The composition of several of the teams in Paris differs across sources and not all teams were composed solely of members who were nationals of the countries in which their clubs were based. Libellule de Paris has been listed as having a player by the name of &quot;Devenot&quot;, but Olympic historian Bill Mallon identifies this player as Jules Clévenot, who also competed in swimming events at the Games. Their squad also included Bill Burgess, a Briton who would later become the second man to swim across the English Channel. The first Pupilles de Neptune de Lille team contained a Belgian national, Philippe Houben. Three members of this squad, Eugène Favier, René Lériche, and Charles Treffel, joined the second Pupilles de Neptune de Lille team after the first was eliminated from the tournament. They seem to have replaced four players, Auguste Camelin, Antoine Fiolet, Pierre Gellé, and Louis Marc, who competed for the second Pupilles de Neptune de Lille lineup only in the first round.

German sources do not list Hans Aniol, Max Hainle, or Herbert von Petersdorff as members of the Berliner Swimming Club, mentioning Gustav Erpf, Asmus Simonsen, and Max Schöne instead, but Mallon notes that there is proof contemporary to the tournament for the participation of only the former trio. Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romer, Guillaume Séron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he &quot;was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.&quot;

===Full rosters===
All entries are listed as per Mallon&#x27;s &quot;The 1900 Olympic Games&quot; unless otherwise noted:

==Tournament results==

The water polo tournament was held at the river Seine, with the first round taking place on 11 August. Osborne defeated Tritons Lillois in a 12–0 shutout, with Jarvis scoring at least six of the goals. Brussels also shutout the first Pupilles de Neptune de Lille squad 2–0, while the latter&#x27;s second team defeated Berliner 3–2. Libellule de Paris received a bye and the losing teams were eliminated from the tournament. The semi-finals took place on 12 August, with Osborne defeating the remaining Pupilles de Neptune de Lille squad 10–1 (with Martin scoring the lone goal for the French team) and Brussels winning against Libellule de Paris 5–1. The final was held on the same day, with Osborne overcoming Brussels 7–2. Osborne, with the medal later credited to Great Britain, became the first Olympic water polo champions and &quot;descriptions of the matches make it appear that they won as they wished, and the margins could have been larger, had they pressed the matter&quot;. Belgium has been retroactively credited with silver (medals were not handed out for many events at the 1900 Summer Olympics), while the two French semi-finalists have been seen as the bronze medalists.

<doc id="229691" wikidata="Q4797381" url="?curid=229691" title="Arte Moreno">
<text>Arturo &quot;Arte&quot; Moreno (born August 14, 1946) is an American businessman. On May 15, 2003 he became the first Mexican-American to own a major sports team in the United States when he purchased the Anaheim Angels baseball team from the Walt Disney Company. In August 2022, he announced that he would explore a possible sale of the franchise, but in January 2023, he decided not to sell the team.

== Early life and education ==
Moreno was born to a Mexican American family in Tucson, Arizona, the oldest of 11 children of Maria and Arturo Moreno, who immigrated from Mexico. His father ran a small print shop; his grandfather owned Tucson&#x27;s first Spanish-language newspaper. In 1965, Moreno graduated from high school and in 1966, he was drafted into the United States Army and fought in the Vietnam War. After returning to civilian life in 1968, he enrolled at the University of Arizona where he graduated in 1973 with a degree in marketing.

== Career ==
=== Advertising background ===

After school, he was hired to work at Eller Outdoor, an advertising company. He traveled across the country for the next seven years, relocating several times and in 1984, he moved back to Arizona, settling in Phoenix, where he was hired by billboard company Outdoor Systems. In 1984, Moreno and his friend Wally Kelly attempted unsuccessfully to buy the firm from owner William S. Levine. Moreno and Kelly entered into a partnership with Levine, and Moreno later became its president and chief executive officer.

In 1996, Moreno took Outdoor Systems public. The company&#x27;s stock soared, and in 1998 Outdoor Systems was purchased by Infinity Broadcasting for $8 billion.

=== Baseball ownership ===
With baseball being Moreno&#x27;s favorite pastime, he purchased the Salt Lake Trappers minor league team alongside 17 other investors in 1986. The group owned the team until 1992, and the venture proved to be a resounding financial success.

By 2001, Moreno wished to own a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. He attempted to buy controlling interest in his home state&#x27;s Arizona Diamondbacks, but no deal could be reached. He nonetheless remained determined to own a Major League team, and soon set his sights on the 2002 World Series champion Anaheim Angels.

It was announced in April 2003 that Moreno had agreed with The Walt Disney Company to purchase the team for $180 million. On May 15, 2003, MLB commissioner Bud Selig announced that the sale of the Angels to Moreno had been approved. One of the first people to congratulate Moreno after the news was Diamondbacks&#x27; owner Jerry Colangelo, a personal friend who declared it a good opportunity for Moreno.

==== Angels owner ====
Moreno soon demonstrated a willingness to spend the money necessary to sign premium players, including star outfielder Vladimir Guerrero. He also took a hands-on approach, becoming a regular attendee of the team&#x27;s home games and periodically leaving his owner&#x27;s box during games to mingle with fans in the regular stadium seating areas and concourses. All of these moves proved very popular with fans. In the first year of his ownership, the Angels drew more than three million fans, 750,000 more than their championship season.

However, Moreno encountered a substantial backlash from fans of the team, and in particular, from the city leadership of Anaheim, California, over his decision in 2005 to change the name of the team from the &quot;Anaheim Angels&quot; to the &quot;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&quot;. Moreno saw the change as part of an overall strategy to increase the team&#x27;s revenue by actively marketing it to, and associating it with, the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area, rather than restricting the team&#x27;s identity to the city of Anaheim and to Orange County. In recent years, the San Diego Zoo and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; have been notable club sponsors, while all baseball TV rightsholders also use some variation of the team&#x27;s new name, indicating the effect of Moreno&#x27;s plan. But the move outraged Anaheim city officials, who responded by suing the team. It also angered a substantial segment of the Angels&#x27; fan base in Orange County, who took pride in the team&#x27;s identity being distinct from Los Angeles. The awkwardness of the &quot;of Anaheim&quot; suffix, appended to satisfy a contractual requirement for &quot;Anaheim&quot; to be included in the team&#x27;s name, also caused the new name to become the subject of national ridicule. Eventually, the team won the lawsuit filed by the city.

Aside from the name controversy, Moreno&#x27;s first few seasons as owner of the Angels were largely successful. The team posted three consecutive winning seasons for the first time in club history (2007–2009), including winning the American League Western Division championship in 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2014 when they finished with a league leading 98 regular season wins. However, the Angels, even with Albert Pujols and Mike Trout at the helm for the team, could not lead them back to the postseason or win a postseason game. From 2010 to 2022, the Angels failed to win a postseason game (the longest gap since their drought from 1987 to 2001) despite a massive deal for Trout for over $400 million and high priced signings of players such as Pujols, Anthony Rendon, Josh Hamilton, that totaled over $500 million. A losing season in 2022 tied a franchise record of seventh straight losing seasons, matching the mark set from 1971 to 1977.

Just prior to the start of the 2006 Major League season, Moreno scored another success in signing a lucrative contract with Fox Sports Net for the television broadcast rights for the Angels&#x27; regular season games. The ten-year deal significantly increased the team&#x27;s television revenue. In April 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated the team to be worth $368 million—twice the amount Moreno paid for the club only three years earlier; in January 2018 &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the franchise value at $1.75 billion.

&quot;[Moreno] has really done an amazing job with the franchise. To double the value in three years without getting a new stadium is an incredible feat.&quot;
:— &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine associate editor Kurt Badenhausen

In October 2020, Moreno, through his company SRB Management, agreed to purchase Angel Stadium and the surrounding parking lots from the City of Anaheim for $320 million. In May 2022, it was reported that an FBI had conducted a corruption investigation into the dealings of the city and the stadium sale, which led to the resignation of Anaheim mayor Harry Sidhu on May 24. In light of the scandal, the Anaheim City Council voted to cancel the sale later that day.

On August 23, 2022, Moreno officially announced that he would explore a possible sale of the Angels franchise. In a public statement, Moreno said that he and his family decided &quot;now is the time&quot; after a &quot;a great deal of thoughtful consideration&quot;. The franchise was estimated to be worth $2.2 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot; in an analysis from March 2022. However, he retracted that statement and committed himself to owning the team, citing &quot;unfinished business&quot;.

In his tenure, the Angels had a run of sustained consistency in the mid to late 2000s that included five American League West championships from 2004 to 2009. After failing to reach the World Series each time, they missed the postseason until 2014, two years after having signed Albert Pujols to a record 10-year deal for $254 million that outbid the St. Louis Cardinals. The Pujols deal is now considered one of the worst deals in free agent history as the career .300 hitter of the time proceeded to hit under .300 in each season before being released in 2021. The Angels won 98 games in 2014 but were swept in the first round by the Kansas City Royals. The next year saw them win 85 games but it also started a spiral for the team. From 2016 to 2024, the Angels have had a losing season and failed to reach the postseason each time, despite the fact that in four of those nine seasons they had an MVP on the roster (Trout won in 2016 and 2019 and Shohei Ohtani, acquired in 2018, won it in 2021 and 2023). The eight losing seasons, all under Moreno&#x27;s leadership as owner, is the worst stretch in Angels history, eclipsing the 1971-1977 era.

&quot;He has been criticized for targeting mega-contracts that quickly became problematic -- particularly those of Vernon Wells, Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton and Anthony Rendon, the latter three of which came with the loss of draft picks -- and then declining to exceed the luxury tax threshold in an effort to make up for it. He has been criticized for not paying enough attention to the infrastructure that helps organizations develop talent through minor league systems, part of the reason the Angels&#x27; farm system has ranked within the bottom eight in the industry by Baseball America seven out of the past 10 years. And he has been criticized for continually cutting costs in many of the behind-the-scenes aspects that would help maximize expensive rosters, from analytics to training resources to staffing hires -- an approach one former pitcher described as &quot;buying a McLaren and taking it to Jiffy Lube&quot;.&quot;
:— &quot;ESPN&quot; writer Alden Gonzlez

In the 2023 offseason, the Angels lost two-time AL MVP Shohei Ohtani to free agency after they failed to offer a better deal than the Los Angeles Dodgers. Following the Dodgers victory in the 2024 World Series, criticism of Moreno increased from Angels fans who felt the team could have made a playoff run with Trout and Ohtani.

==== Other business interests ====
On February 26, 2006, Moreno led a partnership of buyers to purchase Radio 830 KMXE, the nation&#x27;s largest Spanish-language AM radio station. For the 2006 and 2007 seasons Radio 830 KMXE served as the Spanish-language radio broadcast outlet for the Angels. On July 17, 2007, the station began broadcasting from new studios located in Angel Stadium. Just before the 2008 season the station became AM830 KLAA (AM) and went all English language, including the Angels game broadcasts. The station has since added morning and afternoon sports talk shows to its lineup.

While it seems a new trend for sports teams to buy their own radio stations (see the St. Louis Cardinals and the Washington Commanders), for the Angels it is a tradition started by team founder Gene Autry, who owned 710 KMPC and broadcast the games for years.

== Personal life ==
Moreno has been married twice. He has three children.

In 1997, Moreno and his wife established the Moreno Family Foundation, which supports non-profit organizations focusing on youth and education. It also has provided support to the athletic programs at the University of Arizona.

Aside from this, Moreno is vigilant about maintaining his privacy. He refuses most interview requests, and does not discuss his personal life publicly. His family and friends also avoid commenting on his personal life publicly, though off the record, those who know him describe him as &quot;unabashed in his support of Republican politics&quot; and as particularly dedicated to his family.

In September 2020 he endorsed Donald Trump for president, saying &quot;it’s very necessary to vote for President Trump&quot;.

<doc id="229694" wikidata="Q1127694" url="?curid=229694" title="Intercooler">
<text>An intercooler is a heat exchanger used to cool a gas after compression. Often found in turbocharged engines, intercoolers are also used in air compressors, air conditioners, refrigeration and gas turbines.

==Internal combustion engines==

Most commonly used with turbocharged engines, an intercooler is used to counteract the heat of compression and heat soak in the pressurised intake air. By reducing the temperature of the intake air, the air becomes denser (allowing more fuel to be injected, resulting in increased power) and less likely to suffer from pre-ignition or knocking. Additional cooling can be provided by externally spraying a fine mist onto the intercooler surface, or even into the intake air itself, to further reduce intake charge temperature through evaporative cooling.

Intercoolers can vary dramatically in size, shape and design, depending on the performance and space requirements of the system. Many passenger cars use either front-mounted intercoolers located in the front bumper or grill opening, or top-mounted intercoolers located above the engine. An intercooling system can use an air-to-air design, an air-to-liquid design, or a combination of both.

=== Multiple stages of compression ===
In automotive engines where multiple stages of forced-induction are used (e.g. a sequential twin-turbo or twin-charged engine), the intercooling usually takes place after the last turbocharger/supercharger. However it is also possible to use separate intercoolers for each stage of the turbocharging/supercharging, such as in the JCB Dieselmax land speed record racing car. Some aircraft engines also use an intercooler for each stage of the forced induction. In engines with two-stage turbocharging, the term &quot;intercooler&quot; can specifically refer to the cooler between the two turbochargers and the term &quot;aftercooler&quot; is used for the cooler located between the second-stage turbo and the engine. However, the terms &quot;intercooler&quot; and &quot;charge-air cooler&quot; are also often used regardless of the location in the intake system.

=== Method of heat transfer ===
Air-to-air intercoolers are heat exchangers that transfer heat from the intake air directly to the atmosphere. Alternatively, air-to-liquid intercoolers transfer the heat from the intake air to intermediate liquid (usually water), which in turn transfers the heat to the atmosphere. The heat exchanger that transfers the heat from the fluid to the atmosphere operates in a similar fashion to the main radiator in a water-cooled engine&#x27;s cooling system, or in some cases the engine&#x27;s cooling system is also used for the intercooling system. Air-to-liquid intercoolers are usually heavier than their air-to-air counterparts, due to additional components making up the system (e.g. water circulation pump, radiator, fluid, and plumbing).

The majority of marine engines use air-to-liquid intercoolers, since the water of the lake, river or sea can easily be accessed for cooling purposes. In addition, most marine engines are located in closed compartments where obtaining a good flow of cooling air for an air-to-air unit would be difficult. Marine intercoolers take the form of a tubular heat exchanger with the air passing around a series of tubes within the cooler casing, and sea water circulating inside the tubes. The main materials used for this kind of application are meant to resist sea water corrosion: Copper-Nickel for the tubes and bronze for the sea water covers.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative to using intercoolers - which is rarely used these days - was to inject excess fuel into the combustion chamber, so that the vaporization process would cool the cylinders in order to prevent knocking. However the downsides to this method were increased fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions.
== Air compressors ==

Intercoolers are used to remove the waste heat from the first stage of two-stage air compressors. Two-stage air compressors are manufactured because of their inherent efficiency. The cooling action of the intercooler is principally responsible for this higher efficiency, bringing it closer to Carnot efficiency. Removing the heat-of-compression from the discharge of the first stage has the effect of densifying the air charge. This, in turn, allows the second stage to produce more work from its fixed compression ratio. Adding an intercooler to the setup requires additional investments.

<doc id="229697" wikidata="Q1782562" url="?curid=229697" title="Soft X-ray transient">
<text>Soft X-ray transients (SXTs), also known as X-ray novae and black hole X-ray transients, are composed of a compact object (most commonly a black hole but sometimes a neutron star) and some type of &quot;normal&quot;, low-mass star (i.e. a star with a mass of some fraction of the Sun&#x27;s mass). These objects show dramatic changes in their X-ray emission, probably produced by variable transfer of mass from the normal star to the compact object, a process called accretion. In effect the compact object &quot;gobbles up&quot; the normal star, and the X-ray emission can provide the best view of how this process occurs. The &quot;soft&quot; name arises because in many cases there is strong soft (i.e. low-energy) X-ray emission from an accretion disk close to the compact object, although there are exceptions which are quite hard.

Soft X-ray transients Cen X-4 and Aql X-1 were discovered by Hakucho, Japan&#x27;s first X-ray astronomy satellite to be X-ray bursters.

During active accretion episodes, called &quot;outbursts&quot;, SXTs are bright (with typical luminosities above 1037 erg/s). Between these episodes, when the accretion is absent, SXTs are usually very faint, or even unobservable; this is called the &quot;quiescent&quot; state.

In the &quot;outburst&quot; state the brightness of the system increases by a factor of 100–10000 in both X-rays and optical. During outburst, a bright SXT is the brightest object in the X-ray sky, and the apparent magnitude is about 12. The SXTs have outbursts with intervals of decades or longer, as only a few systems have shown two or more outbursts. The system fades back to quiescence in a few months. During the outburst, the X-ray spectrum is &quot;soft&quot; or dominated by low-energy X-rays, hence the name &quot;Soft&quot; X-ray transients.

SXTs are quite rare; about 100 systems are known. SXTs are a class of low-mass X-ray binaries. A typical SXT contains a K-type subgiant or dwarf that is transferring mass to a compact object through an accretion disk. In some cases the compact object is a neutron star, but black holes are more common. The type of compact object can be determined by observation of the system after an outburst; residual thermal emission from the surface of a neutron star will be seen whereas a black hole will not show residual emission. During &quot;quiescence&quot; mass is accumulating to the disk, and during outburst most of the disk falls into the black hole. The outburst is triggered as the density in the accretion disk exceeds a critical value. High density increases viscosity, which results in heating of the disk. Increasing temperature ionizes the gas, increasing the viscosity, and the instability increases and propagates throughout the disk. As the instability reaches the inner accretion disk, the X-ray luminosity rises and outburst begins. The outer disk is further heated by intense radiation from the inner accretion disk. A similar runaway heating mechanism operates in dwarf novae.

Some SXTs in the quiescent state show thermal X-ray radiation from the surface of a neutron star with typical luminosities ~(1032—1034) erg/s. In so called &quot;quasi-persistent SXTs&quot;, whose periods of accretion and quiescence are particularly long (of the order of years), the cooling of the accretion-heated neutron-star crust can be observed in quiescence. Analyzing the quiescent thermal states of the SXTs and their crust cooling, one can test the physical properties of the superdense matter in the neutron stars.
