<text>Pierre Joseph Auguste Messmer (; 20 March 191629 August 2007) was a French Gaullist politician. He served as Minister of Armies under Charles de Gaulle from 1960 to 1969 – the longest serving since Étienne François, duc de Choiseul under Louis XV – and then as Prime Minister under Georges Pompidou from 1972 to 1974. A member of the French Foreign Legion, he was considered one of the historical Gaullists, and died aged 91 in the military hospital of the Val-de-Grâce in August 2007. He was elected a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; in 1999; his seat was taken over by Simone Veil.

== Early career ==

Pierre Joseph Auguste Messmer was born in Vincennes in 1916. He graduated in 1936 in the language school ENLOV and the following year at the &quot;Ecole nationale de la France d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (National School of Oversea France). 

He then became a senior civil servant in the colonial administration and became a Doctor of Laws in 1939. In the outbreak of World War II, he was sous-lieutenant of the 12th regiment of Senegalese tirailleurs, and refused France&#x27;s capitulation after the defeat. He then hijacked in Marseille an Italian cargo ship (the &quot;Capo Olmo&quot;), along with his friend Jean Simon (a future French General), and sailed first to Gibraltar, then London and engaged himself in the Free French Forces as a member of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the French Foreign Legion. 

Messmer then participated to the campaign in Eritrea, in Syria, in Libya, participating to the Battle of Bir Hakeim, and in the Tunisia campaign. He also fought at the Battle of El Alamein in Egypt. He joined in London General Koenig&#x27;s military staff and participated in the landings in Normandy in August 1944 and the Liberation of Paris.

Named &quot;Compagnon de la Libération&quot; in 1941, he received the &quot;Croix de guerre&quot; (War Cross) with six citations after the Liberation, as well as the medal of the Resistance.

== After World War II ==
After World War II, he returned to the colonies and was a prisoner of war of the Vietminh, during two months in 1945, after the outbreak of the First Indochina War. He was named the following year general secretary of the interministerial committee for Indochina and then head of staff of the high commissary of the Republic.

=== Colonial administrator in Africa ===
Messmer began his high-level African service as governor of Mauritania from 1952 to 1954, and then served as governor of Ivory Coast from 1954 to 1956, when he briefly returned to Paris in the staff of Gaston Defferre, Minister of Overseas Territories who enacted the Defferre Act granting to colonial territories internal autonomy, a first step towards independence.

That same year, Messmer was nominated as governor general of Cameroun, where a civil war had started the preceding year following the outlawing of the independentist Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) in July 1955. He initiated a decolonization process and imported the counter-revolutionary warfare methods theorized in Indochina and implemented during the Algerian War (1954–62).
Visiting de Gaulle in Paris, he was implicitly granted permission for his change of policies in Cameroon, which exchanged repression for negotiations with the UPC. 

A &quot;Pacification Zone&quot; – the ZOPAC (&quot;Zone de pacification du Cameroon&quot;) was created on 9 December 1957, englobing 7,000 square km controlled by seven infantry regiments. Furthermore, a civilian-military intelligence apparatus was created, combining colonial and local staff, assisted by a civilian militia. Mao Zedong&#x27;s people&#x27;s war was reversed in an attempt to separate the civilian population from the guerrilla. In that aim, the local population was rounded up in guarded villages located on the main roads that were controlled by the French Army.

Messmer served as high commissioner of French Equatorial Africa from January 1958 to July 1958, and as high commissioner of French West Africa from 1958 to 1959.

=== Minister of Armies (1959–1969) ===
From 1959 to 1969, under Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency and in the turmoil of the Algerian War, he was Minister of Armies. He was confronted with the 1961 Generals&#x27; Putsch, reorganised the French Army and adapted it to the nuclear era.

In 1960, Messmer visited Lisbon and expressed lament for the United Nations resolutions against colonialism and approved of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime&#x27;s hardline stance against decolonisation on the grounds that Portugal represented the last vestige of white Western civilisation on the African continent.

Messmer gave permission for former Algerian War veterans to fight in Katanga against the newly independent Congo and United Nations peacekeeping forces. He confided to Roger Trinquier that it was de Gaulle&#x27;s ambition to replace the Belgians and control a reunited Congo from Élisabethville.

Along with the Minister of Research, Gaston Palewski, Messmer was present at the Béryl nuclear test in Algeria, on 1 May 1962 during which an accident occurred. Officials, soldiers, and Algerian workers escaped as they could, often without wearing any protection. Palewski died in 1984 of leukemia, which he always has attributed to the Beryl incident, and Messmer always remained close-mouthed on the affair.
De Gaulle said that along with Maurice Couve de Murville, Messmer was &quot;one of his two arms. &quot; In May 68, he advised de Gaulle against the use of the military.

Messmer became a personality of the Gaullist Party and was elected deputy in 1968, representing Moselle &quot;département&quot;. A member of the conservative wing of the Gaullist movement, he criticised the &quot;New Society&quot; plan of Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas and thus won the trust of Georges Pompidou, elected President in 1969. He quit the government after de Gaulle&#x27;s resignation and founded the association &quot;Présence du gaullisme&quot; (Presence of Gaullism).

== From the 1970s to the 2000s ==

He occupied cabinet positions again in the 1970s, serving first as Minister of state charged of the Overseas Territories in 1971, then as Prime Minister from July 1972 to May 1974.

=== Messmer&#x27;s cabinet (July 1972 – May 1974) ===

He succeeded in this function to Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who had adopted a parliamentary reading of the Constitution, which Messmer opposed in his investiture speech. Messmer had been chosen by Pompidou as a guarant of his fidelity to de Gaulle, and his cabinet included personalities close to Pompidou, such as Jacques Chirac, named Minister of Agriculture.

Due to President Georges Pompidou&#x27;s illness, he dealt with the everyday administration of the country and adopted a conservative stance opposed to Chaban-Delmas&#x27; previous policies. Henceforth, he stopped the liberalization of the ORTF media governmental organization, naming as its CEO Arthur Conte, a personal friend of Pompidou.

Under his government, the Union des Démocrates pour la République (UDR) presidential majority negotiated with Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s Independent Republicans an electoral alliance, which enabled it to win the 1973 elections despite the left-wing union realized with the 1972 Common Program. Messmer&#x27;s second cabinet excluded several Gaullists, among whom Michel Debré, while he named several Independent Republicans members, such as Michel Poniatowski, close to Giscard, himself named Minister of Economy and Finances. A Ministry of Information was also re-created and put under the authority of an ultra-conservative, Philippe Malaud. In June 1974, he initiated the construction of 13 nuclear plants in order to confront the &quot;choc pétrolier&quot; (oil crisis).

In 1974, when Pompidou died, those close to Messmer encouraged him to run for president. He accepted at the condition of Chaban-Delmas, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Edgar Faure&#x27;s withdrawals. Faure accepted, as well as Giscard on the condition that Chaban-Delmas also withdrew himself. However, Chaban-Delmas, despite the &quot;Canard enchaîné&quot;″s campaign against him, maintained himself, leading Messmer to withdraw his candidacy. Finally, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, a conservative rival of the Gaullists, was elected. He served as prime minister for another few weeks after Pompidou&#x27;s death, ending his term after the presidential elections. Jacques Chirac replaced him on 29 May 1974. After the election of Giscard, he never held again ministerial offices, and became one of the historical voices of Gaullism.

=== Later career and death ===
Messmer remained a Member of Parliament for the Moselle department until 1988, and served as President of the Lorraine regional assembly from 1968 to 1992. He was mayor of the town of Sarrebourg from 1971 to 1989. Messmer was also president of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) parliamentary group during the first cohabitation (1986–1988), under Jacques Chirac&#x27;s government. In 1997 he testified as a witness during the trial of Maurice Papon, charged of crimes against humanity committed under the Vichy regime, and declared: &quot;The time has come when the Frenchmen could stop hating themselves and begin to grant pardon to themselves&quot;. Along with some other former Resistants, he demanded Papon&#x27;s pardon in 2001.

He died in 2007 aged 91, just four days after fellow Prime Minister Raymond Barre. He was the last surviving major French Politician to have been a member of the Free French forces.

<text>Multichannel multipoint distribution service (MMDS), formerly known as broadband radio service (BRS) and also known as wireless cable, is a wireless telecommunications technology, used for general-purpose broadband networking or, more commonly, as an alternative method of cable television programming reception.

MMDS is used in Australia, Barbados, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Portugal (including Madeira), Russia, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, Ukraine, United States, Uruguay and Vietnam. It is most commonly used in sparsely populated rural areas, where laying cables is not economically viable, although some companies have also offered MMDS services in urban areas, most notably in Ireland, until they were phased out in 2016.

==Technology==
The BRS band uses microwave frequencies from 2.3 to 2.5 GHz. Reception of BRS-delivered television and data signals is done with a rooftop microwave antenna. The antenna is attached to a down-converter or transceiver to receive and transmit the microwave signal and convert them to frequencies compatible with standard TV tuners (much like on satellite dishes where the signals are converted down to frequencies more compatible with standard TV coaxial cabling), some antennas use an integrated down-converter or transceiver. Digital TV channels can then be decoded with a standard cable set-top box or directly for TVs with integrated digital tuners. Internet data can be received with a standard DOCSIS cable modem connected to the same antenna and transceiver.

The MMDS band is separated into 33 (31 in USA) 6 MHz &quot;channels&quot;, which may be licensed to cable companies offering service in different areas of a country. The concept was to allow entities to own several channels and multiplex several television, radio, and later Internet data onto each channel using digital technology. Just like with digital cable channels, each channel is capable of 30.34 Mbit/s with 64QAM modulation, and 42.88 Mbit/s with 256QAM modulation. Due to forward error correction and other overhead, actual throughput is around 27 Mbit/s for 64QAM and 38 Mbit/s for 256QAM.

The newer BRS Band Plan makes changes to channel size and licensing in order to accommodate new WIMAX TDD fixed and mobile equipment, and reallocated frequencies between 2150 and 2162 MHz to the AWS band. These changes may not be compatible with the frequencies and channel sizes required for operating traditional MMDS or DOCSIS based equipment. MMDS has been used to provide internet access.

==MMDS and DOCSIS+==
Local multipoint distribution service (LMDS) and BRS have adapted the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) from the cable modem world. The version of DOCSIS modified for wireless broadband is known as DOCSIS+.

Data-transport security is accomplished under BRS by encrypting traffic flows between the broadband wireless modem and the WMTS (wireless modem termination system) located in the base station of the provider&#x27;s network using Triple DES.

DOCSIS+ reduces theft-of-service vulnerabilities under BRS by requiring that the WMTS enforce encryption, and by employing an authenticated client/server key-management protocol in which the WMTS controls distribution of keying material to broadband wireless modems.

LMDS and BRS wireless modems utilize the DOCSIS+ key-management protocol to obtain authorization and traffic encryption material from a WMTS, and to support periodic reauthorization and key refresh. The key-management protocol uses X.509 digital certificates, RSA public-key encryption, and Triple DES encryption to secure key exchanges between the wireless modem and the WMTS.

MMDS provided significantly greater range than LMDS.

MMDS may be obsoleted by the newer 802.16 WiMAX standard approved since 2004.

MMDS was sometimes expanded to multipoint microwave distribution system or multi-channel multi-point distribution system. All three phrases refer to the same technology.

==Current status==
In the United States, WATCH Communications (based in Lima, Ohio), Eagle Vision (based in Kirksville, MO), and several other companies offer MMDS-based wireless cable television, Internet access, and IP-based telephone services.

In certain areas, BRS is being deployed for use as wireless high-speed Internet access, mostly in rural areas where other types of high-speed internet are either unavailable (such as cable or DSL) or prohibitively expensive (such as satellite internet). CommSPEED is a major vendor in the US market for BRS-based internet.

AWI Networks (formerly Sky-View Technologies) operates a number of MMDS sites delivering high-speed Internet, VoIP telephone, and digital TV services in the Southwestern U.S. In 2010, AWI began upgrading its infrastructure to DOCSIS 3.0 hardware, along with new microwave transmission equipment, allowing higher modulation rates like 256QAM. This has enabled download speeds in excess of 100 Mbit/s, over distances up to from the transmission site.

In the early days of MMDS, it was known as &quot;wireless cable&quot; and was used in a variety of investment scams that still surface today. Frequent solicitations of wireless cable fraud schemes were often heard on talk radio shows like &quot;The Sonny Bloch Show&quot; in the mid-1990s.

Several US telephone companies attempted television services via this system in the mid-1990sthe Tele-TV venture of Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Bell; and the rival Americast consortium of Ameritech, BellSouth, SBC, SNET and GTE. The Tele-TV operation was only launched from 1999 to 2001 by Pacific Bell (the merged Bell Atlantic/NYNEX never launched a service), while Americast also petered out by that time, albeit mainly in GTE and BellSouth areas; the systems operated by Ameritech utilized standard wired cable.

In the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia, Craig Wireless operates a wireless cable and internet service (MMDS) for rural and remote customers. In Saskatchewan, Sasktel operated an MMDS system under the name Wireless Broadband Internet (WBBI) for rural internet access until it was shut down in 2014 and replaced with an LTE-TDD system due to reallocation of the radio spectrum by Industry Canada.

In Mexico, the 2.5 GHz band spectrum was reclaimed by the government in order to allow newer and better wireless data services. Hence, MAS TV (formerly known as MVS Multivision) had to relinquish the concessions for TV broadcast and shut down its MMDS pay TV services in 2014 after 25 years of service.

In Ireland, since 1990, UPC Ireland (previously Chorus and NTL Ireland) offered MMDS TV services almost nationwide. The frequency band initially allocated was 2500–2690 MHz (the &quot;2.6 GHz band&quot;) consisting of 22–23 analogue 8 MHz channels; digital TV was restricted to 2524–2668 MHz, consisting of 18 digital 8 MHz channels. Two digital TV standards were used: DVB-T/MPEG-2 in the old Chorus franchise area and DVB-C/MPEG-2 in the old NTL franchise area. The existing licences were to expire 18 April 2014, but Comreg, the Irish communications regulator, extended the licences for a further 2 years to 18 April 2016, at which date they expired together with all associated spectrum rights of use. The 2.6 GHz band spectrum will be auctioned off so that when the existing MMDS licences expire, new rights of use can issue on a service- and technology-neutral basis (by means of new licences). As a result, holders of the new rights of use may choose to provide any service capable of being delivered using 2.6 GHz spectrum. For instance, they could distribute television programming content, subject to complying with the relevant technical conditions and with any necessary broadcasting content authorisations, or they could adopt some other use.

In Iceland, since November 2006, Vodafone Iceland runs Digital Ísland (Digital Iceland)the broadcasting system for 365 (previously operated by 365 Broadcast Media). Digital Ísland offers digital MMDS television services using DVB-T technology alongside a few analogue channels. The MMDS frequency range extends from 2500 to 2684 MHz for a total of 23 (21 of which are considered usable for broadcasting in Iceland) 8 MHz channels. Analogue MMDS broadcasting began in 1993, moving to digital in 2004.

In Brazil, the shutdown of the MMDS technology started in 2012 to release the frequency for the 2500–2600 MHz LTE-UTRAN band, which would make the service infeasible. The national shutdown was planned to be finished at the end of 2012; as of 2013, the service had already been shut down in most cities.

In the Dominican Republic, Wind Telecom started operations using MMDS technology in 2008; at that time and ever since it became a pioneer taking advantage of such implementations. The company uses the DVB standard for its digital television transmissions.

<text>Vincent Philip D&#x27;Onofrio (; born June 30, 1959) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is known for his supporting and leading roles in both film and television. He has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.

His roles include Private Leonard &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; Lawrence in &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), Robert E. Howard in &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996), Edgar the Bug in &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) and &quot;Men in Black: The Series&quot; (1997–2001), Carl Stargher in &quot;The Cell&quot; (2000), New York City Police Detective Robert Goren in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2001–11), Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Hoskins in &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015), and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin in four television series of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2015–2018) and &quot;&quot; (2025).

==Early life==
D&#x27;Onofrio was born in Brooklyn, New York. He is of Italian descent, with ancestors from Naples. His parents Gennaro and Phyllis D&#x27;Onofrio met while Gennaro was stationed in Hawaii with the U.S. Air Force. Gennaro was trained as an interior decorator but spent most of his spare time in amateur theater. Vincent is the youngest of three siblings. His older siblings are Antoinette (born 1956) and Elizabeth (born 1957), an actress and drama coach residing in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. He was raised in Hawaii and Colorado during his early years.

D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s parents divorced when he was young; his mother later married George Meyer. He became stepbrother to Guy and Connie, Meyer&#x27;s children from a previous marriage. The family relocated to the Hialeah, Florida area. D&#x27;Onofrio has described himself as a shy boy who spent &quot;a lot of time in my room, staying in my head&quot;. He later became interested in magic and sleight of hand, learning from Cuban entertainers who owned a small magic shop.

In his teens, he worked backstage in set building and sound production at a number of community theaters run by his father. He graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School.

== Career ==

=== Acting and filmmaking ===

After graduating from high school, D&#x27;Onofrio started to appear on stage. During an 18-month stint at the University of Colorado in Boulder, he was involved with small, community-theater productions. He later studied method acting at the American Stanislavsky Theater and the Actors Studio, under coaches Sonia Moore and Sharon Chatten, which landed him his first paid role in off-Broadway&#x27;s &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;. He went on to appear in a number of their productions, including &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;. D&#x27;Onofrio continued his career by performing in many New York University student productions while also working as a bouncer at the Hard Rock Cafe, a bodyguard for Robert Plant and Yul Brynner and also worked as a deliveryman.

In 1984, he made his Broadway debut as Nick Rizzoli in &quot;Open Admissions&quot;. In 1986, D&#x27;Onofrio took on the role often considered the defining moment in his acting career, as Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy Marine recruit in the movie &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. On a tip from friend Matthew Modine, D&#x27;Onofrio was urged to send audition tapes to director Stanley Kubrick, in England. Four tapes later, D&#x27;Onofrio landed the role. Originally, the character of Pvt. Lawrence had been written as a &quot;skinny ignorant redneck&quot;; however, Kubrick believed the role would have more impact if the character were big and clumsy. D&#x27;Onofrio gained for the role, bringing his weight to . While filming an obstacle course scene for the movie, D&#x27;Onofrio injured his left knee, compounded by the excessive weight, which required surgical reconstruction.

Over the course of nine months after filming of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; was completed, D&#x27;Onofrio lost nearly all the weight he had gained for his role. He went on to play Dawson, the owner of Dawson&#x27;s Garage, in &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987). He appears in one scene near the end of the film. In 1988, he was cast in another supporting role in the film &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;, playing the fiancé of Lili Taylor&#x27;s character. In the film, which was Julia Roberts&#x27; breakout film, he was billed under his full name Vincent Philip D&#x27;Onofrio. In 1989 he played a supporting role as Young Gar in &quot;The Blood of Heroes&quot; alongside Joan Chen and Rutger Hauer, for which he is also billed under his full name.

D&#x27;Onofrio continued to play a wide variety of minor or supporting roles, including the father of a saint in Nancy Savoca&#x27;s &quot;Household Saints&quot; (1993), director Orson Welles in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), farmer Edgar and the evil &quot;Bug&quot; that possesses him from &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), a man who claims to be from the future in &quot;Happy Accidents&quot; (2000), and the serial killer Carl Stargher, opposite Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s character in &quot;The Cell&quot; (2000).

In 1992, he appeared in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot;, as an aspiring screenwriter.

In 1996, he interpreted pulp writer Robert E. Howard, author of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; in Dan Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996) adapted from Novalyne Price Ellis&#x27; mémoire &quot;One Who Walked Alone: Robert E. Howard, The Final Years&quot;. &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; was awarded Best New American Film at The Seattle International Film Festival (1996).

For the role of Robert E. Howard D&#x27;Onofrio was awarded Best Actor at the 1996 Seattle International Film Festival and Best Actor at the 1998 Lone Star Film &amp; Television Awards.

In 1997, he made a move to television and received an Emmy nomination for his appearance as John Lange in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Subway&quot;. 

In 1999, he turned down a role in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. D&#x27;Onofrio portrayed leftist radical Abbie Hoffman in &quot;Steal This Movie!&quot; in 2000, starring Janeane Garofalo as his wife.

In 2001, he took on what became his longest and perhaps best-known role as Det. Robert Goren on the NBC/USA Network television show &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. On March 1, 2008, D&#x27;Onofrio made a cameo appearance in a presidential election-related sketch in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode as his character Det. Robert Goren. In the sketch, he interrogates Hillary Clinton (played by Amy Poehler). His entrance to and exit from the skit are punctuated by the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; &quot;dun-DUN&quot; sound.

In 2009, it was announced that D&#x27;Onofrio would be leaving &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; in the spring of 2010, with his last appearance occurring in the two-part, season-9 premiere. He was replaced by Jeff Goldblum, but after a drop in ratings, D&#x27;Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe agreed to return for a 10th (and final) season of the show.

In 2003, it was reported that D&#x27;Onofrio and Joe Pantoliano had begun work on a small film titled &quot;Little Victories&quot;, about a 12-year-old boy whose perceptions of the world are forever changed when his gangster uncle comes to live with him. According to a television interview with Pantoliano, the film was not completed and went into turnaround due to a failure to raise the funds necessary for production.

In November 2005, D&#x27;Onofrio won Best Actor at the Stockholm International Film Festival for his role as Mike Cobb in the independent film &quot;Thumbsucker&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in &quot;The Break-Up&quot;, starring Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, playing Vaughn&#x27;s eccentric brother. Vaughn and he had appeared together in two previous films, &quot;The Cell&quot; (2000), wherein Vaughn played an FBI agent pursuing D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s character, and &quot;Thumbsucker&quot; (2005). He appears in the Oscar-winning short &quot;The New Tenants&quot; (2009).

Over the next few years, D&#x27;Onofrio co-starred in films such as: &quot;Staten Island&quot; (2009), &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; (2010), &quot;Kill the Irishman&quot; (2011), &quot;Crackers&quot; (2011), &quot;American Falls&quot; (2012), &quot;Fire with Fire&quot; (2012), and &quot;Ass Backwards&quot; (2013).

In 2011, he began work on the Jennifer Lynch 2012 film &quot;Chained&quot; (previously titled &quot;Rabbit&quot;) in which he portrays Bob, a serial killer who kidnaps a young boy, Rabbit, and makes him his protégé. When he becomes older, Rabbit must decide whether to follow in the footsteps of his captor or plan his escape. The film shot in areas in and around Regina and Moose Jaw, both in Saskatchewan. On May 1, 2012, due to &quot;explicit violence&quot;, the movie was given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, despite appeals by both Jennifer Lynch and the distributor, with scenes cut to maximize theater exposure and distribution. No stranger to the NC-17 ratings, Lynch, who responded to the ruling a day later had previously seen cuts made to her film &quot;Boxing Helena&quot;. In July 2012, a press release from Anchor Bay announced that the film would be released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012, and would include the deleted scene, involving a throat being cut, which caused the NC-17 rating.

On September 14, 2011, it was announced that D&#x27;Onofrio would star alongside Ethan Hawke in a new NBC show, &quot;Blue Tilt&quot;, named after the harmful psychological effects homicide detectives experience after constantly dealing with horrific crimes. D&#x27;Onofrio and Hawke had worked together in the films &quot;The Newton Boys&quot;, &quot;Staten Island&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; and &quot;Sinister&quot;. The hour-long cop drama, in which D&#x27;Onofrio would play Sonny, was to follow the main characters&#x27; attempts to balance their careers with family life. Writer Chris Brancato, fresh from Season 10 of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, was brought on board to pen the episodes. Filming of the pilot episode was set to start in February 2012. On March 27, 2012, a tweet from Kevin Dunigan, the co-creator and developer of the pilot, revealed that NBC had shelved the project because it did not have enough &quot;pop to attract viewers&quot;.

On April 30, 2012, the short film &quot;Crackers&quot;, starring D&#x27;Onofrio as Gus, won a People&#x27;s Choice Award at the Fort Myers Beach Film Festival. The festival, which had been dormant for six years, was rekindled and partly organized by Vincent&#x27;s sister, actress Elizabeth D&#x27;Onofrio.

Also in November, filming began on the Vidhu Vinod Chopra movie &quot;Broken Horses&quot;, which focused on gang warfare around the border between the United States and Mexico. D&#x27;Onofrio starred alongside Chris Marquette and Anton Yelchin.

In 2013, D&#x27;Onofrio co-starred in the film &quot;Escape Plan&quot;, filmed in New Orleans, also starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 50 Cent. D&#x27;Onofrio portrayed Lester Clark, deputy director of the Prisons Bureau.

D&#x27;Onofrio co-starred in the film drama &quot;The Judge&quot; (2014).

His other projects included a role in &quot;Supreme Ruler&quot; with Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Bogosian&#x27;s &quot;Mall&quot; which he co-wrote with his former &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; co-star, and &quot;Pawn Shop Chronicles&quot;.

In 2015, D&#x27;Onofrio made his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut as Wilson Fisk in the first season of &quot;Daredevil&quot;. He reprised the role in an extended cameo appearance in season 2, and in season 3 as a series regular. He also portrayed Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Hoskins in the action adventure film &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015), and Jack Horne in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s 2016 remake of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

In 2016, he played the role of the evil Duke Luca Abele in the video game &quot;Dishonored 2&quot;. He was able to draw upon his extensive acting experience to fully flesh out the voice of the corrupt Duke Abele in various public speeches that were broadcast in-game over large speakers suspended in the game area.

He plays the role of Vincent &quot;The Chin&quot; Gigante in the American crime drama television series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;. The series began in 2019 and is scheduled for a third season in 2023.

D&#x27;Onofrio returned to the role of Wilson Fisk/Kingpin in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (2021), and again in &quot;Echo&quot; (2024). He is set to reprise the role for &quot;&quot; (2025-present).

===Directing===
D&#x27;Onofrio has also had success behind the camera, producing &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996), in which he also starred, and &quot;Guy&quot; (1997) as well as executive producing &quot;The Velocity of Gary&quot; (1998) and &quot;Steal This Movie!&quot; (2000). In 2005, he directed and starred in the short film &quot;Five Minutes, Mr. Welles&quot; (2005), which represented a culmination of D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s desire to improve on his performance as Welles in &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, which reportedly left director Tim Burton underwhelmed. Burton decided to procure the services of Maurice LaMarche, a voiceoover artist known for his imitation of Welles&#x27; voice, to produce a more dramatically effective rendering of the character&#x27;s dialogue. Disappointed with his performance, having been given two weeks notice to prepare for the role, D&#x27;Onofrio wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the short in answer to the critics and himself. The film depicts D&#x27;Onofrio as Welles preparing for his role in &quot;The Third Man&quot;.

In 2008, he returned to directing with the feature-length musical slasher &quot;Don&#x27;t Go in the Woods&quot; (2010), written by his friend Joe Vinciguerra, featuring a score by Sam Bisbee, and starring various unknown actors hand-picked by D&#x27;Onofrio. It follows an indie rock band who venture into the woods to write new music, only to meet a crazed murderer (Tim Lajcik). The film, shot in 13 days near Kingston, New York, had a budget of $100,000 and played at numerous festivals throughout 2009 and 2010. Initially slated for national release in December 2011, the film opened to limited theaters on January 13, 2012, and was released on DVD on June 12, 2012. His next project is directing and starring in the 2019 western &quot;The Kid&quot;.

===Music===
On October 27, 2009, D&#x27;Onofrio made his musical debut, appearing in character as comedic country singer George Geronimo Gerkie at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City. He appeared as Gerkie again at New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom on December 6, 2009, during Matt Pinfield&#x27;s Holiday Extravaganza Show and at the premiere of his movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Go in the Woods&quot; at Joe&#x27;s Pub on May 28, 2010. A fourth concert was held at the pub on July 22, 2010, with proceeds from the event going to the Utah Meth Cops project.

On November 11, 2011, while teaching students at the Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, D&#x27;Onofrio discussed plans for further concerts, and a George Gerkie documentary which is to be filmed by &quot;Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston&quot; director Whitney Smith.

In September 2011, Australian hip hop band The Funkoars, released an album titled &quot;The Quickening&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Being Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio&quot;, an homage to D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s career and his work on &quot;Law and Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In February 2012, the band announced their upcoming &quot;Being Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio Tour 2012&quot; with artwork featuring D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s face in place of the band members&#x27;.

In 2014, D&#x27;Onofrio released two songs as part of an avant garde spoken-word project with multi-instrumentalist and composer Dana Lyn. The first single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Hamster&quot;, gathered attention on social media. The full album was made available for purchase in March 2015, on the band&#x27;s website.

=== Writing ===
In August 2022 D&#x27;Onofrio announced the upcoming publication of a children&#x27;s book based on his viral tweet about pigs and their reputed inability to look up. The book, entitled &quot;Pigs Can&#x27;t Look Up&quot;, was published in May 2023 and expanded on D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s original tweet, creating a character who commits to the act of kindness the tweet described.

=== Other work ===

In 1998, D&#x27;Onofrio, with his father Gene and sister Elizabeth, founded the RiverRun International Film Festival in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In 2003, former film producer and dean of the School of Filmmaking at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, Dale Pollock, took over the festival and moved it from Brevard, North Carolina, to Winston-Salem. Annually, the festival showcases the best films offered from the independent and international industry, as well as those from student filmmakers.

On August 9, 2012, it was announced that D&#x27;Onofrio had been chosen to narrate the documentary, &quot;Heroes Behind The Badge&quot; (2012). The film follows four fallen officers and the impact their deaths have had on their families, colleagues, and communities. The proceeds are benefitting a memorial museum being built in Washington, D.C. A longtime supporter of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, D&#x27;Onofrio has been the spokesperson for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and Museum since 2010. A follow-up to the documentary, subtitled &quot;Sacrifice and Survival&quot;, was released in the fall of 2013.

On November 13, 2012, D&#x27;Onofrio joined the cast of the off-Broadway production &quot;Clive&quot;, alongside Brooks Ashmanskas and Zoe Kazan. Produced by Jonathan Marc Sherman and directed by Ethan Hawke, the play, based on &quot;Baal&quot; by Bertolt Brecht, opened at The New Group at Theatre Row on February 7, 2013.

In June 2023, D&#x27;Onofrio filed for divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.

On November 10, 2004, D&#x27;Onofrio collapsed on the set of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. He collapsed again at home a few days later and was diagnosed with exhaustion, attributed to his 14-hour days filming &quot;Criminal Intent&quot;, and the making of his short film &quot;Five Minutes, Mr. Welles&quot; during the show&#x27;s hiatus.

D&#x27;Onofrio is dyslexic. In 2011, he stated his belief that he might have been diagnosed with autism as a child had knowledge of the condition been more advanced at the time.

<doc id="231102" wikidata="Q4697623" url="?curid=231102" title="Air-ground radiotelephone service">
<text>Air-ground radiotelephone service is a system that allows voice calls and other communication services to be made from an aircraft to either a satellite or land-based network. The service operates via a transceiver mounted in the aircraft on designated frequencies. In the US these frequencies have been allocated by the Federal Communications Commission. 

The system is used in both commercial and general aviation services. Licensees may offer a wide range of telecommunications services to passengers and others on aircraft.

==Design==
A U.S. air-ground radiotelephone transmits a radio signal in the 849 to 851 megahertz range; this signal is sent to either a receiving ground station or a communications satellite depending on the design of the particular system. &quot;Commercial aviation air-ground radiotelephone service licensees operate in the 800 MHz band and can provide communication services to all aviation markets, including commercial, governmental, and private aircraft.&quot; If it is a call from a commercial airline passenger radiotelephone, the call is then forwarded to a verification center to process credit card or calling card information. The verification center will then route the call to the public switched telephone network, which completes the call. For the return signal, ground stations and satellites use a radio signal in the 894 to 896 megahertz range.

==Frequencies==
Two separate frequency bands have been allocated by the FCC for air-ground telephone service. One at 454/459 MHz, was originally reserved for &quot;general&quot; aviation use (non-airliners) and the 800 MHz range, primarily used for airliner telephone service, which has shown limited acceptance by passengers. AT&amp;T Corporation abandoned its 800 MHz air-ground offering in 2005, and Verizon AIRFONE (formerly GTE Airfone) is scheduled for decommissioning in late 2008, although the FCC has re-auctioned Verizon&#x27;s spectrum (see below). Skytel, (now defunct) which had the third nationwide 800 MHz license, elected not to build it, but continued to operate in the 450 MHz AGRAS system. Its AGRAS license and operating network was sold to Bell Industries in April, 2007.

The 450 MHz General Aviation network is administered by Mid-America Computer Corporation in Blair, Nebraska, which has called the service AGRAS, and requires the use of instruments manufactured by Terra and Chelton Aviation/Wulfsberg Electronics, and marketed as the Flitephone VI Series. &quot;General aviation air-ground radiotelephone service licensees operate in the 450 MHz band and can provide a variety of telecommunications services to private aircraft such as small single engine planes and corporate jets.&quot;

In the 800 MHz band, the FCC defined 10 blocks of paired uplink/downlink narrowband ranges (6 kHz) and six control ranges (3.2 kHz). Six carriers were licensed to offer in-flight telephony, each being granted non-exclusive use of the 10 blocks and exclusive use of a control block. Of the six, only three commenced operations, and only one persisted into the 1990s, now known as Verizon Airfone.

== History ==

An air-to-ground radiotelephone technology demonstration occurred during 1923 Toulouse Air Show at Francazal and Montaudran airports, in France.

The first recorded air-to-ground radiotelephone service on a scheduled flight was in 1937 on the Chicago-Seattle route by Northwest Airlines.

AirFone commenced its service in the early 1980s starting with first-class under experimental licenses; the FCC&#x27;s formal allocation was in 1990. AirFone handsets were gradually extended to include one unit in each row of seats in economy. The service was always priced extremely high--$3.99 per call and $4.99 per minute in 2006—and has seen less and less use as the ready availability of cellular telephones has increased. In an FCC filing in 2005, the agency noted that 4,500 aircraft have AirFone service, and quoted Verizon AirFone&#x27;s president stating in an article in The New York Times that only two to three people per flight make a call.

Verizon added stock tickers and limited information services, but those had little use. In 2003, Verizon partnered with Tenzing Communications to offer very low-speed email using an on-board proxy server and limited live instant messaging at rates of 64 to 128 kbit/s on United Airlines and two other carriers. This service lasted about a year. (Tenzing was merged into a new entity called OnAir along with investment from Airbus and SITA, an airline-owned systems integrator. OnAir will launch satellite-based broadband service in 2006.)

On May 10, 2006, the FCC began Auction 65, which sold off the 4 MHz of spectrum over which radiotelephone calls were made, and required AirFone to revise its equipment within two years of the auction&#x27;s conclusion on June 2, 2006. Instead of the narrowband approach, with dedicated uplink and downlink for each call, Verizon is required to move its operations to a 1 MHz slice which is expected to provide substantially higher call volume and quality.

AirFone received a non-renewable license to share that 1 MHz until 2010 using vertical polarization with the winner of License D in Auction 65, LiveTV, a division of the airline JetBlue, which had not announced its plans at the end of the auction. A more broadband-oriented 3 MHz license (License C) was won by AC BidCo, LLC, a sister company of Aircell. Aircell will deploy in-flight broadband using this license. (License C includes 849.0-850.5 MHz and 894.0-895.5 MHz; License D includes 850.5-851.0 MHz and 895.5-896.0 MHz.)

An interim approach by Aircell was to utilize the existing ground-based cellular network, with highly directional antennas beamed upward. Although initially successful, the widespread conversion to GSM and spread-spectrum by carriers (not all carriers participated) made obsolete the early generation Aircell instruments. Some units were exchanged for satellite-based Iridium equipment, but Aircell&#x27;s recent acquisition of 3 MHz of the 800 MHz spectrum at auction at the FCC, will undoubtedly lead to a new generation of products.

Only the 450 MHz AGRAS network continues to operate in its original configuration.

<doc id="231112" wikidata="Q367240" url="?curid=231112" title="Gerard of Cremona">
<text>Gerard of Cremona (Latin: &quot;Gerardus Cremonensis&quot;; c. 1114 – 1187) was an Italian translator of scientific books from Arabic into Latin. He worked in Toledo, Kingdom of Castile and obtained the Arabic books in the libraries at Toledo. Some of the books had been originally written in Greek and, although well known in Byzantine Constantinople and Greece at the time, were unavailable in Greek or Latin in Western Europe. Gerard of Cremona is the most important translator among the Toledo School of Translators who invigorated Western medieval Europe in the twelfth century by transmitting the Arabs&#x27; and ancient Greeks&#x27; knowledge in astronomy, medicine and other sciences, by making the knowledge available in Latin. One of Gerard&#x27;s most famous translations is of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; from Arabic texts found in Toledo.

Confusingly, there appear to have been two translators of Arabic text into Latin known as &quot;Gerard of Cremona.&quot; The first was active in the 12th century and concentrated on astronomy and other scientific works, while the second was active in the 13th century and concentrated on medical works.

==Life==
Gerard was born in Cremona in northern Italy. Dissatisfied with the philosophies of his Italian teachers, Gerard went to Toledo. There he learned Arabic, initially so that he could read Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, which had a traditionally high reputation among scholars, but which, before his departure to Castile, was not yet known in Latin translation. The first Latin translation was made, from the Greek around 1160 in Sicily. Although we do not have detailed information of the date when Gerard went to Castile, it was no later than 1144.

Toledo, which had been a provincial capital in the Caliphate of Cordoba and remained a seat of learning, was safely available to a Catholic like Gerard, since it had been conquered from the Moors by Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085. Toledo remained a multicultural capital, insofar as its rulers protected the large Jewish and Muslim quarters, and kept their trophy city an important centre of Arab and Hebrew culture. One of the great scholars associated with Toledo was Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, Gerard&#x27;s contemporary. Mozarabic culture was common in the area. The city was full of libraries and manuscripts, and was one of the few places in medieval Europe where a Christian could be exposed to Arabic language and culture.

In Toledo Gerard devoted the remainder of his life to making Latin translations from the Arabic scientific literature.

==Gerard&#x27;s translations==

Gerard of Cremona&#x27;s Latin translation of the Arabic version of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; made c. 1175 was the most widely known in Western Europe before the Renaissance. Unbeknownst to Gerard, an earlier translation of the &quot;Almagest&quot; had already been made in Sicily from the original Greek c. 1160 under the aegis of Henricus Aristippus, although this version was not as widely used in the Middle Ages as Gerard&#x27;s version. George of Trebizond and then Johannes Regiomontanus retranslated it from the Greek original in the fifteenth century. The &quot;Almagest&quot; formed the basis for Western astronomy until it was eclipsed by the theories of Copernicus.

Gerard edited for Latin readers the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot;, the most accurate compilation of astronomical data ever seen in Europe at the time. The &quot;Tables&quot; were partly the work of Al-Zarqali, known to the West as Arzachel, a mathematician and astronomer who flourished in Cordoba in the eleventh century.

Al-Farabi, the Islamic &quot;second teacher&quot; after Aristotle, wrote hundreds of treatises. His book on the sciences, &quot;Kitab lhsa al Ulum,&quot; discussed classification and fundamental principles of science in a unique and useful manner. Gerard rendered it as &quot;De scientiis&quot; (&quot;On the Sciences&quot;).

Gerard translated Euclid’s &quot;Geometry&quot; and Alfraganus&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Astronomy&quot;.

Gerard also composed original treatises on algebra, arithmetic and astrology. In the astrology text, longitudes are reckoned both from Cremona and Toledo.

In total, Gerard of Cremona translated 87 books from the Arabic language, including such originally Greek works as Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, Archimedes&#x27; &quot;On the Measurement of the Circle&quot;, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;; and such originally Arabic works as al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s &quot;On Algebra and Almucabala&quot;, Jabir ibn Aflah&#x27;s &quot;Elementa astronomica&quot;, and works by al-Razi (Rhazes). Gerard of Cremona was also creator of anatomical terms. The Latin translation of the &quot;Calendar of Córdoba&quot;, entitled &quot;Liber Anoe&quot;, has also been attributed to Gerard.

==A second Gerard Cremonensis==

Some of the works credited to Gerard of Cremona are probably the work of a later Gerard Cremonensis, working in the thirteenth century, who was also known as Gerard de Sabloneta (Sabbioneta). The later Gerard focused on translating medical texts rather than astronomical texts, but the two translators have understandably been confused with one another. His translations from works of Avicenna are said to have been made by order of the emperor Frederick II.

Other treatises attributed to the &quot;Second Gerard&quot; include the &quot;Theoria&quot; or &quot;Theorica planetarum&quot;, and versions of Avicenna’s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;— the basis of the numerous subsequent Latin editions of that well-known work — and of the &quot;Almansor&quot; of al-Razi (&quot;Rhazes&quot; in Latin-speaking Europe). The attribution of the &quot;Theorica&quot; to Gerard of Sabbioneta is not well supported by manuscript evidence and should not be regarded as certain.

<doc id="231113" wikidata="Q7869488" url="?curid=231113" title="USS Franklin (1815)">
<text>USS &quot;Franklin&quot; of the United States Navy was a 74-gun ship of the line. She was named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin.

== Construction ==
Built in 1815 under the supervision of Samuel Humphreys and Charles Penrose she was the first vessel to be laid down at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was superintended by her commander Captain John Smith, who died before or right around her launch in August 1815.

== Description ==
This is the description of USS &quot;Franklin&quot; from Journal of Hezekiah Loomis: a frigate of 74 guns, launched with bowsprit, drawing 13.6 forward and 17.2 aft. When equipped for sea her lower deck ports amidships were within 4 feet of the water. In commission, 1815; 188 feet long; 50 feet beam; 20 feet hold.

== Service ==
&quot;Franklin&quot; sailed on her first cruise on 14 October 1817, when under the command of Master Commandant H. E. Ballard she proceeded from Philadelphia to the Mediterranean. She carried the Hon. Richard Rush, U.S. Minister to England, to his post. Subsequently she was designated flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron, cruising on that station until March 1820. She returned to New York City on 24 April 1820.

From 11 October 1821 until 29 August 1824 she served as flagship on the Pacific Squadron. &quot;Franklin&quot; was laid up in ordinary until the summer of 1838 when she was ordered to Boston as a receiving ship. She continued in this capacity until 1852 at which time she was taken to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, razed and broken up.

Parts from her were used in the construction of her successor, the screw frigate , launched in 1864.

<doc id="231114" wikidata="Q485220" url="?curid=231114" title="Good Charlotte">
<text>Good Charlotte is an American rock band formed in Waldorf, Maryland, in 1995. Since 2005, the band&#x27;s lineup has consisted of Joel Madden (lead vocals), Benji Madden (guitar, vocals), Paul Thomas (bass), Billy Martin (guitar, keyboards), and Dean Butterworth (drums, percussion).

The band released their self-titled debut album in 2000. In 2002, they released their second album, &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;. Featuring the singles &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, &quot;The Anthem&quot; and &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; sold 3.5 million copies in the US and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA, for a total of almost 5 million copies sold worldwide.

The band followed up with &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; in 2004; a darker album, both musically and lyrically. Backed by the singles &quot;Predictable&quot; and &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; continued the band&#x27;s success, and the album was certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the US alone. In 2007, they released the dance-punk inspired album &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot; before going back to their pop-punk-roots with the album &quot;Cardiology&quot; in 2010.

After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band released &quot;Youth Authority&quot; 2016, and in 2018 they released their latest album, &quot;Generation Rx&quot;. In addition, they released two compilations: &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 2010.

==History==

===Early years (1995–1999)===
Twin brothers Joel and Benji Madden formed Good Charlotte and worked full-time on the band. The Madden brothers focused on getting the band signed, reading books and magazines that would aid them in achieving this goal. They made promotional packages which they sent to record labels. Joel Madden learned that the girl he took to homecoming was a sister of bassist Paul Thomas. Thomas met the brothers and was impressed with their performance skills. and began playing clubs in the D.C. metro area. The Madden brothers moved to Annapolis, Maryland where they performed acoustic shows. The band named themselves Good Charlotte after the children&#x27;s book, &quot;Good Charlotte: Girls of the Good Day Orphanage&quot;, by Carol Beach York.

Guitarist Billy Martin went to one of these shows at the insistence of Jimi HaHa of Jimmie&#x27;s Chicken Shack. Martin became friends with the Madden brothers and let them move in with him after they were evicted from their apartment. Martin joined Good Charlotte after the trio learned they had a shared interest in the Australian rock band Silverchair and the break up of Martin&#x27;s band Overflow. They wrote new songs and recorded and performed demos. The band worked in support slots for Blink-182, Lit and Bad Religion. In 1999, Good Charlotte opened for Save Ferris in Philadelphia. After the performance, they left a demo of &quot;Little Things&quot; that soon got airplay on local radio station Y100. Benji Madden was certain of the song&#x27;s potential hit status with its high-school theme and the reality of its lyrics.

A Sony Music employee passed the band&#x27;s demo to regional promotion manager Mike Martinovich, who was impressed by the group&#x27;s writing ability and the autobiographical nature of the songs. He contacted talent manager Steve Feinberg, who flew to Annapolis to watch the group perform and later began working with them. Around the same time, WHFS also began playing the demo. As the track became a hit in the area, record labels began showing interest in Good Charlotte. By the end of 1999, the band went on an east-coast tour with Lit. Representatives from several major labels attended the New York City show of the tour.

=== &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; (2000–2001) ===
Starting in 2000, the group became a full-time touring act with support slots for Lit, Goldfinger, Sum 41, and Mest. Following a showcase in New York City, the group met with people in the music industry. David Massey, executive vice president of A&amp;R at major label Epic Records, signed the band to the label in May.

Good Charlotte&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; was released on September 26, 2000 through Epic and Daylight Records. The Japanese edition included &quot;The Click&quot;, a cover of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;If You Leave&quot; and a live acoustic version of &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; as bonus tracks. Sales did not meet the label&#x27;s expectations, and the group were nearly dropped from the label. In October and November, the group went on a US tour with Fenix TX, followed by a US tour with MxPx until the end of the year.

In December, the group appeared at HFSmas, the winter version of HFStival. On March 1, 2001, &quot;Little Things&quot; was released as a single in Australia. The CD version included &quot;The Click&quot; and &quot;Thank You Mom&quot; as B-sides. Despite the lack of success for &quot;Little Things&quot;, the group&#x27;s label allowed them to make another video, which was for &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot;. It was directed by Webb and features the band members on the ground, waking up one-by-one and starting to perform. Scenes from &quot;Undergrads&quot; were played on a TV. Between March and May, the group supported MxPx on their headlining US tour. In April, the video for &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; was receiving airplay from video outlets. While on the MxPx tour, the album was consistently selling 3,000 copies per week. As a result, the group wanted to make a live music video. At the end of May, the group performed at HFStival. During their set, a music video was filmed for &quot;Festival Song&quot;, directed by Marc Webb. The video ended up being a mini-documentary on the day. Members of Mest, New Found Glory, and Linkin Park appear in the video.

=== Mainstream success, &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; (2002–2003) ===
2002&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; sold 4.9 million copies and thrust the band into mainstream popularity. The band&#x27;s breakthrough single, titled &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, topped both pop and rock charts around the globe. Singles that were released from the album include &quot;The Anthem&quot;, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot;, and &quot;Hold On&quot;. The band cited Rancid, Social Distortion, and The Clash as influences for the album.

&quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 117,000 copies. By August 2003, the album had sold over 2 million copies, and by October 2004, 3 million. At that time, the album was still charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 2 years after its release. The album&#x27;s singles lifted the band from modern rock to top 40 radio stations, with all three major singles crossing over to the format. Each had major success in MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. As of 2011, it had sold over 3.5 million copies in the US. The album reached number 18 and 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end charts in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The album charted at number 6 in New Zealand, number 7 in Sweden, number 9 in Australia, number 15 in the UK, number 20 in Austria, number 24 in Japan, number 46 in Switzerland, number 52 in France, and number 57 in the Netherlands.

Around this time, the Used were aware that Good Charlotte were in need of a drummer, and introduced them to Chris Wilson. Shortly after this, he became the group&#x27;s drummer. In July, the group filmed a video for &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot;. Directed by Bill Fishman, it features appearances from &#x27;NSYNC vocalist Chris Kirkpatrick, Tenacious D guitarist Kyle Gass and Minutemen bassist Mike Watt. In the video, the group perform inside a mansion, before police surround the mansion. The band is subsequently arrested and appear before a courtroom. The song was released to modern rock radio on August 13, and released as a CD single on September 9. It featured &quot;Cemetery&quot;, &quot;The Click&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; as B-sides. &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; was released on October 1 through Epic and Daylight Records. The group supported No Doubt on their arena tour for a few shows in early October. In October and November, the group went on a headlining US tour.

Between September and November, the group embarked on a headlining US arena tour. The first half was supported by Mest and Something Corporate, while the remaining half was supported by Eve 6 and Goldfinger. At the start of the tour, &quot;Hold On&quot; was released to alternative rock radio. In October, the group filmed a music video for &quot;Hold On&quot; with director Samuel Bayer. The video premiered on November 12 on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. For the video, the group collaborated with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. It features people with deceased relatives and people who have attempted suicide. In December, the group went on a UK tour with Sugarcult and Mest. In January 2004, the group went on a tour of Japan. &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; were released as a joint single on January 13. A music video was made for &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot;, directed by Sam Erickson and the Madden brothers. The video was filmed on a sound stage in Indianapolis, Indiana and the set was filled with a variety of trophies and ribbons, which the band destroy towards the end of the video. In September, the album was reissued as a two-CD package with &quot;Good Charlotte&quot;.

=== &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; (2004–2006) ===
&quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was made available for streaming on October 1 through MTV&#x27;s The Leak. Initially planned for release in September, &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was officially released on October 5 through Epic and Daylight Records. It was released in two different editions: Life (with &quot;Falling Away&quot; as a bonus track) and Death (with &quot;Meet My Maker&quot; as a bonus track), both with different artwork created by Martin. The art for the Life resembles a first-edition book, while the art for the Death version resembles a 100-year-old book. The album booklet is done in the style of a storybook with the song lyrics detailing a story accompanied by illustrations. The album sold nearly 200,000 copies in its first week and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States. The group debuted material from the album during a show in New York. Alkaline Trio drummer Derek Grant temporarily substituted for drummer Chris Wilson during the show as Wilson was reportedly receiving therapy. Grant subsequently played with the group for a few more promotional events, which included an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and in-store performances.

In October and November, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Sum 41. They were supported by Lola Ray and Hazen Street. &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; was released as a CD single in Australia on January 17, 2005, with live versions of &quot;S.O.S.&quot; and &quot;The World Is Black&quot; as B-sides. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Brett Simon, features the group performing in a dive bar before the members return to their day jobs. Eventually, someone from the music industry signs the band, known as the Food Group, who are dressed as an array of food items. In February 2005, the band appeared at MTV Asia&#x27;s tsunami-relief event for the tsunami in Southeast Asia, before touring Australia. The group embarked on a tour of Europe and the UK in March with support from The Explosion. In early April, a music video was filmed for &quot;We Believe&quot; with director Sam Erickson at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The video features the group performing in an abandoned theatre overlapped with war imagery and people suffering.

In May and June, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Simple Plan, dubbed the Noise to the World tour. They were supported by Relient K. A few dates into the tour, Wilson left the group citing to health concerns. He was replaced by Dean Butterworth. The group met him through John Feldmann of Goldfinger. &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was released as a CD single in Australia on June 3 with live versions of &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; and &quot;Mountain&quot;, and a remix of &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; as B-sides. &quot;We Believe&quot; was released as a single on August 15. In October, the band appeared at the Bridge School Benefit and on November 13 the album was released on the DualDisc format. It included a making-of documentary and live performances. Later, in March 2007, Butterworth was confirmed as the band&#x27;s permanent drummer. Benji Madden has claimed in interviews that he feels this record was not as successful as the previous record due to it being &quot;too selfish.&quot;

=== &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot; and &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; (2007–2008) ===

&quot;Good Morning Revival&quot; is the fourth album by Good Charlotte and the follow-up to 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot;. It was officially released in March 2007, with the precise date varying by country. &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot; debuted in the top 10 of thirteen countries worldwide including the U.S., giving the band some of its highest international chart positions thus far, and went on to sell 4.5 million copies. At midnight, on January 23, 2007, the record was made available for pre-order on iTunes. When pre-ordered, the single &quot;The River&quot; could be downloaded immediately, while the rest of the album was queued to be downloaded on the release date. Pre-ordering on iTunes also provided the exclusive bonus acoustic version of the song. This album was suggested a different sound for the group apart from the group&#x27;s pop punk roots.

The first single from the album, &quot;The River&quot;, featuring Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s lead singer M. Shadows and guitarist Synyster Gates, appeared online on January 4, 2007, and was released as the first single from the album in North America. The music video for &quot;The River&quot; was added to UK music channels Kerrang! and Scuzz on April 13, 2007, making it the second single released from the album in the UK. The song charted at No. 108. &quot;Keep Your Hands off My Girl&quot; was released as the first single in the UK and Australia. &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Girl&quot; charted on the UK Singles Chart at No. 36 the first week of release through download sales and then climbed to No. 23 when released in stores. The second single released in North America was &quot;Dance Floor Anthem&quot;, with which the band had scored a surprise hit, making it onto 11 different Billboard charts and peaking at No. 2 in Australia. The &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Girl&quot; video was certified gold by MTV International in December 2007. It was played 3,000 times on over four continents during the first half of 2007. On January 1, 2008, Good Charlotte was featured on Tila Tequila&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve Masquerade on MTV, as the band was the second performance of the new year and performed its hit &quot;Dance Floor Anthem&quot;.

The band made multiple U.S. and international TV appearances in support of the album. First, Good Charlotte appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on April 9, 2007, the Outdoor Stage on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on April 11, and on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on April 27. Joel and Benji Madden, Good Charlotte&#x27;s lead singer and guitarist respectively, co-hosted the Australian MTV Video Music Awards with Fergie on April 29, 2007 where the band also won the &quot;Viewers Choice Australia&quot; award for &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Girl&quot;.

The band made an appearance performing in the 2008 iCarly movie, iGo to Japan.

On November 25, 2008, &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; was released. This compilation album includes 15 songs from previous Good Charlotte albums remixed by other artists such as Metro Station, Junior Sanchez, William Beckett from The Academy Is..., Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy, and The White Tie Affair featuring Mat Devine of Kill Hannah.

=== &quot;Cardiology&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2009–2011) ===

Describing the sound to MTV news, Joel Madden said it would sound a lot like Blink-182. Joel Madden went on to say in the same MTV interview that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing dance-y on the record, though, at all, which is different from our last one,&quot; further implying a movement away from the sound of &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot;. On December 3, 2008, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine announced that Good Charlotte would be releasing its fifth studio album, &quot;Cardiology&quot; in 2009. The title of which, according to Joel, comes from the lyrical content of the album, which he explained is &quot;all connected to the heart&quot;. Madden also added that the band had already written 20 songs for the new album, and are said to be heading back to their pop-punk roots. On January 24, 2010 Good Charlotte announced that the band had finished the album, but were going to completely scrap it and record with a different producer, Don Gilmore, who also produced the band&#x27;s first and fourth records, &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot;.

The band released its first single &quot;Like It&#x27;s Her Birthday&quot; featuring Tonight Alive from the new album on August 24, 2010. The band posted the song online August 5, 2010, and wrote on its website that if the video of the song received more than 100,000 views, the band would post another song from the album. The video reached 100,000 views on August 15, 2010 and the band released &quot;Counting the Days&quot; as a video on its YouTube channel and announced that it will be the second single from the album. The music video for &quot;Like It&#x27;s Her Birthday&quot; has cameos from The Maine&#x27;s lead singer John O&#x27;Callaghan and guitarist Kennedy Brock and Boys Like Girls&#x27; lead singer Martin Johnson, and guitarist Paul DiGiovanni.

On November 5, 2010, Good Charlotte&#x27;s former label, Sony Music, released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation for Australia, spanning 16 singles from the band&#x27;s four studio albums released on that label. The compilation was later released in the US on January 6, 2011, and in Japan on February 16, 2011.

On September 13, 2010, it was announced that Good Charlotte will be headlining the 2011 Kerrang! Relentless Tour, with supporting acts Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley, and The Wonder Years. On March 3, 2011, Good Charlotte went on tour with This Century and Forever The Sickest Kids throughout North America, playing multiple shows at small high schools across the country. In June 2011 Good Charlotte set out on a U.S. tour co-headlining with Yellowcard and opening act Runner Runner. In June 2011 on an interview with Punkvideosrock.com Billy and Paul stated they were in the process of planning tours for the next 5 years.

On September 1, 2011, Good Charlotte announced a hiatus via an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, but The Madden Brothers released a free mix tape in October 2011, &quot;Before — Volume One&quot;. and their debut album &quot;Greetings From California&quot; was released in September 2014, which featured Good Charlotte drummer Dean Butterworth as session performer.

=== &quot;Youth Authority&quot; and &quot;Generation Rx&quot; (2015–present) ===
On June 2, 2015, Good Charlotte was featured in Waka Flocka&#x27;s song &quot;Game On&quot;, a song from the soundtrack to the &quot;Pixels&quot; movie.

On November 3, 2015, the band announced an official end to the hiatus through &quot;Alternative Press&quot; and on November 5 the band released a single, &quot;Makeshift Love&quot;. A music video for &quot;Makeshift Love&quot; featuring Mikey Way and John Feldmann, including a cameo of the band Waterparks, was released on November 13, 2015. The band performed its first show since its reformation on November 19, 2015, at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. The band supported All Time Low on the UK and Ireland leg of the Back to the Future Hearts tour in 2016.

The group released their sixth studio album, &quot;Youth Authority&quot;, on July 15, 2016, with guest appearances from Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens and Simon Neil of Biffy Clyro. The album release date was announced on March 30, 2016, with the album title and art following several days later. Discussing the album title, Joel Madden said &quot;Youth Authority&quot; was the concept that &quot;there&#x27;s a kid out there right now who has a guitar, or a microphone, or a laptop, with a dream that is going to beat the odds.&quot; He said the album felt like the &quot;GC of the past&quot; with &quot;a new energy to it.&quot;

On December 8, 2017, the band released a three-song EP, &quot;A GC Christmas, Pt. 1&quot;, which included a cover of Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, a full-band version of their previously unreleased song, &quot;Christmas by the Phone&quot;, and an alternate version of &quot;Let the World Be Still&quot;, originally by their side project, The Madden Brothers.

On May 24, 2018, the band announced a new album set for September 14, 2018 called &quot;Generation Rx&quot;. This coincided with the release of a new single called &quot;Actual Pain&quot;. They also announced a tour for 2019 to promote the album. The opioid epidemic inspired the album&#x27;s title: Rx is often used as an abbreviation for medical prescriptions in the US. The album initially had the working title &quot;Cold Song&quot;, but was changed after the band realised pain was a running theme throughout the album. &quot;Generation Rx&quot; talks about several issues: the opioid epidemic, struggles with mental health, difficulty with self-esteem, and the effect of organized religion on other peoples&#x27; lives. According to Joel Madden, the album was &quot;all about that inner struggle, and ... the emotional experience we&#x27;re all going through that gets us to a place where we want to kill the pain that&#x27;s in all of us.&quot; The band played a surprise guest set on the final Vans Warped Tour on July 29, 2018.

On April 2, 2020, Benji and Joel Madden did a Good Charlotte performance livestream via Veeps, a livestreaming company owned by Joel Madden, with all proceeds going to &quot;charitable efforts in our community in the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;. On September 25, 2020, Billy Martin did a guitar play through livestream on the 20th anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album. On December 18, 2020, after a week of previous teasing, Good Charlotte released a single called &quot;Last December&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s first new music in two years.

On October 7, 2024, during Episode 91 of Artist Friendly, a podcast hosted by Joel Madden, he revealed to Dexter Holland from the band The Offspring that Good Charlotte was planning to &quot;put a record out next year&quot;, the first in seven years since Generation Rx. No more information was revealed.

==Musical style and influences==
Good Charlotte has been mainly described as a pop-punk band. The band also has been described as alternative rock, emo, punk rock, pop rock, skate punk, and emo pop. According to writer Bruce Britt, Good Charlotte combine &quot;the hard-charging fury of skate-punk, the melodiousness of pop, and the spooky, mascara-smeared sensibilities of &#x27;80s goth&quot;. According to program director Robert Benjamin, Benji Madden told him Good Charlotte &quot;wanted to be a combination of the Backstreet Boys and Minor Threat&quot;. Benji was a fan of punk band Social Distortion whereas his brother Joel was interested in bands like The Smiths and The Cure. Good Charlotte cite Beastie Boys, Minor Threat, the Clash, the Sex Pistols, Rancid, and Green Day as their influences.

== Activism ==
Billy Martin is a vegetarian and won PETA&#x27;s vegetarian of the year in 2012. In the past, the band actively supported PETA&#x27;s animal rights campaigns. Members of the group recorded a track, &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, on PETA&#x27;s &quot;Liberation&quot; CD and appeared at PETA&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Gala and Humanitarian Awards Show. Group members have also demonstrated against KFC&#x27;s treatment of chickens. However, in 2012 and 2013, band members heavily promoted Kentucky Fried Chicken in a series of Australian television commercials, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.

<doc id="231116" wikidata="Q11653806" url="?curid=231116" title="USS New Hampshire (1864)">
<text>USS &quot;New Hampshire&quot; was a 2,633-ton ship originally designed to be the 74-gun ship of the line &quot;Alabama&quot;, but after being laid down in June 1819, she remained on the stocks for nearly 40 years, well into the age of steam. Renamed as &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, she was launched as a storeship and depot ship for use during the American Civil War. She was later renamed as &quot;Granite State&quot;. The ship burned and sank in the Hudson River in May 1921, and after being refloated, again caught fire and sank under tow near Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, in July 1922.

==Service history==
===&quot;Alabama&quot;===
As &quot;Alabama&quot;, she was one of &quot;nine ships to rate not less than 74 guns each&quot; authorized by Congress on 29 April 1816, and was laid down by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine, in June 1819, the year the State of Alabama was admitted to the Union. Though ready for launch by 1825, she remained on the stocks for preservation; an economical measure that avoided the expense of manning and maintaining a ship of the line.

===&quot;New Hampshire&quot;===
Renamed &quot;New Hampshire&quot; on 28 October 1863, the ship was launched on 23 April 1864, fitted out as a storeship and depot ship of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and commissioned on 13 May 1864, Commodore Henry K. Thatcher in command.

&quot;New Hampshire&quot; sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 15 June and relieved sister ship on 29 July 1864 as store and depot ship at Port Royal, South Carolina, and served there through the end of the Civil War. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 June 1866, serving as a receiving ship there until 10 May 1876, when she sailed back to Port Royal. She resumed duty at Norfolk in 1881 but soon shifted to Newport, Rhode Island. She became flagship of Commodore Stephen B. Luce&#x27;s newly formed Apprentice Training Squadron, marking the commencement of an effective apprentice training program for the Navy. Four of &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s crewmen earned the Medal of Honor for jumping overboard to rescue fellow sailors from drowning in two separate 1882 incidents: Quartermaster Henry J. Manning and Ship&#x27;s Printer John McCarton on 4 January 1882, and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate James F. Sullivan and Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Jeremiah Troy on 21 April 1882.

&quot;New Hampshire&quot; was towed from Newport to New London, Connecticut, in 1891 and was receiving ship there until decommissioned on 5 June 1892. The following year, she was loaned as a training ship for the New York Naval Militia, which was to furnish nearly 1,000 officers and men to the Navy during the Spanish–American War.

===&quot;Granite State&quot;===
The ship was renamed &quot;Granite State&quot; on 30 November 1904 to free the name &quot;New Hampshire&quot; for a newly authorized battleship, . Stationed in the Hudson River, &quot;Granite State&quot; continued training service throughout the years leading to World War I when state naval militia were practically the only trained and equipped men available to the Navy for immediate service. They were mustered into the Navy as National Naval Volunteers. Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy and also a newspaper editor, wrote in his paper &quot;Our Navy at War&quot;, &quot;never again will men dare ridicule the Volunteer, the Reservist, the man who in a national crisis lays aside civilian duty to become a soldier or sailor—they fought well. They died well. They have left in deeds and words a record that will be an inspiration to unborn generations.&quot;

&quot;Granite State&quot; served the New York state militia until she caught fire and sank at her pier in the Hudson River on 23 May 1921. Her hull was sold for salvage on 19 August to the Mulholland Machinery Corporation. Refloated in July 1922, she was taken in tow headed for the Bay of Fundy. The towline parted during a storm, she again caught fire and sank off Half Way Rock near Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, on 26 July.

The shipwreck is in of water, and is an easy scuba dive mission. Although the hull is mostly buried in the sand, small artifacts and copper spikes may still be found. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 October 1976, reference number 76000261.

<doc id="231119" wikidata="Q1199178" url="?curid=231119" title="Four fours">
<text>Four fours is a mathematical puzzle, the goal of which is to find the simplest mathematical expression for every whole number from 0 to some maximum, using only common mathematical symbols and the digit four. No other digit is allowed. Most versions of the puzzle require that each expression have exactly four fours, but some variations require that each expression have some &quot;minimum&quot; number of fours. The puzzle requires skill and mathematical reasoning.

The first printed occurrence of the specific problem of four fours is in &quot;&quot; in 1881. A similar problem involving arranging four identical digits to equal a certain amount was given in Thomas Dilworth&#x27;s popular 1734 textbook &quot;The Schoolmaster&#x27;s Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic Both Practical and Theoretical&quot;.

W. W. Rouse Ball described it in the 6th edition (1914) of his &quot;Mathematical Recreations and Essays&quot;. In this book it is described as a &quot;traditional recreation&quot;.

==Rules==
There are many variations of four fours; their primary difference is which mathematical symbols are allowed. Essentially all variations at least allow addition (&quot;+&quot;), subtraction (&quot;−&quot;), multiplication (&quot;×&quot;), division (&quot;÷&quot;), and parentheses, as well as concatenation (e.g., &quot;44&quot; is allowed). Most also allow the factorial (&quot;!&quot;), exponentiation (e.g. &quot;444&quot;), the decimal point (&quot;.&quot;) and the square root (&quot;√&quot;) operation. Other operations allowed by some variations include the reciprocal function (&quot;1/x&quot;), subfactorial (&quot;!&quot; before the number: !4 equals 9), overline (an infinitely repeated digit), an arbitrary root, the square function (&quot;sqr&quot;), the cube function (&quot;cube&quot;), the cube root, the gamma function (Γ(), where Γ(&quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; − 1)!), and percent (&quot;%&quot;). Therefore:

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4

:formula_5

:formula_6

:formula_7

:formula_8

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

etc.

A common use of the overline in this problem is for this value:
:formula_11

Typically, the successor function is not allowed since any integer above 4 is trivially reachable with it. Similarly, &quot;log&quot; operators are usually not allowed as they allow a general method to produce any non-negative integer. This works by noticing three things:

#It is possible to take square roots repeatedly without using any additional 4s
#A square root can also be written as the exponent (^(1/2))
#Exponents have logarithms as their inverse.

:formula_13

Writing repeated square root in this form we can isolate n, which is the number of square roots:

:formula_14

We can isolate both exponents by using the base 4 logarithm:

:formula_15

This logarithm can be thought of as the answer to the question: &quot;4 to what power gives me 4 to the half power to the n power?&quot;

:formula_16

so we are now left with:

:formula_17

and now we can take a logarithm to isolate the exponent, n:

:formula_18

so, putting it all together:

:formula_19

Now, we can rewrite the base (1/2) with only 4s and the exponent (1/2) back to a square root:

:formula_20

We have used four fours and now the number of square roots we add equals whatever non-negative integer we wanted.

Paul Bourke credits Ben Rudiak-Gould with a different description of how four fours can be solved using natural logarithms (ln(n)) to represent any positive integer &quot;n&quot; as:
:formula_21

Additional variants (usually no longer called &quot;four fours&quot;) replace the set of digits (&quot;4, 4, 4, 4&quot;) with some other set of digits, say of the birthyear of someone. For example, a variant using &quot;1975&quot; would require each expression to use one 1, one 9, one 7, and one 5.

==Solutions==

Here is a set of four fours solutions for the numbers 0 through 32, using typical rules. Some alternate solutions are listed here, although there are actually many more correct solutions. The entries in blue are those that use four integers 4 (rather than four digits 4) and the basic arithmetic operations. Numbers without blue entries have no solution under these constraints. Additionally, solutions that repeat operators are marked in italics.

Note that numbers with values less than one are not usually written with a leading zero. For example, &quot;0.4&quot; is usually written as &quot;.4&quot;. This is because &quot;0&quot; is a digit, and in this puzzle only the digit &quot;4&quot; can be used.

There are also many other ways to find the answer for all of these. A given number will generally have a few possible solutions; any solution that meets the rules is acceptable. Some variations prefer the &quot;fewest&quot; number of operations or prefer some operations to others. Others simply prefer &quot;interesting&quot; solutions, i.e., a surprising way to reach the goal.

Certain numbers, such as 113, 157, and 347, are particularly difficult to solve under typical rules. For 113, Wheeler suggests formula_22. Another solution is formula_23. A non-standard solution is formula_24, where 4&#x27; is the multiplicative inverse of 4. (i.e. formula_25) Another possible solution is formula_26, where formula_27 and formula_28 represent the 14th and 127th multifactorials respectively and should technically be denoted with that many exclamation marks to adhere to the rules of the problem. Note that the number 113/16 can be written by three 4&#x27;s, but this does not help for 113 unless the square function (i.e. &quot;sq&quot;(4) = 16) is allowed.

The use of percent (&quot;%&quot;) admits solutions for a much greater proportion of numbers; for example, 113 = (√4 + (√4 + 4!)%) ÷ (√4)%.

==Algorithmics of the problem==
This problem and its generalizations (like the five fives and the six sixes problem, both shown below) may be solved by a simple algorithm. The basic ingredients are hash tables that map rationals to strings. In these tables, the keys are the numbers being represented by some admissible combination of operators and the chosen digit &quot;d&quot;, e.g. four, and the values are strings that contain the actual formula. There is one table for each number &quot;n&quot; of occurrences of &quot;d&quot;. For example, when &quot;d=4&quot;, the hash table for two occurrences of &quot;d&quot; would contain the key-value pair &quot;8&quot; and 4+4, and the one for three occurrences, the key-value pair &quot;2&quot; and (4+4)/4 (strings shown in bold).

The task is then reduced to recursively computing these hash tables for increasing &quot;n&quot;, starting from &quot;n=1&quot; and continuing up to e.g. &quot;n=4.&quot; The tables for &quot;n=1&quot; and &quot;n=2&quot; are special, because they contain primitive entries that are not the combination of other, smaller formulas, and hence they must be initialized properly, like so (for &quot;n=1&quot;)

 T[4] := &quot;4&quot;;
 T[4/10] := &quot;.4&quot;;
 T[4/9] := &quot;.4...&quot;;

and

 T[44] := &quot;44&quot;;.

(for &quot;n=2&quot;). Now there are two ways in which new entries may arise, either as a combination of existing ones through a binary operator, or by applying the factorial or square root operators (which does not use additional instances of &quot;d&quot;). The first case is treated by iterating over all pairs of subexpressions that use a total of &quot;n&quot; instances of &quot;d&quot;. For example, when &quot;n=4&quot;, we would check pairs &quot;(a,b)&quot; with &quot;a&quot; containing one instance of &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; three, and with &quot;a&quot; containing two instances of &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; two as well. We would then enter &quot;a+b, a-b, b-a, a*b, a/b, b/a)&quot; into the hash table, including parenthesis, for &quot;n=4&quot;. Here the sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; that contain &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are calculated recursively, with &quot;n=1&quot; and &quot;n=2&quot; being the base case. Memoization is used to ensure that every hash table is only computed once. 

The second case (factorials and roots) is treated with the help of an auxiliary function, which is invoked every time a value &quot;v&quot; is recorded. This function computes nested factorials and roots of &quot;v&quot; up to some maximum depth, restricted to rationals.

The last phase of the algorithm consists in iterating over the keys of the table for the desired value of &quot;n&quot; and extracting and sorting those keys that are integers. This algorithm was used to calculate the five fives and six sixes examples shown below. The more compact formula (in the sense of number of characters in the corresponding value) was chosen every time a key occurred more than once.

 243 = (6+((6*(.6*66))-.6))
 244 = (.6...*(6+(6*(66-6))))
 245 = ((((6)!+((6)!+66))/6)-6)
 246 = (66+(6*((6*6)-6)))
 247 = (66+((6+((6)!/.6...))/6))
 248 = (6*(6+(6*(6-(.6.../6)))))
 249 = (.6+(6*(6+((6*6)-.6))))
 250 = (((6*(6*6))-66)/.6)
 251 = ((6*(6+(6*6)))-(6/6))

<text>A cataphract was a form of armoured heavy cavalry that originated in Persia and was fielded in ancient warfare throughout Eurasia and Northern Africa.

Historically, the cataphract was a very heavily armoured horseman, with both the rider and mount almost completely covered in scale or lamellar armour over chain mail, and typically wielding a kontos (lance) as his primary weapon.

Cataphracts served as the elite cavalry force for most empires and nations that fielded them, primarily used for charges to break through opposing heavy cavalry and infantry formations. Chronicled by many historians from the earliest days of antiquity up until the High Middle Ages, they may have influenced the later European knights, through contact with the Eastern Roman Empire.

Peoples and states deploying cataphracts at some point in their history included: the Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Medes, Parthians, Achaemenids, Sakas, Armenians, Seleucids, Attalid, Pontus, Greco-Bactrian, Sassanids, Romans, Goths, Byzantines, Georgians, Chinese, Koreans, Jurchens, Mongols, Tanguts and Songhai.

In Europe, the fashion for heavily armoured Roman cavalry seems to have been a response to the Eastern campaigns of the Parthians and Sasanians in Anatolia, as well as numerous defeats at the hands of Iranian cataphracts across the steppes of Eurasia, most notably in the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC) in upper Mesopotamia. Traditionally, Roman cavalry was neither heavily-armoured nor decisive in effect; the Roman equites corps comprised mainly lightly-armoured horsemen bearing spears and swords and using light cavalry tactics to skirmish before and during battles, and then to pursue retreating enemies after a victory. The adoption of cataphract-like cavalry formations took hold among the late Roman army during the late 3rd and 4th centuries. The Emperor Gallienus () and his general and putative usurper Aureolus (died 268) arguably contributed much to the institution of Roman cataphract contingents in the Late Roman army.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is Greek. (, , , or ) is composed of the Greek root words, , a preposition, and (&quot;covered, protected&quot;), which is interpreted along the lines of &quot;fully armoured&quot; or &quot;closed from all sides&quot;. The term first appears substantively in Latin, in the writings of Lucius Cornelius Sisenna: &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;the armoured, whom they call cataphract&quot;.

There appears to be some confusion about the term in the late Roman period, as armoured cavalrymen of any sort that were traditionally referred to as in the Republican period later became exclusively designated as &quot;cataphracts&quot;. Vegetius, writing in the fourth century, described armour of any sort as &quot;cataphracts&quot; – which at the time of writing would have been either or . Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman soldier and historian of the fourth century, mentions the &quot;&quot; – the &quot;cataphract cavalry which they regularly call clibanarii&quot; (implying that clibanarii is a foreign term, not used in Classical Latin).

&quot;Clibanarii&quot; is a Latin word for &quot;mail-clad riders&quot;, itself a derivative of the Greek (), meaning &quot;camp oven bearers&quot; from the Greek word , meaning &quot;camp oven&quot; or &quot;metallic furnace&quot;; the word has also been tentatively linked to the Persian word for a warrior, . However, it appears with more frequency in Latin sources than in Greek throughout antiquity. A twofold origin of the Greek term has been proposed: either that it was a humorous reference to the heavily armoured cataphracts as men encased in armour who would heat up very quickly much like in an oven; or that it was further derived from the Old Persian word &quot;*griwbanar&quot; (or &quot;*grivpanvar&quot;), itself composed of the Iranian roots &quot;griva-pana-bara&quot;, which translates into &quot;neck-guard wearer&quot;.

Roman chroniclers and historians Arrian, Aelian and Asclepiodotus use the term &quot;cataphract&quot; in their military treatises to describe any type of cavalry with either partial or full horse and rider armour. The Byzantine historian Leo Diaconis calls them (), which would translate as &quot;fully iron-clad knights&quot;.

There is, therefore, some doubt as to what exactly cataphracts were in late antiquity, and whether or not they were distinct from . Some historians theorise that cataphracts and were one and the same type of cavalry, designated differently simply as a result of their divided geographical locations and local linguistic preferences. Cataphract-like cavalry under the command of the Western Roman Empire, where Latin was the official tongue, always bore the Latinized variant of the original Greek name, . The cataphract-like cavalry stationed in the Eastern Roman Empire had no exclusive term ascribed to them, with both the Latin variant and the Greek innovation being used in historical sources, largely because of the Byzantines&#x27; heavy Greek influence (especially after the 7th century, when Latin ceased to be the official language). Contemporary sources, however, sometimes imply that were in fact a heavier type of cavalryman, or formed special-purpose units (such as the late , a Roman equivalent of horse archers, first mentioned in the &quot;&quot;). Given that &quot;cataphract&quot; was used for more than a millennium by various cultures, it appears that different types of fully armoured cavalry in the armies of different nations were assigned this name by Greek and Roman scholars not familiar with the native terms for such cavalry.

==Iranian origins==
The reliance on cavalry as a means of warfare in general lies with the ancient Indo-European inhabitants of the Central Asian steppes in early antiquity, who were one of the first peoples to domesticate the horse and pioneered the development of the chariot. Some of these nomadic tribes and wandering pastoralists (Bronze-Age), the Iranians, migrated from the steppes of Central Asia into the Iranian Plateau and Greater Iran from around 1000 BC to 800 BC. Two of these tribes are attested based upon archaeological evidence: the Mitanni and the Kassites. Although evidence is scant, they are believed to have raised and bred horses for specific purposes, as is evidenced by the large archaeological record of their use of the chariot and several treatises on the training of chariot horses. The one founding prerequisite towards the development of cataphract cavalry in the Ancient Near East, apart from advanced metalworking techniques and the necessary grazing pastures for raising horses, was the development of selective breeding and animal husbandry. Cataphract cavalry needed immensely strong and endurant horses, and without selectively breeding horses for muscular strength and hardiness, they would have surely not been able to bear the immense loads of armor and a rider during the strain of battle. The Near East is generally believed to have been the focal point for where this first occurred.

The previously mentioned early Indo-Iranian kingdoms and statehoods were to a large degree the ancestors of the north-eastern Iranian tribes and the Medians, who would found the first Iranian Empire in 625 BC. It was the Median Empire that left the first written proof of horse breeding around the 7th century BC, being the first to propagate a specific horse breed, known as the Nisean, which originated in the Zagros Mountains for use as heavy cavalry. The Nisean would become renowned in the Ancient World and particularly in Ancient Persia as the mount of nobility. These warhorses, sometimes referred to as &quot;Nisean chargers&quot;, were highly sought after by the Greeks, and are believed to have influenced many modern horse breeds. With the growing aggressiveness of cavalry in warfare, protection of the rider and the horse became paramount. This was especially true of peoples who treated cavalry as the basic arm of their military, such as the Ancient Persians, including the Medes and the successive Persian dynasties. To a larger extent, the same can be said of all the Ancient Iranian peoples: second only to perhaps the bow, horses were held in reverence and importance in these societies as their preferred and mastered medium of warfare, due to an intrinsic link throughout history with the domestication and evolution of the horse.

These early riding traditions, which were strongly tied to the ruling caste of nobility (as only those of noble birth or caste could become cavalry warriors), now spread throughout the Eurasian steppes and Iranian plateau from around 600 BC and onwards due to contact with the Median Empire&#x27;s vast expanse across Central Asia, which was the native homeland of the early, north-eastern Iranian ethnic groups such as the Massagetae, Scythians, Sakas, and Dahae. The successive Persian Empires that followed the Medes after their downfall in 550 BC took these already long-standing military tactics and horse-breeding traditions and infused their centuries of experience and veterancy from conflicts against the Greek city-states, Babylonians, Assyrians, Scythians, and North Arabian tribes with the significant role cavalry played not only in warfare but everyday life to form a military reliant almost entirely upon armored horses for battle.

==Spread to Central Asia and the Near East==

The evolution of the heavily armored horseman was not isolated to one focal point during a specific era (such as the Iranian plateau), but rather developed simultaneously in different parts of Central Asia (especially among the peoples inhabiting the Silk Road) as well as within Greater Iran. Assyria and the Khwarezm region were also significant to the development of cataphract-like cavalry during the 1st millennium BC. Reliefs discovered in the ancient ruins of Nimrud (the ancient Assyrian city founded by king Shalmaneser I during the 13th century BC) are the earliest known depictions of riders wearing plated-mail shirts composed of metal scales, presumably deployed to provide the Assyrians with a tactical advantage over the unprotected mounted archers of their nomadic enemies, primarily the Aramaeans, Mushki, North Arabian tribes and the Babylonians. The Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) period, under which the Neo-Assyrian Empire was formed and reached its military peak, is believed to have been the first context within which the Assyrian kingdom formed crude regiments of cataphract-like cavalry. Even when armed only with pikes, these early horsemen were effective mounted cavalrymen, but when provided with bows under Sennacherib (705–681 BC), they eventually became capable both of long-range and hand-to-hand combat, mirroring the development of dual-purpose cataphract archers by the Parthian Empire during the 1st century BC.

Archaeological excavations also indicate that, by the 6th century BC, similar experimentation had taken place among the Iranian peoples inhabiting the Khwarezm region and Aral Sea basin, such as the Massagetae, Dahae and Saka. While the offensive weapons of these prototype cataphracts were identical to those of the Assyrians, they differed in that not only the rider but also the head and flanks of the horse were protected by armor. Whether this development was influenced by the Assyrians, as Rubin postulates, or perhaps the Achaemenid Empire, or whether they occurred spontaneously and entirely unrelated to the advances in heavily armored cavalry made in the Ancient Near East, cannot be discerned by the archaeological records left by these mounted nomads.

The further evolution of these early forms of heavy cavalry in Western Eurasia is not entirely clear. Heavily armored riders on large horses appear in 4th century BC frescoes in the northern Black Sea region, notably at a time when the Scythians, who relied on light horse archers, were superseded by the Sarmatians. By the 3rd century BC, light cavalry units were used in most eastern armies, but still only &quot;relatively few states in the East or West attempted to imitate the Assyrian and Chorasmian experiments with mailed cavalry&quot;.

==Hellenistic and Roman adoption==

The Greeks first encountered cataphracts during the Greco-Persian Wars of the 5th century BC with the Achaemenid Empire. The Ionian Revolt, an uprising against Persian rule in Asia Minor which preluded the First Persian invasion of Greece, is very likely the first Western encounter of cataphract cavalry, and to a degree heavy cavalry in general. The cataphract was widely adopted by the Seleucid Empire, the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great&#x27;s kingdom who reigned over conquered Persia and Asia Minor after his death in 323 BC. The Parthians, who wrested control over their native Persia from the last Seleucid Kingdom in the East in 147 BC, were also noted for their reliance upon cataphracts as well as horse archers in battle.

Besides the Seleucids it is possible that also the Kingdom of Pergamon adopted some cataphracts. Pergamese reliefs show cavalry similarly armed and equipped as Seleucid cataphracts, indicating an adoption. Yet these were probably equipped from trophies taken from the Seleucids, which would suggest limited numbers.

The Romans came to know cataphracts during their frequent wars in the Hellenistic East. Cataphracts had varying levels of success against Roman military tactics more so at the Battle of Carrhae and less so at the battle of Lucullus with Tigranes the Great near Tigranocerta in 69 BC. In 38 BC, the Roman general Publius Ventidius Bassus, by making extensive use of slingers, whose long-range weapons proved very effective, defeated the uphill-storming Parthian armored cavalry.

At the time of Augustus, the Greek geographer Strabo considered cataphracts with horse armor to be typical of Armenian, Caucasian Albanian, and Persian armies, but, according to Plutarch, they were still held in rather low esteem in the Hellenistic world due to their poor tactical abilities against disciplined infantry as well as against more mobile, light cavalry. However, the lingering period of exposure to cataphracts at the eastern frontier as well as the growing military pressure of the Sarmatian lancers on the Danube frontier led to a gradual integration of cataphracts into the Roman army. Thus, although cavalrymen with armor were deployed in the Roman army as early as the 2nd century BC (Polybios, VI, 25, 3), the first recorded deployment and use of cataphracts (&quot;equites cataphractarii&quot;) by the Roman Empire comes in the 2nd century AD, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD), who created the first, regular unit of auxiliary, mailed cavalry called the &quot;ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum catafractata&quot;. A key architect in the process was evidently the Roman emperor Gallienus, who created a highly mobile force in response to the multiple threats along the northern and eastern frontier. However, as late as 272 AD, Aurelian&#x27;s army, completely composed of light cavalry, defeated Zenobia at the Battle of Immae, proving the continuing importance of mobility on the battlefield.

The Romans fought a prolonged and indecisive campaign in the East against the Parthians beginning in 53 BC, commencing with the defeat of Marcus Licinius Crassus (close benefactor of Julius Caesar) and his 35,000 legionaries at Carrhae. This initially unexpected and humiliating defeat for Rome was followed by numerous campaigns over the next two centuries entailing many notable engagements such as: the Battle of Cilician Gates, Mount Gindarus, Mark Antony&#x27;s Parthian Campaign and finally culminating in the bloody Battle of Nisibis in 217 AD, which resulted in a slight Parthian victory, and Emperor Macrinus being forced to concede peace with Parthia. As a result of this lingering period of exposure to cataphracts, by the 4th century, the Roman Empire had adopted a number of vexillations of mercenary cataphract cavalry (see the Notitia Dignitatum), such as the Sarmatian Auxiliaries. The Romans deployed both native and mercenary units of cataphracts throughout the Empire, from Asia Minor all the way to Britain, where a contingent of 5,500 Sarmatians (including cataphracts, infantry, and non-combatants) were posted in the 2nd century by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (see End of Roman rule in Britain).

This tradition was later paralleled by the rise of feudalism in Christian Europe in the Early Middle Ages and the establishment of the knighthood particularly during the Crusades, while the Eastern Romans continued to maintain a very active corps of cataphracts long after their Western counterparts fell in 476 AD.

==Appearance and equipment==

Cataphracts were almost universally clad in some form of scale armor ( &quot;Folidotos&quot;, equivalent to the Roman Lorica squamata) that was flexible enough to give the rider and horse a good degree of motion, but strong enough to resist the immense impact of a thunderous charge into infantry formations. Scale armor was made from overlapping, rounded plates of bronze or iron (most being around one to two millimeters thick), which had two or four holes drilled into the sides, to be threaded with a bronze wire that was then sewn onto an undergarment of leather or animal hide, worn by the horse. A full set of cataphract armor consisted of approximately 1,300 or so &quot;scales&quot; and could weigh an astonishing 40 kilograms or 88 pounds (not inclusive of the rider&#x27;s body weight). Less commonly, plated mail or lamellar armor (which is similar in appearance but divergent in design, as it has no backing) was substituted for scale armor, while for the most part the rider wore chain mail. Specifically, the horse armor was usually sectional (not joined together as a cohesive &quot;suit&quot;), with large plates of scales tied together around the animal&#x27;s waist, flank, shoulders, neck and head (especially along the breastplate of the saddle) independently to give a further degree of movement for the horse and to allow the armor to be affixed to the horse reasonably tightly so that it should not loosen too much during movement. Usually but not always, a close-fitting helmet that covered the head and neck was worn by the rider; the Persian variants extended this even further and encased the wearer&#x27;s entire head in metal, leaving only minute slits for the nose and eyes as openings. Ammianus Marcellinus, a noted Roman historian and general who served in the army of Constantius II in Gaul and Persia and fought against the Sassanid army under Julian the Apostate, described the sight of a contingent of massed Persian cataphracts in the 4th century:

...all the companies were clad in iron, and all parts of their bodies were covered with thick plates, so fitted that the stiff-joints conformed with those of their limbs; and the forms of human faces were so skillfully fitted to their heads, that since their entire body was covered with metal, arrows that fell upon them could lodge only where they could see a little through tiny openings opposite the pupil of the eye, or where through the tip of their nose they were able to get a little breath. Of these some, who were armed with pikes, stood so motionless that you would think them held fast by clamps of bronze.

The primary weapon of practically all cataphract forces throughout history was the lance. Cataphract lances (known in Greek as a &quot;Kontos&quot; (&quot;oar&quot;) or in Latin as a &quot;Contus&quot;) appeared much like the Hellenistic armies&#x27; &quot;sarissae&quot; used by the famed Greek phalanxes as an anti-cavalry weapon. They were roughly four meters in length, with a capped point made of iron, bronze, or even animal bone and usually wielded with both hands. Most had a chain attached to the horse&#x27;s neck and at the end by a fastening attached to the horse&#x27;s hind leg, which supported the use of the lance by transferring the full momentum of a horse&#x27;s gallop to the thrust of the charge. Though they lacked stirrups, the traditional Roman saddle had four horns with which to secure the rider; enabling a soldier to stay seated upon the full impact. During the Sassanid era, the Persian military developed ever more secure saddles to &quot;fasten&quot; the rider to the horse&#x27;s body, much like the later knightly saddles of Medieval Europe. These saddles had a cantle at the back of the saddle and two guard clamps that curved across the top of the rider&#x27;s thighs and fastened to the saddle, thereby enabling the rider to stay properly seated, especially during violent contact in battle.

The penetrating power of the cataphract&#x27;s lance was recognized as being fearful by Roman writers, described as being capable of transfixing two men at once, as well as inflicting deep and mortal wounds even on opposing cavalries&#x27; mounts, and were definitely more potent than the regular one-handed spear used by most other cavalries of the period. Accounts of later period Middle Eastern cavalrymen wielding them told of occasions when it was capable of bursting through two layers of chain mail. There are also reliefs in Iran at Firuzabad showing Persian kings doing battle in a fashion not dissimilar to later depictions of jousts and mounted combat from the Medieval era.

Cataphracts would often be equipped with an additional side-arm such as a sword or mace, for use in the melee that often followed a charge. Some wore armor that was primarily frontal: providing protection for a charge and against missiles yet offering relief from the weight and encumbrance of a full suit. In yet another variation, cataphracts in some field armies were not equipped with shields at all, particularly if they had heavy body armor, as having both hands occupied with a shield and lance left no room to effectively steer the horse. Eastern and Persian cataphracts, particularly those of the Sassanid Empire, carried bows as well as blunt-force weapons, to soften up enemy formations before an eventual attack, reflecting upon the longstanding Persian tradition of horse archery and its use in battle by successive Persian Empires.

==Tactics and deployment==

While they varied in design and appearance, cataphracts were universally the heavy assault force of most nations that deployed them, acting as &quot;shock troops&quot; to deliver the bulk of an offensive manoeuvre, while being supported by various forms of infantry and archers (both mounted and unmounted). While their roles in military history often seem to overlap with lancers or generic heavy cavalry, they should not be considered analogous to these forms of cavalry, and instead represent the separate evolution of a very distinct class of heavy cavalry in the Near East that had certain connotations of prestige, nobility, and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; attached to them. In many armies, this reflected upon social stratification or a caste system, as only the wealthiest men of noble birth could afford the panoply of the cataphract, not to mention the costs of supporting several war horses and ample amounts of weaponry and armor.

Fire support was deemed particularly important for the proper deployment of cataphracts. The Parthian army that defeated the Romans at Carrhae in 53 BC operated primarily as a combined arms team of cataphracts and horse archers against the Roman heavy infantry. The Parthian horse archers encircled the Roman formation and bombarded it with arrows from all sides, forcing the legionaries to form the Testudo or &quot;tortoise&quot; formation to shield themselves from the huge numbers of incoming arrows. This made them fatally susceptible to a massed cataphract charge, since the testudo made the legionaries immobile and incapable of attacking or defending themselves in close combat against the long reach of the Parthian cataphracts&#x27; &quot;Kontos&quot;, a type of lance. The end result was a far smaller force of Parthian cataphracts and horse archers wiping out a Roman army four times their number, due to a combination of fire and movement, which pinned the enemy down, wore them out and left them vulnerable to a deathblow.

The cataphract charge was very effective due to the disciplined riders and the large numbers of horses deployed. As early as the 1st century BC, especially during the expansionist campaigns of the Parthian and Sassanid dynasties, Eastern Iranian cataphracts employed by the Scythians, Sarmatians, Parthians, and Sassanids presented a grievous problem for the traditionally less mobile, infantry-dependent Roman Empire. Roman writers throughout imperial history made much of the terror of facing cataphracts, let alone receiving their charge. Parthian armies repeatedly clashed with the Roman legions in a series of wars, featuring the heavy usage of cataphracts. Although initially successful, the Romans soon developed ways to crush the charges of heavy horsemen, through use of terrain and maintained discipline.

Persian cataphracts were a contiguous division known as the &quot;Savaran&quot; (Persian: &quot;سواران&quot;, literally meaning &quot;riders&quot;) during the era of the Sassanid army and remained a formidable force from the 3rd to 7th centuries until the collapse of the Sassanid Empire. Initially the Sassanid dynasty continued the cavalry traditions of the Parthians, fielding units of super-heavy cavalry. This gradually fell out of favour, and a &quot;universal&quot; cavalryman was developed during the later 3rd century, able to fight as a mounted archer as well as a cataphract. This was perhaps in response to the harassing, nomadic combat style used by the Sassanids&#x27; northern neighbours who frequently raided their borders, such as the Huns, Hephthalites, Xiongnu, Scythians, and Kushans, all of which favoured hit and run tactics and relied almost solely upon horse archers for combat. However, as the Roman-Persian wars intensified to the West, sweeping military reforms were again re-established. During the 4th century, Shapur II of Persia attempted to reinstate the super-heavy cataphracts of previous Persian dynasties to counter the formation of the new, Roman Comitatenses, the dedicated, front-line legionaries who were the heavy infantry of the late Roman Empire. The elite of the Persian cataphracts, known as the Pushtigban Body Guards, were sourced from the very best of the &quot;Savaran&quot; divisions and were akin in their deployment and military role to their Roman counterparts, the Praetorian Guard, used exclusively by Roman emperors. Ammianus Marcellinus remarked in his memoirs that members of the Pushtigban were able to impale two Roman soldiers on their spears at once with a single furious charge. Persian cataphract archery also seems to have been again revived in late antiquity, perhaps as a response (or even a stimulus) to an emerging trend of the late Roman army towards mobility and versatility in their means of warfare.

In an ironic twist, the elite of the East Roman army by the 6th century had become the cataphract, modelled after the very force that had fought them in the east for more than 500 years earlier. During the Iberian and Lazic wars initiated in the Caucasus by Justinian I, it was noted by Procopius that Persian cataphract archers were adept at firing their arrows in very quick succession and saturating enemy positions but with little hitting power, resulting in mostly non-incapacitating limb wounds for the enemy. The Roman cataphracts, on the other hand, released their shots with far more power, able to launch arrows with lethal kinetic energy behind them, albeit at a slower pace.

==Later history and usage in the early Middle Ages==

Some cataphracts fielded by the later Roman Empire were also equipped with heavy, lead-weight darts called &quot;Martiobarbuli&quot;, akin to the plumbata used by late Roman infantry. These were to be hurled at the enemy lines during or just before a charge, to disorder the defensive formation immediately before the impact of the lances. With or without darts, a cataphract charge would usually be supported by some kind of missile troops (mounted or unmounted) placed on either flank of the enemy formation. Some armies formalised this tactic by deploying separate types of cataphract, the conventional, very heavily armored, bowless lancer for the primary charge and a dual purpose, lance-and-bow cataphract for supporting units.

References to Eastern Roman cataphracts seemed to have disappeared in the late 6th century, as the manual of war known as &quot;Strategikon of Maurice&quot;, published during the same period, made no mention of cataphracts or their tactical employment. This absence persisted through most of the Thematic period, until the cataphracts reappeared in Emperor Leo VI&#x27;s &quot;Sylloge Taktikon&quot;, probably reflecting a revival that paralleled the transformation of the Eastern Roman army from a largely defensive force into a largely offensive force. The cataphracts deployed by the Eastern Roman Empire (most noticeably after the 7th century, when Late Latin ceased to be the official language of the empire) were exclusively referred to as &quot;Kataphraktoi&quot;, due to the Empire&#x27;s strong Greek influence, as opposed to the Romanized term &quot;Cataphractarii&quot;, which subsequently fell out of use.

These later Roman cataphracts were a much feared force in their heyday. The army of Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas reconstituted Kataphraktoi during the tenth century and included a complex and highly developed composition of an offensive, blunt-nosed wedge formation. Made up of roughly five hundred cavalrymen, this unit was clearly designed with a single decisive charge in mind as the centre of the unit was composed of mounted archers. These would release volleys of arrows into the enemy as the unit advanced at a trot, with the first four rows of mace-armed Kataphraktoi then penetrating the enemy formation through the resulting disruption (contrary to popular representations, Byzantine Kataphraktoi did not charge, they advanced at a steady medium-pace trot and were designed to roll over an enemy already softened by the archers).

This formation is the only method prescribed for Kataphraktoi in the Praecepta Militaria of Emperor Nikephoros which was designed as a decisive hammer-blow which would break the enemy. Due to the rigidity of the formation, it was not possible for it to re-form and execute a second charge in instances where the first blow did not smash the enemy (no feigned flight or repeated charges were possible due to the formation employed). It is for this reason that Byzantine military manuals (Praecepta Militaria and the Taktika) advise where possible, for the use of a second wedge of Kataphraktoi which could be hurled at the enemy in the event that they resisted the initial charge.

Contemporary depictions, however, imply that Byzantine cataphracts were not as completely armored as the earlier Roman and Sassanid incarnation. The horse armor was noticeably lighter than earlier examples, being made of leather scales or quilted cloth rather than metal at all. Byzantine cataphracts of the 10th century were drawn from the ranks of the middle-class landowners through the &quot;theme&quot; system, providing the Byzantine Empire with a motivated and professional force that could support its own wartime expenditures. The previously mentioned term &quot;Clibanarii&quot; (possibly representing a distinct class of cavalry from the cataphract) was brought to the fore in the 10th and 11th centuries of the Byzantine Empire, known in Byzantine Greek as &quot;Klibanophoros&quot;, which appeared to be a throwback to the super-heavy cavalry of earlier antiquity. These cataphracts specialised in forming a wedge formation and penetrating enemy formations to create gaps, enabling lighter troops to make a breakthrough. Alternatively, they were used to target the head of the enemy force, typically a foreign emperor.

As with the original cataphracts, the Leonian/Nikephorian units seemed to have fallen out of favour and use with their handlers, making their last, recorded appearance in battle in 970 and the last record of their existence in 1001, referred to as being posted to garrison duty. If they had indeed disappeared, then it is possible that they were revived once again during the Komnenian restoration, a period of thorough financial, territorial and military reform that changed the Byzantine army of previous ages, which is referred to separately as the Komnenian army after the 12th century. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118) established a new military force from the ground up, which was directly responsible for transforming the aging Byzantine Empire from one of the weakest periods in its existence into a major economic and military power, akin to its existence during the golden age of Justinian I. However, even in this case, it seems that the cataphract was eventually superseded by other types of heavy cavalry.

It is difficult to determine when exactly the cataphract saw his final day. After all, cataphracts and knights fulfilled a roughly similar role on the medieval battlefield, and the armored knight survived well into the early modern era of Europe. The Byzantine army maintained units of heavily armored cavalrymen up until its final years, mostly in the form of Western European &quot;Latinikon&quot; mercenaries, while neighbouring Bulgars, Serbs, Avars, Alans, Lithuanians, Khazars, and other Eurasian peoples emulated Byzantine military equipment. During medieval times, the Draco banner and Tamga of Sarmatian cataphracts belonging to the tribe of Royal Sarmatians, was used by the Clan of Ostoja and become Ostoja coat of arms.

As Western European metalwork became increasingly sophisticated, the traditional image of the cataphract&#x27;s awe-inspiring might and presence quickly evaporated. From the 15th century and onwards, chain mail, lamellar armor, and scale armor seemed to fall out of favour with Eastern noble cavalrymen as elaborate and robust plate cuirasses arrived from the West; this, in combination with the advent of early firearms, cannon, and gunpowder, rendered the relatively thin and flexible armor of cataphracts obsolete. Despite these advances, the Byzantine army, often unable to afford newer equipment &quot;en masse&quot;, was left ill-equipped and forced to rely on its increasingly archaic military technology. The cataphract finally passed into the pages of history with the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, when the last nation to refer to its cavalrymen as cataphracts fell (see Decline of the Byzantine Empire).

===Cataphracts in East Asia===

Horses covered with scale armor are alluded to in the ancient Chinese book of poetry, the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; dating between the 7th to 10th centuries BC—however, this armor did not cover the entire horse and was likely made of hide, not metal as traditionally believed (e.g. by Zhu Xi, Séraphin Couvreur, James Legge, etc.). According to surviving records, the Western Han Dynasty had 5,330 sets of horse armor at the Donghai Armory. Comprehensive full-body armor for horses made of organic materials such as rawhide may have existed as early as the Qin Dynasty according to archaeological discoveries of stone lamellar armor for horses. Comprehensive armor for horses made of metal might have been used in China as early as the Three Kingdoms period, but the usage wasn&#x27;t widely adapted as most cavalry formation requires maneuverability. It was not until the early 4th century, however, that cataphracts came into widespread use among with the Xianbei tribes of Inner Mongolia and Liaoning, which led to the readoption of cataphracts en masse by Chinese armies during the Jin dynasty (266–420) and Northern and Southern Dynasties era. Numerous burial seals, military figurines, murals, and official reliefs from this period testify to the great importance of armored cavalry in warfare. The later Sui Empire continued the use of cataphracts. During the Tang Empire it was illegal for private citizens to possess horse armor. Production of horse armor was controlled by the government. However, the use of cataphracts was mentioned in many records and literature. Cataphracts were also used in warfare from the Anlushan Rebellion to the fall of the Tang Dynasty. During the Five Dynasties and 10 Kingdoms era, cataphracts were important units in this civil war. In the same period, cataphracts were also popular among nomadic empires, such as the Liao, Western Xia, and Jin dynasties—the heavy cataphracts of the Xia and Jin were especially effective and were known as &quot;Iron Sparrowhawks&quot; and &quot;Iron Pagodas&quot; respectively. The Song Empire also developed cataphract units to counter those of the Liao, Xia, and Jin, but the shortage of suitable grazing lands and horse pastures in Song territory made the effective breeding and maintenance of Song cavalry far more difficult. This added to the Song&#x27;s vulnerability to continual raids by the emerging Mongol Empire for over two decades, which eventually vanquished them in 1279 at the hands of Kublai Khan. The Yuan dynasty, successors to the Song, were a continuation of the Mongol Empire, and seem to have all but forgotten the cataphract traditions of their predecessors. The last remaining traces of cataphracts in East Asia seems to have faded with the downfall of the Yuan in 1368 and later heavy cavalry never reached the levels of armor and protection for the horses as these earlier cataphracts.

Other East Asian cultures were also known to have used cataphracts during a similar time period to the Chinese. Meanwhile, the Tibetan Empire used cataphracts as the elite assault force of its armies for much of its history. The Gokturk Khaganates might also have had cataphracts, as the Orkhon inscriptions mentioned Latter Göktürk general Kul-Tegin exchanged armored horses in battle.

<doc id="231130" wikidata="Q249697" url="?curid=231130" title="Eulogy">
<text>A eulogy (from , &quot;eulogia&quot;, Classical Greek, &quot;eu&quot; for &quot;well&quot; or &quot;true&quot;, &quot;logia&quot; for &quot;words&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, together for &quot;praise&quot;) is a speech or writing in praise of a person, especially one who recently died or retired, or as a term of endearment.

Eulogies may be given as part of funeral services. In the United States, they take place in a funeral home during or after a wake; in the United Kingdom, they are said during the service, typically at a crematorium or place of worship, before the wake. In the United States, some denominations either discourage or do not permit eulogies at services to maintain respect for traditions. Eulogies can also praise people who are still alive. This normally takes place on special occasions like birthdays, office parties, retirement celebrations, etc. Eulogies should not be confused with elegies, which are poems written in tribute to the dead; nor with obituaries, which are published biographies recounting the lives of those who have recently died; nor with obsequies, which refer generally to the rituals surrounding funerals. Roman Catholic priests are prohibited by the rubrics of the Mass from presenting a eulogy for the deceased in place of a homily during a funeral Mass.

The modern use of the word &quot;eulogy&quot; was first documented in the 16th century and came from the Medieval Latin term &quot;eulogium&quot;. &quot;Eulogium&quot; at that time has since turned into the shorter &quot;eulogy&quot; of today.

Eulogies are usually delivered by a family member or a close family friend in the case of a dead person. For a living eulogy given in such cases as a retirement, a senior colleague could perhaps deliver it. On occasions, eulogies are given to those who are severely ill or elderly in order to express words of love and gratitude before they die. Eulogies are not limited to merely people, however; places or things can also be given eulogies (which anyone can deliver), but these are less common than those delivered to people, whether living or deceased.

In some cases, a self-eulogy is written before the subject dies, with the aim of having a friend or family member read out their words to the funeral mass. Notable examples include the uplifting self-eulogy of American writer Kurt Vonnegut (borrowed from his uncle&#x27;s own funeral) and a humorous self-eulogy by Australian rules footballer and media personality Lou Richards, which was read by a friend.

==Notable examples==

A successful eulogy may provide comfort, inspiration, or establish a connection to the person of whom the eulogy is in behalf. The following examples are well-known eulogies that have done just that.

President Ronald Reagan’s eulogy for the &quot;Challenger&quot; space shuttle crew (1986):

Charles Spencer’s eulogy for his sister, Diana, Princess of Wales (1997):

Jawaharlal Nehru’s eulogy for Mahatma Gandhi (1948):

Ted Kennedy&#x27;s eulogy for his brother Robert F. Kennedy (1968):

==Content==

There are many different types of eulogies. Some of them are strictly meant to be a biography of the person&#x27;s life. The short biography is simply a retelling of what the individual went through in their life. This can be done to highlight major points in the deceased&#x27;s life. Another version is by telling a more personal view on what the individual did. It entails retelling memories that are shared between the storyteller and the deceased. Memories, impressions, and experiences are all things that can be included in a retelling of the personal eulogy (Burch, 2006). In most parts of the world, eulogies mostly focus on the biography of the person&#x27;s life by highlighting the major events of their lives, such as work or career, education, etc.

<doc id="231131" wikidata="Q170251" url="?curid=231131" title="Short-toed snake eagle">
<text>The short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus), also known as the short-toed eagle, is a medium-sized bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers. The genus name &quot;Circaetus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kirkos&quot;, a type of hawk, and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;. The specific &quot;gallicus&quot; means &quot;of Gallia&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The short-toed snake eagle was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the falcons, eagles and their relatives in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco gallicus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Jean le Blanc&quot; that had been described by the English ornithologist John Latham and the French ornithologists Mathurin Jacques Brisson and the Comte de Buffon. The short-toed snake eagle is now placed in the genus &quot;Circaetus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kirkos&quot;, a type of hawk, and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;gallicus&quot; is Latin for &quot;Gaul&quot; ie France.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. g. gallicus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – southwest Europe to central Asia, northwest China and India
* &quot;C. g. sacerdotis&quot; Ng, NSR, Christidis, Olsen, Norman &amp; Rheindt, 2017 – east Java, Bali, and Lombok to Timor (Lesser Sunda Islands)

==Description==
These are relatively large snake eagles. Adults are long with a wingspan and weigh , an average weight for the species is about . They can be recognised in the field by their predominantly white underside, the upper parts being greyish brown. The chin, throat and upper breast are a pale, earthy brown. The tail has 3 or 4 bars. Additional indications are an owl-like rounded head, brightly yellow eyes and lightly barred under wing.

The short-toed snake eagle spends more time on the wing than do most members of its genus. It favours soaring over hill slopes and hilltops on updraughts, and it does much of its hunting from this position at heights of up to . When quartering open country it frequently hovers like a kestrel. When it soars it does so on flattish wings.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is an Old World species found throughout the Mediterranean basin, into Russia and the Middle East, and parts of Western Asia, and in the Indian Subcontinent and also further east in some Indonesian islands.

Those present on the northern edge of the Mediterranean and other parts of Europe migrate mainly to sub-Saharan Africa north of the equator, leaving in September/October and returning in April/May. In the Middle and Far East the populations are resident. In Europe, it is most numerous in Spain where it is fairly common but elsewhere it is rare in many parts of its range. A bird on the Isles of Scilly, Britain, in October 1999 was the first confirmed record for that country.

The short-toed snake eagle is found in open cultivated plains, arid stony deciduous scrub areas and foothills and semi-desert areas. It requires trees for nesting and open habitats, such as cultivations and grasslands for foraging.

==Behaviour==
Its prey is mostly reptiles, mainly snakes, but also some lizards. Sometimes they become entangled with larger snakes and battle on the ground. Occasionally, they prey on small mammals up to the size of a rabbit, and rarely birds and large insects.

This eagle is generally very silent. On occasions, it emits a variety of musical whistling notes. When breeding, it lays only one egg. It can live up to 17 years.

The short-toed snake eagle has suffered a steep decline in numbers and range in Europe and is now rare and still decreasing in several countries due to changes in agriculture and land use. It needs protection. In the middle and far eastern part of its range, this species is not yet threatened.

==Historical material==
In his description of the species, Buffon says that he kept one of these eagles in captivity and observed its behavior. The captive bird ate mice and frogs, and he states that the &quot;Jean-de-blanc&quot; was well known by French farmers for raiding poultry.

<doc id="231137" wikidata="Q606654" url="?curid=231137" title="Earthquake prediction">
<text>Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits, and particularly &quot;the determination of parameters for the &quot;next&quot; strong earthquake to occur in a region&quot;. Earthquake prediction is sometimes distinguished from &quot;earthquake forecasting&quot;, which can be defined as the probabilistic assessment of &quot;general&quot; earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.

Prediction can be further distinguished from earthquake warning systems, which, upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning of seconds to neighboring regions that might be affected.

In the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible. Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred, and the few claims of success are controversial. For example, the most famous claim of a successful prediction is that alleged for the 1975 Haicheng earthquake. A later study said that there was no valid short-term prediction. Extensive searches have reported many possible earthquake precursors, but, so far, such precursors have not been reliably identified across significant spatial and temporal scales. While part of the scientific community hold that, taking into account non-seismic precursors and given enough resources to study them extensively, prediction might be possible, most scientists are pessimistic and some maintain that earthquake prediction is inherently impossible.

== Evaluating earthquake predictions ==
Predictions are deemed significant if they can be shown to be successful beyond random chance. Therefore, methods of statistical hypothesis testing are used to determine the probability that an earthquake such as is predicted would happen anyway (the null hypothesis). The predictions are then evaluated by testing whether they correlate with actual earthquakes better than the null hypothesis.

In many instances, however, the statistical nature of earthquake occurrence is not simply homogeneous. Clustering occurs in both space and time. In southern California about 6% of M≥3.0 earthquakes are &quot;followed by an earthquake of larger magnitude within 5 days and 10 km.&quot; In central Italy 9.5% of M≥3.0 earthquakes are followed by a larger event within 48 hours and 30 km. While such statistics are not satisfactory for purposes of prediction (giving ten to twenty false alarms for each successful prediction) they will skew the results of any analysis that assumes that earthquakes occur randomly in time, for example, as realized from a Poisson process. It has been shown that a &quot;naive&quot; method based solely on clustering can successfully predict about 5% of earthquakes; &quot;far better than &#x27;chance&#x27;&quot;.
As the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction, failure to give warning of a major earthquake, that does occur, or at least an adequate evaluation of the hazard, can result in legal liability, or even political purging. For example, it has been reported that members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were purged for &quot;having ignored scientific predictions of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake of summer 1976.&quot; Following the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila Earthquake, seven scientists and technicians in Italy were convicted of manslaughter, but not so much for failing to &quot;predict&quot; the earthquake, where some 300 people died, as for &quot;giving undue assurance&quot; to the populace – one victim called it &quot;anaesthetizing&quot; – that there would &quot;not&quot; be a serious earthquake, and therefore no need to take precautions. But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost: not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption. False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings. In 1999 it was reported that China was introducing &quot;tough regulations intended to stamp out &#x27;false&#x27; earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors.&quot; This was prompted by &quot;more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate.&quot; The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes. The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.

In a 1997 study of the cost-benefit ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because &quot;organized evacuation of urban centers is unlikely to be successfully accomplished&quot;, while &quot;panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated.&quot; He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece&#x27;s entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.

== Prediction methods ==
Earthquake prediction is an immature scienceit has not yet led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive &quot;precursors&quot; to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical &quot;trend&quot; or pattern in seismicity that might precede a large earthquake. Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while &#x27;trend&#x27; methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).

=== Precursors ===
An earthquake precursor is an anomalous phenomenon that might give effective warning of an impending earthquake. Reports of these – though generally recognized as such only after the event – number in the thousands, some dating back to antiquity. There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types, running the gamut from aeronomy to zoology. None have been found to be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.

In the early 1990, the IASPEI solicited nominations for a Preliminary List of Significant Precursors. Forty nominations were made, of which five were selected as possible significant precursors, with two of those based on a single observation each.

After a critical review of the scientific literature, the &quot;International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection&quot; (ICEF) concluded in 2011 there was &quot;considerable room for methodological improvements in this type of research.&quot; In particular, many cases of reported precursors are contradictory, lack a measure of amplitude, or are generally unsuitable for a rigorous statistical evaluation. Published results are biased towards positive results, and so the rate of false negatives (earthquake but no precursory signal) is unclear.

==== Animal behavior ====
After an earthquake has already begun, pressure waves (P waves) travel twice as fast as the more damaging shear waves (s waves). Typically not noticed by humans, some animals may notice the smaller vibrations that arrive a few to a few dozen seconds before the main shaking, and become alarmed or exhibit other unusual behavior. Seismometers can also detect P waves, and the timing difference is exploited by electronic earthquake warning systems to provide humans with a few seconds to move to a safer location.

A review of scientific studies available as of 2018 covering over 130 species found insufficient evidence to show that animals could provide warning of earthquakes hours, days, or weeks in advance. Statistical correlations suggest some reported unusual animal behavior is due to smaller earthquakes (foreshocks) that sometimes precede a large quake, which if small enough may go unnoticed by people. Foreshocks may also cause groundwater changes or release gases that can be detected by animals. Foreshocks are also detected by seismometers, and have long been studied as potential predictors, but without success (see #Seismicity patterns). Seismologists have not found evidence of medium-term physical or chemical changes that predict earthquakes which animals might be sensing.

Anecdotal reports of strange animal behavior before earthquakes have been recorded for thousands of years. Some unusual animal behavior may be mistakenly attributed to a near-future earthquake. The flashbulb memory effect causes unremarkable details to become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake. Even the vast majority of scientific reports in the 2018 review did not include observations showing that animals did &quot;not&quot; act unusually when there was &quot;not&quot; an earthquake about to happen, meaning the behavior was not established to be predictive.

Most researchers investigating animal prediction of earthquakes are in China and Japan. Most scientific observations have come from the 2010 Canterbury earthquake in New Zealand, the 1984 Nagano earthquake in Japan, and the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila earthquake in Italy.

Animals known to be magnetoreceptive might be able to detect electromagnetic waves in the ultra low frequency and extremely low frequency ranges that reach the surface of the Earth before an earthquake, causing odd behavior. These electromagnetic waves could also cause air ionization, water oxidation and possible water toxification which other animals could detect.

==== Dilatancy–diffusion ====
In the 1970s the dilatancy–diffusion hypothesis was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors. It was based on &quot;solid and repeatable evidence&quot; from laboratory experiments that highly stressed crystalline rock experienced a change in volume, or &quot;dilatancy&quot;, which causes changes in other characteristics, such as seismic velocity and electrical resistivity, and even large-scale uplifts of topography. It was believed this happened in a &#x27;preparatory phase&#x27; just prior to the earthquake, and that suitable monitoring could therefore warn of an impending quake.

Detection of variations in the relative velocities of the primary and secondary seismic waves – expressed as Vp/Vs – as they passed through a certain zone was the basis for predicting the 1973 Blue Mountain Lake (NY) and 1974 Riverside (CA) quake. Although these predictions were informal and even trivial, their apparent success was seen as confirmation of both dilatancy and the existence of a preparatory process, leading to what were subsequently called &quot;wildly over-optimistic statements&quot; that successful earthquake prediction &quot;appears to be on the verge of practical reality.&quot;

However, many studies questioned these results, and the hypothesis eventually languished. Subsequent study showed it &quot;failed for several reasons, largely associated with the validity of the assumptions on which it was based&quot;, including the assumption that laboratory results can be scaled up to the real world. Another factor was the bias of retrospective selection of criteria. Other studies have shown dilatancy to be so negligible that concluded: &quot;The concept of a large-scale &#x27;preparation zone&#x27; indicating the likely magnitude of a future event, remains as ethereal as the ether that went undetected in the Michelson–Morley experiment.&quot;

==== Changes in Vp/Vs ====
&quot;V&quot;p is the symbol for the velocity of a seismic &quot;P&quot; (primary or pressure) wave passing through rock, while &quot;V&quot;s is the symbol for the velocity of the &quot;S&quot; (secondary or shear) wave. Small-scale laboratory experiments have shown that the ratio of these two velocities – represented as &quot;V&quot;p/&quot;V&quot;s – changes when rock is near the point of fracturing. In the 1970s it was considered a likely breakthrough when Russian seismologists reported observing such changes (later discounted.) in the region of a subsequent earthquake. This effect, as well as other possible precursors, has been attributed to dilatancy, where rock stressed to near its breaking point expands (dilates) slightly.

Study of this phenomenon near Blue Mountain Lake in New York State led to a successful albeit informal prediction in 1973, and it was credited for predicting the 1974 Riverside (CA) quake. However, additional successes have not followed, and it has been suggested that these predictions were a fluke. A &quot;V&quot;p/&quot;V&quot;s anomaly was the basis of a 1976 prediction of a M 5.5 to 6.5 earthquake near Los Angeles, which failed to occur. Other studies relying on quarry blasts (more precise, and repeatable) found no such variations, while an analysis of two earthquakes in California found that the variations reported were more likely caused by other factors, including retrospective selection of data. noted that reports of significant velocity changes have ceased since about 1980.

==== Radon emissions ====
Most rock contains small amounts of gases that can be isotopically distinguished from the normal atmospheric gases. There are reports of spikes in the concentrations of such gases prior to a major earthquake; this has been attributed to release due to pre-seismic stress or fracturing of the rock. One of these gases is radon, produced by radioactive decay of the trace amounts of uranium present in most rock. Radon is potentially useful as an earthquake predictor because it is radioactive and thus easily detected, and its short half-life (3.8 days) makes radon levels sensitive to short-term fluctuations.

A 2009 compilation listed 125 reports of changes in radon emissions prior to 86 earthquakes since 1966. The International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) however found in its 2011 critical review that the earthquakes with which these changes are supposedly linked were up to a thousand kilometers away, months later, and at all magnitudes. In some cases the anomalies were observed at a distant site, but not at closer sites. The ICEF found &quot;no significant correlation&quot;.

==== Electromagnetic anomalies ====

Observations of electromagnetic disturbances and their attribution to the earthquake failure process go back as far as the Great Lisbon earthquake of 1755, but practically all such observations prior to the mid-1960s are invalid because the instruments used were sensitive to physical movement. Since then various anomalous electrical, electric-resistive, and magnetic phenomena have been attributed to precursory stress and strain changes that precede earthquakes, raising hopes for finding a reliable earthquake precursor. While a handful of researchers have gained much attention with either theories of how such phenomena might be generated, claims of having observed such phenomena prior to an earthquake, no such phenomena has been shown to be an actual precursor.

A 2011 review by the &quot;International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection&quot; (ICEF) found the &quot;most convincing&quot; electromagnetic precursors to be ultra low frequency magnetic anomalies, such as the Corralitos event (discussed below) recorded before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. However, it is now believed that observation was a system malfunction. Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precursory electromagnetic signals of any type; further study showed that earthquakes with magnitudes less than 5 do not produce significant transient signals. The ICEF considered the search for useful precursors to have been unsuccessful.

===== VAN seismic electric signals =====
The most touted, and most criticized, claim of an electromagnetic precursor is the VAN method of physics professors Panayiotis Varotsos, Kessar Alexopoulos and Konstantine Nomicos (VAN) of the University of Athens. In a 1981 paper they claimed that by measuring geoelectric voltages – what they called &quot;seismic electric signals&quot; (SES) – they could predict earthquakes.

In 1984, they claimed there was a &quot;one-to-one correspondence&quot; between SES and earthquakes – that is, that &quot;&quot;every sizable EQ is preceded by an SES&quot; and inversely &quot;every SES is always followed by an EQ&quot; the magnitude and the epicenter of which can be reliably predicted&quot; – the SES appearing between 6 and 115 hours before the earthquake. As proof of their method they claimed a series of successful predictions.

Although their report was &quot;saluted by some as a major breakthrough&quot;, among seismologists it was greeted by a &quot;wave of generalized skepticism&quot;. In 1996, a paper VAN submitted to the journal Geophysical Research Letters was given an unprecedented public peer-review by a broad group of reviewers, with the paper and reviews published in a special issue; the majority of reviewers found the methods of VAN to be flawed. Additional criticism was raised the same year in a public debate between some of the principals.

A primary criticism was that the method is geophysically implausible and scientifically unsound. Additional objections included the demonstrable falsity of the claimed one-to-one relationship of earthquakes and SES, the unlikelihood of a precursory process generating signals stronger than any observed from the actual earthquakes, and the very strong likelihood that the signals were man-made. Further work in Greece has tracked SES-like &quot;anomalous transient electric signals&quot; back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES. More recent work, by employing modern methods of statistical physics, i.e., detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), multifractal DFA and wavelet transform revealed that SES are clearly distinguished from signals produced by man made sources.

The validity of the VAN method, and therefore the predictive significance of SES, was based primarily on the empirical claim of demonstrated predictive success. Numerous weaknesses have been uncovered in the VAN methodology, and in 2011 the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded that the prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated. Most seismologists consider VAN to have been &quot;resoundingly debunked&quot;. On the other hand, the Section &quot;Earthquake Precursors and Prediction&quot; of &quot;Encyclopedia of Solid Earth Geophysics: part of &quot;Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series&quot; (Springer 2011) ends as follows (just before its summary): &quot;it has recently been shown that by analyzing time-series in a newly introduced time domain &quot;natural time&quot;, the approach to the critical state can be clearly identified [Sarlis et al. 2008]. This way, they appear to have succeeded in shortening the lead-time of VAN prediction to only a few days [Uyeda and Kamogawa 2008]. This means, seismic data may play an amazing role in short term precursor when combined with SES data&quot;.

Since 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call &quot;natural time&quot;, applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from noise and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as &quot;SES activity&quot;), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a critical phenomenon. A review of the updated VAN method in 2020 says that it suffers from an abundance of false positives and is therefore not usable as a prediction protocol. VAN group answered by pinpointing misunderstandings in the specific reasoning.

===== Corralitos anomaly =====
Probably the most celebrated seismo-electromagnetic event ever, and one of the most frequently cited examples of a possible earthquake precursor, is the 1989 Corralitos anomaly. In the month prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, measurements of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at ultra-low frequencies by a magnetometer in Corralitos, California, just 7 km from the epicenter of the impending earthquake, started showing anomalous increases in amplitude. Just three hours before the quake, the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54 km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.

Additional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed. More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.

===== Freund physics =====
In his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere. The study of such currents and interactions is known as &quot;Freund physics&quot;.

Most seismologists reject Freund&#x27;s suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the Earth&#x27;s crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.

====== Disturbance of the daily cycle of the ionosphere ======

The ionosphere usually develops its lower D layer during the day, while at night this layer disappears as the plasma there turns to gas. During the night, the F layer of the ionosphere remains formed, in higher altitude than D layer. A waveguide for low HF radio frequencies up to 10 MHz is formed during the night (skywave propagation) as the F layer reflects these waves back to the Earth. The skywave is lost during the day, as the D layer absorbs these waves.

Tectonic stresses in the Earth&#x27;s crust are claimed to cause waves of electric charges that travel to the surface of the Earth and affect the ionosphere. ULF* recordings of the daily cycle of the ionosphere indicate that the usual cycle could be disturbed a few days before a shallow strong earthquake. When the disturbance occurs, it is observed that either the D layer is lost during the day resulting to ionosphere elevation and skywave formation or the D layer appears at night resulting to lower of the ionosphere and hence absence of skywave.

Science centers have developed a network of VLF transmitters and receivers on a global scale that detect changes in skywave. Each receiver is also daisy transmitter for distances of 1000–10,000 kilometers and is operating at different frequencies within the network. The general area under excitation can be determined depending on the density of the network. It was shown on the other hand that global extreme events like magnetic storms or solar flares and local extreme events in the same VLF path like another earthquake or a volcano eruption that occur in near time with the earthquake under evaluation make it difficult or impossible to relate changes in skywave to the earthquake of interest.

In 2017, an article in the &quot;Journal of Geophysical Research&quot; showed that the relationship between ionospheric anomalies and large seismic events (M≥6.0) occurring globally from 2000 to 2014 was based on the presence of solar weather. When the solar data are removed from the time series, the correlation is no longer statistically significant. A subsequent article in &quot;Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors&quot; in 2020 shows that solar weather and ionospheric disturbances are a potential cause to trigger large earthquakes based on this statistical relationship. The proposed mechanism is electromagnetic induction from the ionosphere to the fault zone. Fault fluids are conductive, and can produce telluric currents at depth. The resulting change in the local magnetic field in the fault triggers dissolution of minerals and weakens the rock, while also potentially changing the groundwater chemistry and level. After the seismic event, different minerals may be precipitated thus changing groundwater chemistry and level again. This process of mineral dissolution and precipitation before and after an earthquake has been observed in Iceland. This model makes sense of the ionospheric, seismic and groundwater data.

====== Satellite observation of the expected ground temperature declination ======

One way of detecting the mobility of tectonic stresses is to detect locally elevated temperatures on the surface of the crust measured by satellites. During the evaluation process, the background of daily variation and noise due to atmospheric disturbances and human activities are removed before visualizing the concentration of trends in the wider area of a fault. This method has been experimentally applied since 1995.

In a newer approach to explain the phenomenon, NASA&#x27;s Friedmann Freund has proposed that the infrared radiation captured by the satellites is not due to a real increase in the surface temperature of the crust. According to this version the emission is a result of the quantum excitation that occurs at the chemical re-bonding of positive charge carriers (holes) which are traveling from the deepest layers to the surface of the crust at a speed of 200 meters per second. The electric charge arises as a result of increasing tectonic stresses as the time of the earthquake approaches. This emission extends superficially up to 500 x 500 square kilometers for very large events and stops almost immediately after the earthquake.

=== Trends ===
Instead of watching for anomalous phenomena that might be precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches also tend to be more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.

==== Nowcasting ====

Earthquake &quot;nowcasting&quot;, suggested in 2016 is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system, based on natural time introduced in 2001. It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting. Nowcasting calculations produce the &quot;earthquake potential score&quot;, an estimation of the current level of seismic progress. Typical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis, aftershocks and induced seismicity, induced seismicity at gas fields, seismic risk to global megacities, studying of clustering of large global earthquakes, etc.

==== Elastic rebound ====
Even the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid. Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the Earth&#x27;s crust will bend or deform. According to the elastic rebound theory of , eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault. Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves. The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake), the demonstrated existence of large strike-slip displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.

==== Characteristic earthquakes ====
The most studied earthquake faults (such as the Nankai megathrust, the Wasatch Fault, and the San Andreas Fault) appear to have distinct segments. The &quot;characteristic earthquake&quot; model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments. As the lengths and other properties of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment. Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals. For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely return period) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. UCERF3 is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California. Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.

The idea of characteristic earthquakes was the basis of the Parkfield prediction: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, with a standard deviation of ±3.1 years. Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval). The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the &quot;trend&quot;, which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters. However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.

The failure of the Parkfield prediction has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself. Some studies have questioned the various assumptions, including the key one that earthquakes are constrained within segments, and suggested that the &quot;characteristic earthquakes&quot; may be an artifact of selection bias and the shortness of seismological records (relative to earthquake cycles). Other studies have considered whether other factors need to be considered, such as the age of the fault. Whether earthquake ruptures are more generally constrained within a segment (as is often seen), or break past segment boundaries (also seen), has a direct bearing on the degree of earthquake hazard: earthquakes are larger where multiple segments break, but in relieving more strain they will happen less often.

==== Seismic gaps ====
At the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind. But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the &quot;next big quake&quot; should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest. This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific (Pacific Rim) forecasts in 1979 and 1989–1991.

However, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect. A close examination suggests that &quot;there may be no information in seismic gaps about the time of occurrence or the magnitude of the next large event in the region&quot;; statistical tests of the circum-Pacific forecasts shows that the seismic gap model &quot;did not forecast large earthquakes well&quot;. Another study concluded that a long quiet period did not increase earthquake potential.

==== Seismicity patterns ====

Various heuristically derived algorithms have been developed for predicting earthquakes. Probably the most widely known is the M8 family of algorithms (including the RTP method) developed under the leadership of Vladimir Keilis-Borok. M8 issues a &quot;Time of Increased Probability&quot; (TIP) alarm for a large earthquake of a specified magnitude upon observing certain patterns of smaller earthquakes. TIPs generally cover large areas (up to a thousand kilometers across) for up to five years. Such large parameters have made M8 controversial, as it is hard to determine whether any hits that happened were skillfully predicted, or only the result of chance.

M8 gained considerable attention when the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes occurred within a TIP. In 1999, Keilis-Borok&#x27;s group published a claim to have achieved statistically significant intermediate-term results using their M8 and MSc models, as far as world-wide large earthquakes are regarded. However, Geller et al. are skeptical of prediction claims over any period shorter than 30 years. A widely publicized TIP for an M 6.4 quake in Southern California in 2004 was not fulfilled, nor two other lesser known TIPs. A deep study of the RTP method in 2008 found that out of some twenty alarms only two could be considered hits (and one of those had a 60% chance of happening anyway). It concluded that &quot;RTP is not significantly different from a naïve method of guessing based on the historical rates [of] seismicity.&quot;

&quot;Accelerating moment release&quot; (AMR, &quot;moment&quot; being a measurement of seismic energy), also known as time-to-failure analysis, or accelerating seismic moment release (ASMR), is based on observations that foreshock activity prior to a major earthquake not only increased, but increased at an exponential rate. In other words, a plot of the cumulative number of foreshocks gets steeper just before the main shock.

Following formulation by into a testable hypothesis, and a number of positive reports, AMR seemed promising despite several problems. Known issues included not being detected for all locations and events, and the difficulty of projecting an accurate occurrence time when the tail end of the curve gets steep. But rigorous testing has shown that apparent AMR trends likely result from how data fitting is done, and failing to account for spatiotemporal clustering of earthquakes. The AMR trends are therefore statistically insignificant. Interest in AMR (as judged by the number of peer-reviewed papers) has fallen off since 2004.

==== Machine learning ====
Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) reported having successfully trained a regression random forest on acoustic time series data capable of identifying a signal emitted from fault zones that forecasts fault failure. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) suggested that the identified signal, previously assumed to be statistical noise, reflects the increasing emission of energy before its sudden release during a slip event. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) further postulated that their approach could bound fault failure times and lead to the identification of other unknown signals. Due to the rarity of the most catastrophic earthquakes, acquiring representative data remains problematic. In response, Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) have conjectured that their model would not need to train on data from catastrophic earthquakes, since further research has shown the seismic patterns of interest to be similar in smaller earthquakes.

Deep learning has also been applied to earthquake prediction. Although Bath&#x27;s law and Omori&#x27;s law describe the magnitude of earthquake aftershocks and their time-varying properties, the prediction of the &quot;spatial distribution of aftershocks&quot; remains an open research problem. Using the Theano and TensorFlow software libraries, DeVries et al. (2018) trained a neural network that achieved higher accuracy in the prediction of spatial distributions of earthquake aftershocks than the previously established methodology of Coulomb failure stress change. Notably, DeVries et al. (2018) reported that their model made no &quot;assumptions about receiver plane orientation or geometry&quot; and heavily weighted the change in shear stress, &quot;sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor,&quot; and the von Mises yield criterion. DeVries et al. (2018) postulated that the reliance of their model on these physical quantities indicated that they might &quot;control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.&quot; For validation testing, DeVries et al. (2018) reserved 10% of positive training earthquake data samples and an equal quantity of randomly chosen negative samples.

Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo have similarly analyzed the application of artificial neural networks to earthquake prediction. They found in a review of literature that earthquake prediction research utilizing artificial neural networks has gravitated towards more sophisticated models amidst increased interest in the area. They also found that neural networks utilized in earthquake prediction with notable success rates were matched in performance by simpler models. They further addressed the issues of acquiring appropriate data for training neural networks to predict earthquakes, writing that the &quot;structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogues&quot; makes transparent machine learning models more desirable than artificial neural networks.

==== EMP induced seismicity ====
High energy electromagnetic pulses can induce earthquakes within 2–6 days after the emission by EMP generators. It has been proposed that strong EM impacts could control seismicity, as the seismicity dynamics that follow appear to be a lot more regular than usual.

== Notable predictions ==
These are predictions, or claims of predictions, that are notable either scientifically or because of public notoriety, and claim a scientific or quasi-scientific basis. As many predictions are held confidentially, or published in obscure locations, and become notable only when they are claimed, there may be a selection bias in that hits get more attention than misses. The predictions listed here are discussed in Hough&#x27;s book and Geller&#x27;s paper.

=== 1975: Haicheng, China ===
The M 7.3 1975 Haicheng earthquake is the most widely cited &quot;success&quot; of earthquake prediction. The ostensible story is that study of seismic activity in the region led the Chinese authorities to issue a medium-term prediction in June 1974, and the political authorities therefore ordered various measures taken, including enforced evacuation of homes, construction of &quot;simple outdoor structures&quot;, and showing of movies out-of-doors. The quake, striking at 19:36, was powerful enough to destroy or badly damage about half of the homes. However, the &quot;effective preventative measures taken&quot; were said to have kept the death toll under 300 in an area with population of about 1.6 million, where otherwise tens of thousands of fatalities might have been expected.

However, although a major earthquake occurred, there has been some skepticism about the narrative of measures taken on the basis of a timely prediction. This event occurred during the Cultural Revolution, when &quot;belief in earthquake prediction was made an element of ideological orthodoxy that distinguished the true party liners from right wing deviationists&quot;. Recordkeeping was disordered, making it difficult to verify details, including whether there was any ordered evacuation. The method used for either the medium-term or short-term predictions (other than &quot;Chairman Mao&#x27;s revolutionary line&quot;) has not been specified. The evacuation may have been spontaneous, following the strong (M 4.7) foreshock that occurred the day before.

A 2006 study that had access to an extensive range of records found that the predictions were flawed. &quot;In particular, there was no official short-term prediction, although such a prediction was made by individual scientists.&quot; Also: &quot;it was the foreshocks alone that triggered the final decisions of warning and evacuation&quot;. They estimated that 2,041 lives were lost. That more did not die was attributed to a number of fortuitous circumstances, including earthquake education in the previous months (prompted by elevated seismic activity), local initiative, timing (occurring when people were neither working nor asleep), and local style of construction. The authors conclude that, while unsatisfactory as a prediction, &quot;it was an attempt to predict a major earthquake that for the first time did not end up with practical failure.&quot;

===1981: Lima, Peru (Brady)===
In 1976, Brian Brady, a physicist, then at the U.S. Bureau of Mines, where he had studied how rocks fracture, &quot;concluded a series of four articles on the theory of earthquakes with the deduction that strain building in the subduction zone [off-shore of Peru] might result in an earthquake of large magnitude within a period of seven to fourteen years from mid November 1974.&quot; In an internal memo written in June 1978 he narrowed the time window to &quot;October to November, 1981&quot;, with a main shock in the range of 9.2±0.2. In a 1980 memo he was reported as specifying &quot;mid-September 1980&quot;. This was discussed at a scientific seminar in San Juan, Argentina, in October 1980, where Brady&#x27;s colleague, W. Spence, presented a paper. Brady and Spence then met with government officials from the U.S. and Peru on 29 October, and &quot;forecast a series of large magnitude earthquakes in the second half of 1981.&quot; This prediction became widely known in Peru, following what the U.S. embassy described as &quot;sensational first page headlines carried in most Lima dailies&quot; on January 26, 1981.

On 27 January 1981, after reviewing the Brady-Spence prediction, the U.S. National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (NEPEC) announced it was &quot;unconvinced of the scientific validity&quot; of the prediction, and had been &quot;shown nothing in the observed seismicity data, or in the theory insofar as presented, that lends substance to the predicted times, locations, and magnitudes of the earthquakes.&quot; It went on to say that while there was a probability of major earthquakes at the predicted times, that probability was low, and recommend that &quot;the prediction not be given serious consideration.&quot;

Unfazed, Brady subsequently revised his forecast, stating there would be at least three earthquakes on or about July 6, August 18 and September 24, 1981, leading one USGS official to complain: &quot;If he is allowed to continue to play this game ... he will eventually get a hit and his theories will be considered valid by many.&quot;

On June 28 (the date most widely taken as the date of the first predicted earthquake), it was reported that: &quot;the population of Lima passed a quiet Sunday&quot;. The headline on one Peruvian newspaper: &quot;NO PASÓ NADA&quot; (&quot;Nothing happened&quot;).

In July Brady formally withdrew his prediction on the grounds that prerequisite seismic activity had not occurred. Economic losses due to reduced tourism during this episode has been roughly estimated at one hundred million dollars.

=== 1985–1993: Parkfield, U.S. (Bakun-Lindh) ===
The &quot;Parkfield earthquake prediction experiment&quot; was the most heralded scientific earthquake prediction ever. It was based on an observation that the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault breaks regularly with a moderate earthquake of about M 6 every several decades: 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966. More particularly, pointed out that, if the 1934 quake is excluded, these occur every 22 years, ±4.3 years. Counting from 1966, they predicted a 95% chance that the next earthquake would hit around 1988, or 1993 at the latest. The National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (NEPEC) evaluated this, and concurred. The U.S. Geological Survey and the State of California therefore established one of the &quot;most sophisticated and densest nets of monitoring instruments in the world&quot;, in part to identify any precursors when the quake came. Confidence was high enough that detailed plans were made for alerting emergency authorities if there were signs an earthquake was imminent. In the words of &quot;The Economist&quot;: &quot;never has an ambush been more carefully laid for such an event.&quot;

1993 came, and passed, without fulfillment. Eventually there was an M 6.0 earthquake on the Parkfield segment of the fault, on 28 September 2004, but without forewarning or obvious precursors. While the &quot;experiment&quot; in catching an earthquake is considered by many scientists to have been successful, the &quot;prediction&quot; was unsuccessful in that the eventual event was a decade late.

=== 1983–1995: Greece (VAN) ===

In 1981, the &quot;VAN&quot; group, headed by Panayiotis Varotsos, said that they found a relationship between earthquakes and &#x27;seismic electric signals&#x27; (SES). In 1984 they presented a table of 23 earthquakes from 19 January 1983 to 19 September 1983, of which they claimed to have successfully predicted 18 earthquakes. Other lists followed, such as their 1991 claim of predicting six out of seven earthquakes with ≥ 5.5 in the period of 1 April 1987 through 10 August 1989, or five out of seven earthquakes with ≥ 5.3 in the overlapping period of 15 May 1988 to 10 August 1989, In 1996 they published a &quot;Summary of all Predictions issued from January 1st, 1987 to June 15, 1995&quot;, amounting to 94 predictions. Matching this against a list of &quot;All earthquakes with MS(ATH)&quot; and within geographical bounds including most of Greece, they come up with a list of 14 earthquakes they should have predicted. Here they claim ten successes, for a success rate of 70%.

The VAN predictions have been criticized on various grounds, including being geophysically implausible, &quot;vague and ambiguous&quot;, failing to satisfy prediction criteria, and retroactive adjustment of parameters. A critical review of 14 cases where VAN claimed 10 successes showed only one case where an earthquake occurred within the prediction parameters. The VAN predictions not only fail to do better than chance, but show &quot;a much better association with the events which occurred before them&quot;, according to Mulargia and Gasperini. Other early reviews found that the VAN results, when evaluated by definite parameters, were statistically significant. Both positive and negative views on VAN predictions from this period were summarized in the 1996 book &quot;A Critical Review of VAN&quot; edited by Sir James Lighthill and in a debate issue presented by the journal Geophysical Research Letters that was focused on the statistical significance of the VAN method. VAN had the opportunity to reply to their critics in those review publications. In 2011, the ICEF reviewed the 1996 debate, and concluded that the optimistic SES prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated. In 2013, the SES activities were found to be coincident with the minima of the fluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity, which have been shown to be statistically significant precursors by employing the event coincidence analysis.

A crucial issue is the large and often indeterminate parameters of the predictions, such that some critics say these are not predictions, and should not be recognized as such. Much of the controversy with VAN arises from this failure to adequately specify these parameters. Some of their telegrams include predictions of two distinct earthquake events, such as (typically) one earthquake predicted at 300 km &quot;NW&quot; of Athens, and another at 240 km &quot;W&quot;, &quot;with 5,3 and 5,8&quot;, with no time limit. The time parameter estimation was introduced in VAN Method by means of natural time in 2001.
VAN has disputed the &#x27;pessimistic&#x27; conclusions of their critics, but the critics have not relented. It was suggested that VAN failed to account for clustering of earthquakes, or that they interpreted their data differently during periods of greater seismic activity.

VAN has been criticized on several occasions for causing public panic and widespread unrest. This has been exacerbated by the broadness of their predictions, which cover large areas of Greece (up to 240 kilometers across, and often pairs of areas), much larger than the areas actually affected by earthquakes of the magnitudes predicted (usually several tens of kilometers across). Magnitudes are similarly broad: a predicted magnitude of &quot;6.0&quot; represents a range from a benign magnitude 5.3 to a broadly destructive 6.7. Coupled with indeterminate time windows of a month or more, such predictions &quot;cannot be practically utilized&quot; to determine an appropriate level of preparedness, whether to curtail usual societal functioning, or even to issue public warnings.

=== 2008: Greece (VAN) ===
After 2006, VAN claim that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at arxiv.org. Such SES activity is evaluated using a new method they call &#x27;natural time&#x27;. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983–2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9. VAN&#x27;s report was also described in an article in the newspaper &quot;Ethnos&quot; on Feb. 10, 2008. However, Gerassimos Papadopoulos commented that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that &quot;none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified.&quot; A reply to this comment, which insisted on the prediction&#x27;s accuracy, was published in the same issue.

=== 1989: Loma Prieta, U.S. ===
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (epicenter in the Santa Cruz Mountains northwest of San Juan Bautista, California) caused significant damage in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reportedly claimed, twelve hours &quot;after&quot; the event, that it had &quot;forecast&quot; this earthquake in a report the previous year. USGS staff subsequently claimed this quake had been &quot;anticipated&quot;; various other claims of prediction have also been made.

Ruth Harris () reviewed 18 papers (with 26 forecasts) dating from 1910 &quot;that variously offer or relate to scientific forecasts of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.&quot; (In this case no distinction is made between a &quot;forecast&quot;, which is limited to a probabilistic estimate of an earthquake happening over some time period, and a more specific &quot;prediction&quot;.) None of these forecasts can be rigorously tested due to lack of specificity, and where a forecast does bracket the correct time and location, the window was so broad (e.g., covering the greater part of California for five years) as to lose any value as a prediction. Predictions that came close (but given a probability of only 30%) had ten- or twenty-year windows.

One debated prediction came from the M8 algorithm used by Keilis-Borok and associates in four forecasts. The first of these forecasts missed both magnitude (M 7.5) and time (a five-year window from 1 January 1984, to 31 December 1988). They did get the location, by including most of California and half of Nevada. A subsequent revision, presented to the NEPEC, extended the time window to 1 July 1992, and reduced the location to only central California; the magnitude remained the same. A figure they presented had two more revisions, for M ≥ 7.0 quakes in central California. The five-year time window for one ended in July 1989, and so missed the Loma Prieta event; the second revision extended to 1990, and so included Loma Prieta.

When discussing success or failure of prediction for the Loma Prieta earthquake, some scientists argue that it did not occur on the San Andreas Fault (the focus of most of the forecasts), and involved dip-slip (vertical) movement rather than strike-slip (horizontal) movement, and so was not predicted.

Other scientists argue that it did occur in the San Andreas Fault &quot;zone&quot;, and released much of the strain accumulated since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; therefore several of the forecasts were correct. Hough states that &quot;most seismologists&quot; do not believe this quake was &quot;predicted&quot; &quot;per se&quot;. In a strict sense there were no predictions, only forecasts, which were only partially successful.

Iben Browning claimed to have predicted the Loma Prieta event, but (as will be seen in the next section) this claim has been rejected.

=== 1990: New Madrid, U.S. (Browning) ===

Iben Browning (a scientist with a Ph.D. degree in zoology and training as a biophysicist, but no experience in geology, geophysics, or seismology) was an &quot;independent business consultant&quot; who forecast long-term climate trends for businesses. He supported the idea (scientifically unproven) that volcanoes and earthquakes are more likely to be triggered when the tidal force of the Sun and the Moon coincide to exert maximum stress on the Earth&#x27;s crust (syzygy). Having calculated when these tidal forces maximize, Browning then &quot;projected&quot; what areas were most at risk for a large earthquake. An area he mentioned frequently was the New Madrid seismic zone at the southeast corner of the state of Missouri, the site of three very large earthquakes in 1811–12, which he coupled with the date of 3 December 1990.

Browning&#x27;s reputation and perceived credibility were boosted when he claimed in various promotional flyers and advertisements to have predicted (among various other events) the Loma Prieta earthquake of 17 October 1989. The National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (NEPEC) formed an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to evaluate Browning&#x27;s prediction. Its report (issued 18 October 1990) specifically rejected the claim of a successful prediction of the Loma Prieta earthquake. A transcript of his talk in San Francisco on 10 October showed he had said: &quot;there will probably be several earthquakes around the world, Richter 6+, and there may be a volcano or two&quot; – which, on a global scale, is about average for a week – with no mention of any earthquake in California.

Though the AHWG report disproved both Browning&#x27;s claims of prior success and the basis of his &quot;projection&quot;, it made little impact after a year of continued claims of a successful prediction. Browning&#x27;s prediction received the support of geophysicist David Stewart, and the tacit endorsement of many public authorities in their preparations for a major disaster, all of which was amplified by massive exposure in the news media. Nothing happened on 3 December, and Browning died of a heart attack seven months later.

=== 2004 and 2005: Southern California, U.S. (Keilis-Borok) ===
The M8 algorithm (developed under the leadership of Vladimir Keilis-Borok at UCLA) gained respect by the apparently successful predictions of the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes. Great interest was therefore generated by the prediction in early 2004 of a M ≥ 6.4 earthquake to occur somewhere within an area of southern California of approximately 12,000 sq. miles, on or before 5 September 2004. In evaluating this prediction the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (CEPEC) noted that this method had not yet made enough predictions for statistical validation, and was sensitive to input assumptions. It therefore concluded that no &quot;special public policy actions&quot; were warranted, though it reminded all Californians &quot;of the significant seismic hazards throughout the state.&quot; The predicted earthquake did not occur.

A very similar prediction was made for an earthquake on or before 14 August 2005, in approximately the same area of southern California. The CEPEC&#x27;s evaluation and recommendation were essentially the same, this time noting that the previous prediction and two others had not been fulfilled. This prediction also failed.

=== 2009: L&#x27;Aquila, Italy (Giuliani) ===
At 03:32 on 6 April 2009, the Abruzzo region of central Italy was rocked by a magnitude M 6.3 earthquake. In the city of L&#x27;Aquila and surrounding area around 60,000 buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged, resulting in 308 deaths and 67,500 people left homeless. Around the same time, it was reported that Giampaolo Giuliani had predicted the earthquake, had tried to warn the public, but had been muzzled by the Italian government.

Giampaolo Giuliani was a laboratory technician at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. As a hobby he had for some years been monitoring radon using instruments he had designed and built. Prior to the L&#x27;Aquila earthquake he was unknown to the scientific community, and had not published any scientific work. He had been interviewed on 24 March by an Italian-language blog, &quot;Donne Democratiche&quot;, about a swarm of low-level earthquakes in the Abruzzo region that had started the previous December. He said that this swarm was normal and would diminish by the end of March. On 30 March, L&#x27;Aquila was struck by a magnitude 4.0 temblor, the largest to date.

On 27 March Giuliani warned the mayor of L&#x27;Aquila there could be an earthquake within 24 hours, and an earthquake M~2.3 occurred. On 29 March he made a second prediction. He telephoned the mayor of the town of Sulmona, about 55 kilometers southeast of L&#x27;Aquila, to expect a &quot;damaging&quot; – or even &quot;catastrophic&quot; – earthquake within 6 to 24 hours. Loudspeaker vans were used to warn the inhabitants of Sulmona to evacuate, with consequential panic. No quake ensued and Giuliano was cited for inciting public alarm and enjoined from making future public predictions.

After the L&#x27;Aquila event Giuliani claimed that he had found alarming rises in radon levels just hours before. He said he had warned relatives, friends and colleagues on the evening before the earthquake hit. He was subsequently interviewed by the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection, which found that Giuliani had not transmitted a valid prediction of the mainshock to the civil authorities before its occurrence.

== Difficulty or impossibility ==
As the preceding examples show, the record of earthquake prediction has been disappointing. The optimism of the 1970s that routine prediction of earthquakes would be &quot;soon&quot;, perhaps within ten years, was coming up disappointingly short by the 1990s, and many scientists began wondering why. By 1997 it was being positively stated that earthquakes can &quot;not&quot; be predicted, which led to a notable debate in 1999 on whether prediction of individual earthquakes is a realistic scientific goal.

Earthquake prediction may have failed only because it is &quot;fiendishly difficult&quot; and still beyond the current competency of science. Despite the confident announcement four decades ago that seismology was &quot;on the verge&quot; of making reliable predictions, there may yet be an underestimation of the difficulties. As early as 1978 it was reported that earthquake rupture might be complicated by &quot;heterogeneous distribution of mechanical properties along the fault&quot;, and in 1986 that geometrical irregularities in the fault surface &quot;appear to exert major controls on the starting and stopping of ruptures&quot;. Another study attributed significant differences in fault behavior to the maturity of the fault. These kinds of complexities are not reflected in current prediction methods.

Seismology may even yet lack an adequate grasp of its most central concept, elastic rebound theory. A simulation that explored assumptions regarding the distribution of slip found results &quot;not in agreement with the classical view of the elastic rebound theory&quot;. (This was attributed to details of fault heterogeneity not accounted for in the theory.)

Earthquake prediction may be intrinsically impossible. In 1997, it has been argued that the Earth is in a state of self-organized criticality &quot;where any small earthquake has some probability of cascading into a large event&quot;. It has also been argued on decision-theoretic grounds that &quot;prediction of major earthquakes is, in any practical sense, impossible.&quot; In 2021, a multitude of authors from a variety of universities and research institutes studying the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite reported that the claims based on self-organized criticality stating that at any moment any small earthquake can eventually cascade to a large event, do not stand in view of the results obtained to date by natural time analysis.

That earthquake prediction might be intrinsically impossible has been strongly disputed, but the best disproof of impossibility – effective earthquake prediction – has yet to be demonstrated.

<text>Sulfuric(IV) acid (United Kingdom spelling: sulphuric(IV) acid), also known as sulfurous (UK: sulphurous) acid and thionic acid, is the chemical compound with the formula .

Raman spectra of solutions of sulfur dioxide in water show only signals due to the molecule and the bisulfite ion, . The intensities of the signals are consistent with the following equilibrium:

17O NMR spectroscopy provided evidence that solutions of sulfurous acid and protonated sulfites contain a mixture of isomers, which is in equilibrium:

Attempts to concentrate the solutions of sulfurous acid simply reverses the equilibrium, producing sulfur dioxide and water vapor. A clathrate with the formula has been crystallised. It decomposes above 7 °C.

==History and production==
Sulfurous acid is commonly known to not exist in its free state, and due to this, it is stated in textbooks that it cannot be isolated in the water-free form. However, the molecule has been detected in the gas phase in 1988 by the dissociative ionization of diethyl sulfite. The conjugate bases of this elusive acid are, however, common anions, bisulfite (or hydrogen sulfite) and sulfite. Sulfurous acid is an intermediate species in the formation of acid rain from sulfur dioxide.

==Uses==
Aqueous solutions of sulfur dioxide, which sometimes are referred to as sulfurous acid, are used as reducing agents and as disinfectants, as are solutions of bisulfite and sulfite salts. They are oxidised to sulfuric acid or sulfate by accepting another oxygen atom.

<text>Krill &quot;(Euphausiids)&quot; (: krill) are small and exclusively marine crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, found in all of the world&#x27;s oceans. The name &quot;krill&quot; comes from the Norwegian word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;small fry of fish&quot;, which is also often attributed to species of fish.

Krill are considered an important trophic level connection near the bottom of the food chain. They feed on phytoplankton and, to a lesser extent, zooplankton, and are also the main source of food for many larger animals. In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, makes up an estimated biomass of around 379 million tonnes, making it among the species with the largest total biomass. Over half of this biomass is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, seabirds, squid, and fish each year. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.

Krill are fished commercially in the Southern Ocean and in the waters around Japan. The total global harvest amounts to 150,000–200,000 tonnes annually, mostly from the Scotia Sea. Most krill catch is used for aquaculture and aquarium feeds, as bait in sport fishing, or in the pharmaceutical industry. Krill are also used for human consumption in several countries. They are known as in Japan and as &quot;camarones&quot; in Spain and the Philippines. In the Philippines, they are also called &quot;alamang&quot; and are used to make a salty paste called &quot;bagoong&quot;.

Krill are also the main prey of baleen whales, including the blue whale.

== Taxonomy ==
Krill belong to the large arthropod subphylum, the Crustacea. The most familiar and largest group of crustaceans, the class Malacostraca, includes the superorder Eucarida comprising the three orders, Euphausiacea (krill), Decapoda (shrimp, prawns, lobsters, crabs), and the planktonic Amphionidacea.

The order Euphausiacea comprises two families. The more abundant Euphausiidae contains 10 different genera with a total of 85 species. Of these, the genus &quot;Euphausia&quot; is the largest, with 31 species. The lesser-known family, the Bentheuphausiidae, has only one species, &quot;Bentheuphausia amblyops&quot;, a bathypelagic krill living in deep waters below . It is considered the most primitive extant krill species.

Well-known species of the Euphausiidae of commercial krill fisheries include Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;), Pacific krill (&quot;E. pacifica&quot;) and Northern krill (&quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot;).

===Phylogeny===


, the order Euphausiacea is believed to be monophyletic due to several unique conserved morphological characteristics (autapomorphy) such as its naked filamentous gills and thin thoracopods and by molecular studies.

There have been many theories of the location of the order Euphausiacea. Since the first description of &quot;Thysanopode tricuspide&quot; by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1830, the similarity of their biramous thoracopods had led zoologists to group euphausiids and Mysidacea in the order Schizopoda, which was split by Johan Erik Vesti Boas in 1883 into two separate orders. Later, William Thomas Calman (1904) ranked the Mysidacea in the superorder Peracarida and euphausiids in the superorder Eucarida, although even up to the 1930s the order Schizopoda was advocated. It was later also proposed that order Euphausiacea should be grouped with the Penaeidae (family of prawns) in the Decapoda based on developmental similarities, as noted by Robert Gurney and Isabella Gordon. The reason for this debate is that krill share some morphological features of decapods and others of mysids.

Molecular studies have not unambiguously grouped them, possibly due to the paucity of key rare species such as &quot;Bentheuphausia amblyops&quot; in krill and &quot;Amphionides reynaudii&quot; in Eucarida. One study supports the monophyly of Eucarida (with basal Mysida), another groups Euphausiacea with Mysida (the Schizopoda), while yet another groups Euphausiacea with Hoplocarida.

===Timeline===
No extant fossil can be unequivocally assigned to Euphausiacea. Some extinct eumalacostracan taxa have been thought to be euphausiaceans such as &quot;Anthracophausia&quot;, &quot;Crangopsis&quot;—now assigned to the Aeschronectida (Hoplocarida)—and &quot;Palaeomysis&quot;. All dating of speciation events were estimated by molecular clock methods, which placed the last common ancestor of the krill family Euphausiidae (order Euphausiacea minus &quot;Bentheuphausia amblyops&quot;) to have lived in the Lower Cretaceous about .

== Distribution ==

Krill occur worldwide in all oceans, although many individual species have endemic or neritic (&quot;i.e.,&quot; coastal) distributions. &quot;Bentheuphausia amblyops&quot;, a bathypelagic species, has a cosmopolitan distribution within its deep-sea habitat.

Species of the genus &quot;Thysanoessa&quot; occur in both Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Pacific is home to &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot;. Northern krill occur across the Atlantic from the Mediterranean Sea northward.

Species with neritic distributions include the four species of the genus &quot;Nyctiphanes&quot;. They are highly abundant along the upwelling regions of the California, Humboldt, Benguela, and Canarias current systems. Another species having only neritic distribution is &quot;E. crystallorophias&quot;, which is endemic to the Antarctic coastline.

Species with endemic distributions include &quot;Nyctiphanes capensis&quot;, which occurs only in the Benguela current, &quot;E. mucronata&quot; in the Humboldt current, and the six &quot;Euphausia&quot; species native to the Southern Ocean.

In the Antarctic, seven species are known, one in genus &quot;Thysanoessa&quot; (&quot;T. macrura&quot;) and six in &quot;Euphausia&quot;. The Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;) commonly lives at depths reaching , whereas ice krill (&quot;Euphausia crystallorophias&quot;) reach depth of , though they commonly inhabit depths of at most . Krill perform Diel Vertical Migrations (DVM) in large swarms, and acoustic data has shown these migrations to go up to 400 metres in depth. Both are found at latitudes south of 55° S, with &quot;E. crystallorophias&quot; dominating south of 74° S and in regions of pack ice. Other species known in the Southern Ocean are &quot;E. frigida&quot;, &quot;E. longirostris&quot;, &quot;E. triacantha&quot; and &quot;E. vallentini&quot;.

== Anatomy and morphology ==

Krill are crustaceans and, like all crustaceans, they have a chitinous exoskeleton. They have anatomy similar to a standard decapod with their bodies made up of three parts: the cephalothorax is composed of the head and the thorax, which are fused, and the abdomen, which bears the ten swimming appendages, and the tail fan. This outer shell of krill is transparent in most species.

Krill feature intricate compound eyes. Some species adapt to different lighting conditions through the use of screening pigments.

They have two antennae and several pairs of thoracic legs called pereiopods or thoracopods, so named because they are attached to the thorax. Their number varies among genera and species. These thoracic legs include feeding legs and grooming legs.

Krill are probably the sister clade of decapods because all species have five pairs of swimming legs called &quot;swimmerets&quot; in common with the latter, very similar to those of a lobster or freshwater crayfish.

In spite of having ten swimmerets, otherwise known as pleopods, krill cannot be considered decapods. They lack any true ground-based legs due to all their pereiopods having been converted into grooming and auxiliary feeding legs. In Decapoda, there are ten functioning pereiopods, giving them their name; whereas here there are no remaining locomotive pereiopods. Nor are there consistently ten pereiopods at all.

Most krill are about long as adults. A few species grow to sizes on the order of . The largest krill species, &quot;Thysanopoda cornuta&quot;, lives deep in the open ocean. Krill can be easily distinguished from other crustaceans such as true shrimp by their externally visible gills.

Except for &quot;Bentheuphausia amblyops&quot;, krill are bioluminescent animals having organs called photophores that can emit light. The light is generated by an enzyme-catalysed chemiluminescence reaction, wherein a luciferin (a kind of pigment) is activated by a luciferase enzyme. Studies indicate that the luciferin of many krill species is a fluorescent tetrapyrrole similar but not identical to dinoflagellate luciferin and that the krill probably do not produce this substance themselves but acquire it as part of their diet, which contains dinoflagellates. Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and can be rotated by muscles. The precise function of these organs is as yet unknown; possibilities include mating, social interaction or orientation and as a form of counter-illumination camouflage to compensate their shadow against overhead ambient light.

== Ecology ==

===Feeding===
Many krill are filter feeders: their frontmost appendages, the thoracopods, form very fine combs with which they can filter out their food from the water. These filters can be very fine in species (such as &quot;Euphausia&quot; spp.) that feed primarily on phytoplankton, in particular on diatoms, which are unicellular algae. Krill are mostly omnivorous, although a few species are carnivorous, preying on small zooplankton and fish larvae.

Krill are an important element of the aquatic food chain. Krill convert the primary production of their prey into a form suitable for consumption by larger animals that cannot feed directly on the minuscule algae. Northern krill and some other species have a relatively small filtering basket and actively hunt copepods and larger zooplankton.

===Predation===
Many animals feed on krill, ranging from smaller animals like fish or penguins to larger ones like seals and baleen whales.

Disturbances of an ecosystem resulting in a decline in the krill population can have far-reaching effects. During a coccolithophore bloom in the Bering Sea in 1998, for instance, the diatom concentration dropped in the affected area. Krill cannot feed on the smaller coccolithophores, and consequently the krill population (mainly &quot;E. pacifica&quot;) in that region declined sharply. This in turn affected other species: the shearwater population dropped. The incident was thought to have been one reason salmon did not spawn that season.

Several single-celled endoparasitoidic ciliates of the genus &quot;Collinia&quot; can infect species of krill and devastate affected populations. Such diseases were reported for &quot;Thysanoessa inermis&quot; in the Bering Sea and also for &quot;E. pacifica&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa spinifera&quot;, and &quot;T. gregaria&quot; off the North American Pacific coast. Some ectoparasites of the family Dajidae (epicaridean isopods) afflict krill (and also shrimp and mysids); one such parasite is &quot;Oculophryxus bicaulis&quot;, which was found on the krill &quot;Stylocheiron affine&quot; and &quot;S. longicorne&quot;. It attaches itself to the animal&#x27;s eyestalk and sucks blood from its head; it apparently inhibits the host&#x27;s reproduction, as none of the afflicted animals reached maturity.

Climate change poses another threat to krill populations.

===Plastics===
Preliminary research indicates krill can digest microplastics under in diameter, breaking them down and excreting them back into the environment in smaller form.

== Life history and behavior ==
The life cycle of krill is relatively well understood, despite minor variations in detail from species to species. After krill hatch, they experience several larval stages—&quot;nauplius&quot;, &quot;pseudometanauplius&quot;, &quot;metanauplius&quot;, &quot;calyptopsis&quot;, and &quot;furcilia&quot;, each of which divides into sub-stages. The pseudometanauplius stage is exclusive to species that lay their eggs within an ovigerous sac: so-called &quot;sac-spawners&quot;. The larvae grow and moult repeatedly as they develop, replacing their rigid exoskeleton when it becomes too small. Smaller animals moult more frequently than larger ones. Yolk reserves within their body nourish the larvae through metanauplius stage.

By the calyptopsis stages differentiation has progressed far enough for them to develop a mouth and a digestive tract, and they begin to eat phytoplankton. By that time their yolk reserves are exhausted and the larvae must have reached the photic zone, the upper layers of the ocean where algae flourish. During the furcilia stages, segments with pairs of swimmerets are added, beginning at the frontmost segments. Each new pair becomes functional only at the next moult. The number of segments added during any one of the furcilia stages may vary even within one species depending on environmental conditions. After the final furcilia stage, an immature juvenile emerges in a shape similar to an adult, and subsequently develops gonads and matures sexually.

===Reproduction===
During the mating season, which varies by species and climate, the male deposits a sperm sack at the female&#x27;s genital opening (named &quot;thelycum&quot;). The females can carry several thousand eggs in their ovary, which may then account for as much as one third of the animal&#x27;s body mass. Krill can have multiple broods in one season, with interbrood intervals lasting on the order of days.

Krill employ two types of spawning mechanism. The 57 species of the genera &quot;Bentheuphausia&quot;, &quot;Euphausia&quot;, &quot;Meganyctiphanes&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa&quot;, and &quot;Thysanopoda&quot; are &quot;broadcast spawners&quot;: the female releases the fertilised eggs into the water, where they usually sink, disperse, and are on their own. These species generally hatch in the nauplius 1 stage, but have recently been discovered to hatch sometimes as metanauplius or even as calyptopis stages. The remaining 29 species of the other genera are &quot;sac spawners&quot;, where the female carries the eggs with her, attached to the rearmost pairs of thoracopods until they hatch as metanauplii, although some species like &quot;Nematoscelis difficilis&quot; may hatch as nauplius or pseudometanauplius.

===Moulting===
Moulting occurs whenever a specimen outgrows its rigid exoskeleton. Young animals, growing faster, moult more often than older and larger ones. The frequency of moulting varies widely by species and is, even within one species, subject to many external factors such as latitude, water temperature, and food availability. The subtropical species &quot;Nyctiphanes simplex&quot;, for instance, has an overall inter-moult period of two to seven days: larvae moult on the average every four days, while juveniles and adults do so, on average, every six days. For &quot;E. superba&quot; in the Antarctic sea, inter-moult periods ranging between 9 and 28 days depending on the temperature between have been observed, and for &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot; in the North Sea the inter-moult periods range also from 9 and 28 days but at temperatures between . &quot;E. superba&quot; is able to reduce its body size when there is not enough food available, moulting also when its exoskeleton becomes too large. Similar shrinkage has also been observed for &quot;E. pacifica&quot;, a species occurring in the Pacific Ocean from polar to temperate zones, as an adaptation to abnormally high water temperatures. Shrinkage has been postulated for other temperate-zone species of krill as well.

===Lifespan===
Some high-latitude species of krill can live for more than six years (e.g., &quot;Euphausia superba&quot;); others, such as the mid-latitude species &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot;, live for only two years. Subtropical or tropical species&#x27; longevity is still shorter, e.g., &quot;Nyctiphanes simplex&quot;, which usually lives for only six to eight months.

===Swarming===
Most krill are swarming animals; the sizes and densities of such swarms vary by species and region. For &quot;Euphausia superba&quot;, swarms reach 10,000 to 60,000 individuals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators that would like to pick out individuals. In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented what appears to be a successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: &quot; (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion.&quot;

===Vertical migration===
Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Sated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which employs a role in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface.

Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., &quot;Euphausia superba&quot;, &quot;E. pacifica&quot;, &quot;E. hanseni&quot;, &quot;Pseudeuphausia latifrons&quot;, and &quot;Thysanoessa spinifera&quot;) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.

Experimental studies using &quot;Artemia salina&quot; as a model suggest that the vertical migrations of krill several hundreds of metres, in groups tens of metres deep, could collectively create enough downward jets of water to have a significant effect on ocean mixing.

Dense swarms can elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantly, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy.

Krill normally swim at a pace of 5–10 cm/s (2–3 body lengths per second), using their swimmerets for propulsion. Their larger migrations are subject to ocean currents. When in danger, they show an escape reaction called lobstering—flicking their caudal structures, the telson and the uropods, they move backwards through the water relatively quickly, achieving speeds in the range of 10 to 27 body lengths per second, which for large krill such as &quot;E. superba&quot; means around . Their swimming performance has led many researchers to classify adult krill as micro-nektonic life-forms, i.e., small animals capable of individual motion against (weak) currents. Larval forms of krill are generally considered zooplankton.

==Biogeochemical cycles==

The Antarctic krill is an important species in the context of biogeochemical cycling and in the Antarctic food web. It plays a prominent role in the Southern Ocean because of its ability to cycle nutrients and to feed penguins and baleen and blue whales.

==Human uses ==

===Harvesting history===
Krill have been harvested as a food source for humans and domesticated animals since at least the 19th century, and possibly earlier in Japan, where it was known as &quot;okiami&quot;. Large-scale fishing developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and now occurs only in Antarctic waters and in the seas around Japan. Historically, the largest krill fishery nations were Japan and the Soviet Union, or, after the latter&#x27;s dissolution, Russia and Ukraine. The harvest peaked, which in 1983 was about 528,000 tonnes in the Southern Ocean alone (of which the Soviet Union took in 93%), is now managed as a precaution against overfishing.

In 1993, two events caused a decline in krill fishing: Russia exited the industry; and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) defined maximum catch quotas for a sustainable exploitation of Antarctic krill. After an October 2011 review, the Commission decided not to change the quota.

The annual Antarctic catch stabilised at around 100,000 tonnes, which is roughly one fiftieth of the CCAMLR catch quota. The main limiting factor was probably high costs along with political and legal issues. The Japanese fishery saturated at some 70,000 tonnes.

Although krill are found worldwide, fishing in Southern Oceans are preferred because the krill are more &quot;catchable&quot; and abundant in these regions. Particularly in Antarctic seas which are considered as , they are considered a &quot;clean product&quot;.

In 2018 it was announced that almost every krill fishing company operating in Antarctica will abandon operations in huge areas around the Antarctic Peninsula from 2020, including &quot;buffer zones&quot; around breeding colonies of penguins.

===Human consumption===
Although the total biomass of Antarctic krill may be as abundant as 400 million tonnes, the human impact on this keystone species is growing, with a 39% increase in total fishing yield to 294,000 tonnes over 2010–2014. Major countries involved in krill harvesting are Norway (56% of total catch in 2014), the Republic of Korea (19%), and China (18%).

Krill is a rich source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids which are under development in the early 21st century as human food, dietary supplements as oil capsules, livestock food, and pet food. Krill tastes salty with a somewhat stronger fish flavor than shrimp. For mass consumption and commercially prepared products, they must be peeled to remove the inedible exoskeleton.

In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration published a letter of no objection for a manufactured krill oil product to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human consumption.

Krill (and other planktonic shrimp, notably &quot;Acetes&quot; spp.) are most widely consumed in Southeast Asia, where it is fermented (with the shells intact) and usually ground finely to make shrimp paste. It can be stir-fried and eaten paired with white rice or used to add umami flavors to a wide variety of traditional dishes. The liquid from the fermentation process is also harvested as fish sauce.

== Bio-inspired robotics ==
Krill are agile swimmers in the intermediate Reynolds number regime, in which there are not many solutions for uncrewed underwater robotics, and have inspired robotic platforms to both study their locomotion as well as find design solutions for underwater robots.

<text>Mastermind or Master Mind () is a code-breaking game for two players invented in Israel. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century.

==History==
Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. After presenting the idea to major toy companies and showing it at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair, it was picked up by a plastics company, Invicta Plastics, based near Leicester, UK. Invicta purchased all the rights to the game, and the founder, Edward Jones-Fenleigh, refined the game further. It was released in 1971–2.

The game is based on a paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows. A computer adaptation was run in the 1960s on Cambridge University’s Titan computer system, where it was called &#x27;MOO&#x27;. This version was written by Frank King. Other versions were written for the TSS/8 time sharing system by J.S. Felton, for Unix by Ken Thompson, and for the Multics system at MIT by Jerrold Grochow.

Since 1971, the rights to &quot;Mastermind&quot; have been held by Invicta Plastics. (Invicta always called the game &quot;Master Mind&quot;.) They originally manufactured it themselves, though they have since licensed its manufacture to Hasbro worldwide, with the exception of Pressman Toys and Orda Industries who have the manufacturing rights to the United States and Israel, respectively. Chieftain Products acquired the rights to manufacture in Canada in 1972, though they went out of business in 1996.

Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a man in a suit jacket seated in the foreground, with a young woman standing behind him. The two amateur models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited in June 2003 to pose for another publicity photo.

==Gameplay and rules==
The game is played using:
* a &quot;decoding board&quot;, with a &quot;shield&quot; at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
* &quot;code pegs&quot; of six different colors (or more; see Variations below), with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and
* &quot;key pegs&quot;, some colored red (or black) and some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.
The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number. One player becomes the &quot;codemaker&quot;, the other the &quot;codebreaker&quot;. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. Players decide in advance whether duplicates and blanks are allowed. If so, the codemaker may choose up to four same-colored code pegs or four blanks. If blanks are not allowed in the code, the codebreaker may not use blanks in their guesses. The codemaker places the chosen pattern in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates a code peg that belongs in the solution, but is incorrectly positioned.
If there are duplicate colors in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colors in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is red-red-blue-blue and the codebreaker guesses red-red-red-blue, the codemaker will award three colored key pegs for the first two reds and the blue, but nothing for the third red. No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second blue.

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the decoding board are full.

Traditionally, players can only earn points when playing as the codemaker. The codemaker gets one point for each guess the codebreaker makes. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker is unable to guess the exact pattern within the given number of turns. (An alternative is to score based on the number of key pegs placed.) The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon number of games are played.

Other rules may be specified.

==Algorithms and strategies==
Before asking for a best strategy of the codebreaker one has to define what is the meaning of &quot;best&quot;: The minimal number of moves can be analyzed under the conditions of worst and average case and in the sense of a minimax value of a zero-sum game in game theory.

===Best strategies with four holes and six colors===
With four holes and six colors, there are 64 = 1,296 different patterns (allowing duplicate colors but not blanks).

====Worst case: Five-guess algorithm====

In 1977, Donald Knuth demonstrated that the codebreaker can solve the pattern in five moves or fewer, using an algorithm that progressively reduces the number of possible patterns.
Described using the numbers 1–6 to represent the six colors of the code pegs, the algorithm works as follows:

# Create the set of 1,296 possible codes {1111, 1112, ... 6665, 6666}.
# Start with initial guess 1122. (Knuth gives examples showing that this algorithm using first guesses other than &quot;two pair&quot;; such as 1111, 1112, 1123, or 1234; does not win in five tries on every code.)
# Play the guess to get a response of colored and white key pegs.
# If the response is four colored key pegs, the game is won, the algorithm terminates.
# Otherwise, remove from any code that would not give that response of colored and white pegs.
# The next guess is chosen by the minimax technique, which chooses a guess that has the least worst response score. In this case, a response to a guess is some number of colored and white key pegs, and the score of such a response is defined to be the number of codes in that are still possible even after the response is known. The score of a guess is pessimistically defined to be the worst (maximum) of all its response scores. From the set of guesses with the best (minimum) guess score, select one as the next guess, choosing a code from whenever possible. (Within these constraints, Knuth follows the convention of choosing the guess with the least numeric value; e.g., 2345 is lower than 3456. Knuth also gives an example showing that in some cases no code from will be among the best scoring guesses and thus the guess cannot win on the next turn, yet will be necessary to assure a win in five.)
# Repeat from step 3.

====Average case====
Subsequent mathematicians have been finding various algorithms that reduce the average number of turns needed to solve the pattern: in 1993, Kenji Koyama and Tony W. Lai performed an exhaustive depth-first search showing that the optimal method for solving a random code could achieve an average of 5,625/1,296 = 4.3403 turns to solve, with a worst-case scenario of six turns.

====Minimax value of game theory====
The minimax value in the sense of game theory is 5,600/1,290 = 4.3411. The minimax strategy of the codemaker consists in a uniformly distributed selection of one of the 1,290 patterns with two or more colors.

===Genetic algorithm===
A new algorithm with an embedded genetic algorithm, where a large set of eligible codes is collected throughout the different generations. The quality of each of these codes is determined based on a comparison with a selection of elements of the eligible set. This algorithm is based on a heuristic that assigns a score to each eligible combination based on its probability of actually being the hidden combination. Since this combination is not known, the score is based on characteristics of the set of eligible solutions or the sample of them found by the evolutionary algorithm.

The algorithm works as follows, with &quot;P&quot; = length of the solution used in the game, &quot;X&quot;1 = exact matches (&quot;red pins&quot;) and &quot;Y&quot;1 = 
near matches (&quot;white pins&quot;):
# Set &quot;i&quot; = 1
# Play fixed initial guess &quot;G&quot;1
# Get the response &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;Y&quot;1
# Repeat while &quot;Xi&quot; ≠ &quot;P&quot;:
## Increment &quot;i&quot;
## Set &quot;Ei&quot; = ∅ and &quot;h&quot; = 1
## Initialize population
## Repeat while &quot;h&quot; ≤ &quot;maxgen&quot; and |&quot;Ei&quot;| ≤ &quot;maxsize&quot;:
### Generate new population using crossover, mutation, inversion and permutation
### Calculate fitness
### Add eligible combinations to &quot;Ei&quot;
### Increment &quot;h&quot;
## Play guess &quot;Gi&quot; which belongs to &quot;Ei&quot;
## Get response &quot;Xi&quot; and &quot;Yi&quot;

===Complexity and the satisfiability problem===

In November 2004, Michiel de Bondt proved that solving a &quot;Mastermind&quot; board is an NP-complete problem when played with &quot;n&quot; pegs per row and two colors, by showing how to represent any one-in-three 3SAT problem in it. He also showed the same for &quot;Consistent Mastermind&quot; (playing the game so that every guess is a candidate for the secret code that is consistent with the hints in the previous guesses).

The &quot;Mastermind satisfiability problem&quot; is a decision problem that asks, &quot;Given a set of guesses and the number of colored and white key pegs scored for each guess, is there at least one secret pattern that generates those exact scores?&quot; (If not, then the codemaker must have incorrectly scored at least one guess.) In December 2005, Jeff Stuckman and Guo-Qiang Zhang showed in an arXiv article that the &quot;Mastermind satisfiability problem&quot; is NP-complete.

==Variations==
Varying the number of colors and the number of holes results in a spectrum of &quot;Mastermind&quot; games of different levels of difficulty. Another common variation is to support different numbers of players taking on the roles of codemaker and codebreaker. The following are some examples of &quot;Mastermind&quot; games produced by Invicta, Parker Brothers, Pressman, Hasbro, and other game manufacturers:


There was also a version called &quot;Super Code&quot; produced in East Germany by VEB Plasticart.

The difficulty level of any of the above can be increased by treating “empty” as an additional color or decreased by requiring only that the code&#x27;s colors be guessed, independent of position. In &quot;Mini Mastermind&quot; the colored code pegs are the same size and shape as the colored or white key pegs so the difficulty can be increased by permitting the key pegs to be used as code pegs for two additional colors.

Computer and Internet versions of the game have also been made, sometimes with variations in the number and type of pieces involved and often under different names to avoid trademark infringement. &quot;Mastermind&quot; can also be played with paper and pencil.
There is a numeral variety of the Mastermind in which a 4-digit number is guessed. The 2021 web game &quot;Wordle&quot; has been compared to &quot;Mastermind&quot;.

The game was included in the compilation party video game &quot;Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics&quot; for the Nintendo Switch under the name &quot;Hit &amp; Blow&quot;.

<text>Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor Sr. (December 1, 1940 – December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. Known for reaching a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most important stand-up comedians of all time. Pryor won a Primetime Emmy Award and five Grammy Awards. He received the first Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 1998. He won the Writers Guild of America Award in 1974. He was listed at number one on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.

Pryor&#x27;s body of work includes numerous concert films and recordings. He won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot; (1974), &quot;...Is It Something I Said?&quot; (1975), &quot;Bicentennial Nigger&quot; (1976), &quot;Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip&quot; (1982), and &quot;Richard Pryor: Here and Now&quot; (1983). He is also known for &quot;Richard Pryor: Live &amp; Smokin&#x27;&quot; (1971), &quot;&quot; (1978), and &quot;Richard Pryor: Live in Concert&quot; (1979). Pryor served as a co-writer for the Mel Brooks satirical western comedy film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974).

As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies. He gained acclaim for his collaborations with Gene Wilder, including the films &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980), &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; (1989), and &quot;Another You&quot; (1991). He also acted in films such as &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (1978), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989), and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997). He appeared as himself on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; before hosting &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot; (1977), and &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; (1984).

==Early life==
Pryor was born on December 1, 1940, in Peoria, Illinois. He grew up in a brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute. His father, LeRoy &quot;Buck Carter&quot; Pryor (June 7, 1915 – September 27, 1968), was a former boxer, hustler and pimp. After Gertrude abandoned him when he was 10, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie, a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities. Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother&#x27;s brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven, and expelled from school at the age of 14.

Pryor served in the U.S. Army from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile article about Pryor in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in West Germany. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of Douglas Sirk&#x27;s film &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although the soldier survived.

He was a member of Henry Brown Lodge No. 22 in Peoria, where he became a Prince Hall Freemason.

== Career ==
===1963–1969: Early performances===

In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as Bob Dylan and Woody Allen. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist Nina Simone at New York&#x27;s Village Gate. Simone recalls Pryor&#x27;s bout of performance anxiety:

Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a middlebrow comic, with material less controversial than what was to come. He began appearing regularly on television variety shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. His popularity led to success as a comic in Las Vegas. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD &quot;Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)&quot;, recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period. In 1966, Pryor was a guest star on an episode of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;.

In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography &quot;Pryor Convictions&quot; (1995) as an &quot;epiphany&quot;. He walked onto the stage at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas (with Dean Martin in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, &quot;What the fuck am I doing here!?&quot;, and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word &quot;nigger&quot;. His first comedy recording, the 1968 debut &quot;Richard Pryor&quot; on the Dove/Reprise label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor&#x27;s routine. His parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.

In 1969, Pryor moved to Berkeley, California, where he immersed himself in the counterculture and met people like Huey P. Newton and Ishmael Reed.

===1970–1979: Breakthrough and acclaim===

In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for television shows such as &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, and a 1973 Lily Tomlin special, for which he shared an Emmy Award. During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He appeared in several films, including &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (1972), &quot;The Mack&quot; (1973), &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;Car Wash&quot; (1976), &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot; (1976), &quot;Which Way Is Up?&quot; (1977), &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (1977), &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979).

Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label Laff Records in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, &quot;Craps (After Hours)&quot;. Two years later Pryor, still relatively unknown, appeared in the documentary &quot;Wattstax&quot; (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of race relations in Watts and the United States. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with Stax Records in 1973. When his third breakthrough album &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot; (1974) was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor&#x27;s recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor&#x27;s release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot; was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album at the 1975 Grammy Awards.
During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to Reprise/Warner Bros. Records, which re-released &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot;, immediately after &quot;...Is It Something I Said?&quot;, his first album with his new label. Like &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot;, the album was a critical success; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.

Pryor&#x27;s 1976 release &quot;Bicentennial Nigger&quot; continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 freebasing accident), Laff published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor&#x27;s growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor films, such as &quot;Are You Serious?&quot; for &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;The Wizard of Comedy&quot; for his appearance in &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), and &quot;Insane&quot; for &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980). Pryor co-wrote &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), directed by Mel Brooks and starring Gene Wilder. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but Mel Brooks didn&#x27;t want to share credit with the quickly-rising comic. Brooks has always maintained Warner Brothers&#x27; executives vetoed Pryor&#x27;s casting, but no studio executive has ever corroborated this claim. It was only after Pryor&#x27;s passing (in 2005), Brooks&#x27; began insisting the comic was &quot;uninsurable&quot; because of a &quot;drug arrest;&quot; but to-date, no studio executive (employed at Warner Brothers during this era), has ever gone on the record to corroborate Brooks&#x27; assertions—either the director&#x27;s vigorously advocating or the studio&#x27;s absolute rejection (for hiring Pryor to act in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;). According to director Michael Shultz, &quot;Richard wrote it and Mel Brooks chased him out,&quot; Shultz said at the time (during the film&#x27;s theatrical exhibition). &quot;Mel Brooks was trying to get total credit for the picture. . . . To be outmaneuvered and ripped off at that early stage in his career is something that&#x27;s a little hard for him to get over. I&#x27;d feel the same way.&quot; Moreover, Brooks assured Pryor the role of Sheriff Bart was his, but after Pryor departed the director&#x27;s writer&#x27;s suite, he never heard from Brooks again. In early-1972, Pryor was reportedly dumbfounded when he had to first learn from Cleavon Little that Mel Brooks wasn&#x27;t going to use him on-screen.
In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), making him the first black host. Pryor&#x27;s longtime girlfriend, actress and talk-show host Kathrine McKee (sister of Lonette McKee), made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on &quot;SNL&quot;. One of the highlights of the night was the controversial &quot;word association&quot; skit with Chevy Chase. He would later do his own variety show, &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot;, which premiered on NBC in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show&#x27;s controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. He later said, &quot;They offered me ten episodes, but I said all I wanted to in four.&quot; During the short-lived series, he portrayed the first black President of the United States, spoofed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Mos Eisley cantina, examined gun violence in a non-comedy skit, lampooned racism on the sinking &quot;Titanic&quot; and used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude. In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Kenya. Upon returning to the United States from Africa, Pryor swore he would never use the word &quot;nigger&quot; in his stand-up comedy routine again.

===1980–1989: Established career===
In 1980, Pryor became the first black actor to earn a million dollars for a single film when he was hired to star in &quot;Stir Crazy&quot;. On June 9, 1980, while on a freebasing binge during the making of the film, Pryor doused himself in rum and set himself on fire. Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show &quot;Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip&quot; (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and pasteurized milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, &quot;What&#x27;s that? Richard Pryor running down the street.&quot;

Before the freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by Gregory Hines. Likewise, Pryor was scheduled for an appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; at that time, which forced the producers to cast their British writer, Chris Langham, as the guest star for that episode instead. After his &quot;final performance&quot;, Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy for long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, &quot;Richard Pryor: Here and Now&quot; (1983), which he directed himself. He wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, &quot;Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling&quot;, which was inspired by the 1980 freebasing incident.

In 1983 Pryor signed a five-year contract with Columbia Pictures for $40 million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions. Softer, more formulaic films followed, including &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), which earned Pryor $4 million, &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985), &quot;Moving&quot; (1988), and &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor&#x27;s semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, &quot;Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling&quot;, which was not a major success. Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), before Eddie Murphy won the part. Despite his reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children&#x27;s show on CBS called &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; (1984). Like &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (where Pryor appeared in a few oft-repeated segments), &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; featured a cast of puppets (animated by Sid and Marty Krofft), hanging out and having fun in a friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. Its theme song was performed by Ray Parker Jr. &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; frequently dealt with more sobering issues than &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. It was cancelled shortly after its debut.
Pryor co-hosted the Academy Awards twice - the 49th Academy Awards in 1977 with Warren Beatty, Ellen Burstyn, and Jane Fonda and again at the 55th Academy Awards in 1983 alongside Liza Minnelli, Dudley Moore, and Walter Matthau. He was also nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series on the television series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is one of only three &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosts to be subjected to a five-second delay (along with Sam Kinison in 1986 and Andrew Dice Clay in 1990).

Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography &quot;Kiss Me Like a Stranger&quot;, co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of &quot;Stir Crazy&quot;, and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:
Pryor appeared in &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Redd Foxx).

===1990–2004: Later years and final works===
In his later years starting in the mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated mobility scooter due to multiple sclerosis (MS). He often said that MS stood for &quot;More Shit&quot;. He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.

Rhino Records remastered all of Pryor&#x27;s Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set &quot;... And It&#x27;s Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)&quot; (2000).

In December 1999, Pryor appeared in the cold open of an episode of &quot;The Norm Show&quot; entitled &quot;Norm vs. The Boxer&quot;. He played Mr. Johnson, an elderly man in a wheelchair who has lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself. This was his last television appearance.

In 2002, Pryor and Jennifer Lee Pryor, his wife and manager, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard&#x27;s blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire &quot;Craps (After Hours)&quot; album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release &quot;Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)&quot;.

== Influences ==
Pryor&#x27;s influences included Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Gleason, Red Skelton, Abbott and Costello, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, and Lenny Bruce.

==Personal life==
Pryor met actress Pam Grier through comedian Freddie Prinze. They began dating when they were both cast in &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (1977). Grier helped Pryor learn to read and tried to help him with his drug addiction. Pryor married another woman while dating Grier.

Pryor dated actress Margot Kidder during the filming of &quot;Some Kind of Hero&quot; (1982). Kidder stated that she &quot;fell in love with Pryor in two seconds flat&quot; after they first met.

=== Marriages and family ===
Pryor was married seven times to five women:

# Patricia Price, to whom he was married 1960–1961.
# Shelley Bonus, to whom he was married 1967–1969.
# Deborah McGuire, an aspiring model and actress whom he married on September 22, 1977. They dated on and off for four years prior to their marriage. They separated in January 1978, and their divorce was finalized in August 1978.
# Jennifer Lee, an actress and interior designer whom Pryor had hired to decorate his home. They married in August 1981, and divorced in October 1982 due to his drug addiction. They remarried on June 29, 2001, and remained married until Pryor&#x27;s death in 2005.
# Flynn Belaine, an aspiring actress whom he married in October 1986. They met when Pryor was performing in Washington, D.C., in 1984. Two months after they married, Pryor filed for divorce, but withdrew the petition the same day. A week later he filed for divorce again. Their divorce was finalized in July 1987. They remarried on April 1, 1990, but divorced again in July 1991.

 Children 

Pryor had seven children with six different women:
# Renee Pryor, born July 20, 1957; from Pryor&#x27;s girlfriend named Susan, when Pryor was 16.
# Richard Pryor Jr., born April 10, 1962; from Pryor&#x27;s first wife Patricia Price.
# Elizabeth Anne, born April 24, 1967; from Pryor&#x27;s girlfriend Maxine Anderson.
# Rain Pryor, born July 16, 1969; from Pryor&#x27;s second wife Shelley Bonus.
# Steven, born November 14, 1984; from Flynn Belaine, who later became Pryor&#x27;s fifth wife.
# Franklin, born April 29, 1987; from Pryor&#x27;s girlfriend Geraldine Mason.
# Kelsey, born October 25, 1987; from Pryor&#x27;s fifth wife Flynn Belaine.

=== Sexuality ===
Nine years after Pryor&#x27;s death, in 2014, the biographical book &quot;Becoming Richard Pryor&quot; by Scott Saul stated that Pryor &quot;acknowledged his bisexuality&quot; and, in 2018, Quincy Jones and Pryor&#x27;s widow Jennifer Lee stated that Pryor had a sexual relationship with actor Marlon Brando, and that Pryor was open with his friends about his bisexuality and the fact that he slept with men. Pryor&#x27;s daughter Rain later disputed the claim, to which Lee stated that Rain was in denial about her father&#x27;s bisexuality.

Lee later told the Hollywood entertainment television series &quot;TMZ on TV&quot; that, &quot;it was the &#x27;70s! Drugs were still good...If you did enough cocaine, you&#x27;d fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.&quot;

In his autobiography &quot;Pryor Convictions&quot;, Pryor talked about having a two-week relationship with Mitrasha, a trans woman, which he called &quot;two weeks of being gay&quot;.

In his first special, &quot;Live &amp; Smokin&#x27;&quot;, Pryor discusses performing fellatio. He also said in the special, and in 1977 at a gay rights show at the Hollywood Bowl, &quot;I have sucked a dick.&quot;

=== Substance abuse ===
Some sources (including Pryor himself) say that late in the evening of June 9, 1980, Pryor poured 151-proof rum all over himself and lit himself on fire. Other sources (including the Los Angeles police) say that what burned him that night was an explosion that happened while he was freebasing cocaine. While he was still burning, he ran down Parthenia Street from his Los Angeles home until he was subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital in Los Angeles. His daughter Rain stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced psychosis.

Pryor&#x27;s widow Jennifer Lee recalled when he began freebasing cocaine: &quot;After two weeks of watching him getting addicted to this stuff I moved out. It was clear the drug had moved in and it had become his lover and everything. I did not exist.&quot;

=== Health problems ===
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor had a mild heart attack at age 36. He recovered and resumed performing in January the following year. In 1986, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In 1990, Pryor had a second heart attack while in Australia. He underwent triple heart bypass surgery in 1991.

In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor&#x27;s wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor&#x27;s official website, citing Richard as saying: &quot;I&#x27;m sick of hearing this shit about me not talking ... not true ... I have good days, bad days ... but I still am a talkin&#x27; motherfucker!&quot;

== Death ==
On the morning of December 10, 2005, Pryor had a third and final heart attack at his house in Los Angeles. After his wife&#x27;s failed attempts to resuscitate him, he was taken to a local Westside hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:58 a.m. PST. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, &quot;At the end, there was a smile on his face.&quot;

He was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family. His ashes were scattered in the bay at Hana, Hawaii, by his widow in 2019. Forensic pathologist Michael Hunter believes Pryor&#x27;s fatal heart attack was caused by coronary artery disease that was at least partially brought about by years of tobacco smoking.

== Legacy ==

Jerry Seinfeld called Pryor &quot;the Picasso of our profession&quot; and Bob Newhart heralded Pryor as &quot;the seminal comedian of the last 50 years&quot;. Dave Chappelle said of Pryor, &quot;You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy.&quot; This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. As Bill Cosby reportedly once said, &quot;Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
In 1998, Pryor won the first Mark Twain Prize for American Humor from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because:
In 2004, Pryor was voted number one on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. In a 2005 British poll to find &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Pryor was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.

The animal rights organization PETA gives out an award in Pryor&#x27;s name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos. In 1999, he was awarded a Humanitarian Award by the group, and worked with them on campaigns against the treatment of birds by KFC.

Artist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it &quot;Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian&quot;. It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother. The unveiling was held Sunday, May 3, 2015.

In a Netflix special released in May 2022, &quot;The Hall: Honoring the Greats of Stand-Up&quot; inducted Richard Pryor into the National Comedy Center in
Jamestown, New York.

===Retrospectives===
In 2002, a television documentary entitled &quot;The Funny Life of Richard Pryor&quot; depicted Pryor&#x27;s life and career. Broadcast in the UK as part of the Channel 4 series &quot;Kings of Black Comedy&quot;, it was produced, directed and narrated by David Upshal and featured rare clips from Pryor&#x27;s 1960s stand-up appearances and films such as &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (1978), &quot;Richard Pryor: Live in Concert&quot; (1978), and &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980). Contributors included George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Whoopi Goldberg, Ice-T, Paul Mooney, Joan Rivers, and Lily Tomlin. The show tracked down the two cops who had rescued Pryor from his &quot;freebasing incident&quot;, former managers, and even school friends from Pryor&#x27;s home town of Peoria, Illinois. In the US, the show went out as part of the &quot;Heroes of Black Comedy&quot; series on Comedy Central, narrated by Don Cheadle.

A television documentary, &quot;Richard Pryor: I Ain&#x27;t Dead Yet,#*%$#@!!&quot; (2003) consisted of archival footage of Pryor&#x27;s performances and testimonials from fellow comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Denis Leary, Chris Rock, and Wanda Sykes, on Pryor&#x27;s influence on comedy.

On December 19, 2005, BET aired a Pryor special, titled &quot;The Funniest Man Dead or Alive&quot;. It included commentary from fellow comedians, and insight into his upbringing.

A retrospective of Pryor&#x27;s film work, concentrating on the 1970s, titled &quot;A Pryor Engagement&quot;, opened at Brooklyn Academy of Music Cinemas for a two-week run in February 2013. Several prolific comedians who have claimed Pryor as an influence include George Carlin, Dave Attell, Martin Lawrence, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Colin Quinn, Patrice O&#x27;Neal, Bill Hicks, Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart, Bill Burr, Joey Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Louis C.K., and Eddie Izzard.

On May 31, 2013, Showtime debuted the documentary &quot;Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic&quot; directed by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Marina Zenovich. The executive producers were Pryor&#x27;s widow Jennifer Lee Pryor and Roy Ackerman. Interviewees included Dave Chappelle, Whoopi Goldberg, Jesse Jackson, Quincy Jones, George Lopez, Bob Newhart, Richard Pryor Jr., Lily Tomlin, and Robin Williams.

On March 12, 2019, Paramount Network debuted the documentary &quot;I Am Richard Pryor&quot;, directed by Jesse James Miller. The film included appearances by Sandra Bernhard, Lily Tomlin, Mike Epps, Howie Mandel, and Pryor&#x27;s ex-wife, Jennifer Lee Pryor, among others. Jennifer Lee served as an executive producer on the film.

=== Portrayals ===
In the episode &quot;Taxes and Death or Get Him to the Sunset Strip&quot; (2012), the voice of Richard Pryor is played by Eddie Griffin in the satirical TV show &quot;Black Dynamite&quot;.

A planned biopic, entitled &quot;Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?&quot;, was being produced by Chris Rock and Adam Sandler. The film would have starred Marlon Wayans as the young Pryor. Other actors previously attached include Mike Epps and Eddie Murphy. The film would have been directed by Bill Condon and was still in development with no release date, as of February 2013.

The biopic remained in limbo, and went through several producers until it was announced in January 2014 that it was being backed by The Weinstein Company with Lee Daniels as director. It was further announced, in August 2014, that the biopic will have Oprah Winfrey as producer and will star Mike Epps as Pryor.

He is portrayed by Brandon Ford Green in Season 1 Episode 4 &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Dying Up Here&quot;.

In the &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot; episode &quot;George Carlin vs. Richard Pryor&quot;, Pryor was portrayed by American rapper Zeale.

With his rigorous treatment of quantum field theories, he promoted research on various aspects of modern mathematical physics.

== Biography ==
Arthur Wightman was born on March 30, 1922, in Rochester, in New York. He studied at the Yale University and in 1942 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics. In 1949 he received his doctorate at the Princeton University under the supervision of John Wheeler. He intended to graduate with Eugene Wigner, but he was spending most of his time at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the early 1950s, he started as a young instructor in the Princeton Physics department and later became the Thomas D. Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics, in 1971. He retired in 1992 as professor emeritus. In the years 1951–1952 and 1956–1957 he was a visiting researcher at the University of Copenhagen at the Niels Bohr Institute, where he worked in particular with Gunnar Källén and Lars Gårding. In 1957 he was at the University of Paris and in the years 1963–1964 and 1968–1969 at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques. Between 1977 and 1978 he was visiting professor at the in Paris and in 1982 at the University of Adelaide.

Wightman has been married twice. His first wife, Anna-Greta Larsson, was an artist and photographer and died early. They had a daughter, Robin, who also died prematurely. The second wife was the Bulgarian translator Ludmilla Popova Wightman. Wightman died on January 13, 2013, in Princeton, in New Jersey.

== Scientific career ==
Already during his undergraduate studies, Arthur Wightman had close contacts with the mathematics department in Princeton. Together with the mathematician John Tate, Wightman was engaged in the work on the Lorentz and Poincaré groups representations.

In the 1950s, he introduced his Wightman axioms as a mathematical foundation to relativistic quantum field theory. Quantum fields are treated as distributions in space-time. The Hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the Poincaré group under which the field operators transform covariantly. Wightman&#x27;s paper with D. Hall reported to a theorem that stated that the expectation value of the product of two fields, formula_1, could be analytically continued to all separations formula_2. Using this, Res Jost was able to derive the PCT and the spin-statistics theorems, as shown in Wightman&#x27;s and Streater&#x27;s book. Together with Eugene Wigner and Gian-Carlo Wick, he introduced superselection rules and studied the representations of commutator and anti-commutator algebras with the mathematician Lars Gårding.

== Honors and awards ==
In 1969 Arthur Wightman was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics for founding and contributing in developing axiomatic quantum field theory and in 1997 the Henri Poincaré Prize of the International Association of Mathematical Physics for his central role in the foundations of the general theory of quantum fields. Since 1964 he was a fellow of the American Physical Society, since 1966 of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and since 1970 of the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1962 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm. In 1976 he was Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer.

<doc id="231159" wikidata="Q804551" url="?curid=231159" title="Bloomsday">
<text>Bloomsday is a commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce, observed annually in Dublin and elsewhere on 16 June, the day his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes place on a Thursday in 1904, the date of his first sexual encounter with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle, and named after its protagonist Leopold Bloom.

== Name ==
The English compound word &quot;Bloomsday&quot; is usually used in Irish as well, though some publications call it &quot;Lá Bloom&quot; (Bloom&#x27;s Day, in Irish).

==First celebration==
The first mention of such a celebration is to be found in a letter by Joyce to Miss Weaver of 27 June 1924, which refers to &quot;a group of people who observe what they call Bloom&#x27;s day – 16 June&quot;.

On the 50th anniversary of the events in the novel, a Wednesday in 1954, John Ryan (artist, critic, publican and founder of &quot;Envoy&quot; magazine) and the novelist Brian O&#x27;Nolan organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the &quot;Ulysses&quot; route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce&#x27;s cousin, represented the family interest) and A. J. Leventhal (a lecturer in French at Trinity College Dublin). Ryan had engaged two horse-drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, in which in &quot;Ulysses&quot; Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to Paddy Dignam&#x27;s funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. Cronin stood in for Stephen Dedalus, O&#x27;Nolan for his father Simon Dedalus, Ryan for the journalist Martin Cunningham, and Leventhal, being Jewish, was recruited to fill (unknownst to him, according to Ryan) the role of Leopold Bloom. They planned to travel round the city through the day, starting at the Martello tower at Sandycove (where the novel begins), visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which in 1967 he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom&#x27;s front door), having rescued it from demolition. A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.

==Activities==

===Dublin===
Since 1994, the Bloomsday Festival has been celebrated in Dublin. The Bloomsday Festival is one-week long and is scheduled on the week of June 16th. The festival involves a range of cultural activities, including &quot;Ulysses&quot; readings and dramatisations, pub crawls and other events. Enthusiasts often dress in Edwardian costume to celebrate Bloomsday, and retrace Bloom&#x27;s route around Dublin via landmarks such as Davy Byrne&#x27;s pub. Hard-core devotees have even been known to hold marathon readings of the entire novel, some lasting up to 36 hours. The Bloomsday Festival is organised by the James Joyce Centre on behalf of the city of Dublin.

The James Joyce Tower and Museum at Sandycove, site of the opening chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, hosts many free activities around Bloomsday including theatrical performances, musical events, tours of the iconic tower and readings from Joyce&#x27;s masterpiece.
&quot;Every year hundreds of Dubliners dress as characters from the book ... as if to assert their willingness to become one with the text. It is quite impossible to imagine any other masterpiece of modernism having quite such an effect on the life of a city.&quot;

On Bloomsday 1982, the centenary year of Joyce&#x27;s birth, Irish state broadcaster RTÉ transmitted a continuous 30-hour dramatic performance of the entire text of &quot;Ulysses&quot; on radio.

A five-month-long festival, ReJoyce Dublin 2004, took place in Dublin between 1 April and 31 August 2004. On the Sunday before the 100th &quot;anniversary&quot; of the fictional events described in the book, 10,000 people in Dublin were treated to a free, open-air, full Irish breakfast on O&#x27;Connell Street consisting of sausages, rashers, toast, beans, and black and white puddings.

The 2006 Bloomsday festivities were cancelled, the day coinciding with the funeral of Charles Haughey.

===United Kingdom===

BBC Radio Four devoted most of its broadcasting on 16 June 2012, to a dramatisation of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, with additional comments from critic Mark Lawson talking to Joyce scholars. In the dramatisation, Molly Bloom was played by Niamh Cusack, Leopold Bloom by Henry Goodman, Stephen Daedalus by Andrew Scott, and the Narrator was Stephen Rea.

===United States===
Washington, D.C. – The Georgetown Neighborhood Library, located at 3260 R Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. held a marathon dramatic reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot; beginning 9 June and concluding on 16 June 2014 (Bloomsday). Twenty-five writers, actors, and scholars read &quot;Ulysses&quot; aloud in its entirety, a project which took more than 33 hours. The reading concluded with opera singer Laura Baxter performing Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy in its entirety, a feat taking hours by itself.

Philadelphia – The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is home to Joyce&#x27;s handwritten manuscript of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The museum first celebrated Bloomsday in 1992, with readings by actors and scholars at the Borders in Center City Philadelphia. The following June 16th, it began the tradition of closing the 2000-block of Delancey Street for a Bloomsday street festival. In addition to dozens of readers, often including Philadelphia&#x27;s mayor, singers from the Academy of Vocal Arts perform songs that are integral to the novel&#x27;s plot. Traditional Irish cuisine is provided by local Irish-themed pubs. In 2014, the Rosenbach&#x27;s Bloomsday festival went on the road, with two hours of readings at the main branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia, an hour of readings at Rittenhouse Square, and concluded with five hours of readings on the steps of the museum, at 2008–10 Delancey Street.

New York City has several events on Bloomsday including formal readings at Symphony Space and informal readings and music at the downtown Ulysses&#x27; Folk House pub. The Irish American Bar Association of New York celebrates Joyce&#x27;s contribution to the First Amendment, with an annual keynote speech named after John Quinn, the Irish-American lawyer who defended Joyce&#x27;s New York publishers in their obscenity trial in 1922. In 2014, New York celebrated Bloomsday with &quot;Bloomsday on Broadway,&quot; which includes famous actors reading excerpts of the books, and commentators explaining the work between segments. The 2016 celebration includes a juried competition for the Best Dressed Molly and Leopold Bloom, selected from among attendees by a blue-ribbon panel including image strategist Margaret Molloy several design figures.

Los Angeles, California – Each year Bloomsday is celebrated at the Hammer Museum with readings, music and libations.

Kansas City, Missouri – The Kansas City Irish Center currently hosts the Bloomsday celebration, started at the now closed Bloomsday Books in 1995. Usually a day long event, the center hosts readings, a documentary, a play, Irish dancers and a performance by Dublin balladeer Eddie Delahunt. This has been an annual event since its inception.

Syracuse, New York – The Syracuse James Joyce Club holds an annual Bloomsday celebration at Johnston&#x27;s BallyBay Pub, at which large portions of the book are either read aloud, or presented as dramatisations by costumed performers.

Cleveland, Ohio – The Nighttown Restaurant/Jazz Club holds an annual reading of the novel on Bloomsday.

Wichita, Kansas – Bloomsday is honoured by a presentation on James Joyce (often by Dr. Marguerite Regan) as well as readings from &quot;Ulysses&quot; and Irish folk music, sponsored by the Wichita Irish Cultural Association.

Norfolk, Virginia – The Irish American Society of Tidewater, Virginia, held a Bloomsday Happy Hour at Smartmouth Brewery, on Saturday, 14 June 2014. Live Irish music was provided by the band Glasgow Kiss, and IAS members attended dressed in Joycean accessories (fedoras, round glasses, eye patches, etc.).

Portland, Maine – Readings from &quot;Ulysses&quot; at the Maine Irish Heritage Center, corner of Gray and State Streets.

Portland, Oregon – Powell&#x27;s Books hosts a reading of the novel in its entirety for the duration of the day by authors, volunteers, and other Joyce lovers.

Worcester, Massachusetts – long running annual celebration with readings from Ulysses at 7 sites around the city. Organized annually by the Worcester County Poetry Association.

Tulsa, Oklahoma – The Oklahoma Center for the Humanities, Booksmart Tulsa, and the Guthrie Green began an annual Bloomsday Pub Crawl in the Brady Arts District of downtown Tulsa in 2014.

Phoenix, Arizona – the Irish Cultural Center and McClelland Library sponsor a weekend Annual Bloomin&#x27; Beerfest with live Irish music, a costume contest, and live readings.

Bethlehem, Pennsylvania - Sam Masotto (uncostumed) of Bonn Place Brewery celebrates Bloomsday by reciting sections from &quot;Ulysses&quot; behind the bar while onlookers look and drink and wonder &#x27;why&#x27; - June 16, 2022.

===Australia===
In Sydney, Bloomsday is hosted by the John Hume Institute for Global Irish Studies UNSW in association with the National Irish Association Sydney and the Consulate General of Ireland, Sydney.

Bloomsday in Melbourne has a proud history of engagement with the work of James Joyce. Since 1994, a committee of Joyceansnow known as &#x27;Bloomsday in Melbourne&#x27;has read and re-read Joyce and mounted theatrical events designed to communicate the joy of Joyce to its loyal patrons. In 2019 Bloomsday in Melbourne mounted a production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Travesties&quot; at fortyfivedownstairs in Melbourne. In 2020, Bloomsday in Melbourne created an online series of eighteen short films, corresponding to each of the episodes of &quot;Ulysses.&quot; The films featured well-known Australian actor Max Gillies. In 2021, Bloomsday in Melbourne announced that it was to present &quot;Love&#x27;s Bitter Mystery: the year that made James Joyce,&quot; as an &#x27;intense immersive theatrical experience&#x27; at Melbourne&#x27;s Villa Alba in Kew, Victoria. The play, written by Bloomsday in Melbourne&#x27;s Steve Carey, focuses on a key period in the young James Joyce&#x27;s life, between his first failed exile in Paris in 1902 and his departure for Europe in September 1904.

===New Zealand===
Bloomsday commenced in Auckland in the year 2000 with a radio transmission of &quot;Ulysses&quot; on Access Radio from midnight to 6am, 16 Junethe first Bloomsday celebration of the new millennium anywhere in the world. A cabaret show with Linn Lorkin and the Jews Brothers Band followed next year, 2001, and there has been a Jews Brothers Bloomsday ever since on 16 June, with Brooklyn musician Hershal Herscher as a Woody Allen Bloom and Dublin actor Brian Keagan reading from &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Currently this three-hour show is hosted by the Thirsty Dog, on Karangahape Road. Guest Molly Blooms have included New Zealanders Robyn Malcolm, Noelle McCarthy, Carmel McGlone, Lucy Lawless, Joe Carolan, Geraldine Brophy and Jennifer Ward-Lealand.

===Canada===
A five-day Bloomsday festival has been celebrated in Montreal since 2012 with readings, academic workshops, films, concerts and musical galas, cabarets, walking tours of Irish Montreal, Irish pub events, and guest lectures by internationally known Ulysses experts. Major partners include the Concordia School for Canadian Irish Studies, McGill University Continuing Education, The Jewish Public Library, Westmount and Atwater Libraries.

===Italy===
There have been many Bloomsday events in Trieste, where the first part of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was written. The Joyce Museum Trieste, opened on 16 June 2004, collects works by and about James Joyce, including secondary sources, with a special emphasis on his period in Trieste.

Since 2005 Bloomsday has been celebrated every year in Genoa, with a reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot; in Italian by volunteers (students, actors, teachers, scholars), starting at 0900 and finishing in the early hours of 17 June; the readings take place in 18 different places in the old town centre, one for each episode of the novel, and these places are selected for their resemblance to the original settings. Thus for example &quot;Telemachus&quot; has been read in a medieval tower or on a terrace overlookibg the port, &quot;Nestor&quot; in a classroom of the Faculty of Languages, &quot;Proteus&quot; in a bookshop on the waterfront, &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot; in the University Library, and &quot;Cyclops&quot; in an old pub. The Genoa Bloomsday is organised by the Faculty of Languages and the International Genoa Poetry Festival. 

===France===
The Paris Bloomsday Group (of Paris-based Irish Joyceans) performs texts and songs from the work of James Joyce in such Parisian venues as the Irish Embassy, the Centre Culturel Irlandais or the American Library in Paris. Performances are in English with brief forays into French, Italian, Latin and Greek.

===Czech Republic===
Bloomsday has been celebrated annually since 1993 in Prague. Fans of Ulysses meet just below the Strahov Monastery near a large grove containing what is now a frequently dried pond. A large historical protected oak tree (pamatný strom) is at one end of the grove and an unrelated cement monolith on the opposite. People meet every year at 11:50AM. A volunteer reads a section of Aeolus at the noon hour to the pealing of the Strahov monastery&#x27;s bells.

===Hungary===
Bloomsday has also been celebrated since 1994 in the Hungarian town of Szombathely, the fictional birthplace of Leopold Bloom&#x27;s father, Virág Rudolf, an emigrant Hungarian Jew. The event is usually centred on the Iseum – the remnants of an Isis temple there from Roman times – and the Blum-mansion, commemorated to Joyce since 1997, at 40–41 Fő square, which used to be the property of an actual Jewish family called Blum. Hungarian author László Najmányi in his 2007 novel, &quot;The Mystery of the Blum-mansion&quot; (A Blum-ház rejtélye) describes the results of his research on the connection between Joyce and the Blum family.

=== Latvia ===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic obstacles, &quot;Bloomsday Latvia&quot; initiative group organized a limited conference dedicated to the question whether should “Ulysses” be translated once again into Latvian (the first translation and publication of the book was in 1960). This was followed by a promenade through Riga Old Town where passages from &quot;Ulysses&quot; were read along the way which ended at the local Irish pub with further talks and Irish dances.

===Brazil===
Bloomsday has been celebrated in Brazil since 1967 when the first event took place in São Paulo, a year after it had first been translated into Portuguese by former diplomat Antônio Houaiss. Events have since spread to the cities of Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Florianópolis. The centenary of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was celebrated with the issuing of a commemorative stamp in Brazil on Bloomsday 2022.

===Global===
On Bloomsday 2011, &quot;@Ulysses&quot; was the stage for an experimental day-long tweeting of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Starting at 0800 (Dublin time) on Thursday 16 June 2011, the aim was to explore what would happen if &quot;Ulysses&quot; was recast 140 characters at a time. It was hoped that the event would become the first of a series.

==Literary references==
In 2004, Vintage Publishers issued &quot;Yes I said yes I will yes: A Celebration of James Joyce, Ulysses, and 100 Years of Bloomsday&quot;. It is one of the few monographs that details the increasing popularity of Bloomsday. The book&#x27;s title is the last line of the novel.

In 1956, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath were married by special licence of the Archbishop of Canterbury at St George the Martyr Church, Holborn, on 16 June, in honour of Bloomsday.

Pat Conroy&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;South of Broad&quot; has numerous references to Bloomsday. Leopold Bloom King is the narrator. The book&#x27;s first chapter describes the events of 16 June 1969 in Leo&#x27;s story.

In the novel by Enrique Vila-Matas &quot;Dublinesca&quot; (2010), part of the action takes place in Dublin for Bloomsday. The book&#x27;s main protagonist, Riba, a retired Spanish editor, moves to this city with several writer friends to officiate a &quot;funeral&quot; for the Gutenberg era.

American playwright Steven Dietz&#x27;s 2015 play, &quot;Bloomsday&quot;, features an American man returning to Dublin in search of a woman he met on a &quot;Ulysses&quot; tour years earlier. The play premiered at ACT Theatre in Seattle, WA. It received the 2016 Steinberg New Play Award Citation from the American Theatre Critics Association. It has been widely produced in the United States.

==Popular cultural references==
===In film and television===
In Mel Brooks&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;The Producers&quot;, Gene Wilder&#x27;s character is called Leo Bloom, an homage to Joyce&#x27;s character. In the 2005 film musical version, in the evening scene at the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, Leo asks, &quot;When will it be Bloom&#x27;s day?&quot;. However, in the earlier scene in which Bloom first meets Max Bialystock, the office wall calendar shows that the current day is 16 June, indicating that it is, in fact, Bloomsday.

Richard Linklater alludes to &quot;Ulysses&quot; in two of his films. In 1991&#x27;s &quot;Slacker&quot;, a character reads an excerpt from &quot;Ulysses&quot; after convincing his friends to dump a tent and a typewriter in a river as a response to a prior lover&#x27;s infidelity. The film also takes place over a 24-hour period. In 1995&#x27;s &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, events take place on 16 June.

A 2009 episode of the cartoon &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot;, featured the family&#x27;s trip to Dublin and Lisa&#x27;s reference to Bloomsday.

===In music===

Punk band Minutemen have a song on their 1984 &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; album entitled &quot;June 16th&quot;, which is named after Bloomsday.

U2&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;Breathe&quot; refers to events taking place on a fictitious 16 June. Dublin band Fontaines D.C.’s song “Bloomsday” from their 2022 album “Skinty Fia” also references the holiday. Native American alt-folk musician Samantha Crain released a single named after Bloomsday in 2021.

<text>Geomicrobiology is the scientific field at the intersection of geology and microbiology and is a major subfield of geobiology. It concerns the role of microbes on geological and geochemical processes and effects of minerals and metals to microbial growth, activity and survival. Such interactions occur in the geosphere (rocks, minerals, soils, and sediments), the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. Geomicrobiology studies microorganisms that are driving the Earth&#x27;s biogeochemical cycles, mediating mineral precipitation and dissolution, and sorbing and concentrating metals. The applications include for example bioremediation, mining, climate change mitigation and public drinking water supplies.

== Rocks and minerals ==
===Microbe-aquifer interactions===
Microorganisms are known to impact aquifers by modifying their rates of dissolution. In the karstic Edwards Aquifer, microbes colonizing the aquifer surfaces enhance the dissolution rates of the host rock.

In the oceanic crustal aquifer, the largest aquifer on Earth, microbial communities can impact ocean productivity, sea water chemistry as well as geochemical cycling throughout the geosphere. The mineral make-up of the rocks affects the composition and abundance of these subseafloor microbial communities present. Through bioremediation some microbes can aid in decontaminating freshwater resources in aquifers contaminated by waste products.

== Microbially precipitated minerals ==

Some bacteria use metal ions as their energy source. They convert (or chemically reduce) the dissolved metal ions from one electrical state to another. This reduction releases energy for the bacteria&#x27;s use, and, as a side product, serves to concentrate the metals into what ultimately become ore deposits. Biohydrometallurgy or &quot;in situ&quot; mining is where low-grade ores may be attacked by well-studied microbial processes under controlled conditions to extract metals. Certain iron, copper, uranium and even gold ores are thought to have formed as the result of microbe action.

Subsurface environments, like aquifers, are attractive locations when selecting repositories for nuclear waste, carbon dioxide (See carbon sequestration), or as artificial reservoirs for natural gas. Understanding microbial activity within the aquifer is important since it may interact with and effect the stability of the materials within the underground repository. Microbe-mineral interactions contribute to biofouling and microbially induced corrosion. Microbially induced corrosion of materials, such as carbon steel, have serious implications in the safe storage of radioactive waste within repositories and storage containers.

==Environmental remediation==
Microbes are being studied and used to degrade organic and even nuclear waste pollution (see Deinococcus radiodurans) and assist in environmental cleanup. An application of geomicrobiology is bioleaching, the use of microbes to extract metals from mine waste.

=== Soil and sediment: microbial remediation ===
Microbial remediation is used in soils to remove contaminants and pollutants. Microbes play a key role in many biogeochemistry cycles and can effect a variety of soil properties, such as biotransformation of mineral and metal speciation, toxicity, mobility, mineral precipitation, and mineral dissolution. Microbes play a role in the immobilization and detoxification of a variety of elements, such as metals, radionuclides, sulfur and phosphorus, in the soil. Thirteen metals are considered priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Se, Ag, Tl, Zn, Hg). Soils and sediment act as sinks for metals which originate from both natural sources through rocks and minerals as well as anthropogenic sources through agriculture, industry, mining, waste disposal, among others.

Many heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr), at low concentrations are essential micronutrients in the soil, however they can be toxic at higher concentrations. Heavy metals are added into soils through many anthropogenic sources such industry and/or fertilizers. Heavy metal interaction with microbes can increase or decrease the toxicity. Levels of chromium toxicity, mobility and bioavailability depend on oxidation states of chromium. Two of the most common chromium species are Cr(III) and Cr(VI). Cr(VI) is highly mobile, bioavailable and more toxic to flora and fauna, while Cr(III) is less toxic, more immobile and readily precipitates in soils with pH &gt;6. Utilizing microbes to facilitate the transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is an environmentally friendly, low cost bioremediation technique to help mitigate toxicity in the environment.

=== Acid mine drainage ===

Another application of geomicrobiology is bioleaching, the use of microbes to extract metals from mine waste. For example, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) produce H2S which precipitates metals as a metal sulfide. This process removed heavy metals from mine waste which is one of the major environmental issues associated with acid mine drainage (along with a low pH).
Bioremediation techniques are also used on contaminated surface water and ground water often associated with acid mine drainage. Studies have shown that the production of bicarbonate by microbes such as sulfate-reducing bacteria adds alkalinity to neutralize the acidity of the mine drainage waters. Hydrogen ions are consumed while bicarbonate is produced which leads to an increase in pH (decrease in acidity).

===Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons===

Microbes can affect the quality of oil and gas deposits through their metabolic processes. Microbes can influence the development of hydrocarbons by being present at the time of deposition of the source sediments or by dispersing through the rock column to colonize reservoir or source lithologies after the generation of hydrocarbons.

== Early Earth history and astrobiology ==

A common field of study within geomicrobiology is origin of life on earth or other planets. Various rock-water interactions, such as serpentinization and water radiolysis, are possible sources of metabolic energy to support chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities on Early Earth and on other planetary bodies such as Mars, Europa and Enceladus.

Interactions between microbes and sediment record some of the earliest evidence of life on earth. Information on the life during Archean Earth is recorded in bacterial fossils and stromatolites preserved in precipitated lithologies such as chert or carbonates. Additional evidence of early life on land around 3.5 billion years ago can be found in the Dresser Formation of Australia in a hot spring facies, indicating that some of Earth&#x27;s earliest life on land occurred in hot springs. Microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) are found throughout the geologic record up to 3.2 billion years old. They are formed by the interaction of microbial mats and physical sediment dynamics, and record paleoenvironmental data as well as providing evidence of early life. The paleoenvironments of early life on Earth also serve as models when searching for potential fossil life on Mars.

===Extremophiles===

Another area of investigation in geomicrobiology is the study of extremophile organisms, the microorganisms that thrive in environments normally considered hostile to life. Such environments may include extremely hot (hot springs or mid-ocean ridge black smoker) environments, extremely saline environments, or even space environments such as Martian soil or comets.

Observations and research in hyper-saline lagoon environments in Brazil and Australia as well as slightly saline, inland lake environments in NW China have shown that anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria may be directly involved in the formation of dolomite. This suggests the alteration and replacement of limestone sediments by dolomitization in ancient rocks was possibly aided by ancestors to these anaerobic bacteria.

In July 2019, a scientific study of Kidd Mine in Canada discovered sulfur-breathing organisms which live 7900 feet below the surface, and which breathe sulfur in order to survive. These organisms are also remarkable due to eating rocks such as pyrite as their regular food source.

<doc id="231167" wikidata="Q603836" url="?curid=231167" title="Arnulfo Arias">
<text>Arnulfo Arias Madrid (15 August 1901 – 10 August 1988) was a Panamanian politician, medical doctor, and writer who served as the President of Panama from 1940 to 1941, again from 1949 to 1951, and finally for 11 days in October 1968.

Throughout his adult life, he warned about the increasing influence of the military in Panamanian politics and vowed to reduce that. In turn, he was denied his presidential electoral success in 1948 by the military. He was removed from his duly-elected presidency thrice in military coups.

==Background==

Arnulfo Arias Madrid was born in Penonomé, Coclé Province, on 15 August 1901. He was the son of Antonio Arias and Carmen Madrid, and the brother of Harmodio Arias, who also served as the President of Panama for 13 days in January 1931 and again from 1932 to 1936.

Arias began his studies at the French Christian Brothership (today known as La Salle) in his native city and attended secondary school in New York City. He studied medicine and surgery at Harvard University and the University of Chicago. Later, he specialized in psychiatry, obstetrics and endocrinology.

==Political life==

In 1925, Arias returned to Panama and assumed leadership of the nationalistic organization Patriotic Communal Action. This organization tapped into a building current of discontent in Panama against the considerable influence the United States exerted on the country. It formed the nucleus of the present-day Panameñista Party. Panama had been, for all intents and purposes, a U.S. protectorate since the United States helped it gain its independence in 1903 from Colombia. Arias was branded a nationalist.

In 1931, Arias led a coup that deposed Liberal President Florencio Harmodio Arosemena. The following year, he helped his brother Harmodio Arias become president. He subsequently served in the cabinet and on diplomatic posts, including as Panama&#x27;s ambassador to Italy during Benito Mussolini&#x27;s reign. 
In 1940, he was elected president by an unprecedented majority as the candidate of the National Revolutionary Party (PNR, which became the Panameñista Party in the mid-1940s). Soon after taking office, Arias enacted a new constitution that granted women the right to vote for the first time. He was ousted in October 1941, in a coup engineered by the police. Arias was an outspoken nationalist. His service in Italy&#x27;s Mussolini era led some to claim he was pro-Axis. With war looming some Washington politicians were leery of Arias ruling Panama. Some historians feel Roosevelt supported his removal from the presidency. 

Arias consistently opposed the influence of the police in politics, labeling it as &quot;a cancer&quot; on the body politic. He ran for president once more in 1948 as the candidate of a coalition of his party and the Authentic Revolutionary Party and clearly won but was not allowed to be seated. However, a year later the National Assembly declared that he had actually won. He appointed his long time collaborator, Norberto Navarro, Minister of Public Works. Faced with growing interference by the police, Arias suspended the constitution and created government entities to counter the power of the police. But he failed to curb their power. In 1951 he was overthrown by Colonel José Remón Cantera, Panama City&#x27;s police chief, the nation did not have an army. Arias fled the country but remained widely popular among the masses. He ran in 1964, then won the 1968 elections as the standard-bearer of a five-party coalition.

Taking office in October, he sought to restructure the command of the National Guard. After only eleven days as president, he was ousted for the third time and undertook a midnight escape to the Canal Zone. Repeating mistakes which occurred in his previous administrations, Arias forgot to destroy records of his corruption and his opposition immediately capitalized. The Presidential Palace was attacked by Omar Torrijos&#x27; men. Arias, having seen his guards disappear and after receiving a call from the Costa Rican President José Joaquín Trejos Fernández, warning him that the border had been closed; he left the palace along with Hildebrando Nicosia, his chief of staff.

Nicosia called Michael J. Merry, his son-in-law and manager of a U.S. communications company, and asked him to pick up Arias and three ministers of state at a prearranged location. By that time, military patrols were searching the city for Arias. With the country&#x27;s leaders and an arsenal of automatic weapons in his vehicle, Merry drove through the military blockade to safety in the Panama Canal Zone, where the headquarters for the government in exile had been prepared.

Since the Canal Zone, an independent political entity, authorities would not allow the weapons to remain in its territory, Merry was forced to bluff his way back to Panama City, through the National Guard border blockade and patrols to safety. Arias and Nicosia later left the Canal Zone to Miami, Florida. His 93-year-old mother, however, was sleeping upstairs, but was unharmed and undisturbed, having taken her hearing aids out to sleep.

After the U.S. pressured military leader Omar Torrijos to liberalize his regime, Arias and Nicosia returned to Panama in 1978. While they were in exile, a small dissident group in Arias&#x27;s Panameñista Party joined the pro-Torrijos coalition, and took over the party&#x27;s registration. The majority of the party remained with Arias, renaming itself the &quot;Authentic Panameñista Party.&quot; It was renamed the &quot;Arnulfista Party&quot; in 1990, and in 2005 regained its old name, the Panameñista Party.

In 1984, the 83-year-old Arias ran again for president. His campaign was complicated by a book &quot;Holocaust in Panama&quot;, distributed by Noriega with help from the Israeli Mossad, that fraudulently claimed Arias had arranged a massacre of Jews in 1941. When exit polls showed Arias with a substantial lead, the government, now controlled by Manuel Noriega, halted the count and brazenly manipulated the results to declare that its favored candidate, Nicolás Ardito Barletta, had won by a mere 1,713 votes. Independent observers estimated that Arias would have won in a landslide had the election been conducted in a fair manner. As a result, Barletta was nicknamed &quot;Fraudito&quot;, portmanteau of &quot;fraud&quot; and his middle name, Ardito. Arias fled once again to Florida. It was the beginning of the Noriega military dictatorship.

==Death==

On the morning of 10 August 1988, Arnulfo died of a heart attack at his Coral Gables, Miami-Dade County, Florida home. His wife, Mireya Moscoso was at his side. His death caused national mourning in Panama. Following the transfer of his body to Panama City and an enormous funeral where his supporters protested against Noriega, Arias was buried in Jardin de Paz cemetery (Located in Parque Lefevre) on 15 August, the day of what would have been his 87th birthday.

After his death, Guillermo Endara became the leading opponent of the military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Despite defeating pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque by an overwhelming margin, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were badly beaten in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. Seven months later, the United States launched Operation Just Cause and Arias&#x27; party regained power shortly afterwards.

On 8 January 2012, 23 years after his death and in order to fulfill his last wish, his remains were exhumed and he was given a state funeral. He was re-buried in a mausoleum close to the Arias Madrid Family Museum, located in the town of Penonomé, Coclé Province, Panama. 
Currently, there are monuments, schools, and a township avenue bearing his name.

==Personal life==

Arias married to Ana Matilde Linares in 1927 and remained together until her death in 1955. In 1964, he married Mireya Moscoso. They remained together until his death. Moscoso later became the first woman President of Panama following the 1999 elections.

During his first marriage, he adopted a son named Gerardo Edilberto Arias (1929–2002).

<text>A mausoleum is an external free-standing building constructed as a monument enclosing the burial chamber of a deceased person or people. A mausoleum without the person&#x27;s remains is called a cenotaph. A mausoleum may be considered a type of tomb, or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum.

== Overview ==
The word &quot;mausoleum&quot; (from the ) derives from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (near modern-day Bodrum in Turkey), the grave of King Mausolus, the Persian satrap of Caria, whose large tomb was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Mausolea were historically, and still may be, large and impressive constructions for a deceased leader or other person of importance. However, smaller mausolea soon became popular with the gentry and nobility in many countries. In the Roman Empire, these were often in necropoles or along roadsides: the via Appia Antica retains the ruins of many private mausolea for kilometres outside Rome. When Christianity became dominant, mausolea were out of use.

Later, mausolea became particularly popular in Europe and its colonies during the early modern and modern periods. A single mausoleum may be permanently sealed. A mausoleum encloses a burial chamber either wholly above ground or within a burial vault below the superstructure. This contains the body or bodies, probably within sarcophagi or interment niches. Modern mausolea may also act as columbaria (a type of mausoleum for cremated remains) with additional cinerary urn niches. Mausolea may be located in a cemetery, a churchyard or on private land.

In the United States, the term may be used for a burial vault below a larger facility, such as a church. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, California, for example, has 6,000 sepulchral and cinerary urn spaces for interments in the lower level of the building. It is known as the &quot;crypt mausoleum&quot;. In Europe, these underground vaults are sometimes called crypts or catacombs.

A &quot;chapel mausoleum&quot; or &quot;mausoleum chapel&quot; in a cemetery can be used for closed-casket funeral services prior to interments.

<doc id="231169" wikidata="Q753852" url="?curid=231169" title="USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)">
<text>USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; (CVN-71) is the fourth , nuclear-powered, aircraft carrier in the United States Navy. She is named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States and a proponent of naval power. She is the fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his last name. Another three U.S. Navy ships have &quot;Roosevelt&quot; in their names in honor of members of the Roosevelt family. This carrier&#x27;s radio call sign is &quot;Rough Rider&quot;, the nickname of President Roosevelt&#x27;s volunteer cavalry unit during the Spanish–American War. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during the Gulf War in 1991. As of August, 2024, she is deployed with Carrier Air Wing 11 and Carrier Strike Group 9, which includes the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; (CG-70), and the &quot;Arleigh Burke-&quot;class destroyer&#x27;s USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; (DDG-56), USS Halsey (DDG-97), and the USS &quot;Daniel Inouye&quot; (DDG-118).

==Background==
Initially, President Gerald Ford cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carriers that were expected to operate V/STOL aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.

Authorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President Jimmy Carter vetoed the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy ship-building program. As a result of the Iran hostage crisis, which required the increased deployment of U.S. carrier battle groups to the Indian Ocean, President Carter reversed his stand on &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in &quot;lay-down&quot; areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together. Modular construction, made possible through the use of a huge gantry crane capable of lifting 900 tons, cut 16 months off &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;″s construction time, and the technique has been used on every aircraft carrier since. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and those &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class vessels completed after her have slight structural differences from the earlier carriers (, , and ) and improved protection for ordnance storage in her magazines.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;″s history began on 30 September 1980, when a contract was awarded for &quot;Hull 624D&quot; to Newport News Shipbuilding. Her keel was laid down on 31 October 1981, with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger initiating the first weld. On 3 November 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman announced that the carrier would be named for Theodore Roosevelt. The vessel&#x27;s Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) was formed in February 1984, with Captain Paul W. Parcells named as Commanding Officer. On 27 October 1984, the ship was officially christened by Mrs. Barbara Lehman, wife of Secretary Lehman. On 25 October 1986, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was commissioned to active service at Newport News.

==Service history==
===Maiden deployment===

After sea trials and pre-deployment workups, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; started her maiden deployment on 30 December 1988 with Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8) embarked. The ship patrolled the Mediterranean Sea prior to returning on 30 June 1989. She was awarded the 1989 Battle &quot;E&quot; from Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 20 March 1990.

===1990s===
On 28 December 1990, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-8 deployed for Operation Desert Shield, arriving in the Persian Gulf on 16 January 1991. With the commencement of Operation Desert Storm on 15 January 1991, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; began combat operations; eventually flying over 4,200 sorties, more than any other carrier, and dropping more than of ordnance before the cease-fire on 28 February.
When Iraqi forces turned on the Kurds, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-8 were among the first coalition forces in Operation Provide Comfort, flying patrols over northern Iraq. After a 189-day deployment, with 176 days at sea, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to Norfolk on 28 June 1991. On 14 February 1992, the ship won her second Battle &quot;E&quot;. This was followed by the award of the Battenberg Cup for 1991 as the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s premier ship.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; began her third deployment on 11 March 1993, again with CVW-8 embarked. Also embarked was a Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF), in a test of the concept of embarking a multi-purpose Marine force in a carrier. While the ship was still in the Virginia Capes operating area, President Bill Clinton flew aboard for several hours for his first visit to a U.S. Navy ship. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; operated in the Adriatic as CVW-8 planes enforced Operation Deny Flight in the U.S. no-fly zone over Bosnia. In June, on the way to only her second port visit, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was ordered instead to transit the Suez Canal en route to the Red Sea to participate in Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq. Deployed for 184 days, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; spent 169 days under way prior to return in September 1993. For the accomplishments of her crew, the ship received her second Meritorious Unit Commendation.

From November 1993 to April 1994, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; conducted a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY), completing ahead of schedule. On 10 March 1994, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; received her third Battle &quot;E&quot;. Then on 3 June, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was awarded her second Battenberg Cup as the best ship in the Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-8 began their fourth deployment in March 1995, operating in the Red Sea in support of Operation Southern Watch over Iraq, and Operations Deny Flight and Sharp Guard over the skies of Bosnia and in the Adriatic operating areas. Deny Flight evolved into Operation Deliberate Force, as CVW-8 aircraft led NATO strikes against strategic Bosnian Serb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Battle Group returned to Norfolk, Virginia in September 1995 and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for its Bosnia operations.

On 14 October 1996, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; collided with , a guided missile cruiser, while conducting operations off the coast of North Carolina. The incident occurred as the carrier, without prior warning, reversed her engines while &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was behind her and collided with the cruiser&#x27;s bow. There were no injuries reported, but &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; suffered more than $7 million damage to her stern, while damages to &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot;″s bow were assessed at $2 million.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; deployed for her fifth deployment on 25 November 1996, with CVW-3 embarked, in support of Operation Southern Watch in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. The ship returned from deployment in May 1997. On 8 July 1997, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; entered the Newport News Shipbuilding yard for a one-year Extended Drydock and Selected Restricted Availability (EDSRA), her first major overhaul since commissioning. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to her homeport of Norfolk Naval Station on 2 July 1998.
From 1 February to 4 March 1999 &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; participated in exercise JTFEX / TMDI99 along with the Brazilian Navy and several NATO navies. During the exercise, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was mock-sunk, along with eight other U.S. ships, many of which were the carrier&#x27;s escorts, by submarine HNLMS &quot;Walrus&quot; of the Royal Netherlands Navy.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; began her sixth deployment on 26 March 1999 with CVW-8 embarked. They were immediately called to duty in the Ionian Sea to support NATO&#x27;s Operation Allied Force. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-8 aircraft conducted airstrikes for two months over the skies of Kosovo against Serbian positions. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-8 were then dispatched to support Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the &quot;no-fly zone&quot; over Southern Iraq. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 September 1999.

===2000s===
On 10 January 2000, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; entered a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia for a six-month maintenance period.

After the September 11 attacks, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; began her seventh deployment on 19 September 2001 with Carrier Air Wing One (CVW-1). On 15 October 2001, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and CVW-1 entered the North Arabian Sea, joining the already-present &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; in conducting attacks against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. Between departing Norfolk on 19 September 2001 and arriving in Bahrain for a liberty call on 27 February 2002, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; spent 160 consecutive days at sea, breaking the record for the longest period underway since World War II. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to her homeport 27 March 2002 and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, 2001 Battenberg Cup, and 2001 Battle &quot;E&quot;. From April to October 2002, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; conducted a Planned Incremental Availability maintenance period at Norfolk Naval Ship Yard.
&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; got underway on 6 January for a scheduled month-long training period in the Puerto Rican Operating Area. Near the end of January, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; received orders to proceed across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea. Strike Fighter Squadron 201, based at Naval Air Station Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, was ordered to active duty as a unit of Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, the first Naval Reserve squadron to deploy aboard an aircraft carrier since the Korean War. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; arrived on station in the Eastern Mediterranean in February. On 22 March 2003 &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, along with , began launching air strikes into Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned home on 26 May and was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy Unit Citation, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.

On 19 February 2004, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; entered a ten-month Docked Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA) at NNSY in Portsmouth. Major systems overhauled included AC systems, Steam and CHT (sewage) systems, 1MC (announcing) systems, communication, navigation, and detection suites, weapons elevator overhauls, propeller replacement, hull cleaning and painting, and sea valve replacement. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; came out of dry-dock in August and completed the maintenance availability on 17 December 2004.
On 1 September 2005, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; deployed with CVW-8 embarked for a routine six-month mission to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), transiting the Suez Canal on 27 September and launching OIF missions beginning 6 October. This deployment was the last cruise for the F-14 Tomcat before its retirement in 2006. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; carried two Tomcat squadrons, VF-31 (Tomcatters) and VF-213 (Black Lions). &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to home port on 11 March 2006. Shortly after this cruise, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; earned the &quot;Jig Dog&quot; Ramage Carrier and Carrier Air Wing Operational Excellence Award, which is a Navy-wide award that is selected jointly by Type Commanders (TYCOM) and is presented to the Carrier/Air Wing team with the best performance as an integrated unit.

On 7 March 2007, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; began a nine-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) in Norfolk, which saw the addition of RAM-116 missiles among other upgrades. The ship returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 28 November 2007.

CVW-8 and &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 08-4 Operation Brimstone off the coast of North Carolina between 21 and 31 July 2008. The British aircraft carrier , the amphibious assault ship with associated units and the Brazilian frigate and the French submarine also participated in the event.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; left Norfolk on 8 September 2008 for a scheduled deployment to the Middle East with Carrier Air Wing Eight embarked. On 4 October 2008, the ship stopped at Cape Town, South Africa. This was the first visit to Cape Town by a nuclear-powered vessel since the German cargo ship &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; in the 1970s. Due to poor weather, approximately half of the ship&#x27;s crew was unable to go ashore on liberty. Much of the crew that made it ashore were unable to return to &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; due to the increasingly poor weather. The remaining crew was forced to remain on the pier till morning alongside the cruiser . The ship made four subsequent port stops in Jebel Ali, UAE, including one during the Christmas holiday. CVW-8 and CVN-71 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and flew more than 3,100 sorties and dropped more than 59,500 pounds of ordnance while providing close air support for ISAF-forces in Afghanistan.

On 21 March 2009, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was relieved by &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;. The carrier arrived at Norfolk on 18 April. On 26 August 2009 defense contractor Northrop Grumman was awarded a 2.4 billion dollar contract for Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; at its Newport News shipyard.

===2010s===

On 29 August 2013, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to Norfolk Naval Station, Virginia, completing its post-overhaul sea trials that concluded its four-year mid-life RCOH. On 14 September 2013, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; successfully completed flight deck certification which entailed completing a total of 160 carrier landings during daytime and night-time operations. Other certification drills included rigging the emergency barricade, flight deck firefighting evolutions, and crash and salvage operations. On 17 September 2013, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; completed her first underway replenishment in over four years.

Flight testing for the X-47B continued on board &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; on 10 November 2013. During this phase, the X-47B&#x27;s digitized carrier-controlled environment was tested which involved the interface between the unmanned aircraft and carrier personnel during launching, flight operations and recovery. The digital environment offered increased flexibility and enhanced safety for carrier operations.

On 15 January 2014, the Navy announced that &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;″s homeport would move to San Diego, replacing when she relocated to Japan sometime in 2015 as part of the US Navy&#x27;s preparation for the planned refueling of .

On 4 March 2015, during a training exercise off Florida, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was mock-sunk by the French Navy submarine .

On 11 March 2015,&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and Carrier Strike Group 12 departed Naval Station Norfolk for an around the world tour with deployments to the U.S. 5th, 6th and 7th Fleets as part the first deployment of Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) Carrier Strike Group, before arriving in their new homeport of San Diego, California.

On 20 April 2015, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, along with the cruiser , was deployed off the coast of Yemen to intercept suspected Iranian weapons shipments intended for Houthi rebels, who are engaged in a civil war with Yemeni government forces.

In early November 2015, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; along with the guided-missile destroyer , sailed to the South China Sea to assert freedom of navigation in the area claimed by China.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; pulled into her new home port at San Diego on 23 November 2015, completing a deployment during which she circumnavigated the globe. The carrier launched 1,800 sorties against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, totaling 10,618 flight hours and over one million pounds of ordnance employed through 1,085 guided munitions. Carrier Strike Group 12 traveled nearly during the deployment, which also marked aviation milestones including the first operational use of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and the last active-duty operational deployment of the HH-60H Rescue Hawk and SH-60F Seahawk helicopters.

On 6 October 2017, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; departed San Diego for her deployment to the United States Seventh Fleet and United States Fifth Fleet area of operations, accompanied with Carrier Strike Group 9 and Carrier Air Wing Seventeen. On November 8, 2017, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and her group started a 4-day exercise with two other carrier strike groups, led by carriers &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and &quot;Nimitz&quot;, in the Sea of Japan.

In May 2019, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; participated in Exercise Northern Edge 2019, marking the first time in a decade a carrier took part in the exercise. Also in 2019, Carrier Air Wing Eleven was transferred to the ship.

===2020s===
On 5 March 2020, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, along with the cruiser , arrived at Da Nang, Vietnam, for a five-day port visit commemorating the 25th anniversary of United States–Vietnam relations.

In July 2021 she was moved from San Diego, her usual homeport, to Bremerton, Washington, where she will be retrofitted to accommodate the F-35 multirole combat aircraft. A Navy spokesman said she will be in the Bremerton shipyard for 16 to 18 months. Approximately 3,000 sailors and their families moved to Bremerton with the ship. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; left Bremerton for sea trials in March 2023 and will eventually return to her previous homeport of San Diego.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; deployed in January 2024 from Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. On 19 March 2024, a F/A-18F Super Hornet from Carrier Air Wing 11 made the 250,000th successful arrested landing on her deck. In late-June 2024, she was ordered to the Middle East to relieve &quot;USS Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and to continue the U.S. presence in the region arriving there in July. 
In mid-July 2024, US Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Group 9 centred on USS Theodore Roosevelt along with Carrier Air Wing 11 and USS Daniel Inouye conducted an exercise with Indian Navy&#x27;s INS &quot;Aditya&quot; and INS &quot;Visakhapatnam&quot; in the Indian Ocean. She operated in conjunction with the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; from August until September 2024 before returning home on 14 October 2024 after 278 days on deployment.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
On 24 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, three sailors aboard the deployed vessel tested positive for COVID-19, a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Within a few days, that number climbed to dozens. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was reported to be the first ship in the U.S. Navy to have a COVID-19 outbreak while at sea; &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; docked at Guam on 27 March 2020.

By 31 March, the number of infected sailors was over 100, and the captain, Brett Crozier, pleaded for help from the Navy, sending an e-mail to ten Pacific Fleet admirals and captains, including his superior, the commander of Carrier Strike Group-9, and the commander of the Pacific Fleet, requesting that his ship be evacuated. The US Navy ordered the aircraft carrier evacuated with a skeleton crew of 400 to remain aboard the vessel to maintain the nuclear reactor, the fire-fighting equipment, and the ship&#x27;s galley.

On 2 April, acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to what he characterized as &quot;broad array of people&quot; rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier &quot;allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally&quot;. Crozier was to remain in the Navy and retain his rank. Several members of the House Armed Services Committee criticized the decision, stating that &quot;the dismissal of Captain Crozier at this critical moment, as the sailors aboard the U.S.S. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; are confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, is a reckless, political move that reeks of undue command influence.&quot; Captain Carlos A. Sardiello assumed temporary command of &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;; his second stint serving as the ship&#x27;s captain. Modly traveled to Guam and gave a ship-wide speech, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;tirade&quot;, during which he was heckled by some of the sailors. After demands from Congress that he be fired, Modly resigned on April 7.

As of Easter Sunday, April 12, 585 crew members had tested positive. The Navy and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are using the infection, death, and recovery data from &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; to study the pandemic. On 13 April, the hospitalized sailor, a chief petty officer, died.

As of 20 April, 4,069 sailors had been moved off the ship, 94% of the crew had been tested for the virus, yielding 678 positive and 3,904 negative results. As of 17 April, seven crew members were in the hospital including one in intensive care. About 60% of the people who tested positive did not have symptoms. As of 16 April, most of the ship had been cleaned. Sailors kept testing positive for the virus even after 14 days of isolation; some who tested positive had previously tested negative. The Navy temporarily suspended post-quarantine testing and extended the sailors&#x27; isolation, delaying plans to begin moves of the crew back to the carrier. Some sailors volunteered for antibody testing. Initial testing was completed by 27 April 2020, at which point, 969 crew members had tested positive, and 14 of those 969 had recovered.

By 29 April, sailors that were previously quarantined in Guam began moving back to the ship. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to sea on 21 May for the first time after being sidelined for two months due to COVID-19.

On 19 June 2020 the widely expected reinstatement of Captain Crozier was canceled and the promotion of the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; strike group commander was put on hold.

On 23 June 2020 and &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; completed a two-carrier operation in the Philippine Sea. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was returning to home port when another chief petty officer suffered a medical emergency, of which the nature was not disclosed, and died 2 July 2020.

In a 10 November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC highlighted this case among several others to detail the community benefit of masking, as the use of face coverings on-board was demonstrated to be associated with a 70% reduced risk of infection. Final analysis of the outbreak in December 2020, found 1271 crew members tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 and an additional 60 had suspected COVID-19 but did not test positive; 76.9% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic at testing. 55% developed symptoms.

<text>We TV (an abbreviation for Women’s Entertainment Television) is an American pay television channel owned by AMC Networks that is oriented mainly towards lifestyle and entertainment programming targeting women and African-Americans. It was originally launched on September 1, 1997 as Romance Classics, before adopting its current name on January 1, 2001.

, We TV is available to approximately 64,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2017 peak of 87,000,000 households.

==History==
===Relaunch and early years===
Romance Classics launched on September 1, 1997, under the ownership of what was then the Cablevision Systems Corporation-controlled Rainbow Media. It was originally a movie channel focusing mostly on romantic dramas and comedies, and television miniseries. Similar to the original format of AMC, the channel initially broadcast its films commercial-free. On January 1, 2001, the network was relaunched as WE: Women&#x27;s Entertainment, taking on an ad-supported general entertainment format. By 2006, the network&#x27;s name was shortened to WE tv.

WE&#x27;s programming would shift towards reality shows as the decade progressed. In addition to general fare (like &quot;Secret Lives of Women&quot;), the network became known for airing several shows related to weddings (such as &quot;Bridezillas&quot;, &quot;Big Easy Brides&quot; and &quot;My Fair Wedding with David Tutera&quot;). On August 18, 2009, Rainbow launched a sister network called Wedding Central; the channel would last less than two years before it was closed on July 1, 2011.

In January 2011, We TV confirmed that it had signed Toni Braxton for a reality series, entitled &quot;Braxton Family Values&quot;, which is marketed as one of the flagship shows. The network was given a new logo and branding ahead of the show&#x27;s launch, with the tagline &quot;Life As WE Know It&quot;.

In March 2012, the network ordered 14 episodes of &quot;Kendra on Top&quot;; a reality show following the lives of Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett, who previously appeared in the E! reality series &quot;Kendra&quot;. Kendra said the show focuses on &quot;motherhood, parenthood, and wife hood&quot;. &quot;Kendra On Top&quot; premiered on June 5, 2012.

===2014–present===

In June 2014, We TV unveiled a new logo; AMC Networks president Marc Juris explained that while We TV was to remain &quot;a leading destination for women on television and online&quot;, the goal of the new branding was to broaden the focus on the word &quot;we&quot; as representing shared experiences, describing it as &quot;a powerful and universal theme which drives connection, conversation, collaboration and community&quot;.

During this period, the network attempted a move into scripted series. &quot;The Divide&quot;, which was originally pitched for AMC, was cancelled after 1 season. Its second series, &quot;South of Hell&quot; premiered in its entirely on November 27, 2015 as a Black Friday programming stunt.

In 2018, We TV premiered &quot;Love After Lockup&quot;, a reality show following relationships formed by singles who had been recently released from prison. Benefitting from word of mouth via fans on social media, &quot;Love After Lockup&quot; was one of the fastest-growing, newly-launched reality series on cable that year, became We TV&#x27;s second-highest rated series among women 25–54 behind &quot;Marriage Boot Camp&quot;, while the show and its spinoff &quot;Life After Lockup&quot; helped make We TV the highest-rated cable network among African American women 25–54 on Friday nights in 2019.

In December 2020, Urban Movie Channel (now Allblk) head Brett Dismuke became the general manager of both We TV and UMC, with plans to increase the synergies between the two services amid internal consolidations at AMC Networks, and ratings successes at the channel among African American audiences.

<text>Jean Baudrillard (, ; ; – 6 March 2007) was a French sociologist and philosopher with an interest in cultural studies. He is best known for his analyses of media, contemporary culture, and technological communication, as well as his formulation of concepts such as hyperreality. Baudrillard wrote about diverse subjects, including consumerism, critique of economy, social history, aesthetics, Western foreign policy, and popular culture. Among his most well-known works are &quot;Seduction&quot; (1978), &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; (1981), , and &quot;The Gulf War Did Not Take Place&quot; (1991). His work is frequently associated with postmodernism and specifically post-structuralism. Nevertheless, Baudrillard had also opposed , and had distanced himself from postmodernism.

== Biography ==
Baudrillard was born in Reims, northeastern France, on 27 July 1929. His grandparents were farm workers and his father a gendarme. During high school (at the Lycée at Reims), he became aware of &#x27;pataphysics, a parody of the philosophy of science, via philosophy professor Emmanuel Peillet (1914-1973), which is said to be crucial for understanding Baudrillard&#x27;s later thought. He became the first of his family to attend university when he moved to Paris to attend the Sorbonne. There he studied German language and literature, which led him to begin teaching the subject at several different lycées, both Parisian and provincial, from 1960 until 1966.

=== Teaching career ===
While teaching, Baudrillard began to publish reviews of literature and translated the works of such authors as Peter Weiss, Bertolt Brecht, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Wilhelm Emil Mühlmann. While teaching German, Baudrillard began to transfer to sociology, eventually completing and publishing in 1968 his doctoral thesis &quot;Le Système des Objets&quot; (&quot;The System of Objects&quot;) under the dissertation committee of Henri Lefebvre, Roland Barthes, and Pierre Bourdieu. Subsequently, he began teaching Sociology at the Paris X Nanterre, a university campus just outside Paris which would become heavily involved in the uprising of May 1968. During this time, Baudrillard worked closely with Philosopher Humphrey De Battenburge, who described Baudrillard as a &quot;visionary&quot;. At Nanterre he took up a position as &quot;Maître Assistant&quot; (Assistant Professor), then (Associate Professor), eventually becoming a professor after completing his accreditation, (&quot;The Other by Himself&quot;).

In 1970, Baudrillard made the first of his many trips to the United States (Aspen, Colorado), and in 1973, the first of several trips to Kyoto, Japan. He was given his first camera in 1981 in Japan, which led to him becoming a photographer. In 1986, he moved to IRIS (Institut de Recherche et d&#x27;Information Socio-Économique) at the Université de Paris-IX Dauphine, where he spent the latter part of his teaching career. During this time he had begun to move away from sociology as a discipline (particularly in its &quot;classical&quot; form), and, after ceasing to teach , he rarely identified himself with any particular discipline, although he remained linked to academia. During the 1980s and 1990s his books had gained a wide audience, and in his last years he became, to an extent, an intellectual celebrity, being published often in the French- and popular press. He nonetheless continued supporting the Institut de Recherche sur l&#x27;Innovation Sociale at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and was &quot;Satrap&quot; at the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique. Baudrillard taught at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, and collaborated at the Canadian theory, culture, and technology review &quot;CTheory&quot;, where he was abundantly cited. He also purportedly participated in the &quot;International Journal of Baudrillard Studies&quot; (as of 2022 hosted on Bishop&#x27;s University domain) from its inception in 2004 until his death.

In 1999–2000, his photographs were exhibited at the Maison européenne de la photographie in Paris. In 2004, Baudrillard attended the major conference on his work, &quot;Baudrillard and the Arts&quot;, at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe, Germany.

=== Personal life ===

Baudrillard enjoyed baroque music; a favorite composer was Claudio Monteverdi. He also favored rock music such as &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. Baudrillard did his writing using &quot;his old typewriter, never at the computer&quot;. He has stated that a computer is not &quot;merely a handier and more complex kind of typewriter&quot;, and with a typewriter he has a &quot;physical relation to writing&quot;.

Baudrillard was married twice. He and his first wife Lucile Baudrillard had two children, Gilles and Anne. Not much is known about their relationship, or why they separated. In 1970, while working as a professor at the University of Paris-Nanterre, 41-year-old Baudrillard met 25-year-old Marine Dupuis, who had just come back from a sailing trip around the world with her then-boyfriend. In 1994, more than 20 years later, Jean and Marine got married. Marine went on to be a journalist and media artistic director. Diagnosed with cancer in 2005, Baudrillard battled the disease for two years from his apartment on Rue Sainte-Beuve, Paris, dying at the age of 77. Marine Baudrillard curates &quot;Cool Memories&quot;, an association of Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s friends.

== Key concepts ==

Baudrillard&#x27;s published work emerged as part of a generation of French thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jacques Lacan who all shared an interest in semiotics, and he is often seen as a part of the post-structuralist philosophical school.

James M. Russell in 2015 stated that &quot;In common with many post-structuralists, his arguments consistently draw upon the notion that signification and meaning are both only understandable in terms of how particular words or &#x27;signs&#x27; interrelate&quot;. Baudrillard thought, as do many post-structuralists, that meaning is brought about through &quot;systems&quot; of signs working together. Following on from the structuralist linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, Baudrillard argued that meaning (&quot;value&quot;) is created through &quot;difference&quot;—through what something is not (so &quot;dog&quot; means &quot;dog&quot; because it is not-&quot;cat&quot;, not-&quot;goat&quot;, not-&quot;tree&quot;, etc.). In fact, he viewed meaning as near enough self-referential: objects, images of objects, words and signs are situated in a web of meaning; one object&#x27;s meaning is only understandable through its relation to the system of other objects; for instance, one thing&#x27;s prestige relates to another&#x27;s mundanity.

From this starting point Baudrillard theorized broadly about human society based upon this kind of self-referentiality. His writing portrays societies always searching for a sense of meaning—or a &quot;total&quot; understanding of the world—that remains consistently elusive. In contrast to Post-structuralism (such as Michel Foucault), for whom the formations of knowledge emerge only as the result of relations of power, Baudrillard developed theories in which the excessive, fruitless search for total knowledge leads almost inevitably to a kind of delusion. In Baudrillard&#x27;s view, the (human) subject may try to understand the (non-human) object, but because the object can only be understood according to what it signifies (and because the process of signification immediately involves a web of other signs from which it is distinguished) this never produces the desired results. The subject is, rather, &quot;seduced&quot; (in the original Latin sense: ) by the object. He argued therefore that, in the final analysis, a complete understanding of the minutiae of human life is impossible, and when people are seduced into thinking otherwise they become drawn toward a &quot;simulated&quot; version of reality, or, to use one of his neologisms, a state of &quot;hyperreality&quot;. This is not to say that the world becomes unreal, but rather that the faster and more comprehensively societies begin to bring reality together into one supposedly coherent picture, the more insecure and unstable it looks and the more fearful societies become. Reality, in this sense, &quot;dies out.&quot;

Russell states that Baudrillard argues that &quot;in our present &#x27;global&#x27; society, technological communication has created an excessive proliferation of meaning. Because of this, meaning&#x27;s self-referentiality has prompted, not a &#x27;global village,&#x27; but a world where meaning has been obliterated&quot;
Accordingly, Baudrillard argued that the excess of signs and of meaning in late 20th century &quot;global&quot; society had caused (quite paradoxically) an effacement of reality. In this world neither liberal nor Marxist utopias are any longer believed in. We live, he argued, not in a &quot;global village&quot;, to use Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s phrase, but rather in a world that is ever more easily petrified by even the smallest event. Because the &quot;global&quot; world operates at the level of the exchange of signs and commodities, it becomes ever more blind to &quot;symbolic&quot; acts such as, for example, terrorism. In Baudrillard&#x27;s work the symbolic realm (which he develops a perspective on through the anthropological work of Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille) is seen as quite distinct from that of signs and signification. Signs can be exchanged like commodities; symbols, on the other hand, operate quite differently: they are exchanged, like gifts, sometimes violently as a form of potlatch. Baudrillard, particularly in his later work, saw the &quot;global&quot; society as without this &quot;symbolic&quot; element, and therefore symbolically (if not militarily) defenseless against acts such as the Rushdie Fatwa or, indeed, the September 11 terrorist attacks against the United States and its military and economic establishment.

=== Value criticism ===
In his early books, such as &quot;The System of Objects&quot;, &quot;For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, Baudrillard&#x27;s main focus is upon consumerism, and how different objects are consumed in different ways. At this time Baudrillard&#x27;s political outlook was loosely associated with Marxism (and Situationism), but in these books he differed from Karl Marx in one significant way. For Baudrillard, as for the situationists, it was consumption rather than production that was the main driver of capitalist society.

Baudrillard came to this conclusion by criticising Marx&#x27;s concept of &quot;use-value&quot;. Baudrillard thought that both Marx&#x27;s and Adam Smith&#x27;s economic thought accepted the idea of genuine needs relating to genuine uses too easily and too simply. Baudrillard argued, drawing from Georges Bataille, that needs are constructed, rather than innate. He stressed that all purchases, because they always signify something &quot;socially&quot;, have their fetishistic side. Objects always, drawing from Roland Barthes, &quot;say something&quot; about their users. And this was, for him, why consumption was and remains more important than production: because the &quot;ideological genesis of needs&quot; precedes the production of goods to meet those needs.

He wrote that there are four ways of an object obtaining value. The four value-making processes are:

# The functional value: an object&#x27;s instrumental purpose (use value). Example: a pen writes; a refrigerator cools.
# The exchange value: an object&#x27;s economic value. Example: One pen may be worth three pencils, while one refrigerator may be worth the salary earned by three months of work.
# The symbolic value: an object&#x27;s value assigned by a subject &quot;in relation to another subject&quot; (i.e., between a giver and receiver). Example: a pen might symbolize a student&#x27;s school graduation gift or a commencement speaker&#x27;s gift; or a diamond may be a symbol of publicly declared marital love.
# The sign value: an object&#x27;s value within a &quot;system&quot; of objects. Example: a particular pen may, while having no added functional benefit, signify prestige relative to another pen; a diamond ring may have no function at all, but may suggest particular social values, such as taste or class.

Baudrillard&#x27;s earlier books were attempts to argue that the first two of these values are not simply associated, but are disrupted by the third and, particularly, the fourth. Later, Baudrillard rejected Marxism totally (&quot;The Mirror of Production&quot; and &quot;Symbolic Exchange and Death&quot;). But the focus on the difference between sign value (which relates to commodity exchange) and symbolic value (which relates to Maussian gift exchange) remained in his work up until his death. Indeed, it came to play a more and more important role, particularly in his writings on world events.

=== &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; ===

As Baudrillard developed his work throughout the 1980s, he moved from economic theory to mediation and mass communication. Although retaining his interest in Saussurean semiotics and the logic of symbolic exchange (as influenced by anthropologist Marcel Mauss), Baudrillard turned his attention to the work of Marshall McLuhan, developing ideas about how the nature of social relations is determined by the forms of communication that a society employs. In so doing, Baudrillard progressed beyond both Saussure&#x27;s and Roland Barthes&#x27;s formal semiology to consider the implications of a historically understood version of structural semiology. According to Kornelije Kvas, &quot;Baudrillard rejects the structuralist principle of the equivalence of different forms of linguistic organization, the binary principle that contains oppositions such as: true-false, real-unreal, center-periphery. He denies any possibility of a (mimetic) duplication of reality; reality mediated through language becomes a game of signs. In his theoretical system all distinctions between the real and the fictional, between a copy and the original, disappear&quot;.

Simulation, Baudrillard claims, is the current stage of the simulacrum: all is composed of references with no referents, a hyperreality. Baudrillard argues that this is part of a historical progression. In the Renaissance, the dominant simulacrum was in the form of the counterfeit, where people or objects appear to stand for a real referent that does not exist (for instance, royalty, nobility, holiness, etc.). With the Industrial Revolution, the dominant simulacrum becomes the product, which can be propagated on an endless production line. In current times, the dominant simulacrum is the model, which by its nature already stands for endless reproducibility, and is itself already reproduced.

=== The end of history and meaning ===
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, one of Baudrillard&#x27;s most common themes was historicity, or, more specifically, how present-day societies use the notions of progress and modernity in their political choices. He argued, much like the political theorist Francis Fukuyama, that history had ended or &quot;vanished&quot; with the spread of globalization; but, unlike Fukuyama, Baudrillard averred that this end should not be understood as the culmination of history&#x27;s progress, but as the collapse of the very &quot;idea&quot; of historical progress. For Baudrillard, the end of the Cold War did not represent an ideological victory; rather, it signaled the disappearance of utopian visions shared between both the political Right and Left. Giving further evidence of his opposition toward Marxist visions of global communism and liberal visions of global civil society, Baudrillard contended that the ends they hoped for had always been illusions; indeed, as &quot;The Illusion of the End&quot; argues, he thought the idea of an end itself was nothing more than a misguided dream:

Within a society subject to and ruled by fast-paced electronic communication and global information networks the collapse of this façade was always going to be, he thought, inevitable. Employing a quasi-scientific vocabulary that attracted the ire of the physicist Alan Sokal, Baudrillard wrote that the speed society moved at had destabilized the linearity of history: &quot;we have the particle accelerator that has smashed the referential orbit of things once and for all.&quot;

Russell stated that this &quot;approach to history demonstrates Baudrillard&#x27;s affinities with the postmodern philosophy of Jean-François Lyotard&quot;, who argued that in the late 20th century there was no longer any room for &quot;metanarratives&quot;. (The triumph of a coming communism being one such metanarrative.) But, in addition to simply lamenting this collapse of history, Baudrillard also went beyond Lyotard and attempted to analyse how the idea of positive progress was being employed in spite of the notion&#x27;s declining validity. Baudrillard argued that although genuine belief in a universal endpoint of history, wherein all conflicts would find their resolution, had been deemed redundant, universality was still a notion used in world politics as an excuse for actions. Universal values which, according to him, no one any longer believed were universal and are still rhetorically employed to justify otherwise unjustifiable choices. The means, he wrote, are there even though the ends are no longer believed in, and are employed to hide the present&#x27;s harsh realities (or, as he would have put it, unrealities). &quot;In the Enlightenment, universalization was viewed as unlimited growth and forward progress. Today, by contrast, universalization is expressed as a forward &quot;escape&quot;.&quot; This involves the notion of &quot;escape velocity&quot; as outlined in &quot;The Illusion of the End&quot;, which in turn, results in the postmodern &quot;fallacy of escape velocity&quot; on which the postmodern mind and critical view cannot, by definition, ever truly break free from the all-encompassing &quot;self-referential&quot; sphere of discourse.

== Political commentary ==
=== On the Bosnian War ===
Baudrillard reacted to the West&#x27;s indifference to the Bosnian War in writings, mostly in essays in his column for &quot;Libération&quot;. More specifically, he expressed his view on Europe&#x27;s unwillingness to respond to &quot;aggression and genocide in Bosnia&quot;, in which &quot;New Europe&quot; revealed itself to be a &quot;sham.&quot; He criticized the Western media and intellectuals for their passivity, and for taking the role of bystanders, engaging in ineffective, hypocritical and self-serving action, and the public for its inability to distinguish &quot;simulacra&quot; from real world happenings, in which real death and destruction in Bosnia seemed unreal. He was determined in his columns to openly name the perpetrators, Serbs, and call their actions in Bosnia aggression and genocide.

Baudrillard heavily criticized Susan Sontag for directing a production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in war-torn Sarajevo during the siege.

===On the Persian Gulf War===
Baudrillard&#x27;s provocative 1991 book, &quot;The Gulf War Did Not Take Place&quot;, raised his public profile as an academic and political commentator. He argued that the first Gulf War was the inverse of the Clausewitzian formula: not &quot;the continuation of politics by other means&quot;, but &quot;the continuation of the absence of politics by other means.&quot; Accordingly, Saddam Hussein was not fighting the Coalition, but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power. The Coalition fighting the Iraqi military was merely dropping 10,000 tonnes of bombs daily, as if proving to themselves that there was an enemy to fight. So, too, were the Western media complicit, presenting the war in real time, by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led Coalition and the Iraqi government were actually fighting, but, such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity (the Iraqi Air Force). His power was not weakened, evinced by his easy suppression of the 1991 internal uprisings that followed afterwards. Over all, little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated, the &quot;victors&quot; were not victorious, and thus there was no war—i.e., the Gulf War did not occur.

The book was originally a series of articles in the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, published in three parts: &quot;The Gulf War Will Not Take Place,&quot; published during the American military and rhetorical buildup; &quot;The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place,&quot; published during military action; and &quot;The Gulf War Did Not Take Place&quot; published afterwards.

Some critics, like Christopher Norris accused Baudrillard of instant revisionism; a denial of the physical action of the conflict (which was related to his denial of reality in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian subjective idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin, in his book &quot;Baudrillard and the Media&quot;, have argued that Baudrillard was more concerned with the West&#x27;s technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened, but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral &quot;atrocity masquerading as a war&quot;. Merrin viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillard&#x27;s own words:

===On the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001===
In his essay, &quot;The Spirit of Terrorism&quot;, Baudrillard characterises the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Center in New York City as the &quot;absolute event&quot;. Baudrillard contrasts the &quot;absolute event&quot; of 11 September 2001 with &quot;global events&quot;, such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and World Cup. The essay culminates in Baudrillard regarding the U.S.-led Gulf War as a &quot;non-event&quot;, or an &quot;event that did not happen&quot;. Seeking to understand them as a reaction to the technological and political expansion of capitalist globalization, rather than as a war of religiously based or warfare, he described the absolute event and its consequences as follows:

In accordance with his theory of society, Baudrillard portrayed the attacks as a symbolic reaction to the inexorable rise of a world based on commodity exchange.

Baudrillard&#x27;s stance on the 11 September 2001 attacks was criticised on two counts. Richard Wolin (in &quot;The Seduction of Unreason&quot;) forcefully accused Baudrillard and Slavoj Žižek of all but celebrating the terrorist attacks, essentially claiming that the United States received what it deserved. Žižek, however, countered that accusation to Wolin&#x27;s analysis as a form of intellectual barbarism in the journal &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot;, saying that Wolin failed to see the difference between fantasising about an event and stating that one is deserving of that event. Merrin (in &quot;Baudrillard and the Media&quot;) argued that Baudrillard&#x27;s position affords the terrorists a type of moral superiority. In the journal &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, Merrin further noted that Baudrillard gives the symbolic facets of society unfair privilege above semiotic concerns. Second, authors questioned whether the attacks were unavoidable. Bruno Latour, in &quot;Critical Inquiry,&quot; argued that Baudrillard believed that their destruction was forced by the society that created them, alluding to the notion that the Towers were &quot;brought down by their own weight.&quot; In Latour&#x27;s view, this was because Baudrillard conceived only of society in terms of a symbolic and semiotic dualism.

===Debate with Jacques Derrida===
19 February 2003, with the 2003 invasion of Iraq impending, moderated a debate entitled &quot;Pourquoi La Guerre Aujourd&#x27;hui?&quot; between Baudrillard and Jacques Derrida, co-hosted by &quot;Major&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Studies in Psychoanalysis&quot; and &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;. The debate discussed the relation between terrorist attacks and the invasion. &quot;Where Baudrillard situates 9/11 as the primary motivating force&quot; behind the Iraq War, whereas &quot;Derrida argues that the Iraq War was planned long before 9/11, and that 9/11 plays a secondary role&quot;.

===&quot;The Agony of Power&quot;===

During 2005, Baudrillard wrote three short pieces and gave a brief magazine interview, all treating similar ideas; following his death in 2007, the four pieces were collected and published posthumously as &quot;The Agony of Power&quot;, a polemic against power itself. The first piece, &quot;From Domination to Hegemony&quot;, contrasts its two subjects, modes of power; domination stands for historical, traditional power relations, while hegemony stands for modern, more sophisticated power relations as realized by states and businesses. Baudrillard decried the &quot;cynicism&quot; with which contemporary businesses openly state their business models. For example, he cited French television channel TF1 executive Patrick Le Lay who stated that his business&#x27; job was &quot;to help Coca-Cola sell its products.&quot; Baudrillard lamented that such honesty pre-empted and thus robbed the Left of its traditional role of critiquing governments and businesses: &quot;In fact, Le Lay takes away the only power we had left. He steals our denunciation.&quot; Consequently, Baudrillard stated that &quot;power itself must be abolished—and not solely in the refusal to be dominated [...] but also, just as violently, in the refusal to dominate.&quot;

The latter pieces included further analysis of the 11 September terrorist attacks, using the metaphor of the Native American potlatch to describe both American and Muslim societies, specifically the American state versus the hijackers. In the piece&#x27;s context, &quot;potlatch&quot; referred not to the gift-giving aspect of the ritual, but rather its wealth-destroying aspect: &quot;The terrorists&#x27; potlatch against the West is their own death. Our potlatch is indignity, immodesty, obscenity, degradation and abjection.&quot; This criticism of the West carried notes of Baudrillard&#x27;s simulacrum, the above cynicism of business, and contrast between Muslim and Western societies:We [the West] throw this indifference and abjection at others like a challenge: the challenge to defile themselves in return, to deny their values, to strip naked, confess, admit—to respond to a nihilism equal to our own.

==Reception==
Jean-François Lyotard&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Économie Libidinale&quot; criticised Baudrillard&#x27;s work.

Lotringer notes that Gilles Deleuze, &quot;otherwise known for his generosity&quot;, &quot;made it known around Paris&quot; that he saw Baudrillard as &quot;the shame of the profession&quot; after Baudrillard published his views on Foucault&#x27;s works.

Sontag, responding to Baudrillard&#x27;s comments on her reactions to the Bosnian war, described him as &quot;ignorant and cynical&quot; and &quot;a political idiot&quot;.

James M. Russell in 2015 wrote that &quot;The most severe&quot; of Baudrillard&#x27;s &quot;critics accuse him of being a purveyor of a form of reality-denying irrationalism&quot;.
One of Baudrillard&#x27;s editors, critical theory professor Mark Poster, remarked:

But Poster still argued for his contemporary relevance; he also attempted to refute the most extreme of Baudrillard&#x27;s critics:

Christopher Norris&#x27;s &quot;Uncritical Theory: Postmodernism, Intellectuals and the Gulf War&quot;, to Russell, &quot;seeks to reject his media theory and position on &quot;the real&quot; out of hand&quot;.

Frankfurt school critical theorist Douglas Kellner&#x27;s &quot;Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond&quot;—seeks rather to analyse Baudrillard&#x27;s relation to postmodernism (a concept with which Baudrillard has had a continued, if uneasy and rarely explicit, relationship) and to present a Marxist counter. Regarding the former, William Merrin (discussed above) published more than one denunciation of Norris&#x27; position. The latter Baudrillard himself characterised as reductive.

Kellner stated that &quot;it is difficult to decide whether Baudrillard is best read as science fiction and pataphysics, or as philosophy, social theory, and cultural metaphysics, and whether his post-1970s work should be read under the sign of truth or fiction.&quot; To Kellner, Baudrillard during and after the 1970s &quot;falls prey to a technological determinism and semiological idealism which posits an autonomous technology&quot;.

In 1991, writing for &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot;, Vivian Sobchack alleged that &quot;The man [Baudrillard] is really dangerous&quot; for lacking &quot;moral gaze&quot;, while J. G. Ballard (whose novel Baudrillard had written on) commented in his &quot;Response to an Invitation to Respond&quot; excluded Baudrillard from his criticism towards the journal and its endeavour at large.

Sara Ahmed in 1996 remarked that Baudrillard&#x27;s was culpable of &quot;celebrating [...] is precisely women&#x27;s status as signs and commodities circulated by and for male spectators and consumers&quot;. Kellner described as an &quot;affront to feminism&quot;.

Art critic Adrian Searle in 1998 described Baudrillard&#x27;s photography as &quot;wistful, elegiac and oddly haunting&quot;, like &quot;movie stills of unregarded moments&quot;.

One of the most commonly cited critiques of Baudrillard was written in 2013 from academic writer Andrew Robinson of Ceasefire magazine, who declares Baudrillard&#x27;s work as both sexist and racist, while also containing ableist undertones, stating: &quot;Many of his [Baudrillard&#x27;s] formulations are inadvertently sexist and racist. There are also times when Baudrillard comes across as ableist in his critiques of the therapeutic.&quot; Additionally, Robison critiques the philosophy of Baudrillard as exaggeratory. Although Robinson provides a critique of Baudrillard&#x27;s theory, he also describes the value of said theory. Specifically, Robinson states, &quot;Baudrillard’s theory also helps to explain why his appropriation by leftists has been strategically unsuccessful.&quot; Robinson also describes the value of the simulacra in relation to media critique, especially in the US media. 

=== Tone and attitude ===
Mark Fisher pointed out that Baudrillard &quot;is condemned, sometimes lionised, as the melancholic observer of a departed reality&quot;, asserting that Baudrillard &quot;was certainly melancholic&quot;. Poster stated that &quot;As the politics of the sixties receded so did Baudrillard&#x27;s radicalism: from a position of firm leftism he gradually moved to one of bleak fatalism&quot;, a view Felix Guattari echoed. Richard G. Smith, David B. Clarke and Marcus A. Doel instead consider Baudrillard &quot;an extreme optimist&quot;. In an exchange between critical theorist McKenzie Wark and EGS professor Geert Lovink, Wark remarked of Baudrillard that &quot;Everything he wrote was marked by a radical sadness and yet invariably expressed in the happiest of forms.&quot; Baudrillard himself stated &quot;we have to fight against charges of unreality, lack of responsibility, nihilism, and despair&quot;. Chris Turner&#x27;s English translation of Baudrillard&#x27;s &quot;Cool Memories: 1980–1985&quot; writes, &quot;I accuse myself of[...] being profoundly carnal and melancholy [...] AMEN &quot;.

David Macey saw &quot;extraordinary arrogance&quot; in Baudrillard&#x27;s take on Foucault. Sontag found Baudrillard &#x27;condescending&#x27;.

Russell wrote that &quot;Baudrillard&#x27;s writing, and his uncompromising – even arrogant – stance, have led to fierce criticism which in contemporary social scholarship can only be compared to the criticism received by Jacques Lacan.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==
Native American Anishinaabe writer Gerald Vizenor made extensive use of Baudrillard&#x27;s concepts of simulation in his critical work.

=== In popular culture ===

The Wachowskis said that Baudrillard influenced &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), and Neo hides money and disks containing information in &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;. Adam Gopnik wondered whether Baudrillard, who had not embraced the movie, was &quot;thinking of suing for a screen credit,&quot; but Baudrillard himself disclaimed any connection to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, calling it at best a misreading of his ideas.

Some reviewers have noted that Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; seems inspired by Baudrillard&#x27;s &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;.

The album &quot;Why Hasn&#x27;t Everything Already Disappeared?&quot; by rock band Deerhunter was influenced by Baudrillard&#x27;s essay of the same name.

=== In technology ===
Cody Wilson, the developer of the first 3D-printed gun, credits the work of Baudrillard as his theoretical inspiration, and claims him as his &quot;master.&quot;

<text>Wat Tyler (4 January 1341 (disputed) – 15 June 1381) was a leader of the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt in England. He led a group of rebels from Canterbury to London to oppose the collection of a poll tax and to demand economic and social reforms. While the brief rebellion enjoyed early success, Tyler was killed by officers loyal to King Richard II during negotiations at Smithfield, London.

==Early life==
Little is known of Wat Tyler&#x27;s early life. Historical sources give differing accounts of his birth. One claims that he was born on 4 January 1341, while another source claims he was born around 1320. Most historians agree that he was born around 1341. He was fascinated by John Ball, his group having broken the radical priest out of jail. He was probably born in Kent or Essex. “Wat” may have been his given name (derived from the Old English name &quot;Watt)&quot;, or a diminutive form of the name &quot;Walter&quot;; his original surname was unknown. It is thought that the name &quot;Tyler&quot; came from his occupation as a roof tiler, but this is not confirmed. Prior to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, it is probable that he lived in Kent or Essex; he has variously been represented as coming from Dartford and Maidstone in Kent, from Deptford, which was in Kent at the time, and from Colchester in Essex.

==Peasants&#x27; Revolt==
The Peasants&#x27; Revolt began in May 1381, triggered by a recently imposed poll tax of 4 pence from every adult, whether peasant or wealthy. The revolt was not only about money, as the peasants also sought increased liberty and other social reforms. They demanded that each labourer be allowed to work for the employer of his choice and sought an end to serfdom and other rigid social demarcation. There were uprisings across England, with much of the unrest focused on Essex and Kent. The uprising was opposed by a significant part of English society in those regions, including nobility and wealthy religious establishments. Many peasants and labourers were inspired by the teachings of John Ball, a radical priest who preached that all humans should be treated equally, as descendants of Adam and Eve, and who asked: &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span/Who was then the gentleman?&quot;

How Tyler became involved with the revolt is unknown, although a much later 16th-century source indicates that a man of a similar name, John Tyler, was its initiator. This account suggests that a poll-tax collector had indecently assaulted John Tyler&#x27;s daughter. It is suggested the poll tax collector &quot;pulled up his daughter&#x27;s clothes to see if she arrived at the age of puberty&quot;. In revenge he killed the miscreant and triggered the insurgency. According to article &quot;Boys of English History&quot; from The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper (1879), Tyler &quot;slew the wretch with his hammer,&quot; presumably a tool used in his trade, after the tax collector &quot;vilely insulted the maiden.&quot; Regardless of the basis of that story, by June 1381, when groups of rebels from across the country began a coordinated assault on London, Wat Tyler had emerged as a leader of the Kentish forces.

On 13 June, Tyler with other rebels of Kent crossed London Bridge to enter the city, as Stow recorded in his Summary and Annals. Once in the city, they attacked civil targets, destroying legal records, opening prisons, sacking homes, and killing individuals they thought were associated with the royal government. In response, the king, Richard II (then 14 years old), met with the rebels on 14 June 1381 and agreed to make many concessions and to give full pardons to all those involved in the rebellion. While some of the rebels were satisfied by the king&#x27;s promises and dispersed, Tyler and his followers were not.

==Death==

On 15 June 1381, Tyler and his Kentish forces met King Richard at Smithfield, outside London. There, Tyler spoke personally with the king and put forward his demands. At first, the meeting seems to have gone well, with Tyler treating the king in a friendly, if overly familiar, manner, and Richard agreeing the rebels &quot;should have all that he could fairly grant&quot;. 

However, tensions quickly rose. According to a contemporary chronicler, Tyler acted contemptuously, calling for a flagon of water to rinse his mouth &quot;because of the great heat that he was in&quot; and when he received the water &quot;he rinsed his mouth in a very rude and disgusting fashion before the King&#x27;s face&quot;. Sir John Newton (a servant of the king) insulted Tyler by calling him &quot;the greatest thief and robber in all of Kent&quot;. Tyler attacked Newton, but was restrained and arrested by the Lord Mayor of London, William Walworth. Tyler then attempted to stab the mayor, who was saved by his armour. Walworth slashed Tyler across the neck and head with his sword, and another of the king&#x27;s servants, possibly Ralph de Standish, stabbed Tyler again, severely wounding him. Tyler managed to ride thirty yards before he fell from his horse.

In the disorder that followed, he was taken to a hospital for the poor, but was tracked down by the mayor, brought back to Smithfield and by judgment of the mayor publicly beheaded. Tyler&#x27;s head was placed atop a pole and carried through the city, then displayed on London Bridge. In the wake of their leader&#x27;s death, his followers were driven from London and the movement was shattered. Subsequently, Richard II revoked all the concessions he had made to the rebels and many were hunted down and executed. That effectively ended the revolt.

==In literature and the arts==
John Gower commented on Wat Tyler in his 14th-century poem &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot;: &quot;The jay&#x27;s voice is wild and he has only learnt the art of speaking from the classes with whom the Latin poet is identified.&quot; A number of works in the post-medieval period have featured Wat Tyler as protagonist. Tyler was the protagonist of the play &quot;Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, or, The Mob Reformers&quot; (1730) first performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1730. Wat Tyler is represented in Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;Wat Tyler, A Dramatic Poem&quot;, which was written in 1794 but not published until 1813.

The first novel to feature Wat Tyler is Mrs O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Bondman: A Story of the Days of Wat Tyler&quot; (1833). He is the protagonist in Pierce Egan the Younger&#x27;s novel &quot;Wat Tyler, or the Rebellion of 1381&quot; (1841), a highly radical text published at the height of the second phase of the Chartist movement that argued for republican government in England. Egan&#x27;s novel was subsequently abridged and plagiarised and published as &quot;The Life and Adventures of Wat Tyler: The Good and the Brave&quot; (1851). Wat Tyler is the protagonist of the penny dreadful serial novel &quot;Wat Tyler; or, The King and the Apprentice&quot; which appeared in weekly parts in &quot;The Young Englishman&#x27;s Journal&quot; in 1867, and appears as a main character in William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s &quot;Merry England; or, Nobles and Serfs&quot; (1874). In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), his name is invoked by Sir Leicester Dedlock as an example of what would happen if any concessions were made to &quot;some person in the lower classes&quot;. Tyler features as a sympathetic hero in the novel &quot;A Dream of John Ball&quot; (1888) by William Morris.

Wat Tyler is also mentioned in &quot;Redburn&quot; by Herman Melville and in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; by Mark Twain. Tyler features briefly in the historical fiction &quot;The Mediation of Ralph Hardelot&quot; (1888) by William Minto. The juvenile novel &quot;A March on London&quot; (1897) by G. A. Henty, depicts Tyler briefly as a &quot;sullen and resentful&quot; demagogue. Henty&#x27;s book was illustrated by W.H. Margetson. &quot;Long Will&quot; (1903), a novel by Florence Converse, depicts a meritorious Wat Tyler.

The 1921 play &quot;Wat Tyler&quot; by Halcott Glover interprets Tyler as a sympathetic protester against feudal tyranny, who is driven into violence by John Ball&#x27;s preaching. &quot;Riot at Gravesend&quot; (1952), a novel by William Howard Woods, focus on the combats between the rebels and the authorities. &quot;Who Then Was The Gentleman?&quot; (1963) is a novel by Charles E. Israel, that renders a courageous and charismatic Wat Tyler. &quot;A Summer Storm&quot; (1976), a novel by Jane Lane, depicts Tyler as a villain. The novel &quot;The Confession of Jack Straw&quot; (1991) by Simone Zelitch features Tyler as a central character. The children&#x27;s novel &quot;Fire, Bed, and Bone&quot; (1997) by Henrietta Branford has Wat Tyler as one of its characters. Wat Tyler is the principal character in the historical novel, &quot;Now is the Time&quot; (2015) by Melvyn Bragg.

English composer Alan Bush wrote an opera, &quot;Wat Tyler&quot;, about Tyler&#x27;s life. Bush&#x27;s opera was premiered at the Leipzig Opera in 1953.

Singer-songwriter Martin Newell references Wat Tyler and the Peasant&#x27;s Revolt in his song &quot;The Jangling Man&quot; from the 1990 album &quot;Number Thirteen&quot;, in reference to the poll tax riots.

English folk singer-songwriter Frank Turner references Wat Tyler&#x27;s negotiations at Smithfield in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; from the 2009 album &quot;Poetry of the Deed&quot;, and again mentions Tyler by name in &quot;One Foot Before the Other&quot; from 2011 album &quot;England Keep My Bones&quot;.

Provisional IRA member and hunger striker Bobby Sands referenced &quot;Wat the Tyler&quot; and his poor in one of his wider-known poems written while in prison, &quot;The Rhythm of Time&quot;.

A cultural history survey of Wat Tyler&#x27;s portrayals in post-medieval literature down to the modern period has been written by Stephen Basdeo who argues that most of Tyler&#x27;s appropriations in popular culture appear at times of political excitement.

<text>Sociotechnical systems (STS) in organizational development is an approach to complex organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people and technology in s. The term also refers to coherent systems of human relations, technical objects, and cybernetic processes that inhere to large, complex infrastructures. Social society, and its constituent substructures, qualify as complex sociotechnical systems.

The term sociotechnical systems was coined by Eric Trist, Ken Bamforth and Fred Emery, in the World War II era, based on their work with workers in English coal mines at the Tavistock Institute in London. Sociotechnical systems pertains to theory regarding the social aspects of people and society and technical aspects of organizational structure and processes. Here, technical does not necessarily imply material technology. The focus is on procedures and related knowledge, i.e. it refers to the ancient Greek term &quot;techne&quot;. &quot;Technical&quot; is a term used to refer to structure and a broader sense of technicalities. Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of &quot;social&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; aspects of an organization or the society as a whole.

Sociotechnical theory is about &quot;joint optimization&quot;, with a shared emphasis on achievement of both excellence in technical performance and quality in people&#x27;s work lives. Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, according to which the functional output of different sociotechnical elements leads to system efficiency, productive sustainability, user satisfaction, and change management.

==Overview==
Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of &quot;social&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; aspects of an organization. Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles:
* One is that the interaction of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational performance. This interaction consists partly of linear &quot;cause and effect&quot; relationships (the relationships that are normally &quot;designed&quot;) and partly from &quot;non-linear&quot;, complex, even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected). Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work.
* The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, &quot;un-designed&quot; relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system&#x27;s performance.

Therefore, sociotechnical theory is about &quot;joint optimization&quot;, that is, designing the social system and technical system in tandem so that they work smoothly together. Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing, rather than all too often case of new technology failing to meet the expectations of designers and users alike.

The scientific literature shows terms like &quot;sociotechnical&quot; all one word, or &quot;socio-technical&quot; with a hyphen, &quot;sociotechnical theory&quot;, &quot;sociotechnical system&quot; and &quot;sociotechnical systems theory&quot;. All of these terms appear ubiquitously but their actual meanings often remain unclear. The key term &quot;sociotechnical&quot; is something of a buzzword and its varied usage can be unpicked. What can be said about it, though, is that it is most often used to simply, and quite correctly, describe any kind of organization that is composed of people and technology.

The key elements of the STS approach include combining the human elements and the technical systems together to enable new possibilities for work and pave the way for technological change (Trist, 1981). The involvement of human elements in negotiations may cause a larger workload initially, but it is crucial that requirements can be determined and accommodated for prior to implementation as it is central to the systems success. Due to its mutual causality (Davis, 1977), the STS approach has become widely linked with autonomy, completeness and job satisfaction as both systems can work together to achieving a goal.

Enid Mumford (1983) defines the socio-technical approach to recognize technology and people to ensure work systems are highly efficient and contain better characteristics which leads to higher job satisfaction for employees, resulting in a sense of fulfilment to improving quality of work and exceeding expectations. Mumford concludes that the development of information systems is not a technical issue, but a business organization issue which is concerned with the process of change.

==Principles==
Some of the central principles of sociotechnical theory were elaborated in a seminal paper by Eric Trist and Ken Bamforth in 1951. This is an interesting case study which, like most of the work in sociotechnical theory, is focused on a form of &#x27;production system&#x27; expressive of the era and the contemporary technological systems it contained. The study was based on the paradoxical observation that despite improved technology, productivity was falling, and that despite better pay and amenities, absenteeism was increasing. This particular rational organisation had become irrational. The cause of the problem was hypothesized to be the adoption of a new form of production technology which had created the need for a bureaucratic form of organization (rather like classic command-and-control). In this specific example, technology brought with it a retrograde step in organizational design terms. The analysis that followed introduced the terms &quot;socio&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; and elaborated on many of the core principles that sociotechnical theory subsequently became.

“The key elements of the STS approach include combining the human elements and the technical systems together to enable new possibilities for work and pave the way for technological change. Due to its mutual causality, the STS approach has become widely linked with autonomy, completeness and job satisfaction as both systems can work together to achieving a goal.”

===Responsible autonomy===
Sociotechnical theory was pioneering for its shift in emphasis, a shift towards considering teams or groups as the primary unit of analysis and not the individual. Sociotechnical theory pays particular attention to internal supervision and leadership at the level of the &quot;group&quot; and refers to it as &quot;responsible autonomy&quot;. The overriding point seems to be that having the simple ability of individual team members being able to perform their function is not the only predictor of group effectiveness. There are a range of issues in team cohesion research, for example, that are answered by having the regulation and leadership internal to a group or team.

These, and other factors, play an integral and parallel role in ensuring successful teamwork which sociotechnical theory exploits.
The idea of semi-autonomous groups conveys a number of further advantages. Not least among these, especially in hazardous environments, is the often felt need on the part of people in the organisation for a role in a small primary group. It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited. As Carvalho states, this is because &quot;...operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness...&quot;. The immediacy and proximity of trusted team members makes it possible for this to occur. The coevolution of technology and organizations brings with it an expanding array of new possibilities for novel interaction. Responsible autonomy could become more distributed along with the team(s) themselves.

The key to responsible autonomy seems to be to design an organization possessing the characteristics of small groups whilst preventing the &quot;silo-thinking&quot; and &quot;stovepipe&quot; neologisms of contemporary management theory. In order to preserve &quot;...intact the loyalties on which the small group [depend]...the system as a whole [needs to contain] its bad in a way that [does] not destroy its good&quot;. In practice, this requires groups to be responsible for their own internal regulation and supervision, with the primary task of relating the group to the wider system falling explicitly to a group leader. This principle, therefore, describes a strategy for removing more traditional command hierarchies.

===Adaptability===
Carvajal states that &quot;the rate at which uncertainty overwhelms an organisation is related more to its internal structure than to the amount of environmental uncertainty&quot;. Sitter in 1997 offered two solutions for organisations confronted, like the military, with an environment of increased (and increasing) complexity:
&quot;The first option is to restore the fit with the external complexity by an increasing internal complexity. ...This usually means the creation of more staff functions or the enlargement of staff-functions and/or the investment in vertical information systems&quot;. Vertical information systems are often confused for &quot;network enabled capability&quot; systems (NEC) but an important distinction needs to be made, which Sitter et al. propose as their second option:
&quot;...the organisation tries to deal with the external complexity by &#x27;reducing&#x27; the internal control and coordination needs. ...This option might be called the strategy of &#x27;simple organisations and complex jobs&#x27;&quot;. This all contributes to a number of unique advantages.
Firstly is the issue of &quot;human redundancy&quot; in which &quot;groups of this kind were free to set their own targets, so that aspiration levels with respect to production could be adjusted to the age and stamina of the individuals concerned&quot;. Human redundancy speaks towards the flexibility, ubiquity and pervasiveness of resources within NEC.

The second issue is that of complexity. Complexity lies at the heart of many organisational contexts (there are numerous organizational paradigms that struggle to cope with it). Trist and Bamforth (1951) could have been writing about these with the following passage: &quot;A very large variety of unfavourable and changing environmental conditions is encountered ... many of which are impossible to predict. Others, though predictable, are impossible to alter.&quot;

Many type of organisations are clearly motivated by the appealing &quot;industrial age&quot;, rational principles of &quot;factory production&quot;, a particular approach to dealing with complexity: &quot;In the factory a comparatively high degree of control can be exercised over the complex and moving &quot;figure&quot; of a production sequence, since it is possible to maintain the &quot;ground&quot; in a comparatively passive and constant state&quot;. On the other hand, many activities are constantly faced with the possibility of &quot;untoward activity in the &#x27;ground&#x27;&quot; of the &#x27;figure-ground&#x27; relationship&quot; The central problem, one that appears to be at the nub of many problems that &quot;classic&quot; organisations have with complexity, is that &quot;The instability of the &#x27;ground&#x27; limits the applicability ... of methods derived from the factory&quot;.

In Classic organisations, problems with the moving &quot;figure&quot; and moving &quot;ground&quot; often become magnified through a much larger social space, one in which there is a far greater extent of hierarchical task interdependence. For this reason, the semi-autonomous group, and its ability to make a much more fine grained response to the &quot;ground&quot; situation, can be regarded as &quot;agile&quot;. Added to which, local problems that do arise need not propagate throughout the entire system (to affect the workload and quality of work of many others) because a complex organization doing simple tasks has been replaced by a simpler organization doing more complex tasks. The agility and internal regulation of the group allows problems to be solved locally without propagation through a larger social space, thus increasing tempo.

===Whole tasks===
Another concept in sociotechnical theory is the &quot;whole task&quot;. A whole task &quot;has the advantage of placing responsibility for the ... task squarely on the shoulders of a single, small, face-to-face group which experiences the entire cycle of operations within the compass of its membership.&quot; The Sociotechnical embodiment of this principle is the notion of minimal critical specification. This principle states that, &quot;While it may be necessary to be quite precise about what has to be done, it is rarely necessary to be precise about how it is done&quot;. This is no more illustrated by the antithetical example of &quot;working to rule&quot; and the virtual collapse of any system that is subject to the intentional withdrawal of human adaptation to situations and contexts.

The key factor in minimally critically specifying tasks is the responsible autonomy of the group to decide, based on local conditions, how best to undertake the task in a flexible adaptive manner. This principle is isomorphic with ideas like effects-based operations (EBO). EBO asks the question of what goal is it that we want to achieve, what objective is it that we need to reach rather than what tasks have to be undertaken, when and how. The EBO concept enables the managers to &quot;...manipulate and decompose high level effects. They must then assign lesser effects as objectives for subordinates to achieve. The intention is that subordinates&#x27; actions will cumulatively achieve the overall effects desired&quot;. In other words, the focus shifts from being a scriptwriter for tasks to instead being a designer of behaviours. In some cases, this can make the task of the manager significantly less arduous.

===Meaningfulness of tasks===
Effects-based operations and the notion of a &quot;whole task&quot;, combined with adaptability and responsible autonomy, have additional advantages for those at work in the organization. This is because &quot;for each participant the task has total significance and dynamic closure&quot; as well as the requirement to deploy a multiplicity of skills and to have the responsible autonomy in order to select when and how to do so. This is clearly hinting at a relaxation of the myriad of control mechanisms found in more classically designed organizations.

Greater interdependence (through diffuse processes such as globalisation) also bring with them an issue of size, in which &quot;the scale of a task transcends the limits of simple spatio-temporal structure. By this is meant conditions under which those concerned can complete a job in one place at one time, i.e., the situation of the face-to-face, or singular group&quot;. In other words, in classic organisations the &quot;wholeness&quot; of a task is often diminished by multiple group integration and spatiotemporal disintegration. The group based form of organization design proposed by sociotechnical theory combined with new technological possibilities (such as the internet) provide a response to this often forgotten issue, one that contributes significantly to joint optimisation.

==Topics==
===Sociotechnical system===
A sociotechnical system is the term usually given to any instantiation of socio and technical elements engaged in goal directed behaviour. Sociotechnical systems are a particular expression of sociotechnical theory, although they are not necessarily one and the same thing. Sociotechnical systems theory is a mixture of sociotechnical theory, joint optimisation and so forth and general systems theory. The term sociotechnical system recognises that organizations have boundaries and that transactions occur within the system (and its sub-systems) and between the wider context and dynamics of the environment. It is an extension of Sociotechnical Theory which provides a richer descriptive and conceptual language for describing, analysing and designing organisations. A Sociotechnical System, therefore, often describes a &#x27;thing&#x27; (an interlinked, systems based mixture of people, technology and their environment).

Social technical means that technology, which by definition, should not be allowed to be the controlling factor when new work systems are implemented. So in order to be classified as &#x27;Sociotechnical&#x27;, equal attention must be paid to providing a high quality and satisfying work environment for employees.

The Tavistock researchers, presented that employees who will be using the new and improved system, should be participating in determining the required quality of working life improvements. Participative socio‐technical design can be achieved by in‐depth interviews, questionnaires and collection of data.

Participative socio-technical design can be conducted through in-depth interviews, the collection of statistics and the analysis of relevant documents. These will provide important comparative data that can help approve or disprove the chosen hypotheses. A common approach to participative design is, whenever possible, to use a democratically selected user design group as the key information collectors and decision makers. The design group is backed by a committee of senior staff who can lay the foundations and subsequently oversee the project.

Alter describes sociotechnical analysis and design methods to not be a strong point in the information systems practice. The aim of socio-technical designs is to optimise and join both social and technical systems. However, the problem is that of the technical and social system along with the work system and joint optimisation are not defined as they should be.

===Sustainability===
Standalone, incremental improvements are not sufficient to address current, let alone future sustainability challenges. These challenges will require deep changes of sociotechnical systems. Theories on innovation systems; sustainable innovations; system thinking and design; and sustainability transitions, among others, have attempted to describe potential changes capable of shifting development towards more sustainable directions.

===Autonomous work teams===

Autonomous work teams also called self-managed teams, are an alternative to traditional assembly line methods. Rather than having a large number of employees each do a small operation to assemble a product, the employees are organized into small teams, each of which is responsible for assembling an entire product. These teams are self-managed, and are independent of one another.

In the mid-1970s, Pehr Gyllenhammar created his new “dock assembly” work system at Volvo’s Kalmar Plant. Instead of the traditional flow line system of car production, self-managed teams would assemble the entire car. The idea of worker directors – a director on the company board who is a representative of the workforce – was established through this project and the Swedish government required them in state enterprises.

===Job enrichment===
Job enrichment in organizational development, human resources management, and organizational behavior, is the process of giving the employee a wider and higher level scope of responsibility with increased decision-making authority. This is the opposite of job enlargement, which simply would not involve greater authority. Instead, it will only have an increased number of duties.

The concept of minimal critical specifications. (Mumford, 2006) states workers should be told what to do but not how to do it. Deciding this should be left to their initiative. She says they can be involved in work groups, matrices and networks. The employee should receive correct objectives but they decide how to achieve these objectives.

===Job enlargement===
Job enlargement means increasing the scope of a job through extending the range of its job duties and responsibilities. This contradicts the principles of specialisation and the division of labour whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall.

===Job rotation===
Job rotation is an approach to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth of exposure to the entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the scheduled exchange of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the German green party for some time but has been discontinued.

===Motivation===
Motivation in psychology refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behavior. Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion. Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual&#x27;s state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behavior (e.g., anger, grief, happiness).
With the view that socio-technical design is by which intelligence and skill combined with emerging technologies could improve the work-life balance of employees, it is also believed that the aim is to achieve both a safer and more pleasurable workplace as well as to see greater democracy in society. The achievement of these aims would therefore lead to increased motivation of employees and would directly and positively influence their ability to express ideas. Enid Mumford&#x27;s work on redesigning designing human systems also expressed that it is the role of the facilitator to “keep the members interested and motivated toward the design task, to help them resolve any conflicts”.

Mumford states that although technology and organizational structures may change in industry, the employee rights and needs must be given a high priority. Future commercial success requires motivated work forces who are committed to their employers’ interests. This requires companies; managers who are dedicated to creating this motivation and recognize what is required for it to be achieved. Returning to socio-technical values, objectives; principals may provide an answer.

Mumford reflects on leadership within organisations, because lack of leadership has proven to be the downfall of most companies. As competition increases employers have lost their valued and qualified employees to their competitors. Opportunities such as better job roles and an opportunity to work your way up has motivated these employees to join their rivals. Mumford suggests that a delegation of responsibility could help employees stay motivated as they would feel appreciated and belonging thus keeping them in their current organization. Leadership is key as employees would prefer following a structure and knowing that there is opportunity to improve.

When Mumford analysed the role of user participation during two ES projects A drawback that was found was that users found it difficult to see beyond their current practices and found it difficult to anticipate how things can be done differently. Motivation was found to be another challenge during this process as users were not interested in participating (Wagner, 2007).

===Process improvement===
Process improvement in organizational development is a series of actions taken to identify, analyze and improve existing processes within an organization to meet new goals and objectives. These actions often follow a specific methodology or strategy to create successful results.

===Task analysis===
Task analysis is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task. This information can then be used for many purposes, such as personnel selection and training, tool or equipment design, procedure design (e.g., design of checklists or decision support systems) and automation.

===Job design===
Job design or work design in organizational development is the application of sociotechnical systems principles and techniques to the humanization of work, for example, through job enrichment. The aims of work design to improved job satisfaction, to improved through-put, to improved quality and to reduced employee problems, e.g., grievances, absenteeism.

===Deliberations===
Deliberations are key units of analysis in non-linear, knowledge work. They are &#x27;choice points&#x27; that move knowledge work forward. As originated and defined by Cal Pava (1983) in a second-generation development of STS theory, deliberations are patterns of exchange and communication to reduce the equivocality of a problematic issue; for example, for systems engineering work, what features to develop in new software. Deliberations are not discrete decisions—they are a more continuous context for decisions. They have 3 aspects: topics, forums, and participants.

=== Work System Theory (WST) and Work System Method (WSM) ===
The WST and WSM simplifies the conceptualization of traditional complicated socio-technical system (STS) approach (Alter, 2015). Extending the prior research on STS which divides social and technical aspects; WST combines the two perspectives in a work system and outlines the framework for WSM which considers work system as the system of interest and proposes solutions accordingly (Alter, 2015).    

The Work System Theory (WST) and Work System Method (WSM) are both forms of socio-technical systems but in the form of work systems. Also, the Work System Method encourages the use of both socio-technical ideas and values when it comes to IS development, use and implementation.

=== Evolution of socio-technical systems ===
The evolution of socio-technical design has seen its development from being approached as a social system exclusively. The realisation of the joint optimisation of social and technical systems was later realised. It was divided into sections where primary work which looks into principles and description, and how to incorporate technical designs on a macrosocial level.

=== Benefits of seeing sociotechnical systems through a work system lens ===
Analysing and designing sociotechnical systems from a work system perspective and eliminates the artificial distinction of the social system from the technical system. This also eliminates the idea of joint optimization. By using a work system lens in can bring many benefits, such as:

* Viewing the work system as a whole, making it easier to discuss and analyse
* More organised approach by even outlining basic understanding of a work system
* A readily usable analysis method making it more adaptable for performing analysis of a work system
* Does not require guidance by experts and researchers
*Reinforces the idea that a work system exists to produce a product(s)/service(s)
*Easier to theorize potential staff reductions, job roles changing and reorganizations
*Encourages motivation and good will while reducing the stress from monitoring
*Conscientious that documentation and practice may differ

=== Problems to overcome ===

* Difference in cultures across the world
* Data theft of company information and networked systems
* &quot;Big Brother&quot; effect on employees
* Hierarchical imbalance between managers and lower staff
* Persuading peoples old attitude of &#x27;instant fixes&#x27; without any real thought of structure

=== Social network / structure ===
The social network perspective first started in 1920 at Harvard University within the Sociology Department. Within information systems social networks have been used to study behaviour of teams, organisations and Industries. Social network perspective is useful for studying some of the emerging forms of social or organisational arrangements and the roles of ICT.

=== Social media and Artificial Intelligence ===
Recent work on Artificial Intelligence considers large Sociotechnical Systems, 
such as social networks and online marketplaces, 
as agents whose behaviour can be purposeful and adaptive. The behaviour of recommender
systems can therefore be analysed in the language and framework of sociotechnical systems,
leading also to a new perspective for their legal regulation. 


=== Multi-directional inheritance ===
Multi-directional inheritance is the premise that work systems inherit their purpose, meaning and structure from the organisation and reflect the priorities and purposes of the organisation that encompasses them. Fundamentally, this premise includes crucial assumptions about sequencing, timescales, and precedence. The purpose, meaning and structure can derive from multiple contexts and once obtained it can be passed on to the sociotechnical systems that emerge throughout the organisation.

=== Sociological perspective on sociotechnical systems ===
A 1990s research interest in social dimensions of IS directed to relationship among IS development, uses, and resultant social and organizational changes offered fresh insight into the emerging role of ICT within differing organizational context; drawing directly on sociological theories of institution. This sociotechnical research has informed if not shaped IS scholarship. Sociological theories have offered a solid basis upon which emerging sociotechnical research built.

===ETHICS history===
The ETHICS (Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems) process has been used successfully by Mumford in a variety of projects since its idea conception from the Turners Asbestos Cement project. After forgetting a vital request from the customer to discuss and potentially fix the issues found with the current organisation, she gave her advice on making a system. The system was not received well and Mumford was told they already had been using a similar system. This is when she realised a participative based approach would benefit many future projects.

Enid Mumfords ETHICS development was a push from her to remind those in the field that research doesn&#x27;t always need to be done on things of current interest and following the immediate trends over your current research is not always the way forward. A reminder that work should always be finished and we should never “write them off with no outcome.” as she said.

<text>Channel capacity, in electrical engineering, computer science, and information theory, is the theoretical maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel.

Following the terms of the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the highest information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability.

Information theory, developed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948, defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which it may be computed. The key result states that the capacity of the channel, as defined above, is given by the maximum of the mutual information between the input and output of the channel, where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution.

The notion of channel capacity has been central to the development of modern wireline and wireless communication systems, with the advent of novel error correction coding mechanisms that have resulted in achieving performance very close to the limits promised by channel capacity.

== Formal definition ==

The basic mathematical model for a communication system is the following:

:formula_1

where:
* formula_2 is the message to be transmitted;
* formula_3 is the channel input symbol (formula_4 is a sequence of formula_5 symbols) taken in an alphabet formula_6;
* formula_7 is the channel output symbol (formula_8 is a sequence of formula_5 symbols) taken in an alphabet formula_10;
* formula_11 is the estimate of the transmitted message;
* formula_12 is the encoding function for a block of length formula_5;
* formula_14 is the noisy channel, which is modeled by a conditional probability distribution; and,
* formula_15 is the decoding function for a block of length formula_5.

Let formula_3 and formula_7 be modeled as random variables. Furthermore, let formula_19 be the conditional probability distribution function of formula_7 given formula_3, which is an inherent fixed property of the communication channel. Then the choice of the marginal distribution formula_22 completely determines the joint distribution formula_23 due to the identity

:formula_24

which, in turn, induces a mutual information formula_25. The channel capacity is defined as

:formula_26

where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of formula_22.

== Additivity of channel capacity ==
Channel capacity is additive over independent channels. It means that using two independent channels in a combined manner provides the same theoretical capacity as using them independently. 
More formally, let formula_28 and formula_29 be two independent channels modelled as above; formula_28 having an input alphabet formula_31 and an output alphabet formula_32. Idem for formula_29. 
We define the product channel formula_34 as 
formula_35

This theorem states:
formula_36

}(I(X_{1},X_{2} : Y_{1},Y_{2}))&lt;/math&gt;.

Since formula_37 and formula_38 are independent, as well as formula_39 and formula_40, formula_41 is independent of formula_42. We can apply the following property of mutual information: formula_43

For now we only need to find a distribution formula_44 such that formula_45. In fact, formula_46 and formula_47, two probability distributions for formula_37 and formula_38 achieving formula_50 and formula_51, suffice:
:formula_52
ie. formula_53

Now let us show that formula_54.

Let formula_55 be some distribution for the channel formula_56 defining formula_57 and the corresponding output formula_58. Let formula_59 be the alphabet of formula_37, formula_61 for formula_62, and analogously formula_63 and formula_64.

By definition of mutual information, we have

formula_65

Let us rewrite the last term of entropy.

formula_66

By definition of the product channel, formula_67. 
For a given pair formula_68, we can rewrite formula_69 as:

formula_70

By summing this equality over all formula_68, we obtain 
formula_72.

We can now give an upper bound over mutual information:

formula_73

This relation is preserved at the supremum. Therefore
:formula_74

Combining the two inequalities we proved, we obtain the result of the theorem:
:formula_75

==Shannon capacity of a graph==

If &quot;G&quot; is an undirected graph, it can be used to define a communications channel in which the symbols are the graph vertices, and two codewords may be confused with each other if their symbols in each position are equal or adjacent. The computational complexity of finding the Shannon capacity of such a channel remains open, but it can be upper bounded by another important graph invariant, the Lovász number.

==Noisy-channel coding theorem==

The noisy-channel coding theorem states that for any error probability ε &gt; 0 and for any transmission rate &quot;R&quot; less than the channel capacity &quot;C&quot;, there is an encoding and decoding scheme transmitting data at rate &quot;R&quot; whose error probability is less than ε, for a sufficiently large block length. Also, for any rate greater than the channel capacity, the probability of error at the receiver goes to 0.5 as the block length goes to infinity.

==Example application==

An application of the channel capacity concept to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with &quot;B&quot; Hz bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio &quot;S/N&quot; is the Shannon–Hartley theorem:
:formula_76

&quot;C&quot; is measured in bits per second if the logarithm is taken in base 2, or nats per second if the natural logarithm is used, assuming &quot;B&quot; is in hertz; the signal and noise powers &quot;S&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are expressed in a linear power unit (like watts or volts2). Since &quot;S/N&quot; figures are often cited in dB, a conversion may be needed. For example, a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB corresponds to a linear power ratio of formula_77.

== Channel capacity estimation ==
To determine the channel capacity, it is necessary to find the capacity-achieving distribution formula_22 and evaluate the mutual information formula_25. Research has mostly focused on studying additive noise channels under certain power constraints and noise distributions, as analytical methods are not feasible in the majority of other scenarios. Hence, alternative approaches such as, investigation on the input support, relaxations and capacity bounds, have been proposed in the literature.

The capacity of a discrete memoryless channel can be computed using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.

Deep learning can be used to estimate the channel capacity. In fact, the channel capacity and the capacity-achieving distribution of any discrete-time continuous memoryless vector channel can be obtained using CORTICAL, a cooperative framework inspired by generative adversarial networks. CORTICAL consists of two cooperative networks: a generator with the objective of learning to sample from the capacity-achieving input distribution, and a discriminator with the objective to learn to distinguish between paired and unpaired channel input-output samples and estimates formula_25.

== Channel capacity in wireless communications ==

This section focuses on the single-antenna, point-to-point scenario. For channel capacity in systems with multiple antennas, see the article on MIMO.

===Bandlimited AWGN channel===

If the average received power is formula_81 [W], the total bandwidth is formula_2 in Hertz, and the noise power spectral density is formula_83 [W/Hz], the AWGN channel capacity is

:formula_84 [bits/s],

where formula_85 is the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This result is known as the Shannon–Hartley theorem.

When the SNR is large (SNR ≫ 0 dB), the capacity formula_86 is logarithmic in power and approximately linear in bandwidth. This is called the &quot;bandwidth-limited regime&quot;.

When the SNR is small (SNR ≪ 0 dB), the capacity formula_87 is linear in power but insensitive to bandwidth. This is called the &quot;power-limited regime&quot;.

The bandwidth-limited regime and power-limited regime are illustrated in the figure.

===Frequency-selective AWGN channel===

The capacity of the frequency-selective channel is given by so-called water filling power allocation,

:formula_88

where formula_89 and formula_90 is the gain of subchannel formula_5, with formula_92 chosen to meet the power constraint.

===Slow-fading channel===

In a slow-fading channel, where the coherence time is greater than the latency requirement, there is no definite capacity as the maximum rate of reliable communications supported by the channel, formula_93, depends on the random channel gain formula_94, which is unknown to the transmitter. If the transmitter encodes data at rate formula_95 [bits/s/Hz], there is a non-zero probability that the decoding error probability cannot be made arbitrarily small,

:formula_96,

in which case the system is said to be in outage. With a non-zero probability that the channel is in deep fade, the capacity of the slow-fading channel in strict sense is zero. However, it is possible to determine the largest value of formula_95 such that the outage probability formula_98 is less than formula_99. This value is known as the formula_99-outage capacity.

===Fast-fading channel===

In a fast-fading channel, where the latency requirement is greater than the coherence time and the codeword length spans many coherence periods, one can average over many independent channel fades by coding over a large number of coherence time intervals. Thus, it is possible to achieve a reliable rate of communication of formula_101 [bits/s/Hz] and it is meaningful to speak of this value as the capacity of the fast-fading channel.

== Feedback Capacity==
Feedback capacity is the greatest rate at which information can be reliably transmitted, per unit time, over a point-to-point communication channel in which the receiver feeds back the channel outputs to the transmitter. Information-theoretic analysis of communication systems that incorporate feedback is more complicated and challenging than without feedback. Possibly, this was the reason C.E. Shannon chose feedback as the subject of the first Shannon Lecture, delivered at the 1973 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory in Ashkelon, Israel.

The feedback capacity is characterized by the maximum of the directed information between the channel inputs and the channel outputs, where the maximization is with respect to the causal conditioning of the input given the output. The directed information was coined by James Massey in 1990, who showed that its an upper bound on feedback capacity. For memoryless channels, Shannon showed that feedback does not increase the capacity, and the feedback capacity coincides with the channel capacity characterized by the mutual information between the input and the output. The feedback capacity is known as a closed-form expression only for several examples such as the trapdoor channel, Ising channel. For some other channels, it is characterized through constant-size optimization problems such as the binary erasure channel with a no-consecutive-ones input constraint, NOST channel.

The basic mathematical model for a communication system is the following:

Here is the formal definition of each element (where the only difference with respect to the nonfeedback capacity is the encoder definition):
* formula_2 is the message to be transmitted, taken in an alphabet formula_103;
* formula_3 is the channel input symbol (formula_4 is a sequence of formula_5 symbols) taken in an alphabet formula_6;
* formula_7 is the channel output symbol (formula_8 is a sequence of formula_5 symbols) taken in an alphabet formula_10;
* formula_11 is the estimate of the transmitted message;
* formula_113 is the encoding function at time formula_114, for a block of length formula_5;
* formula_116 is the noisy channel at time formula_114, which is modeled by a conditional probability distribution; and,
* formula_118 is the decoding function for a block of length formula_5.
That is, for each time formula_120 there exists a feedback of the previous output formula_121 such that the encoder has access to all previous outputs formula_122. An formula_123 code is a pair of encoding and decoding mappings with formula_124, and formula_2 is uniformly distributed. A rate formula_95 is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of codes formula_123 such that the &quot;average probability of error:&quot; formula_128 tends to zero as formula_129.

The feedback capacity is denoted by formula_130, and is defined as the supremum over all achievable rates.

=== Main results on feedback capacity ===
Let formula_3 and formula_7 be modeled as random variables. The causal conditioning formula_133 describes the given channel. The choice of the causally conditional distribution formula_134 determines the joint distribution formula_135 due to the chain rule for causal conditioning formula_136 which, in turn, induces a directed information formula_137.

The feedback capacity is given by

: formula_138,

where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of formula_139.

=== Gaussian feedback capacity ===
When the Gaussian noise is colored, the channel has memory. Consider for instance the simple case on an autoregressive model noise process formula_140 where formula_141 is an i.i.d. process.

=== Solution techniques ===
The feedback capacity is difficult to solve in the general case. There are some techniques that are related to control theory and Markov decision processes if the channel is discrete.

<text>Paper engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the usage of physical science (e.g. chemistry and physics) and life sciences (e.g. biology and biochemistry) in conjunction with mathematics as applied to the converting of raw materials into useful paper products and co-products. The field applies various principles in process engineering and unit operations to the manufacture of paper, chemicals, energy and related materials. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical and bioprocess engineering:

From a heritage perspective, the field encompasses the design and analysis of a wide variety of thermal, chemical and biochemical unit operations employed in the manufacture of pulp and paper, and addresses the preparation of its raw materials from trees or other natural resources via a pulping process, chemical and mechanical pretreatment of these recovered biopolymer (e.g. principally, although not solely, cellulose-based) fibers in a fluid suspension, the high-speed forming and initial dewatering of a non-woven web, the development of bulk sheet properties via control of energy and mass transfer operations, as well as post-treatment of the sheet with coating, calendering, and other chemical and mechanical processes.

==Applications==
Today, the field of paper and chemical engineering is applied to the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The forestry and biology, chemical science, (bio)chemical industry scope manufactures organic and agrochemicals (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), oleochemicals, fragrances and flavors, food, feed, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, chemicals, polymers and power from biological materials.

The resulting products of paper engineering including paper, cardboard, and various paper derivatives are widely used in everyday life. In addition to being a subset of chemical engineering, the field of paper engineering is closely linked to forest management, product recycling, and the mass production of paper – based media.

==Methods==

===Mechanical pulping===
In the process of mechanical pulping, &quot;grinding&quot; and &quot;refining&quot; are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of pressing logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, one or both of which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner mechanical pulping, thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping. Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:
Mechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85–95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.

===Chemical pulping===
The process of chemical pulping is used to chemically disband the lignin found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the cellulose fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate (Kraft process) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed on a wide range of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.

===Further pulp processing===
The pulp is then processed through an apparatus which renders the pulp as a mesh of fibers. This fiber network is then pressed to remove all water contents, and the paper is subsequently dried to remove all traces of moisture.

===Finishing===
After the above processes have been completed, the resulting paper is coated with a minuscule amount of china clay or calcium carbonate to modify the surface, and the paper is then re-sized depending on its intended purpose.

===Product recycling ===
Generally, the material to be recycled first undergoes mechanical or chemical pulping to render it in pulp form. The resulting pulp is then processed in the same way normal pulp is processed; however, original fiber is sometimes added to enhance the quality and appearance of the product.

<text>Robert Koehler (November 28, 1850 – April 23, 1917) was a German-born painter and art teacher who spent most of his career in the United States.

==Biography==
Koehler was born in Hamburg; his family spelled their name Köhler until they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1854. There he attended the historic German-English Academy. He graduated from the academy in 1865, but continued his lessons with the school&#x27;s drawing master, Henry Vianden, who had graduated from Munich&#x27;s Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He apprenticed himself to a lithography firm.

In 1871, he went to New York City for eye surgery, and stayed to work as a lithographer. After studying drawing in the night classes of the National Academy of Design, Koehler went to Munich to study fine art at the Royal Academy in 1873, studying with Karl von Piloty and Ludwig Thiersch. He returned to New York after two years because of depleted funds. In 1879, he was able to return to Munich with means furnished by George Ehret, of New York, whose attention had been drawn to the young artists&#x27;s ambition and capabilities. On his second trip, he studied under Ludwig Löfftz and Franz Defregger. His friendships with William Merritt Chase and Frank Duveneck date from this time.

Koehler&#x27;s work while in Munich won him silver and bronze awards from the Academy, and Bavaria&#x27;s &quot;Cross of the Order of St. Michael&quot;. Koehler then set himself up as head of a private art school; pupils included Alfons Mucha.

He began to exhibit in the National Academy, New York, in 1877. In 1885 he took charge of a private school of art in that city. He organized the American department of the international art exhibition at Munich in 1883, and was appointed by the Bavarian authorities to act in the same capacity in the exhibition of 1888.

In 1892 Robert Koehler returned to New York City to work as a portrait artist. The following year he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, accepting an offer to be the director of the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts (now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design). Koehler was also involved with the establishment of Minneapolis&#x27; Museum of Fine Art, now the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. He was a pioneer of art instruction and appreciation in the region.

Koehler was president of the Minnesota State Art Commission from 1903 to 1910, member of the Artists&#x27; League of Minneapolis, honorary member of the Minnesota State Art Society, honorary member of the Alumni Association of the Minneapolis School of Art, member of the Society of Western Artists, a lecturer on art history at the University of Minnesota, and member of the Institute des Beaux Arts et des Lettres of Paris, France. He received bronze and silver medals at the Munich Academy, honorable mention at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair, 1889, bronze medal at the International Art Exhibition at Buenos Aires in 1910, and the cross of the Order of Saint Michael of Bavaria in 1888. Three notable paintings, &quot;The Carpenter&#x27;s Family,&quot; &quot;At the Cafe,&quot; and his masterpiece &quot;The Strike&quot; were selected for display at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

Koehler continued working in Minneapolis, painting portraits and landscapes, teaching painting, and arranging exhibitions. He retired as director in 1914. He died in Minneapolis at age 66.

<text>Capablanca chess (or Capablanca&#x27;s chess) is a chess variant invented in the 1920s by World Chess Champion José Raúl Capablanca. It incorporates two new pieces and is played on a 10×8 board. Capablanca believed that chess would be played out in a few decades (meaning games between grandmasters would always end in draws). This threat of &quot;draw death&quot; for chess was his main motivation for creating a more complex version of the game.
* The archbishop combines powers of a bishop and a knight.
* The chancellor combines powers of a rook and a knight.

The new pieces allow new strategies and possibilities that change the game. For example, the archbishop by itself can checkmate a lone king in a corner (when placed diagonally with one square in between).

==Setup and rules==

Capablanca proposed two opening setups for Capablanca chess. His final revision placed the archbishop between the and ; the chancellor between the and . The king moves three squares when castling instead of moving two squares as in standard chess. A pawn can promote to archbishop or chancellor in addition to the regular promotion options in standard chess.
Unlike orthodox chess, each king, instead of each queen, starts on a square of its own color (the white king on a light square; the black king on a dark square).

Capablanca also experimented with a 10×10 board size with a different initial setup and where pawns could advance up to three squares on their first move. Edward Lasker wrote: ... I played many test games with Capablanca, and they rarely lasted more than twenty or twenty-five moves. We tried boards of 10×10 squares and 10×8 squares, and we concluded that the latter was preferable because hand-to-hand fights start earlier on it.

Lasker was one of the few supporters. Hungarian grandmaster Géza Maróczy also played some games with Capablanca (who got the better of him). British champion William Winter thought that there were too many strong pieces, making the less relevant.

The new piece names &quot;archbishop&quot; (originally named chancellor) and &quot;chancellor&quot; (originally named marshall, followed by marshal) were introduced by Capablanca himself. These names are still used in most modern variants of Capablanca Chess.

==Variants of Capablanca chess==

===Predating Capablanca chess===
Capablanca was not the first person to add the archbishop and the chancellor to the normal chess set, though he is the most famous. Other attempts mostly differ only by the arrangement of pieces and the castling rules.

In 1617, Pietro Carrera published a book &quot;Il Gioco degli Scacchi&quot;, which contained a description of a chess variant played on an 8×10 board. He placed new pieces between a rook and a knight. Archbishop was on the and chancellor on the . His likely primary motivation for the design was either the limitations of opening theory in this time or that he already foresaw the logic of chess playing out to the game being about the second player’s response to the King’s or queen’s pawn opening and he was not as concerned with avoiding structural weaknesses in the new game’s starting position created by a potential new piece standing on a given file, as with the archbishop between the knight and the rook leaving its own pawn unprotected. Carrera used the names &quot;Centauro&quot; (centaur) instead of archbishop, and &quot;Campione&quot; (champion) instead of chancellor.

In 1874, Henry Bird proposed a chess variant similar to Carrera&#x27;s variant. The only significant difference was the opening setup. The new pieces were now between the bishops and the royal pair, the archbishop close to the king, the chancellor close to the queen. The queen&#x27;s bishop&#x27;s pawn is not protected in the initial setup. Bird used the names &quot;equerry&quot; instead of archbishop, and &quot;guard&quot; instead of chancellor. The theoretical benefit of this setup is that the new pieces’ pawns are thus very important to the opening theory of the game, equally to the king’s and queen&#x27;s pawns. This makes the chancellor‘s pawn a pair for the queen&#x27;s pawn as leading to a more strategically oriented game from the nature of the chancellor.

===Postdating Capablanca chess===



Capablanca chess has inspired a number of variants:
* Universal chess (1928) by Dr. Bruno Violet (on 10×10 board). He proposed two arrangements.
* Grand Chess (1984) by Christian Freeling
* Gothic chess, also known as Trice&#x27;s chess (2000) by Edward A. Trice
* Aberg&#x27;s variation (2003) by Hans Aberg
* Capablanca random chess (2004) by Reinhard Scharnagl
* Grotesque chess (2004) by Fergus Duniho
* Paulovich&#x27;s variation (2004) by David Paulovich
* Ladorean chess (2005) by Bernhard U. Hermes
* Embassy chess (2005) by Kevin Hill
* Univers chess (2006) by Fergus Duniho
* Schoolbook chess (2006) by Sam Trenholme
* Victorian chess (2007) by John K. Lewis
* Modern Capablanca random chess (2008) by José Carrillo

Several chess variants postdating Capablanca chess were designed with initial arrangements where all pawns are protected by at least one piece; these include Universal chess, Grand Chess, Gothic chess, Grotesque chess, Ladorean chess, Schoolbook chess, and Univers chess which adopted the starting lineup of Universal chess and used it on a 10×8 board, and Embassy chess which uses a starting position identical to Grand Chess adapted to a 10×8 board.

Aberg&#x27;s variation has the same setup as the historic ancestor Carrera&#x27;s chess. Aberg followed Murray&#x27;s description, which was wrong, and invented a new game by switching the archbishop and the chancellor, thus reaching exactly the setup proposed by the 17th century Italian master.

In 2004, David Paulowich proposed an arrangement that was included in ChessV as &quot;Capablanca Chess, Paulowich Variant&quot;. John Kipling Lewis re-invented it independently in 2007, giving it the name of Victorian Chess.

Capablanca random chess applies the concept of Fischer Random Chess to Capablanca chess, except with additional restrictions for the starting setup:
* All pawns in the starting positions must be protected by at least one piece.
* Bishops cannot start on neighboring squares.
* The queen and the archbishop must start on opposite-colored squares.
* The starting position cannot be that of Gothic chess.

In total, there are 12,118 starting positions in Capablanca random chess.

===Using a different board===
Some variants of Capablanca Chess do not use the standard 10×8 board. For example, Grand Chess, a popular variant invented by Dutch game designer Christian Freeling in 1984, uses Capablanca chess pieces on a 10×10 board. The layout allows the rooks early mobility.

====Seirawan chess====
Seirawan chess (or S-Chess) is a Capablanca chess variant by Yasser Seirawan and Bruce Harper that uses a standard 8x8 chess board. The initial position is that of standard chess. Each side has additionally two pieces in hand (called a hawk and an elephant in Seirawan Chess):
* The elephant, moves as a rook or a knight (this piece is better known as chancellor or empress); and
* The hawk, moves as a bishop or a knight (this piece is better known as archbishop or princess).

The elephant and the hawk are introduced to the game in the following way: whenever the player moves a piece (king, queen, knight, bishop or rook) from its starting position (that hasn&#x27;t already been moved), one of the pieces in hand may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. One cannot use the placing of an elephant or hawk to block check. If the player moves all his pieces from the first without placing one or both in hand pieces, he forfeits the right to do so. After castling, the player may put one of the pieces in hand on either the king&#x27;s or the rook&#x27;s square, but he may not place both pieces in hand in the same turn. Pawns may promote to a hawk or an elephant in this game (in addition to the normal chess pieces).

When notating games in algebraic notation, the letter E is used for the elephant and H for the hawk. If the player places one of the two pieces on the board, it is written after a slash. For example, 1. Nc3/E means that the player moved his knight from b1 to c3 and placed the elephant on b1.

==Strategy==
H. G. Muller suggested the following estimated piece values:
On the wider board, bishops gain in value, because both of its forward moves become likely to attack the enemy camp. (In cylindrical chess, bishops become even more valuable, having a base value of 4 pawns compared to 5 for the rook.) Thus in Capablanca chess, two bishops are clearly superior to two knights, and closer in value to two knights plus pawn.

There is in addition a strong &quot;leveling effect&quot;: the strong pieces (archbishop, chancellor, and queen) cannot display their superiority against a large number of weaker pieces, because the weaker pieces can restrict them. (For example, a queen attacked by a knight must usually move to avoid capture, and cannot rely on being defended; but a knight attacked by a queen need not fear.) Thus sacrificing a strong piece for rook and minor, or three minor pieces, can give significant compensation (greater than a pawn) because it increases the value of one&#x27;s remaining strong pieces relative to the opponent&#x27;s.

<text>The Susquehanna River ( ; Lenape: ) is a major river located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, crossing three lower Northeast states (New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland). At long, it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States. By watershed area, it is the 16th-largest river in the United States, and also the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic.

The Susquehanna River forms from two main branches: the North Branch, which rises in Cooperstown, New York, and is regarded by federal mapmakers as the main branch or headwaters, and the West Branch, which rises in western Pennsylvania and joins the main branch near Northumberland in central Pennsylvania.

The river drains , including nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania. The drainage basin includes portions of the Allegheny Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains, cutting through a succession of water gaps in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland in the lateral near-parallel array of mountain ridges. The river empties into the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at Perryville and Havre de Grace, Maryland, providing half of the Bay&#x27;s freshwater inflow. The bay lies in the flooded valley, or &quot;ria&quot;, of the Susquehanna.

==Geology==
The Susquehanna River is one of the oldest existing rivers in the world, being dated as 320–340 Myr, older than the mountain ridges through which it flows. These ridges resulted from the Alleghenian orogeny uplift events, when Africa (as part of Gondwana) slammed into the Northern part of Euramerica. The Susquehanna basin reaches its ultimate outflow in the Chesapeake Bay. It was well established in the flat tidelands of eastern North America during the Mesozoic era about 252 to 66 million years ago. This is the same period when the Hudson, Delaware and Potomac rivers were established.

==Course==
Both branches and the lower Susquehanna were part of important regional transportation corridors. The river was extensively used for muscle-powered ferries, boats, and canal boat shipping of bulk goods in the brief decades before the Pennsylvania Canal System was eclipsed by the coming of age of steam-powered railways. While the railroad industry has been less prevalent since the closures and mergers of the 1950s–1960s, a wide-ranging rail transportation infrastructure still operates along the river&#x27;s shores.
===North Branch Susquehanna===
Also called the Main Branch Susquehanna, the longer branch of the river rises at the outlet of Otsego Lake in Cooperstown, New York. From there, the north branch of the river runs west-southwest through rural farmland and dairy country, receiving the Unadilla River at Sidney. It dips south into Pennsylvania briefly to turn sharply 90 degrees west at Susquehanna and again 90 degrees north at Great Bend hooking back into New York. It receives the Chenango in downtown Binghamton. After meandering westwards, it turns south crossing the line again through the twin towns of Waverly, New York, and Sayre, Pennsylvania, and their large right bank railyard, once briefly holding the largest structure in the United States devoted to the maintenance and construction of railroad locomotives.

A couple of miles south, in Athens Township, Pennsylvania, it receives the Chemung from the northwest. It makes a right-angle curve between Sayre and Towanda to cut through the Endless Mountains in the Allegheny Plateau of Pennsylvania. It receives the Lackawanna River southwest of Scranton and turns sharply to the southwest, flowing through the former anthracite industrial heartland in the mountain ridges of northeastern Pennsylvania, past Pittston City (Greater Pittston), Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, Shickshinny, Berwick, Bloomsburg, and Danville, before receiving the West Branch at Northumberland.

===West Branch Susquehanna===
The origin of the official West Branch is near Elmora, Pennsylvania, in northern Cambria County near the contemporary and US Route 219 (locally Plank Road). It travels northeasterly through the towns of Northern Cambria, Cherry Tree, Burnside, Mahaffey and Curwensville (where the river is dammed to form a lake), into and through Clearfield, where it receives Clearfield Creek.

The West Branch turns to the southeast and passes Karthaus (at Mosquito Creek), Keating (at Sinnemahoning Creek), Renovo and Lock Haven, where it receives Bald Eagle Creek. At Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, Pine Creek, the largest tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River, is received. Pine Creek has the largest watershed of all the West Branch’s tributaries. It passes Williamsport, where both Lycoming Creek and Loyalsock Creek empty into it, then turns south, passing Lewisburg, before joining the North Branch flowing from the northwest at Northumberland.

===Main Susquehanna flow===

Downstream from the confluence of its branches in Northumberland, the river flows south past Selinsgrove, where it is joined by its Penns Creek tributary, and cuts through a water gap at the western end of Mahantongo Mountain. It receives the Juniata River from the northwest at Duncannon, then passes through its last water gap, the Susquehanna Gap through the Blue Mountain Ridge, just northwest of Harrisburg.

Downtown Harrisburg developed on the east side of the river, which is nearly a mile wide here. Harrisburg is the largest city located on the lower river, which flows southeast across South Central Pennsylvania, forming the border between York and Lancaster counties, and receiving Swatara Creek from the northeast. It crosses into northern Maryland approximately northeast of Baltimore and is joined by Octoraro Creek from the northeast and Deer Creek from the northwest. The river enters the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at Havre de Grace. Concord Point Light was built here in 1827 to accommodate the increasing navigational traffic.

==Etymology==
&quot;Susquehanna&quot; may come from the Lenape (Delaware) word &quot;siskëwahane&quot; meaning &quot;Muddy River&quot;. Alternatively, it may come from the Lenape (Delaware) term &quot;Sisa&#x27;we&#x27;hak&#x27;hanna&quot;, which means &quot;Oyster River&quot;. Oyster beds were widespread in the bay near the mouth of the river, which the Lenape farmed. They left oyster shell middens at their villages. A third account translates &quot;Susquehanna&quot; from the Susquehannock language, of the Iroquoian family, as &quot;the stream that falls toward the south&quot; or &quot;long-crooked-river&quot;.

The Lenape are an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who had communities ranging from coastal Connecticut through New York and Long Island, and further south into New Jersey and Delaware in the mid-Atlantic area. Their settlements in Pennsylvania included &quot;Con&#x27;esto&#x27;ga&quot; (&quot;Roof-place&quot; or &quot;town&quot;, modern Washington Boro, Lancaster County), also called &quot;Ka&#x27;ot&#x27;sch&#x27;ie&#x27;ra&quot; (&quot;Place-crawfish&quot;, modern Chickisalunga, Lancaster County), or &quot;Gasch&#x27;guch&#x27;sa&quot; (&quot;Great-fall-in-river&quot;, modern Conewago Falls, Lancaster County). They were called &quot;Minquas&quot; (&quot;quite different&quot;), or &quot;Sisa&#x27;we&#x27;hak&#x27;hanna&#x27;lenno&#x27;wak&quot; (&quot;Oyster-river-people&quot;) by others. The Lenape also called the area &quot;Sisa&#x27;we&#x27;hak&#x27;hanna&#x27;unk&quot; (&quot;Oyster-river-place&quot;).

Peoples of the mid-Atlantic Coast included coastal peoples who spoke Algonquian languages, such as the Lenape (whose bands spoke three dialects of Lenape), and Iroquoian languages-speaking peoples of the interior, such as the Eroni and the Five Nations of the Iroquois League, or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, based largely in present-day New York and upper Pennsylvania around the Great Lakes. The English of Pennsylvania referred to the Eroni people of Conestoga as &quot;Susquehannocks&quot; or &quot;Susquehannock Indians&quot;, a name derived from the Lenape term. In addition, John Smith of Jamestown, Virginia, labeled their settlement as &quot;Sasquesahanough&quot; on his 1612 map when he explored the upper Chesapeake Bay area.

In Virginia and other southern colonies, Siouan-speaking tribes constituted a third major language family, with their peoples occupying much of the middle areas of the interior. Algongquian-speaking peoples predominated in the coastal areas. Iroquoian speakers, such as the Cherokee and Tuscarora peoples, generally occupied areas to the interior near the Piedmont and foothills.

==History==

In 1615, the river was traversed by the French explorer Étienne Brûlé. In the 1670s the Conestoga, or Susquehannock people, succumbed to Iroquois conquest by the powerful Five Nations of the Iroquois League based in present-day New York, who wanted to control the fur trade with Europeans. The Susquehannock assimilated with the Iroquois. In the aftermath, the Iroquois resettled some of the semi-tributary Lenape in this area, as it was near the western boundary of the Lenape&#x27;s former territory, known as Lenapehoking.

The Susquehanna River has continued to play an important role throughout the history of the United States. In the 18th century, William Penn, the founder of the Pennsylvania Colony, negotiated with the Lenape to allow white settlement in the area between the Delaware River and the Susquehanna, which was part of Lenape territory. In late colonial times, the river became an increasingly important transportation corridor, used to ship anthracite coal, discovered by Necho Allen, from its upper reaches in the mountains to the markets downriver.

In 1779 during the American Revolutionary War, General James Clinton led an expedition down the Susquehanna from its headwaters. His party had made the upper portion navigable by damming the river&#x27;s source at Otsego Lake, allowing the lake&#x27;s level to rise, and then destroying the dam and flooding the river in order for his flotilla to travel for miles downstream. James Fenimore Cooper described this event in the introduction to his historical novel &quot;The Pioneers&quot; (1823).

At Athens, Pennsylvania, then known as Tioga or &quot;Tioga Point&quot;, Clinton met with General John Sullivan and his forces, who had marched from Easton, Pennsylvania. Together on August 29, they defeated the Tories and warriors of allied Iroquois bands at the Battle of Newtown (near present-day Elmira, New York). This was part of what was known as the &quot;Sullivan-Clinton Campaign&quot; or the &quot;Sullivan Expedition&quot;. They swept through western New York, dominated by the Seneca people, destroying more than 40 Seneca villages, as well as the stores of crops the people had set aside for winter. Many of the Iroquois left New York and went to Canada as refugees; casualties from exposure and starvation were high that winter.

Following the United States gaining independence in the Revolutionary War, in 1790 Colonel Timothy Matlack, Samuel Maclay and John Adlum were commissioned by the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to survey the headwaters of the Susquehanna river. They were to explore a route for a passage to connect the West Branch with the waters of the Allegheny River, which flowed to Pittsburgh and the Ohio River. In 1792, the Union Canal was proposed in order to link the Susquehanna and the Delaware rivers in Pennsylvania along Swatara and Tulpehocken creeks. In the 19th century, many industrial centers developed along the Susquehanna, using its water power to drive mills and coal machinery, to cool machines, and as a waterway for the transport of raw and manufactured goods.

Based on colonial charters, both Pennsylvania and Connecticut claimed land in the Wyoming Valley along the Susquehanna. Connecticut founded Westmoreland County here and defended its claim in the Pennamite Wars. Under federal arbitration, eventually the state ceded this territory to Pennsylvania.

In the 1790s English Lake Poets Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Lovell formulated the &quot;Pantisocracy Plan&quot; to marry three sisters and move to the banks of the Susquehanna River to start a socialist experiment. They made the marriages but Southey moved to Lisbon, Portugal, to visit an uncle, and they abandoned the plan to move to the United States.

In 1833 John B. Jervis began a canal system to extend the Chenango River and connect the waters of the Susquehanna from Chenango Point to the Erie Canal, which ran through the Mohawk Valley of New York, ultimately connecting with Lake Erie through the Wood Canal. In October 1836, water from the Susquehanna was connected to the Erie Canal at Utica, New York. Water travel was the main form of transportation during that era. The Erie Canal dramatically expanded trade between communities around the Great Lakes and markets in New York and Pennsylvania. With the expansion of construction of railroad lines, canal-transport became unprofitable, as it could not compete in speed or flexibility. Boats had to climb a net height of between basins, requiring the use of more than 100 water locks, which were too expensive to be maintained under the new competition.

The Susquehanna River figures in the history of the Latter Day Saint movement. It holds that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the priesthood from heavenly beings at a site along the Susquehanna and performed their first baptisms of Latter Day Saints in the North Branch of the river. Smith and Cowdery said that they were visited on May 15, 1829, by the resurrected John the Baptist and given the Aaronic priesthood. Following his visit, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other in the river. Later that year, they said they were visited near the river by the apostles Peter, James and John. Both events took place in unspecified locations near the river&#x27;s shore in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania.

During the Civil War&#x27;s 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, Union Major General Darius N. Couch, commander of the Department of the Susquehanna, resolved that Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army of Northern Virginia would not cross the Susquehanna. He positioned militia units under Maj. Granville Haller to protect key bridges in Harrisburg and Wrightsville, as well as nearby fords. Confederate forces reached the river at several locations in Cumberland and York counties.

In 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the New York-Pennsylvania border, dropping as much as of rain on the hilly lands. Much of that precipitation was received into the Susquehanna from its western tributaries, and the valley suffered disastrous flooding. Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was among the hardest-hit communities and the capital Harrisburg was flooded. The Chesapeake Bay received so much fresh water that it altered the ecosystem, killing much of the marine life that depended on saltwater.

The Mid-Atlantic Flood of June 2006, caused by a stalled jet stream-driven storm system, affected portions of the river system. The worst affected area was Binghamton, New York, where record-setting flood levels forced the evacuation of thousands of residents.

In September 2011 the Susquehanna River and its communities were hit by Tropical Storm Lee, which caused the worst flooding since Agnes in 1972.

==Bridges, ferries, canals and dams==
The Susquehanna River is important in the transportation history of the United States. Before the Port Deposit Bridge opened in 1818, the river formed a barrier between the northern and southern states, as it could be crossed only by ferry. The earliest dams were constructed to support ferry operations in low water. The presence of many rapids in the river meant that while commercial traffic could navigate down the river in the high waters of the spring thaws, nothing could move up.The Susquehanna was improved by navigations throughout the 1820s and 1830s as the Pennsylvania Canal. Together with facilities of the Allegheny Portage Railroad, loaded barges were transferred from the canal and hoisted across the mountain ridge into the Pittsburgh area with access to the Monongahela, Allegheny Rivers and their confluence into the Ohio River flowing southwest towards the Mississippi River. The Union Canal was completed in 1828 to connect the Schuylkill River (flowing southeast towards the Delaware River at Philadelphia) at Reading westwards to the Susquehanna River above the state capital of Harrisburg. Competition from faster transport via the railroad industry by the 1850s resulted in reducing the reliance on the river for transport.Two canal systems were constructed on the lower Susquehanna to bypass the rapids. The first was the Susquehanna Canal, also called the Conowingo Canal or the Port Deposit Canal, completed in 1802 by a Maryland company known as the Proprietors of the Susquehanna Canal. The second was the much longer and more successful Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal. The canals required dams to provide canal water and navigation pools.

As the industrial age progressed, bridges replaced ferries, and railroads replaced canals. The railroads were often constructed on top of the canal right-of-way along the river. Many canal remnants can be seen; for example, in Havre de Grace, Maryland, along US Route 15 in Pennsylvania, and in upstate New York at various locations. These latter remnants are parts of the upstream divisions of the Pennsylvania Canal, of privately funded canals, and of canals in the New York system.Today 200 bridges cross the Susquehanna. The Rockville Bridge, which crosses the river from Harrisburg to Marysville, Pennsylvania, is the longest stone masonry arch bridge in the world. It was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1902, replacing an earlier iron bridge. Two seasonal ferries operate across the Susquehanna. The Millersburg Ferry at Millersburg, Pennsylvania, is a practical ferry for up to four vehicles and 50 passengers, while the &quot;Pride of the Susquehanna&quot;, based at Harrisburg, provides a passenger-only pleasure cruise.

Most of the canals have been filled in or are partially preserved as a part of historical parks. Dams generally are used to generate power or to provide lakes for recreation.

==Environmental threats==
The environmental group American Rivers named the Susquehanna &quot;America&#x27;s Most Endangered River for 2005&quot; because of the excessive pollution it receives. Most of the pollution in the river is caused by excess animal manure from farming, agricultural runoff, urban and suburban stormwater runoff, and raw or inadequately treated sewage. In 2003 the river contributed 50% of the freshwater, 44% of the nitrogen, 21% of the phosphorus, and 21% of the sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.

It was designated as one of the American Heritage Rivers in 1997. The designation provides for technical assistance from federal agencies to state and local governments working in the Susquehanna watershed.

Another environmental concern is radioactivity released during the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. However, extensive radionuclide studies over a 25-year period from 1979 through 2003, confirm that the Three Mile Island accident has not resulted in any harmful radiation effects. The areas in and along a 262-km length of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania were monitored for the presence of radioactive materials. This study began two months after the 1979 Three Mile Island (TMI) partial reactor meltdown; it spanned the next 25 years. Monitoring points included stations at the PPL Susquehanna and TMI nuclear power plants. Monthly gamma measurements documented concentrations of radionuclides from natural and anthropogenic sources. During this study, various series of gamma-emitting radionuclide concentration measurements were made in many general categories of animals, plants, and other inorganic matter, both within and near the river. Sampling began in 1979 before the first start-up of the PPL Susquehanna power plant. Although all species were not continuously monitored for the entire period, an extensive database was compiled. In May 1986, ongoing measurements from several monitoring stations along the river near Three Mile Island, Peach Bottom and Calvert Cliffs detected iodine-131 beta particles attributable to fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The remaining reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station was shut down in 2019.

In 2015, a smallmouth bass with a rare, cancerous tumor was caught from the river, raising renewed concerns about toxic materials and water pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency reported, &quot;we do not have sufficient data at this time to scientifically support listing the main stem of the Susquehanna as impaired.&quot;

==Recreation==
The Susquehanna River has attracted boaters who watch or fish for its migratory species. Many tourists and local residents use the Susquehanna in the summer for recreation purposes such as kayaking, canoeing, and motor-boating. Due to the high volume of smallmouth bass in the river, it is the host of numerous bass fishing tournaments each year and is regarded by many as one of the premier bass fishing rivers in North America. Canoe races are held annually on various sections of the river, such as the amateur race held in Oneonta, New York.

Susquehanna rowing and paddling have a long history. Starting in 1874, rowers from Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, raced men from Sunbury. The General Clinton Canoe Regatta, a flat-water race, takes place each year in Bainbridge, New York, on Memorial Day weekend. Binghamton University Crew and Hiawatha Island Boat Club are also located on the river, in the Southern Tier of New York.

The Appalachian Trail passes through Duncannon, Pennsylvania, and crosses the Susquehanna on the Clarks Ferry Bridge.

<text>Detasheet is a flexible rubberized explosive, somewhat similar to plastic explosives, originally manufactured by DuPont. Its ingredients are PETN with nitrocellulose and a binder.

== Properties ==
It was manufactured in thin flexible sheets with a rubbery texture, technically known as a rubberized explosive and is generally colored either reddish/orange (commercial) or green (military). In use, it is typically cut to shape for precision engineering charges.

Compared to other explosives detasheet is very stable. It is detonated with a blasting cap or primercord but not by small-arms fire, heat, water, pressure, or concussion. Detasheet is relatively expensive compared to other explosives.

=== Ingredients ===
Detasheet C, the last and most common version produced, was made up of 63% PETN, 8% nitrocellulose, and 29% acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), an organic plasticizer.

=== Production status ===
DuPont ceased manufacturing explosives in the 1990s and when they did the Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense Company bought their product line, including all their equipment and trademarks. The Detasheet trademark is now owned by the Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense Company, which has been selling an identical explosive sheet product called Primasheet since 1984. Primasheet-1000 and Detasheet are identical and when purchased the packaging contains both trademarks.

== Deta Flex ==
A military variant of Detasheet, called Deta Flex, was manufactured in a single thickness (0.25 inch (6.25 mm)) and olive green colored. Deta Flex contains a higher percentage of PETN (70%).

=== LX-02-1 ===
A version of Deta Flex is manufactured for Department of Energy research purposes, colored blue and manufactured in various thicknesses. LX-02-1 contains 73.5% PETN, 17.6% butyl rubber, 6.9% ATBC, and 2.0% Cab-o-sil.
