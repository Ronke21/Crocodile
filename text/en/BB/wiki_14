<text>Beck&#x27;s Brewery, also known as Brauerei Beck &amp; Co., is a brewery in the northern German city of Bremen. In 2001, Interbrew bought Brauerei Beck for 1.8 billion euros; at that time it was the fourth-largest brewer in Germany. US manufacture of Beck&#x27;s has been based in St. Louis, Missouri, since early 2012.

Since 2008, it has been owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV subsidiary Interbrew.

Beck&#x27;s key logo is based upon the city of Bremen&#x27;s coat of arms, which contains a key attributed to the patron saint of the city, Saint Peter.

The brewery sponsored Jaguar in Formula 1 until 2004.

<text>The Duwamish River () is the name of the lower of Washington state&#x27;s Green River. Its industrialized estuary is known as the Duwamish Waterway. Although heavily polluted, it is an important habitat for the wildlife. Important to the Duwamish people, the Duwamish Longhouse and Cultural Center is on the west bank of the river and several parks have indigenous Lushootseed names .

==Name==
In the Lushootseed language, the name of the Duwamish River (and of the Cedar River) is &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;inside.&quot; The Lushootseed name for the Duwamish people, who lived along the river and its tributaries, is &quot;dxʷdəwʔabš&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the inside.&quot; 
== History ==


For thousands of years, the Duwamish people have lived along the Duwamish River and its tributaries. The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation along the Duwamish River dates back to the 6th century CE. The Duwamish traditionally used the river to hunt ducks and geese, fish for salmon, cod, and halibut, harvest clams, and gather berries, camas, and other plants for food and medicinal purposes. When the first American settlers came to what is now the Seattle area in 1851, the Duwamish lived in more than 90 longhouses, in at least 17 villages.

Native villages on the Duwamish were eventually supplanted by white settlements and commercial uses, and there was evidence of deliberate burning of Indian longhouses in 1893. Duwamish people continued to work and fish in the area, using man-made &quot;Ballast Island&quot; on the Seattle waterfront as a canoe haul-out and informal market, but by the early 20th Century, most remnants of traditional life along the river had disappeared.

Until 1906, the White and Green Rivers combined at Auburn, and joined the Black River at Tukwila to form the Duwamish. In 1906, however, the White River changed course following a major flood and emptied into the Puyallup River as it does today. The lower portion of the historic White River—from the historic confluence of the White and Green Rivers to the confluence with the Black River—is now considered part of the Green River. Later, in 1911 the Cedar River was diverted to empty into Lake Washington instead of into the Black River; at that time, the lake itself still emptied into the Black River. Then, with the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916, the lake&#x27;s level dropped nearly nine feet and the Black River dried up. From that time forward, the point of the name change from Green to Duwamish is no longer the confluence of the Green and Black Rivers, though it has not changed location.

The last year-round Duwamish residents on the river – an old man named Seetoowathl, and his wife – died of starvation in their float-house on Kellogg Island in the winter of 1920.

In 2009, the Duwamish Longhouse and Cultural Center was opened on the west bank of the river as part of the Duwamish Tribal Organization&#x27;s reassertion of its historic rights in the area and its continuing struggle for federal recognition as the Duwamish Tribe.

=== Duwamish Waterway ===

As of the present day, the Duwamish Waterway empties into Elliott Bay in Seattle. The waterway was completed after the completion of the man-made Harbor Island in 1909. The waterway is now divided into two channels, the East and West Waterways.

In 1895, Eugene Semple, who had earlier served as Governor of Washington Territory, outlined a plan for a series of major public works projects in the Seattle area, including the straightening and dredging of the Duwamish River, both to open up the area to commercial use and to alleviate flooding. In 1909 the City of Seattle formed the Duwamish Waterway Commission to sell bonds and oversee the re-channelling of the river. Work began in October 1913, and the oxbows gradually disappeared, with a few recesses in the channel left to accommodate high water flows and turning ships. Parts of the Georgetown and South Park neighborhoods once on quiet riverbank found themselves inland; the Georgetown Steam Plant was now almost a mile from the river, and special water pumping facilities had to be installed. By 1920, 4½ miles of the Duwamish Waterway had been dredged to a depth of 50 feet, with 20 million cubic feet of mud and sand going into the expansion of Harbor Island. The shallow, meandering, nine-mile-long river became a five-mile engineered waterway capable of handling ocean-going vessels.

The Duwamish basin soon became Seattle&#x27;s industrial and commercial core area. Activities included cargo handling and storage, marine construction, ship and boat manufacturing, concrete manufacturing, paper and metals fabrication, food processing, and countless other industrial operations. Boeing Plant 1 was established on the Lower Duwamish in 1916, and Boeing Plant 2, further upriver, in 1936.

=== Pollution ===

Due to 20th century industrial contamination, the lower of the Duwamish Waterway was declared a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2001. The contaminants include PCBs, PAHs, arsenic, mercury, and phthalates, discharged from multiple industries.

The cleanup included a plan for an &quot;early action&quot; or hotspot cleanup proposed to dredge contaminated sediment and dump the resulting sludge in Tacoma&#x27;s Commencement Bay, to the southwest. Opposition to this plan in both Seattle and Tacoma forced the sludge to be shipped to Klickitat County in south central Washington instead of disposal in Puget Sound. EPA has identified responsible parties for the pollution and in 2014 it published a final cleanup plan. By late 2015, 50 percent of the PCB-contaminated sediment had been removed. As of 2022, cleanup and restoration efforts are ongoing.

The Duwamish River faces other types of pollution such as fecal coliform bacteria, caused by combined sewer overflows. If these overflows were to be cleaned up, the overall quality of the water would not improve much. The river&#x27;s most common pollutant is petroleum. Other common contamination occurs from farms, surface runoff, or failing septic tanks.

With the spread of ecological concerns in the 1970s, various environmental, tribal, and community organizations became interested in the severely polluted Duwamish River and Waterway. Kellogg Island, the last remnant of the original river, was declared a wildlife preserve, and nearby terminal T-107 was converted into a park, creating a substantial natural area near the mouth of the river. In 2001, the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition (DRCC) was established as a community advisory group in response to the EPA declaring the Duwamish a Superfund site. As of 2023, the DRCC continues to organize cleanup events, provide community education, and campaign for environmental justice.

==Wildlife==

Despite the industrialization of the Duwamish river, it remains an important habitat for the wildlife in the area. Thousands of salmon and trout that visit the marshes and estuaries each year to spawn. The Duwamish supports chinook, coho, chum and steelhead, as well as the more rare sockeye, sea-run cutthroat trout and bull trout. Pink salmon run in the millions every odd-numbered years in recent history. Canada geese, great blue herons, starlings, cormorants, pigeons, buffleheads, Caspian terns, warblers, hawks, ospreys, bald eagles, and numerous waterfowl call the river home and can be seen feeding in and around its waters.

Many of the animal species found in or around the river contain an unhealthy amount of contaminants. For example, other than salmon, any type of fish or shellfish found in the river is unfit for human consumption. It was found that PCB levels in fish and crab that live in the waterway most of their lives are 35 to 110 times higher than in Puget Sound salmon. The Ecological Risk Assessment also found that river otters from the Lower Duwamish River might be exposed to such high levels of PCBs that the growth or survival of their offspring may be reduced.

==Recreation==

The Port of Seattle owns several properties along the Duwamish River and industrial channels. In 2020, a set of six parks were renamed to use Indigenous Lushootseed names following consultation with local tribes.
== Bridges ==

The Duwamish Waterway is spanned by four major, public bridges: the First Avenue South Bridge, the South Park Bridge, the Spokane Street Bridge, and, directly above the latter, the West Seattle Bridge. Historically, the West Spokane Street Bridge also crossed the west fork of the Duwamish Waterway from 1924 until the 1970s and 1980s.

<doc id="228222" wikidata="Q6447249" url="?curid=228222" title="Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)">
<text>Kurtz is a fictional character in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1899 novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. A European ivory trader in Central Africa and commander of a trading post, he monopolizes his position as a demigod among native Africans. Kurtz meets with the novella&#x27;s protagonist, Charles Marlow, who returns him to the coast via steamboat. Kurtz, whose reputation precedes him, impresses Marlow strongly, and during the return journey, Marlow is witness to Kurtz&#x27;s final moments.

== In the novella ==
Kurtz is an ivory trader, sent by a shadowy Belgian company into the heart of an unnamed place in Africa (generally regarded as the Congo Free State). With the help of his superior technology, Kurtz has turned himself into a charismatic demigod of all the tribes surrounding his station and gathered vast quantities of ivory in this way. As a result, his name is known throughout the region. Kurtz&#x27;s general manager is envious of Kurtz and plots his downfall.

Kurtz&#x27;s mother was half English, his father was half French and thus &quot;All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz.&quot; As the reader finds out at the end, Kurtz is a multitalented man—painter, musician, writer, promising politician. He starts out, years before the novel begins, as an imperialist in the best tradition of the &quot;white man&#x27;s burden&quot;. The reader is introduced to a painting of Kurtz&#x27;s, depicting a blindfolded woman bearing a torch against a nearly black background, and clearly symbolic of his former views. Kurtz&#x27;s painting suggests that he saw himself as a civilizing force, aiming to educate and enlighten the African continent, which was then often referred to as the &quot;dark continent&quot; due to its perceived unknownness and perceived backwardness by European colonizers. Kurtz is also the author of a pamphlet regarding the civilization of the natives.
The presence of his admirer, the Russian &quot;Harlequin&quot;, and what he reveals about Kurtz in his adulatory descriptions of him raises questions about Kurtz&#x27;s actual beliefs and the sincerity of his progressive views.

However, over the course of his stay in Africa, Kurtz becomes corrupted. He takes his pamphlet and scribbles in, at the very end, the words &quot;Exterminate all the brutes!&quot; He induces the natives to worship him, setting up rituals and venerations worthy of a tyrant. By the time Marlow, the protagonist, sees Kurtz, he is ill with jungle fever and almost dead. Marlow seizes Kurtz and endeavours to take him back down the river in his steamboat. Kurtz dies on the boat with the last words, &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; Kurtz ultimately was changed by the jungle. At first, he wanted to bring civilization to the natives, as his painting shows, but by the end it seems he wants to &quot;exterminate&quot; them.

== Basis ==
Kurtz&#x27;s persona is generally understood to derive from the notoriously brutal history of the so-called Congo Free State, a territory that existed as the private property of King Leopold II from 1885 to 1908 until it was taken over by Belgium and became a Belgian colony. In his book &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, historian Adam Hochschild suggests that Léon Rom, an administrator in the Congo Free State, was the principal inspiration for the Kurtz character, citing references as the heads on the stakes outside of the station and other similarities between the two.

Hochschild and other authors have also suggested that the fate of the disastrous &quot;rear column&quot; of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (1886–1888) on the Congo may have also been an influence. Column leader Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, &quot;went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered&quot;. Harold Bloom notes that Kurtz&#x27;s sophisticated brutality is closer to that of Barttelot&#x27;s associate, slave trader Tippu Tip.
The rear column&#x27;s Scottish naturalist, James Sligo Jameson, who died in the Congo a few months after watching while a slave girl for whom he had paid was killed and eaten by cannibals, has also been suggested.
The expedition&#x27;s overall leader, Henry Morton Stanley, the principal figure involved in preparing the Congo for Leopold&#x27;s rule, may also have been an influence.

Conrad&#x27;s biographer Norman Sherry judged that Arthur Hodister (1847–1892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by Congolese to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis. Peter Firchow mentions the possibility that Kurtz is a composite, modelled on various figures present in the Congo Free State at the time as well as on Conrad&#x27;s imagining of what they might have had in common.

A personal acquaintance of Conrad&#x27;s, Georges Antoine Klein, may also have been a real-life basis for the character. Klein was an employee of the Brussels-based trading company &quot;Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo&quot;, and died shortly after being picked up on the steamboat Conrad was piloting. Further, means &quot;little&quot; in German, and as Marlow muses in the novella, means &quot;short&quot; in the same language.

Conrad also expressed admiration of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s Pacific Ocean writings, in particular, the stories &quot;The Beach of Falesá&quot; and &quot;The Ebb-Tide&quot;, as well as the non-fiction account of Tembinok&#x27; of the Gilbert Islands that appeared in &quot;In the South Seas&quot;. All three texts contain who manipulate their circumstances and remote settings to assert power over others. It is widely believed that Conrad drew influence from these characters, as well as Stevenson&#x27;s plot lines when writing &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.

==In other works==
=== Film ===
In the 1958 loose adaptation for the CBS television anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, Kurtz was played by Boris Karloff. This version uses the encounter between Marlow and Kurtz as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz&#x27;s adopted son.

Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s acclaimed Vietnam War film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) centers on the protagonist&#x27;s mission to find and kill the renegade Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando), based on Conrad&#x27;s character, who has gone rogue far up a river, deep in the Cambodian jungle. The script acknowledges &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as a source of inspiration, and the last words of Colonel Kurtz, &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot;, echo those of his namesake in the novel.

In the 1993 TNT version of the story directed by Nicolas Roeg, Kurtz, who has gone insane and is now doing the most horrible and blasphemous deeds, was portrayed by John Malkovich.

The 2020 documentary &quot;African Apocalypse&quot; follows the parallels between the fictional Kurtz and the brutal Paul Voulet, who led a murderous expedition into Niger in the year that &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; was published.

===Games===
The video game &quot;&quot; (2010) features a character in many ways similar to Kurtz, a man who refers to himself as Caesar. Caesar was initially a diplomat who went out into the post-apocalyptic world in an attempt to both increase the knowledge of the now tribal inhabitants and learn from their cultures to facilitate understanding in the wasteland. Caesar eventually went mad with power after becoming the de facto leader of one such tribe and led them in dismantling other tribes who then assimilated into his group. Now, he is the ruler of Caesar&#x27;s Legion, a vast army of tribals modelled after the Roman Empire. Like Kurtz, Caesar is an educated, charismatic figure who is worshipped as a god by his underlings; in Caesar&#x27;s case, his followers believe him to be the reincarnation of Mars, the Roman god of war.

The video game &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot; (2012), another modernized loose adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (set in a ruined Dubai), has a similar Kurtz figure named Colonel John Konrad (named after Joseph Conrad).

===Literature===
Timothy Findley&#x27;s novel &quot;Headhunter&quot; (1993) features Kurtz&#x27;s escape from &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and subsequent reign of terror over the city of Toronto as the psychiatrist-in-chief at the Parkin Institute.

The poem &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; by T.S. Eliot starts off with the line &quot;Mistah Kurtz – He Dead.&quot;

In Josef Škvorecký&#x27;s novel &quot;The Engineer of Human Souls&quot; Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism.

===Manga===

&quot;Who Fighter with Heart of Darkness&quot; is an anthology that includes a manga adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. Similarly to &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, the setting is changed to World War II–era Burma, where a soldier named Maruo is sent to hunt down the renegade Colonel Kurutsu.

<text>Liquore Galliano L&#x27;Autentico, known more commonly as Galliano (), is a brand of sweet herbal liqueur produced in Italy. It was created in 1896 by Tuscan distiller and brandy producer Arturo Vaccari and named after Giuseppe Galliano, an Italian officer of the Royal Italian Army of the First Italo-Ethiopian War.

Galliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woody herbal undernotes. The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as anisette, ouzo, sambuca, and pastis.

Galliano is used both as a digestif and as an ingredient for cocktails, notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Yellow Bird, Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream.

==Ingredients==
Galliano has numerous natural ingredients including star anise, Mediterranean anise, juniper berry, musk yarrow, lavender, peppermint, cinnamon, and Galliano&#x27;s hallmark vanilla flavour. Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening. Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano&#x27;s bright yellow colour.

Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla. In the final stage, distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. The original blend is formulated at 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume), while a blend with a more prominent taste of vanilla is produced at 60 proof (30% by volume). There was also a period where 70 proof (35% alcohol by volume) and 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume) was produced.

==Brand ownership==
The Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column. 

Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia, where the products are popular as shots.
Galliano also makes &quot;Galliano Ristretto&quot; coffee-flavored liqueur and &quot;Galliano Balsamico&quot;, a balsamic vinegar-infused liqueur.

==Awards==
Galliano has earned bronze and silver medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Another spirit ratings organization, &quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot;, gave Galliano L&#x27;autentico a score of &quot;90–95&quot; in 2011.

<text>The biceps or biceps brachii (, &quot;two-headed muscle of the arm&quot;) is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is attached to the upper forearm. While the long head of the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes and supinates the forearm. Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps screws in the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion).

== Structure ==

The biceps is one of three muscles in the anterior compartment of the upper arm, along with the brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the biceps shares a nerve supply. The biceps muscle has two heads, the short head and the long head, distinguished according to their origin at the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, respectively. From its origin on the glenoid, the long head remains tendinous as it passes through the shoulder joint and through the intertubercular groove of the humerus. Extending from its origin on the coracoid, the tendon of the short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis. Unlike the other muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm, the long head of the biceps muscle crosses two joints, the shoulder joint and the elbow joint.

Both heads of the biceps join in the middle upper arm to form a single muscle mass, usually near the insertion of the deltoid, to form a common muscle belly; although several anatomic studies have demonstrated that the muscle bellies remain distinct structures without confluent fibers. As the muscle extends distally, the two heads rotate 90 degrees externally before inserting onto the radial tuberosity. The short head inserts distally on the tuberosity while the long head inserts proximally closer to the apex of the tuberosity. The bicipital aponeurosis, also called the lacertus fibrosus, is a thick fascial band that organizes close to the musculotendinous junction of the biceps and radiates over and inserts onto the ulnar part of the antebrachial fascia.

The tendon that attaches to the radial tuberosity is partially or completely surrounded by a bursa, the bicipitoradial bursa, which ensures frictionless motion between the biceps tendon and the proximal radius during pronation and supination of the forearm.

Two muscles lie underneath the biceps brachii. These are the coracobrachialis muscle, which like the biceps attaches to the coracoid process of the scapula, and the brachialis muscle which connects to the ulna and along the mid-shaft of the humerus. Besides those, the brachioradialis muscle is adjacent to the biceps and also inserts on the radius bone, though more distally.

===Variation===
Traditionally described as a two-headed muscle, biceps brachii is one of the most variable muscles of the human body and has a third head arising from the humerus in 10% of cases (normal variation)—most commonly originating near the insertion of the coracobrachialis and joining the short head—but four, five, and even seven supernumerary heads have been reported in rare cases.

One study found a higher than expected number of female cadavers with a third head of biceps brachii, equal incidence between sides of the body, and uniform innervation by musculocutaneous nerve.

The distal biceps tendons are completely separated in 40% and in 25% of cases.
===Nerve supply===

The biceps shares its nerve supply with the other two muscles of the anterior compartment. The muscles are supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve. Fibers of the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves make up the components of the musculocutaneous nerve which supply the biceps.

=== Blood supply ===
The blood supply of the biceps is the brachial artery. The distal tendon of the biceps can be useful for palpating the brachial pulse, as the artery runs medial to the tendon in the cubital fossa.

== Function ==

The biceps works across three joints. The most important of these functions is to supinate the forearm and flex the elbow. Besides, the long head of biceps prevents the upward displacement of the head of the humerus. In more detail, the actions are, by joint:

* Proximal radioulnar joint of the elbow – The biceps brachii functions as a powerful supinator of the forearm, i.e. it turns the palm upwards. This action, which is aided by the supinator muscle, requires the humeroulnar joint of the elbow to be at least partially flexed. If the humeroulnar joint is fully extended, supination is then primarily carried out by the supinator muscle. The biceps is a particularly powerful supinator of the forearm due to the distal attachment of the muscle at the radial tuberosity, on the opposite side of the bone from the supinator muscle. When flexed, the biceps effectively pulls the radius back into its neutral supinated position in concert with the supinator muscle.
* Humeroulnar joint of the elbow – The biceps brachii also functions as an important flexor of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when lifting an object, such as a bag of groceries or when performing a biceps curl. When the forearm is in pronation (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex the forearm, with minimal contribution from the biceps brachii. Regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral) the force exerted by the biceps brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending on position than the biceps during concentric contractions. That is, the biceps can only exert so much force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.
* Glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) – Several weaker functions occur at the glenohumeral joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity and prevents an impingement of the supraspinatus tendon.
Motor units in the lateral portion of the long head of the biceps are preferentially activated during elbow flexion, while motor units in the medial portion are preferentially activated during forearm supination.

The biceps are usually attributed as representative of strength within a variety of worldwide cultures.

==Clinical significance==
The proximal tendons of the biceps brachii are commonly involved in pathological processes and are a frequent cause of anterior shoulder pain. Disorders of the distal biceps brachii tendon include insertional tendonitis and partial or complete tears of the tendon. Partial tears are usually characterized by pain and enlargement and abnormal contour of the tendon. Complete tears occur as avulsion of the tendinous portion of the biceps away from its insertion on the tuberosity of the radius, and is often accompanied by a palpable, audible &quot;pop&quot; and immediate pain and soft tissue swelling.

A soft-tissue mass is sometimes encountered in the anterior aspect of the arm, the so-called Reverse Popeye deformity, which paradoxically leads to a decreased strength during flexion of the elbow and supination of the forearm.

===Tendon rupture===
Tears of the biceps brachii may occur during athletic activities, however avulsion injuries of the distal biceps tendon are frequently occupational in nature and sustained during forceful, eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle while lifting.

Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.

===Training===
The biceps can be strengthened using weight and resistance training. Examples of well known biceps exercises are the chin-up and biceps curl.

==Etymology and grammar==
The biceps brachii muscle is the one that gave all muscles their name: it comes from the Latin &quot;musculus&quot;, &quot;little mouse&quot;, because the appearance of the flexed biceps resembles the back of a mouse. The same phenomenon occurred in Greek, in which μῦς, &quot;mȳs&quot;, means both &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;muscle&quot;.

The term &quot;biceps brachii&quot; is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;two-headed [muscle] of the arm&quot;, in reference to the fact that the muscle consists of two bundles of muscle, each with its own origin, sharing a common insertion point near the elbow joint. The proper plural form of the Latin adjective &quot;biceps&quot; is &quot;bicipites&quot;, a form not in general English use. Instead, &quot;biceps&quot; is used in both singular and plural (i.e., when referring to both arms).

The English form &quot;&quot;, attested from 1939, is a back formation derived from misinterpreting the &quot;s&quot; of &quot;biceps&quot; as the English plural marker &quot;-s&quot;.

Adriaan van den Spiegel called the biceps a &quot;Pisciculus&quot;) due to its fusiform shape, which is why in the Italian-language medical literature it is sometimes called &quot;il pescetto&quot;, &quot;the small fish&quot;.

==History==

Leonardo da Vinci expressed the original idea of the biceps acting as a supinator in a series of annotated drawings made between 1505 and 1510; in which the principle of the biceps as a supinator, as well as its role as a flexor to the elbow were devised. However, this function remained undiscovered by the medical community as da Vinci was not regarded as a teacher of anatomy, nor were his results publicly released. It was not until 1713 that this movement was re-discovered by William Cheselden and subsequently recorded for the medical community. It was rewritten several times by different authors wishing to present information to different audiences. The most notable recent expansion upon Cheselden&#x27;s recordings was written by Guillaume Duchenne in 1867, in a journal named &quot;Physiology of Motion&quot;. It remains one of the major references on supination action of the biceps brachii. 

==Other species==

===Neanderthals===
In Neanderthals, the radial bicipital tuberosities were larger than in modern humans, which suggests they were probably able to use their biceps for supination over a wider range of pronation-supination. It is possible that they relied more on their biceps for forceful supination without the assistance of the supinator muscle like in modern humans, and thus that they used a different movement when throwing.

===Horses===
In the horse, the biceps&#x27; function is to extend the shoulder and flex the elbow. It is composed of two short-fibred heads separated longitudinally by a thick internal tendon which stretches from the origin on the supraglenoid tubercle to the insertion on the medial radial tuberosity. This tendon can withstand very large forces when the biceps is stretched. From this internal tendon a strip of tendon, the &quot;lacertus fibrosus&quot;, connects the muscle with the extensor carpi radialis -- an important feature in the horse&#x27;s stay apparatus (through which the horse can rest and sleep whilst standing.)

<text>Paula Jane Radcliffe MBE (born 17 December 1973) is a British former long-distance runner. She is a three-time winner of the London Marathon (2002, 2003, 2005), three-time New York Marathon champion (2004, 2007, 2008), the 2002 Chicago Marathon winner and the 2005 World Champion in the Marathon from Helsinki. She was previously the fastest female marathoner of all time, and held the Women&#x27;s World Marathon Record with a time of 2:15:25 for 16 years from 2003 to 2019 when it was broken by Brigid Kosgei.

Radcliffe is a former world champion in the marathon, half marathon and cross country. She has also been European champion over 10,000 metres and in cross country. On the track, Radcliffe won the 10,000 metres silver medal at the 1999 World Championships and was the 2002 Commonwealth champion at 5000 metres. She represented Great Britain at the Olympics in four consecutive games (1996 to 2008), although she never won an Olympic medal.

Her running has earned her a number of accolades including the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, Laureus World Comeback of the Year, IAAF World Athlete of the Year, AIMS World Athlete of the Year (three times) and a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). She has also been nominated for World Sportswoman of the year on several occasions. In 2010, she was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the Loughborough University Hall of Fame in 2015.

She ended her competitive running career at the 2015 London Marathon.

==Early life==
Radcliffe was born on 17 December 1973 in Davenham near Northwich, Cheshire. Her family then moved to nearby Barnton where she attended Little Leigh Primary School. Despite suffering from asthma and anaemia, she took up running at the age of seven, influenced by her father who was a keen amateur marathon runner and joined Frodsham Athletic Club. Her family later moved to Kingsley.

When Radcliffe was aged 12, the family moved to Oakley, Bedfordshire and she became a member of Bedford &amp; County Athletics Club. Her joining the club coincided with a talented and dedicated coach, Alex Stanton, building the women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; sections into one of the strongest in the country, in spite of Bedford&#x27;s relatively small size.

Radcliffe&#x27;s father became club vice-chairman and her mother, a fun-runner, managed the women&#x27;s cross-country team. Her first race at a national level came as a 12-year-old in 1986 when she placed 299th out of around 600 in the girls&#x27; race of the English Schools Cross Country Championships. She finished fourth in the same race one year later.

Radcliffe attended Sharnbrook Upper School and Community College. She went on to study French, German and economics at Loughborough University, gaining a first-class honours degree in Modern European Studies.

==Running career==
Radcliffe&#x27;s father was a keen marathon runner as a young man. He took up the hobby again in an attempt to lose weight after giving up smoking. Despite suffering from asthma Radcliffe took up running at the age of seven. In 1992 Radcliffe discovered that she suffers from anaemia. Radcliffe was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at the age of 14 after blacking out whilst training. During her father&#x27;s training jogs in the woods, Radcliffe and her brother would often run with him for a mile or two. Radcliffe attended Frodsham Athletic Club until the age of nine, Radcliffe became a member of Bedford &amp; County Athletics Club, when they moved to Oakley. There she was coached by Alex Stanton, who still fulfilled that role in her professional career. Stanton started to coach Radcliffe at the age of 12 after his wife Rosemary spotted her talent. At the age of 10 Radcliffe, accompanied by her father, watched Ingrid Kristiansen run in the London Marathon, inspiring her to become an athlete. Her first race at a national level came as a 12-year-old in 1986, when she placed 299th in the English Schools Cross Country Championships. In 1991 Radcliffe won the English Schools 1500 metres title.

===1992–1996===
 At the 1992 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, Radcliffe, took the Junior title, beating Wang Junxia and Gete Wami in Boston, after recovering from a bad asthma attack in the weeks beforehand. Radcliffe then went to the Junior track World championships and finished fourth in the 3,000 metres. In her first senior race, in Durham at the start of 1993, Radcliffe finished second to Olympic Champion Derartu Tulu. At the age of 19 Radcliffe finished in seventh place at the 1993 World Championships. Radcliffe claimed back to back World Cross Challenge wins at Durham and Mallusk to start the 1994 season. Radcliffe missed the World Cross Country Championships with a foot injury. Radcliffe was initially misdiagnosed with the injury which forced her to miss all of 1994 and thought about quitting as the injury would not get better. At the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo in 1995 Radcliffe outkicked Tulu to run the third fastest time by a British woman for the 5,000 metres. At the World championships, Radcliffe qualified comfortably for the final of the 5,000 metres, where she finished fifth. At the 1996 Securicor Games Radcliffe ran the 5,000 metres finishing second. The Olympic Games saw Radcliffe finish fifth in the 5,000 metres. Radcliffe rounded off 1996 by finishing third in a cross country race in Durham.

===1997–2000===
1997 saw Radcliffe split Wami and Tulu, and win the silver medal at the 1997 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Radcliffe became the first woman to defend the Fifth Avenue Mile title. In the 1997 World Championships, Radcliffe finished in 4th place over the 5,000 metres. Wami again outsprinted Radcliffe in her final race of 1997, in the Brussels cross country event. Radcliffe had dropped out of Durham&#x27;s cross country race with flu at the start of 1998, but bounced back to finish third in Dublin. At the 1998 edition of the World Cross Country, Radcliffe again won the silver medal. Radcliffe set a new world best for on the road around Balmoral Castle. At the European Cup Radcliffe, captaining the team, won the 5,000 metres and finished second in the 1500 metres. Radcliffe set the pace in the 10,000 metres at the European Championships, but finished fifth. Radcliffe, who was suffering from a virus, took some time off, before returning to the cross country discipline, where she won her first senior title by taking the European Long course race. 1998 finished with a fourth-place finish in Brussels.

Radcliffe started 1999 by finishing fourth in Durham. At the World Cross Country championships, Radcliffe finished with the bronze medal. Radcliffe then ran the seventh fastest 10,000 metres ever at the European 10,000 metres challenge. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe took two seconds off her own British record in the 5,000 metres. Radcliffe took the silver at the World Championships behind finishing behind Wami in the 10,000 metres. Radcliffe and Loruope found themselves at the front and tried to get rid of Wami but failed as the Ethiopian took the title. At the Berlin Golden league meeting, Radcliffe finished eighth in the 5,000 metres. Radcliffe then ran the second fastest half marathon by a British woman, finishing third on her debut at the distance at the Great North Run, despite getting into a tangle with a spectator.

Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country race for a third time. Radcliffe then finished fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury. For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined a host of other British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track for the first time since March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500 metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000 metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials won the 5,000 metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000 metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000 metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.

She won back-to-back titles in the 2000 and 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, winning a third title in 2003.

====Cross country champion====
On 24 March, Radcliffe won the Ostend, Belgium-held World Cross Country Championships 2001 title in a time of 27:49.

Held in March in Dublin, Radcliffe defended her title in the Women&#x27;s Long Race when she won the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships title for a second year. She won in 26:46.

===Marathon world record===
In 2002, Radcliffe made the move up to the marathon, a decision that immediately paid off with victory at her debut in that year&#x27;s London Marathon on 14 April 2002 in a world&#x27;s best time for a women&#x27;s only race (2:18:55). Her time was the second quickest in women&#x27;s marathon history behind the world record of 2:18:47 set by Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, in Chicago.

Later that year, Radcliffe set a world record time of 2:17:18 in the Chicago Marathon on 13 October 2002, breaking the previous record by a minute and a half.

She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours for services to athletics. She said: &quot;It means a great deal to me, it&#x27;s a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year. To come here and receive this and to meet the Queen at the end of it just finishes it off perfectly.&quot;

Later the same year, she became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, making her the first woman in over a decade to be honoured with the accolade. Paula thanked her husband Gary Lough, her coach Alex Stanton and her physio, Gerard Hartmann.

===Further world records===
Radcliffe set her last women&#x27;s marathon world record during the 2003 London Marathon in April, with a time of 2:15:25. The performance is one of the highest of score&#x27;s values in terms of the IAAF World ranking points.

Radcliffe is the former world record holder for the women&#x27;s road 10k in a time of 30 minutes and 21 seconds, which she set on 23 February 2003 in the World&#x27;s Best 10K in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Radcliffe won the 2004 New York City Marathon in a time of 2:23:10, beating Kenya&#x27;s Susan Chepkemei.

===2004 Athens Olympics===
Radcliffe did not compete in the London Marathon in 2004, but was the favourite to win a gold medal in the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens. However, she suffered an injury to her leg just two weeks prior to the event and had to use a high dose of anti-inflammatory drugs. This had an adverse effect on her stomach, hindering food absorption. She ended up withdrawing from the race after . Five days later she started in the 10,000 metres but, still suffering from the effects of the marathon, retired with eight laps remaining. Radcliffe said &quot;You go through bad stages in a marathon, but never as bad as that&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve never before not been able to finish and I&#x27;m desperately trying to find a reason for what happened&quot;, &quot;I just feel numb – this is something I worked so hard for.&quot;

Additionally, Radcliffe, like many other athletes, complained about the very high temperatures that prevailed in Athens at the time of the Olympic games.

Regarded as Great Britain&#x27;s best gold medal hope in athletics, her withdrawal made headlines in the UK, with editorial stances ranging from support to negativity, with some newspapers deriding Radcliffe for &#x27;quitting&#x27;, rather than going on to finish the race. Television pictures showed Radcliffe in a clearly distressed state after dropping out of the marathon, being comforted by two friends from her early running days.

===2005: Marathon World Champion===

At the 2005 London Marathon, Radcliffe won with a time of 2:17:42, a world&#x27;s best time for a women&#x27;s only race by over a minute. The race is remembered for a notorious moment towards the end when Radcliffe, hindered by runner&#x27;s diarrhea and in need for a toilet break, stopped and defecated on the side of the road in view of the crowd and TV cameras which broadcast the incident live. After the race, she apologised to viewers and explained what happened, &quot;I was losing time because I was having stomach cramps and I thought &#x27;I just need to go and I&#x27;ll be fine&#x27;. ... I didn&#x27;t really want to resort to that in front of hundreds of thousands of people. Basically I needed to go. I started feeling it between 15 and and probably carried on too long before stopping. I must have eaten too much beforehand&quot;. In November 2006, the incident was voted &quot;top running moment in history&quot; in the UK from a choice of ten &quot;unforgettable moments&quot;.

On 14 August 2005 at the World Championships held in Helsinki she won Britain&#x27;s only gold medal when she took the marathon title, dominating the race and setting a championship record time of 2:20:57. Catherine Ndereba of Kenya finished in second place, more than a minute behind. Radcliffe said: &quot;It pretty much went according to plan. If somebody had been with me at the end I think I could have pushed it up a bit more.&quot; She and three other British runners were also awarded third place in the team competition.

===Family and autobiography===

Radcliffe took a break through the 2006 season owing to injuries and in July announced that she was expecting her first child. Her comeback was further delayed in 2007 as a result of a stress fracture in her lower back.

Radcliffe chose not to defend her world marathon crown in 2007, in order to undertake further rehabilitation, but insisted she wanted to compete in the next two Olympics. She made her return to competitive running on 30 September 2007, taking part in the BUPA Great North Run in the UK on Tyneside. This was her first race in almost two years. Radcliffe finished second behind US runner Kara Goucher.

Radcliffe made her marathon return at the New York City Marathon on 4 November 2007 which she won with an official time of 2:23:09.

Radcliffe released an autobiography in 2004, &quot;Paula: My Story So Far&quot;.

===2008–09: Beijing Olympics and fitness problems===

Radcliffe withdrew from the 2008 London Marathon due to a foot injury. Shortly after the London Marathon, it was also revealed that Radcliffe was suffering from an injury to her hip, preventing her from running. Originally thought to be a muscular problem, scans later revealed it was a stress fracture to her femur. Radcliffe won the 2008 Great South Run in 51 minutes 11 seconds, 11 seconds off of Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s course record. In May, Radcliffe broke her left leg.

Radcliffe managed to get to fitness level for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but cramped during the marathon to the point where she had to stop running and stretch. She resumed the race and finished in 23rd place overall.

Radcliffe won the 2008 New York City Marathon, making it her third victory at the competition with a time of 2:23:56. Russian Lyudmila Petrova came in second, and American Kara Goucher took third.

Following the New York Marathon, Radcliffe suffered more injury setbacks: she had to withdraw from the 2009 London Marathon due to a fractured toe. In March that year, she had a bunion removed which doctors believed was the root cause of her other injuries at that time. She did not run competitively for almost 10 months, but made herself available for inclusion in the 2009 British team for the World Championships in Athletics. She announced that the New York City Half Marathon would be a testing ground for her fitness before the competition.

Radcliffe went on to win the New York City Half Marathon in 1:09:45, two seconds off the course record. However, after this she pulled out of the World Championships as she felt unfit, and she missed the 2009 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Birmingham due to a bout of tonsillitis. She returned to action at the 2009 New York City Marathon but failed to notch her third consecutive victory, instead fading to fourth place with knee problems.

===2011 onwards===

Following a 19-month layoff that included the birth of her second child, she returned to action at the Bupa London , where she finished 3rd, 55 seconds behind the winner, Jo Pavey. Radcliffe called the performance &quot;a bit of a disaster&quot;, and indicated she was suffering from a tear in one of the discs of her back.

She set the 2011 Berlin Marathon as her comeback venue to try for an Olympic qualifying time. She came third in the race with a time of 2:23:46 hours – getting the Olympic standard and the fourth fastest time by a European that year. She was dissatisfied, however, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not particularly happy, either with my time or my place. I came here wanting to win&quot;. She used the 2012 Vienna Half Marathon to gauge her fitness and the race was set up as a battle between her and Haile Gebrselassie, with Radcliffe receiving a head start of 7:52 minutes (the difference between the two athletes&#x27; personal bests). She did not perform well and was comfortably beaten by the Ethiopian, while she crossed the line after 72:03 minutes.

Radcliffe pulled out of London 2012 Olympics because of a foot injury.

In January 2015, Radcliffe announced that she had decided to end her marathon career on 26 April 2015 by competing in the 2015 London Marathon. She finished in 2:36:55.

==Anti-doping activity==
Radcliffe has frequently made high-profile condemnations of the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletics. Radcliffe and teammate Hayley Tullett caused controversy when, in the heats of the 5,000 metres at the 2001 World Athletics Championships in Edmonton, they held up a sign protesting against the reinstatement of Russian athlete Olga Yegorova after Yegorova had tested positive for the banned substance EPO. The sign was made by Radcliffe&#x27;s husband and read &#x27;EPO Cheats Out&#x27;. It was eventually taken off them by the stadium officials, but not before it was streamed around the world. After Radcliffe and Tullett&#x27;s initial protest, teammates Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling – who both missed out on a place in the final – protested alongside coaches Mark Rowland and Alan Storey, wearing Radcliffe masks and holding up banners with mocking slogans including one which read &#x27;Free Paula&#x27;. Radcliffe vowed to continue her fight against drugs in sport after her high-profile actions in Edmonton. Since the 1999 European Cup, Radcliffe wears a red ribbon when competing to show her support for blood testing as a method of catching drug cheats.

Radcliffe has advocated a system where first time offenders are banned for four years and any future offence for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not trying to get to the tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.

==Doping allegations==
Reflecting upon the scepticism created by incidents of doping, she said &quot;You have to accept the situation...it would be great if we could win the battle against doping and have testing that was 100 per-cent reliable, but I don&#x27;t think that will happen in my competitive career.&quot; She has previously asked for the results of a blood test taken at the London Marathon to be made public, saying that she had &quot;absolutely no objection to my test being released&quot;.

In 2015, in the wake of revelations of widespread doping in athletics, Radcliffe said that, unlike some other prominent British athletes, she would not be releasing her blood-test history, and discouraged other athletes from doing so. She was later indirectly identified as a suspected doper by MP Jesse Norman during a parliamentary inquiry into blood doping. In response, Radcliffe issued a statement in which she &quot;categorically denied&quot; cheating in any form and said she has &quot;nothing to hide&quot;. Shortly afterwards, her three suspect test results were leaked, though Radcliffe still refused to release her complete blood-test history. In late November 2015, the IAAF declared that the accusations were &quot;based on the gross misinterpretation of incomplete data&quot;. The UK Anti Doping Agency, having received Radcliffe&#x27;s blood test history via the IAAF, stated that &quot;UKAD has come to the same conclusion as the IAAF review that there is no case to answer&quot;. It is likely that the first suspicious off-score was caused by faulty equipment. The third suspicious off-score was the direct result of an altitude training trip in Kenya with Mo Farah and other British athletes.

==Personal life==
Radcliffe was born to Peter and Pat Radcliffe and is the grandniece of 1920 Olympic silver medallist Charlotte Radcliffe. Radcliffe met her husband Gary Lough, a former Northern Irish 1,500 m runner, when he was her lodger at Loughborough University. The pair married in 2001. She gave birth to her first child, daughter Isla, in 2007. Her second child, a son, Raphael, was born in 2010. The family resides in Monte Carlo.

<text>Herta Däubler-Gmelin (; born 12 August 1943) is a German lawyer, academic and politician of the Social Democratic Party. She served as Federal Minister of Justice from 1998 to 2002, and as a Member of the Bundestag from 1972 to 2009. She currently teaches as an honorary professor of political science at the Free University of Berlin, particularly on international relations and human rights, and was the Hemmerle Professor at RWTH Aachen University in 2011. She is married to the legal scholar Wolfgang Däubler.

==History==
She was born in Bratislava, in the war-time Slovak Republic, as the daughter of Hans Gmelin (d. 1991), who was mayor of Tübingen from 1954 to 1974. She studied history, economy, law and political science in Tübingen and Berlin. Since 1974, she has been admitted as a lawyer, first in Stuttgart, then in Berlin. Since 1992, she has lectured law at the Freie Universität Berlin, which made her an honorary professor in 1995.

==Political career==
Däubler-Gmelin joined the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1965 and became a member of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; in 1972, subsequently representing Tübingen from 1998 to 2002. She held several party offices in the 1980s and 1990s, serving as deputy party chairman from 1988-1997. From 1994–98, she was chairwoman of the working group on legal affairs and legal adviser to the SPD parliamentary group.

In 1993, the SPD nominated Däubler-Gmelin to fill the vacancy of vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court, but after conservative parliamentary groups blocked the nomination for nine months as being &quot;too political&quot; she abandoned this career step in favor of Jutta Limbach. Ahead of the 1994 elections, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping included her in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. During the campaign, Däubler-Gmelin served as shadow minister of justice.

===Federal Minister of Justice, 1998–2002===
From 1998 to 2002, Däubler-Gmelin served as Justice Minister in Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s first cabinet, where she oversaw a number of controversial reform projects such as the reform of German citizenship legislation, the introduction of same-sex civil unions, and the overhaul of the German Civil Code, the most invasive since its inception in 1900.

In 1999, both Däubler-Gmelin and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer appealed for clemency for the LaGrand brothers, two German citizens sentenced to death in Arizona. According to the German government, the LaGrands had been denied their rights as German citizens because prosecutors did not inform the German consulate of the brothers&#x27; arrest in 1982 until a decade later. However, both were put to death in a cloud of cyanide gas.

Amid the Enron scandal in 2002, Däubler-Gmelin launched a voluntary 12-page corporate governance code that calls on company audit committees to be aware of other business links between the company and its auditors, including consulting work.

On 18 September 2002, four days before Schröder&#x27;s re-election, she attended a meeting at a restaurant in Derendingen (near Tübingen) with about 30 trade unionists from two local factories (the topic was &quot;Globalization and Labor&quot;). Däubler-Gmelin, who has long been known for her outspokenness, later said she had been unaware that a reporter from local newspaper &quot;Schwäbisches Tagblatt&quot; was present, insisting that she regarded the event as an internal meeting. After discussion had turned to the Iraq crisis, she remarked that U.S. president Bush was preparing a war to detract from domestic problems such as the economic crisis at the time, and that this was a popular political strategy which had already been used by Adolf Hitler. When some participants showed disagreement, she added immediately that this was not meant to liken Bush to Hitler as a person, but rather to compare their methods, and that British prime minister Margaret Thatcher had also used the 1982 Falklands War to improve election prospects. She also described the U.S. legal system as &quot;lousy&quot;.

This was the version published by &quot;Schwäbisches Tagblatt&quot; (a paper widely regarded as liberal to leftist and respected for its journalistic quality), which later stated that Däubler-Gmelin herself had confirmed the wording of the report, as well as several present at the meeting. Another account of the meeting states that the Hitler comparison originated from a participant and that Däubler-Gmelin had merely agreed that Hitler had used such tactics, too.

Immediately after the article had been published, Däubler-Gmelin strongly denied it, claiming to have been misquoted. She also announced that she would sue the Schwäbische Tagblatt, but later chose not to do so. She encountered criticism for allegedly expressing anti-americanism in both Germany and abroad, including members of the U.S. government such as Ari Fleischer and Condoleezza Rice. On September 20, Däubler-Gmelin called U.S. Ambassador Dan Coats to state that the reports had no basis and Schröder wrote an apology letter to Bush, stating &quot;there is no place at my cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection between the American president and such a criminal.&quot; He did not force her to resign immediately, claiming to trust her denial of the quotation, but she was dropped from his new cabinet when it was formed a few weeks after his narrow re-election.

===Later work===
From 2002 to 2005 Däubler-Gmelin served as chairwoman of the Bundestag&#x27;s Committee on Consumer Protection and Agriculture, and from 2005 she chaired the Committee for Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid.

==Life after politics==
Since 2004, Däubler-Gmelin has been practicing as Of counsel with the Berlin office of law firm Schwegler.

In 2009, Germany’s national railway company Deutsche Bahn commissioned Däubler-Gmelin and former Interior Minister Gerhart Baum with investigating allegations according to which the company had, in violation of privacy laws and corporate guidelines repeatedly and on a large scale compared personal data of its employees with those of suppliers, in a bid to uncover possible corruption.

Between 2012 and 2013, Däubler-Gmelin served as member of the European Commission’s High Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism, an advisory panel set up by European Commissioner Neelie Kroes and chaired by Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.

She has voiced her support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

From 2012 to 2014, Däubler-Gmelin represented political group “Mehr Demokratie e.V.” (More Democracy) in its unsuccessful constitutional complaint before the Federal Constitutional Court against Germany’s participation in the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the European Fiscal Compact.

In 2019, Däubler-Gmelin was appointed to a task force investigating allegations of fraud and embezzlement at Workers&#x27; Welfare Association (AWO), a charity and one of Germany’s largest employers.

<text>Sir Edward Charles Kayll Ollivant (1846–1915) was a senior member of the Indian Civil Service. He had notable interactions with both Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammed Ali Jinnah.

Ollivant arrived in India in 1881. In 1892, he had a disagreement in Rajkot with Gandhi, who was then a young barrister. The incident resulted in Gandhi being pushed out of a room, and ill feelings about this dispute were apparently a factor in Gandhi&#x27;s departure for South Africa in 1893.

Ollivant also offered to hire Muhammed Ali Jinnah at 1,500 rupees per month, and was notably turned down.

Ollivant was a judicial member of the Council of the Governor of Bombay until April 1902, and a director of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1892.

<doc id="228246" wikidata="Q178843" url="?curid=228246" title="Rupee">
<text>Rupee (, ) is the common name for the currencies of 

India, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka, and of former currencies of Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (as the Gulf rupee), British East Africa, Burma, German East Africa (as Rupie/Rupien), and Tibet. In Indonesia and the Maldives, the unit of currency is known as &quot;rupiah&quot; and &quot;rufiyaa&quot; respectively, cognates of the word rupee.

The Indian rupee and Pakistani rupee are subdivided into one hundred paise (singular &quot;paisa&quot;) or pice. The Nepalese rupee (रू) subdivides into one hundred paisa (singular and plural) or four sukaas. The Mauritian, Seychellois, and Sri Lankan rupees subdivide into 100 cents.

== Etymology ==

The Hindustani word &quot;rupayā&quot; () is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;rūpya&quot; (), which means &quot;wrought silver, a coin of silver&quot;, in origin an adjective meaning &quot;shapely&quot;, with a more specific meaning of &quot;stamped, impressed&quot;, whence &quot;coin&quot;. It is derived from the noun &quot;rūpa&quot; () &quot;shape, likeness, image&quot;.

== History ==



The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC. Ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Lydian staters, several other Middle Eastern coinages and the Chinese wen.
The term is from &quot;rūpya&quot;, a Sanskrit term for silver coin, from Sanskrit &quot;rūpa&quot;, beautiful form.

&quot;Arthashastra&quot;, written by Chanakya, chief adviser to the first Maurya emperor Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340–290 BCE), mentions silver coins as &quot;rūpyarūpa&quot;, other types including gold coins (&quot;rūpya-suvarṇa&quot;), copper coins (&quot;tāmrarūpa&quot;) and lead coins (&quot;sīsarūpa&quot;) are mentioned. &quot;Rūpa&quot; means form or shape, example, &quot;rūpyarūpa&quot;, &quot;rūpya&quot; – wrought silver, &quot;rūpa&quot; – form. This coinage system continued more or less across the Indian subcontinent well till 20th century.

In the intermediate times there was no fixed monetary system as reported by the &quot;Da Tang Xi Yu Ji&quot;.

During his reign from 1538/1540 to 1545, Sher Shah Suri of the Sur Empire set up a new civic and military administration and issued a coin of silver, weighing 178 grains, which was also termed the &quot;Rupiya&quot;. Suri also introduced copper coins called &quot;dam&quot; and gold coins called &quot;mohur&quot; that weighed 169 grains (10.95 g). The use of the rupee coin continued under the Mughal Empire with the same standard and weight, though some rulers after Mughal Emperor Akbar occasionally issued heavier rupees.
The European powers started minting coinage as early as mid-17th century, under patronage of Mughal Empire. The British gold coins were termed Carolina, the silver coins Anglina, the copper coins Cupperoon and tin coins Tinny. The coins of Bengal were developed in the Mughal style and those of Madras mostly in a South Indian style. The English coins of Western India developed along Mughal as well as English patterns. It was only in AD 1717 that the British obtained permission from the Emperor Farrukh Siyar to coin Mughal money at the Bombay mint. By early 1830, the British had become the dominant power in India and started minting coinage independently. The Coinage Act of 1835 provided for uniform coinage throughout India. The new coins had the effigy of William IV on the obverse and the value on the reverse in English and Persian. The coins issued after 1840 bore the portrait of Queen Victoria. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India. The gold silver ratio expanded during 1870–1910. Unlike India, Britain was on the gold standard.

The 1911 accession to the throne of the King-Emperor George V led to the famous &quot;pig rupee&quot;. On the coin, the King appeared wearing a robe with the imprint of an elephant. Through poor engraving, the elephant looked like a pig. The population was enraged and the image had to be quickly redesigned. Acute shortage of silver during the First World War, led to the introduction of paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees. The silver coins of smaller denominations were issued in cupro-nickel. The compulsion of the Second World War led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the &quot;Quaternary Silver Alloy&quot;. The Quaternary Silver coins were issued from 1940. In 1947 these were replaced by pure Nickel coins. The Monetary System remained unchanged at One Rupee consisting of 64 pice, or 192 pies.

In India, the &quot;Anna Series&quot; was introduced on 15 August 1950. This was the first coinage of the Republic of India. The King&#x27;s Portrait was replaced by the Ashoka&#x27;s Lion Capital. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin. The monetary system was retained with one Rupee consisting of 16 Annas. The 1955 Indian Coinage (Amendment) Act, that came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, introduced a &quot;Decimal series&quot;. The rupee was now divided into 100 &#x27;Paisa&#x27; instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice. The &quot;Naye Paise&quot; coins were minted in the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Naye Paise. Both the Anna series and the Naye Paise coins were valid for some time. From 1968 onwards, the new coins were called just Paise instead of Naye Paise because they were no longer naye(new).

With high inflation in the sixties, small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and aluminium-bronze were gradually minted in aluminium only. This change commenced with the introduction of the new hexagonal 3 paise coin. A twenty paise coin was introduced in 1968 but did not gain much popularity. Over a period, cost-benefit considerations led to the gradual discontinuance of 1, 2 and 3 paise coins in the 1970s. Stainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paise, was introduced in 1988 and of one rupee in 1992. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Rs 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinisation of these denominations in the 1990s.

===East Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia===
In East Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, the rupee and its subsidiary coinage was current at various times. The usage of the rupee in East Africa extended from Somaliland in the north to as far south as Natal. In Mozambique, the British India rupees were overstamped, and in Kenya, the British East Africa Company minted the rupee and its fractions, as well as pice.

The rise in the price of silver immediately after the First World War caused the rupee to rise in value to two shillings sterling. In 1920 in British East Africa, the opportunity was then taken to introduce a new florin coin, hence bringing the currency into line with sterling. Shortly after that, the florin was split into two East African shillings. This assimilation to sterling did not, however, happen in British India itself. In Somalia, the Italian colonial authority minted &#x27;rupia&#x27; to exactly the same standard and called the &quot;pice&quot; &#x27;besa&#x27;.

The Indian rupee was the official currency of Dubai and Qatar until 1959, when India created a new Gulf rupee (also known as the &quot;external rupee&quot;) to hinder the smuggling of gold. The Gulf rupee was legal tender until 1966, when India significantly devalued the Indian rupee and a new Qatar-Dubai riyal was established to provide economic stability.

===Straits Settlements===
The Straits Settlements were originally an outlier of the British East India Company. The Spanish dollar had already taken hold in the Straits Settlements by the time the British arrived in the 19th century. The East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place. These attempts were resisted by the locals, and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company, attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned.

===Tibet===
Until the middle of the 20th century, Tibet&#x27;s official currency was also known as the Tibetan rupee.

===Denominations===
The original silver rupee, .917 fine silver, , was divided into 16 annas, 64 paise, or 192 pies. Each circulating coin of British India, until the rupee was decimalised, had a different name in practice. A paisa was equal to two &quot;dhelas&quot;, three &quot;pies&quot;, or six &quot;damaris&quot;. Other coins for half anna (&quot;adhanni&quot;, or two paisas), two annas (&quot;duanni&quot;), four annas (a &quot;chawanni&quot;, or a quarter of a rupee), and eight annas (an &quot;athanni&quot;, or half a rupee) were widely in use until decimalization in 1961. (The numbers &quot;adha&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;chār&quot;, &quot;ātha&quot; mean respectively half, two, four, eight in Hindi and Urdu.) Two &quot;paisa&quot; was also called a &quot;taka&quot;, see below.

Decimalisation occurred in India in 1957 and in Pakistan in 1961. Since 1957 an Indian rupee is divided into 100 paise. The decimalised paisa was originally officially named &quot;naya paisa&quot; meaning the &quot;new paisa&quot; to distinguish it from the erstwhile paisa which had a higher value of rupee. The word &quot;naya&quot; was dropped in 1964 and since then it is simply known as &quot;paisa&quot; (plural &quot;paise&quot;).

The most commonly used symbol for the rupee is &quot;₨&quot;. India adopted a new symbol () for the Indian rupee on 15 July 2010. In most parts of India, the rupee is known as rupaya, rupaye, or one of several other terms derived from the Sanskrit &quot;rūpya&quot;, meaning silver.

&quot;Ṭaṅka&quot; is an ancient Sanskrit word for money. While the two-paise coin was called a &quot;taka&quot; in West Pakistan, the word &quot;taka&quot; was commonly used in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), alternatively for rupee. In the Bengali and Assamese languages, spoken in Assam, Tripura, and West Bengal, the rupee is known as a &quot;taka&quot;, and is written as such on Indian banknotes. In Odisha it is known as &quot;tanka&quot;. After its independence, Bangladesh started to officially call its currency &quot;taka&quot; (BDT) in 1971.

The issuance of the Indian currency is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India, and issuance of Pakistani currency is controlled by State Bank of Pakistan.

Currently in India (from 2010 onwards), the 50 paise coin (half a rupee) is the lowest valued legal tender coin. Coins of 1, 2, 5, and 10 rupees and banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 2000 rupees are commonly in use for cash transaction.

Large denominations of rupees are traditionally counted in lakhs, crores, arabs, kharabs, nils, padmas, shankhs, udpadhas, and anks. Terms beyond &quot;crore&quot; are not generally used in the context of money; for example, an amount would be called ₨ 1 lakh crore (equivalent to 1 trillion) instead of ₨ 10 kharab.

== Symbol==
The symbol is the Indian rupee sign. The precomposed character is a currency sign used to represent the monetary unit of account in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius, Seychelles, and formerly in India. It resembles, and is often written as, the Latin character sequence &quot;Rs&quot; or &quot;Rs.&quot;. The symbol represents the Nepalese rupee. Currency signs exist for other countries that use the rupee but not this sign: their usage is also described at the main article.

In Latin script, &quot;rupee&quot; (singular) is abbreviated as &#x27;Re&#x27;. and &quot;rupees&quot; (plural) as &#x27;₨&#x27;. The Indonesian &quot;rupiah&quot; is abbreviated &#x27;Rp&#x27;. In 19th century typography, abbreviations were often superscripted: formula_1 or formula_2. In Brahmic scripts, rupee is often abbreviated with the grapheme for the first syllable, optionally followed by a circular abbreviation mark or a Latin abbreviation point: (Devanagari &quot;ru.&quot;), (Gujarati &quot;ru.&quot;), (Sinhala &quot;ru&quot;), (Telugu &quot;rū&quot;).

== Value ==
The history of the rupees can be traced back to Ancient India around the 6th century BC. Ancient India had some of the earliest coins in the world, along with the Chinese wen and Lydian staters.
The rupee coin has been used since then, even during British India, when it contained 11.66 g (1 tola) of 91.7% silver with an ASW of 0.3437 of a troy ounce (that is, silver worth about US$10 at modern prices). Valuation of the rupee based on its silver content had severe consequences in the 19th century, when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard. The discovery of vast quantities of silver in the United States and various European colonies resulted in a decline in the value of silver relative to gold.

At the end of the 19th century, the Indian silver rupee went onto a gold exchange standard at a fixed rate of one rupee to one shilling and fourpence in British currency, i.e. 15 rupees to 1 pound sterling.

<text>Dadabhai Naoroji (4 September 1825 – 30 June 1917), also known as the &quot;Grand Old Man of India&quot; and &quot;Unofficial Ambassador of India&quot;, was an Indian Independence activist, political leader, merchant, scholar and writer. He was one of the founding members of the Indian National Congress and served as its 2nd, 9th, and 22nd President from 1886 to 1887, 1893 to 1894 and 1906 to 1907.

He was the Diwan of Baroda from 1874, before moving to England, where he was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons, representing Finsbury Central between 1892 and 1895. He was the second person of Asian descent to be a British MP, the first being Anglo Indian MP David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre.

His book &quot;Poverty and Un-British Rule in India&quot; brought attention to his theory of the Indian &quot;wealth drain&quot; into Britain. He was also a member of the Second International along with Kautsky and Plekhanov. In 2014, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg inaugurated the Dadabhai Naoroji Awards for services to UK-India relations. India Post depicted Naoroji on stamps in 1963, 1997 and 2017.

==Biography==
Naoroji was born in Navsari in a Gujarati-speaking Parsi Zoroastrian family, and educated at the Elphinstone Institute School. His patron was the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, and he started his career as Dewan (Minister) to the Maharaja in 1874. Being an &quot;Athornan&quot; (ordained priest), Naoroji founded the Rahnumai Mazdayasan Sabha (Guides on the Mazdayasne Path) on 1 August 1851 to restore the Zoroastrian religion to its original purity and simplicity. In 1854, he also founded a Gujarati fortnightly publication, the &quot;Rast Goftar&quot; (The Truth Teller), to clarify Zoroastrian concepts and promote Parsi social reforms.

Around this time, he also published another newspaper called &quot;The Voice of India&quot;. In December 1855, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Elphinstone College in Bombay, becoming the first Indian to hold such an academic position. He travelled to London in 1855 to become a partner in Cama &amp; Co, opening a Liverpool location for the first Indian company to be established in Britain. Within three years, he had resigned on ethical grounds. In 1859, he established his own cotton trading company, Dadabhai Naoroji &amp; Co. In 1861 he also founded The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe alongside Muncherjee Hormusji Cama.
In 1865, Naoroji directed and launched the London Indian Society, the purpose of which was to discuss Indian political, social and literary subjects. In 1867, he also helped to establish the East India Association, one of the predecessor organisations of the Indian National Congress with the aim of putting across the Indian point of view before the British public. The Association was instrumental in counter-acting the propaganda by the Ethnological Society of London which, in its session in 1866, had tried to prove the inferiority of the Asians to the Europeans. This Association soon won the support of eminent Englishmen and was able to exercise considerable influence in the British parliament. The organization soon had branches in Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.

In 1874, he became Prime Minister of Baroda and was a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay (1885–88). He was also a member of the Indian National Association founded by Sir Surendranath Banerjea from Calcutta a few years before the founding of the Indian National Congress in Bombay, with the same objectives and practices. The two groups later merged into the INC, and Naoroji was elected President of the Congress in 1886. Naoroji published &quot;Poverty and Un-British Rule in India&quot; in 1901.

Naoroji moved to Britain once again and continued his political involvement. Elected for the Liberal Party in Finsbury Central at the 1892 general election, he was the first British Indian MP. He refused to take the oath on the Bible, as he was Zoroastrian. He was allowed to take the oath of office in the name of God on his copy of the &quot;Khordeh Avesta&quot;. During his time he put his efforts towards improving the situation in India. He had a very clear vision and was an effective communicator. He set forth his views about the situation in India over the course of the history of the governance of the country and the way in which the colonial rulers rule. In Parliament, he spoke on Irish Home Rule and the condition of the Indian people. He was a notable Freemason.

In 1906, Naoroji was again elected president of the Indian National Congress. He was a staunch moderate within the Congress, during the phase when opinion in the party was split between the moderates and extremists. Such was the respect commanded by him that assertive nationalists could not oppose his candidature and the rift was avoided for the time being. Naoroji&#x27;s &quot;Poverty and Un-British Rule in India&quot; influenced Mahatma Gandhi.

==Personal life and death==

He was married to Gulbai at the age of 11. He died in Bombay on 30 June 1917, at the age of 91.

The Dadabhai Naoroji Road, a heritage road of Mumbai, is named after him, as are the Dadabhai Naoroji Road in Karachi, Pakistan and Naoroji Street in the Finsbury area of London. A prominent residential colony for central government servants in the south of Delhi is also named Naoroji Nagar. His granddaughters, Perin and Khurshedben, were also involved in the independence movement. In 1930, Khurshedben was arrested along with other revolutionaries for attempting to hoist the Indian flag in a Government College in Ahmedabad.

==Drain theory and poverty==
Naoroji&#x27;s work focused on the drain of wealth from India to Britain during the period of British rule in India. One of the reasons that the Drain theory is attributed to Naoroji is his decision to estimate the net national profit of India, and by extension, the effect that colonial rule had on the country. Through his work with economics, Naoroji sought to prove that Britain was draining money out of India.

Naoroji described six factors that resulted in the external drain.
# India was governed by a foreign government.
# India did not attract immigrants who brought labour and capital for economic growth.
# India paid for Britain&#x27;s civil administrations in India and her Indian army.
# India bore the burden of empire building in and out of its borders.
# Opening the country to free trade allowed for foreigners to take highly paid jobs over those of equally qualified Indians.
# The principal income-earners would spend their money outside of India or leave with the money as they were mostly foreign personnel.

His book &quot;Poverty and Un-British Rule in India&quot; estimated a 200–300 million pounds drain of India&#x27;s revenue to Britain that was not recirculated into India.

When referring to the drain, Naoroji stated that he believed some tribute was necessary as payment for the services that Britain brought to India such as the newly constructed railways. However the money from these services were being drained out of India; for instance the money being earned by the railways did not belong to India, which supported his assessment that India was sending too much to Britain. According to Naoroji, India was paying tribute for something that was not bringing profit to the country directly. Instead of paying off foreign investment, as other countries did, India was paying for services rendered despite the operation of the railway being already profitable for Britain. This type of drain was experienced in different ways as well, for instance, British workers earning wages that were not equal with the work that they have done in India, or trade that undervalued India&#x27;s goods and overvalued outside goods.

British workers in India were encouraged to take on high paying jobs in India, and the British government allowed them to take a portion of their income back to Britain. Furthermore, the East India Company was purchasing Indian goods with money drained from India to export to Britain, which was a way that the opening up of free trade allowed India to be exploited.

When elected to Parliament by a narrow margin of five votes, his first speech was devoted to the issue of questioning Britain&#x27;s role in India. Naoroji explained that Indians would either be British subjects or their slaves, depending on how willing Britain was to give India control over the institutions that Britain presently operated. By giving these institutions to India it would allow India to govern itself and as a result all revenue would stay in India.

Naoroji identified himself as a fellow subject of the Empire and was able to address the economic hardships facing India to a British audience. By presenting himself as an imperial subject he was able to use rhetoric to show the benefit to Britain that an ease of financial burden on India would have. He argued that by allowing the money earned in India to stay in India, tributes would be willingly and easily paid without fear of poverty; he argued that this could be done by giving equal employment opportunities to Indian professionals who were consistently forced to take jobs that they were over-qualified for. Indian labour would be more likely to spend their income within India preventing one aspect of the drain.

Naoroji also found it important to examine Anglo-Indian trade to prevent the premature dissolution of budding industries to unfair valuing of goods and services. By allowing industry to grow and develop in India, tribute could be paid to Britain in the form of taxation and the increase in Indian interest for British goods. Over time, Naoroji became more inflammatory in his comments as he began to lose patience with Britain over the seemingly lack of progress regarding reforms. He rhetorically questioned whether or not the British government would be willing to award French youths all the high ranking posts in the British economy. He also pointed to historical examples of Britain being opposed to the &quot;wealth drain&quot; concept, including the English objection to the wealth drain to the papacy during the 1500s.

Naoroji&#x27;s work on the drain theory was the main reason behind the creation of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure in 1896 in which he was also a member. This commission reviewed financial burdens on India and in some cases came to the conclusion that those burdens were misplaced.

==Views and legacy==
Dadabhai Naoroji is regarded as one of the most important Indians during the birth of the nascent independence movement. In his writings, he came to the conclusion that the exertion of foreign rule over India was not favourable for the nation, and that independence (or at the very least, responsible government) would be the better path for India.

Naoroji is often remembered as the &quot;Grand Old Man of Indian Nationalism.&quot;

Mahatma Gandhi wrote to Naoroji in 1894, saying that &quot;The Indians look up to you as children to the father. Such is really the feeling here.&quot;

Bal Gangadhar Tilak admired him; he said:

Here are the significant extracts taken from his speech delivered before the East India Association on 2 May 1867 regarding what educated Indians expect from their British rulers.

&quot;In this Memorandum I desire to submit for the kind and generous consideration of His Lordship the Secretary of State for India, that from the same cause of the deplorable drain [of economic wealth from India to Britain], besides the material exhaustion of India, the moral loss to her is no less sad and lamentable . . . All [the Europeans] effectually do is to eat the substance of India, material and moral, while living there, and when they go, they carry away all they have acquired . . . The thousands [of Indians] that are being sent out by the universities every year find themselves in a most anomalous position. There is no place for them in their motherland . . . What must be the inevitable consequence? . . . despotism and destruction . . . or destroying hand and power. &quot;

A plaque referring to Dadabhai Naoroji is located outside the Finsbury Town Hall on Rosebery Avenue, London. On 10 August 2022 English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque in his honour at the site of his former home, 72, Anerley Park, Bromley, London where he lived between 1897 - 1904 or 1905.

<text>Islamic studies refers to the academic study of Islam, which is analogous to related fields such as Jewish studies and Quranic studies. Islamic studies seeks to understand the past and the potential future of the Islamic world. In this multidisciplinary program, scholars from diverse areas (history, culture, literature, art) participate and exchange ideas pertaining to the particular field of study.

Generations of scholars in Islamic studies, most of whom studied with Orientalist mentors, helped bridge the gap between Orientalism and Religious studies. The subfield that grew out of this effort is called &quot;Islamic studies.&quot; The study of Islam is part of a tradition that started in Western academia on a professional scale about two centuries ago, and has been previously linked to social concern. This academic tradition has not only led to an accumulation of knowledge, even if some of it is almost forgotten or badly neglected, but has also witnessed major changes in interests, questions, methods, aesthetics, and ethics of Islam.

Many academic Islamic studies programs include the historical study of Islam, Islamic civilization, history of the Muslim world, historiography, Islamic law, Islamic theology and Islamic philosophy. Specialists in Islamic studies concentrate on the detailed, academic study of texts written in Arabic within the fields of Islamic theology, Islamic law, and the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith along with ancillary disciplines such as Tafsir or Qur&#x27;an Exegesis. However, they also often apply the methods adapted from several ancillary fields, ranging from Biblical studies and classical philology to modern history, legal history and sociology.

==Overview==
Scholars in the field of Islamic studies are often referred to as &quot;Islamicists&quot; and the discipline traditionally made up the bulk of what used to be called Oriental studies. The transitional generation of Islamicists were betwixt and between an era when Islamic studies were dominated by Orientalism and the post-Orientalist era of post-colonial criticism and critical theory in the social sciences and much of religious studies. In fact, some of the more traditional Western universities still confer degrees in Arabic and Islamic studies under the primary title of &quot;Oriental studies&quot;. This is the case, for example, at the University of Oxford, where classical Arabic and Islamic studies have been taught since as early as the 16th century, originally as a sub-division of divinity. This latter context gave early academic Islamic studies its Biblical studies character and was also a consequence of the fact that, throughout early-modern Western Europe, the discipline was developed by churchmen whose primary aim had been to refute the tenets of Islam. Today, academic Islamic studies is usually taught and studied alongside or after an extensive study of the Arabic language, with named undergraduate and graduate degrees in Arabic and Islamic studies existing at universities such as Georgetown University, the University of Exeter, University of Oxford, University of Leeds, SOAS at the University of London, Yale University and several universities in Holland and Germany (notably Leiden University and Tübingen University).

A recent HEFCE report emphasises the increasing, strategic importance for Western governments since 9/11 of Islamic studies in higher education and also provides an international overview of the state of the field. With the events of 11 September 2001, Islam has become the most prominent world religion and occupies center stage in world politics.

== History ==

In Islamic Studies, there is a tendency to rely on history (as method and approach) as a reassuring scientific framework. However nowadays, besides recurrent debates within history itself, many scientists look unfavorably at a linear conception of time (Rovelli 2018).

The first attempt to understand Islam as a topic of modern scholarship (as opposed to a Christological heresy) was within the context of 19th-century Christian European Oriental studies. Examining and understanding this kind of Islam – a heterogeneous living tradition with some non-discursive elements, which is internally extremely dynamic and multifaceted – is the purview of Islamic studies in the modern world.

In the years 1821 to 1850, the Royal Asiatic Society in England, the Société Asiatique in France, the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft in Germany, and the American Oriental Society in the United States were founded.

In the second half of the 19th century, philological and historical approaches were predominant. Leading in the field were German researchers like Theodore Nöldeke  with his &quot;Geschichte des Qorāns&quot; (&quot;History of the Quran&quot;), and Ignaz Goldziher &#x27;s work on hadith (&quot;Muslim Studies&quot;).

Orientalists and Islamic scholars alike preferred to interpret the history of Islam in a conservative way. They did not question the traditional account of the early time of Islam, of Muhammad and how the Quran was written.

In the 1970s, the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies questioned the uncritical adherence to traditional Islamic sources and started to develop a new picture of the earliest times of Islam by applying the historical-critical method.

== Themes ==
===History of Islam===

To understand the history of Islam provides the indispensable basis to understand all aspects of Islam and its culture. Themes of special interest are:
* Historiography of early Islam
* History of the Quran
* Historicity of Muhammad
* Early Muslim conquests

===Textual Studies===
* Quranic studies
* Hadith studies
* Fiqh studies

=== Gender Textual Studies ===
The history of women and gender in Islamic studies experienced a surge of scholarly research during the early 1990&#x27;s. This wave of scholarship was influenced by the growing presence of politically and religiously active women scholars with Muslim and Arab backgrounds. Additionally, there was a notable increase in the utilization of gender studies methodologies within the traditionally conservative realms of Islamic history and law.

Works such as Leila Ahmed’s Women and Gender in Islam (1992), Fatima Mernissi’s The Veil and the Male Elite (first published in English in 1991, translated from a 1987 French original), and Fedwa Malti-Douglas’s Woman’s Body, Woman’s Word: Gender and Discourse in Arabo-Islamic Writing (1991) surveyed large swathes of Islamic history and thought, suggesting structural connections between gendered religious discourses and the social and political roles and rights of women over time.

The work from this era sparked a significant amount of academic research in that, in the subsequent twenty years, not only expanded and detailed the arguments put forth by these scholars, but also analyzed and improved upon their methodologies. Recent years have seen a shift towards utilizing a broader range of sources and developing more intricate interpretive frameworks, some of which have even challenged the idea of a uniform Islamic gender discourse. Following the impactful comprehensive syntheses of the early 1990&#x27;s, more in-depth and context-specific studies have delved into social customs, religious beliefs, and the interplay between the two.

===Theology===
* Kalam – Islamic studies of theology often include study of the traditional science of Kalâm
* Islamic eschatology

===Mysticism===

Sufism ( &quot;taṣawwuf&quot;) is a mystic tradition of Islam based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as it is gradually revealed to the heart and mind of the Sufi (one who practices Sufism).According to Renard (2021) quoted by Green the meaning of Sufism is “a strong method of Muslim’s knowledge and practice bringing proximity to or meditation with God and believed that it came from Prophet Muhammad from generation to generation who followed him” (P.8). The etymological term &quot;Suf&quot; has mysticism to the educational notion of asceticism. The ascetics and mystics have different and separate roles in each setting, and everyone needs to search the context of a given Sufi’s own time for reasons as to why he/she was known as a Sufi. Sufism is not that, they do not follow the Islam properly it’s just that they spend more time with God. It is an individual way of studying.

It might also be referred to as Islamic mysticism. While other branches of Islam generally focus on exoteric aspects of religion, Sufism is mainly focused on the direct perception of truth or God through mystic practices based on divine love. Sufism embodies a number of cultures, philosophies, central teachings and bodies of esoteric knowledge.

=== Kalam ===
Kalām emerged as a discipline in response to political disputes among Muslims, and then later in response to the impact of Hellenistic philosophy and the expansion of the Islamic Empire into territories previously dominated and occupied by the Sassanian and Byzantine Empires. Thus, one of the first and persistent questions challenging the Islamic community was the status of a believer who committed grave sins.

===Law===

The term “Islamic law” would in itself be an example of such a holistic merging of two spheres, conflating a person’s faith with his rights, or even three, if “law” is seen as a natural aspect of state politics that in a modern differentiated system should not be separated from religion, in its institutions and its rules.

Islamic jurisprudence relates to everyday and social issues in the life of Muslims. It is divided in fields like:
* the study of sharia 
* Islamic economics
* Qur&#x27;an and Hadith studies

Key distinctions include those between &quot;fiqh&quot;, &quot;hadith&quot; and &quot;ijtihad&quot;.
===Philosophy===

Islamic studies scholars also deal with the long and rich tradition of philosophy as developed by Muslim philosophers.

It is divided in fields like:
* Early Islamic philosophy
** Avicennism
** Averroism
* Islamic philosophy
* Modern Islamic philosophy
** Sufi philosophy
** Transcendent theosophy
* List of Muslim philosophers
* Illuminationist philosophy
* Islamic ethics
* Sufi metaphysics

===Sciences===

Islamic studies scholars are also active in the history and philosophy of science. Significant progress in science was made in the Muslim world during the Middle Ages, especially during the Islamic Golden Age, which is considered a major period in the history of science.
* Timeline of Islamic science and engineering
* Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam
* Astronomy in medieval Islam
** Islamic astrology
* Inventions in medieval Islam
* Mathematics in medieval Islam
* Medicine in medieval Islam
** Ophthalmology in medieval Islam
* Physics in medieval Islam
* Psychology in medieval Islam

Scholars also study the relationship between Islam and science, for example in the application of Islamic ethics to scientific practice.
* Qur&#x27;an and science
* Islamic creationism

===Literature===
* Arabic literature
** Arabic epic literature
* Islamic poetry
** Arabic poetry
* Persian literature
* Urdu literature
This field includes the study of modern and classical Arabic and the literature written in those languages. It also often includes other modern, classic or ancient languages of the Middle East and other areas that are or have been part of, or influenced by, Islamic culture, such as Hebrew, Turkish, Persian, Urdu, Azerbaijanian and Uzbek.

===Architecture===

Islamic architecture is the entire range of architecture that has evolved within Muslim culture in the course of the history of Islam. Hence the term encompasses religious buildings as well as secular ones, historic as well as modern expressions and the production of all places that have come under the varying levels of Islamic influence.
===Art===

* Islamic calligraphy
* Islamic pottery
* Muslim music

Islamic visual art has, throughout history, been mainly abstract and decorative, portraying geometric, floral, Arabesque, and calligraphic designs. Unlike the strong tradition of portraying the human figure in Christian art, Islamic art is typically distinguished as not including depictions of human beings. The lack of portraiture is due to the fact that early Islam forbade the painting of human beings, especially the Prophet, as Muslims believe this tempts followers of the Prophet to idolatry. This prohibition against human beings or icons is called aniconism. Despite such a prohibition, depictions of human beings do occur in Islamic art, such as that of the Mughals, demonstrating a strong diversity in popular interpretation over the pre-modern period. Increased contact with the Western civilization may also have contributed to human depictions in Islamic art in modern times.

<text>The Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op. 83, by Johannes Brahms is separated by a gap of 22 years from his first piano concerto. Brahms began work on the piece in 1878 and completed it in 1881 while in Pressbaum near Vienna. It took him three years to work on this concerto, which indicates that he was always self-critical. He wrote to Clara Schumann: &quot;I want to tell you that I have written a very small piano concerto with a very small and pretty scherzo.&quot; Ironically, he was describing a huge piece. This concerto is dedicated to his teacher, Eduard Marxsen. The public premiere of the concerto was given in Budapest on 9 November 1881, with Brahms as soloist and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, and was an immediate success. He proceeded to perform the piece in many cities across Europe.

The piece is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (initially 2 in B bass, 2 in F), 2 trumpets (B), timpani (B and F, A and D in second movement) and strings. (The trumpets and timpani are used only in the first two movements, which is unusual.)

The piece is in four movements, rather than the three typical of concertos in the Classical and Romantic periods:
The additional movement results in a concerto considerably longer than most other concertos written up to that time, with typical performances lasting around 50 minutes. Upon its completion, Brahms sent its score to his friend, the surgeon and violinist Theodor Billroth to whom Brahms had dedicated his first two string quartets, describing the work as &quot;some little piano pieces.&quot; Brahms even described the stormy scherzo as a &quot;little wisp of a scherzo.&quot;

The autograph manuscript of the concerto is preserved in the Hamburg State and University Library Carl von Ossietzky.

==Description==
The work opens with the following horn call, which provides much of the thematic material for the first movement:
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27;
\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot;
\key bes 
\major
\time 4/4 
\tempo 4 = 92
bes4( c d) \times 2/3 {es8( d c)} 
d4( f2.) 
r1
bes4( f es) \times 2/3 {d8( c bes)}
c4( f2.)
&lt;/score&gt;

===Allegro non troppo===

The first movement is in the concerto variant of sonata form. The main theme is introduced by the horn solo, with the piano interceding. The woodwind instruments proceed to introduce a small motif (borrowed, perhaps unconsciously, from the opening of the first movement of his Serenade No. 2) before an unusually placed cadenza appears. The full orchestra repeats the theme and introduces more motifs in the orchestral exposition. The piano and orchestra work together to develop these themes in the piano exposition before the key changes to F minor (from F major, the dominant) and the piano plays a powerful and difficult section before the next orchestral tutti appears. The development, like many such sections in the Classical period, works its way from the dominant key back to the tonic while heavily developing themes. At the beginning of the recapitulation, the theme is replayed before a differing transition is heard, returning to the music heard in the piano exposition (this time in B major/minor). A coda appears after the minor key section, finishing off this movement.

One motif repeated in the development has been noted by musicologists as bearing similarity to &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; and &quot;Say, Brothers&quot;, but it is unlikely Brahms knew of either hymn.

===Allegro appassionato===

This scherzo is in the key of D minor and is in sonata form with a trio inserted in the development. Contrary to Brahms&#x27; &quot;tiny wisp of a scherzo&quot; remark, it is a tumultuous movement. The piano and orchestra introduce the theme and develop it before a quiet section intervenes. Soon afterwards the piano and orchestra launch into a stormy development of the theme before coming to the central episode (in D major). The central episode is brisk and begins with the full orchestra before yet another quiet section intervenes; then the piano is integrated into the orchestral effect to repeat the theme of the central episode. The beginning section returns but is highly varied.

===Andante===

The slow movement is in the tonic key of B major and is unusual in utilizing an extensive cello solo within a piano concerto (the source of this idea may be Clara Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto, which features a slow movement scored only for cello and piano). Brahms subsequently rewrote the cello&#x27;s theme and changed it into a song, &quot;Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer&quot; (&quot;My Slumber Grows Ever More Peaceful&quot;) with lyrics by Hermann Lingg. (Op. 105, No. 2). Within the concerto, the cello plays the theme for the first three minutes, before the piano comes in. However, the gentler melodic piece that the piano plays soon gives way to a stormy theme in B minor. When the storm subsides, still in the minor key, the piano plays a transitional motif that leads to the key of F major, before the cello comes in to reprise, in the wrong key, and knowing that it has to get back to B major, the piano and the orchestra make a brief transition to E major before finishing off the theme in its original home key of B major. After the piano plays the transitional motifs, the piano quickly reprises the middle section before the final coda is established.

===Allegretto grazioso—Un poco più presto===

The last movement consists of five clearly distinguishable sections, which introduce and develop five different themes.

The first section (bars 1 to 64) presents themes 1 and 2. The first theme (also the &quot;main theme&quot;) (1–8) is first played by the piano and then repeated by the orchestra. The second theme (16–20) is likewise presented by the piano and repeated – and expanded – by the orchestra. Finally, a kind of development of the first theme leads on to the next section.

The second section (65–164) contains the next three themes. Theme 3 (65–73) is very different from the previous ones, due largely to its minor setting and its distinctive Hungarian rhythm. Theme 4 (81–88) is still in a minor and theme 5 (97–104) is in F major. These three themes are each repeated back and forth several times, which gives the section the character of a development.

The third section (165–308) can be seen as a reprise of the first; it is built on the first two themes, but a striking new element is given in 201–205 and repeated in 238–241.

The fourth section (309–376) reprises themes 3, 5 and 4, in that order.

The final section, the coda, is built on the main theme, but even here (398) Brahms presents a new element, restating the main theme in triple rhythm (a device he used earlier to end his violin concerto) over a little march, first played by the piano, then answered by the orchestra, which trades themes with the soloist before the final chords.

<doc id="228264" wikidata="Q201196" url="?curid=228264" title="Shavuot">
<text>Shavuot (, from ), or Shvues (, in some Ashkenazi usage), is a Jewish holiday, one of the biblically ordained Three Pilgrimage Festivals. It occurs on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of Sivan; in the 21st century, it may fall anywhere between May 15 and June 14 on the Gregorian calendar.

Shavuot marked the wheat harvest in the Land of Israel in the Hebrew Bible according to Exodus 34:22. In addition, rabbinic tradition teaches that the date also marks the revelation of the Ten Commandments to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred at this date in 1312BCE.

The word &quot;Shavuot&quot; means &quot;weeks&quot; in Hebrew, and marks the conclusion of the Counting of the Omer. Its date is directly linked to that of Passover; the Torah mandates the seven-week Counting of the Omer, beginning on the second day of Passover, to be immediately followed by Shavuot. This counting of days and weeks is understood to express anticipation and desire for the giving of the Torah. On Passover, the people of Israel were freed from their enslavement to Pharaoh; on Shavuot, they were given the Torah and became a nation committed to serving God. 

While Shavuot is sometimes referred to as Pentecost (in ) due to its timing fifty days after the first day of Passover, it is not the same celebration as the Christian Pentecost or Whitsun, which comes fifty days after Easter. That said, the two festivals are related, as the first Day of Pentecost, related in the Acts of the Apostles, is said to have happened on Shavuot.

Shavuot is traditionally celebrated in Israel for one day, where it is a public holiday, and for two days in the diaspora.

==Names==
===Biblical names===
In the Bible, Shavuot is called the &quot;Festival of Weeks&quot; (, , ); &quot;Festival of Reaping&quot; ( ), and &quot;Day of the First Fruits&quot; (, ). &quot;Shavuot&quot;, the plural of a word meaning &quot;week&quot; or &quot;seven&quot;, alludes to the fact that this festival happens exactly seven weeks (i.e. &quot;a week of weeks&quot;) after Passover.

===Later names===
The Talmud refers to Shavuot as ʻAṣeret () according to Pesachim 68b, referring to the prohibition against work on this holiday and also to the conclusion of the Passover holiday season. The other reason given is that just as Shmini ʿAṣeret brings Sukkot to a close, ʿAṣeret brings Passover to a close.

Since Shavuot occurs fifty days after Passover, Hellenistic Jews referred to it by the Koine name &quot;Pentecost&quot;.

==Significance==
===Giving of the Torah===
Shavuot is not explicitly named in the Bible as the day on which the Torah was revealed by God to the Israelite nation at Mount Sinai, although this is commonly considered to be its main significance.

Unlike other major holidays, the Torah does not specify the date of Shavuot, but only that it falls 50 days after Passover, placing it at the 6th of Sivan according to the current fixed calendar (in earlier times when months were fixed by lunar observation, the date could vary by a day or two). The Torah states that the Israelites reached Sinai on the first day of the third month following the Exodus, i.e. Sivan. Then several events occurred, taking a total of at least three days, before the Torah was given. Thus, it is plausible that the giving of the Torah occurred on or about Shavuot, but no exact date is mentioned.

Besides the timing, scholars have pointed to thematic connections between Shavuot and the giving of the Torah, which are indicated by the Bible itself:
* Several aspects of the Shavuot Temple sacrifice (&quot;shtei halechem&quot;) suggest a connection to the Exodus and the giving of the Torah. The &quot;shtei halechem&quot; is the only holiday sacrifice which includes a communal &quot;shelamim&quot; (&quot;peace&quot;) offering, recalling the communal &quot;shelamim&quot; offering which was offered after the acceptance of the Torah (). Also, the &quot;shtei halechem&quot; is one of the few sacrifices to include chametz, suggesting that Shavuot is a counterpoint to Passover and its historical events.

*From an early period, Shavuot was regarded as an appropriate time to make covenants between God and humanity. Asa chose to make his covenant () on or about Shavuot. (Similarly, according to Book of Jubilees, Noah made his covenant with God on Shavuot.) The association between Shavuot and covenants suggests a connection to the giving of the Torah, which itself was a covenant between God and Israel. In addition, the description of Asa&#x27;s covenant repeatedly alludes both to the giving of the Torah and to the Shavuot holiday, suggesting a link between the two.

Most of the Talmudic sages agreed that the Torah was given on the 6 Sivan (the date of Shavuot), but Jose ben Halafta holds that it was given on 7 Sivan. According to the classical timeline, the Israelites arrived at the wilderness of Sinai on the new moon () and the Ten Commandments were given on the following Shabbat (i.e., Saturday). The question of whether the new moon fell on Sunday or Monday is undecided. In practice, Shavuot is observed on 6 Sivan in Israel and a second day is added in the Jewish diaspora (in keeping with a separate rabbinical ruling that applies to all biblical holidays, called &quot;Yom tov sheni shel galuyot&quot;, Second-Day Yom Tov in the diaspora). Thus, according to Jose ben Halafta, only outside Israel does Shavuot fall out on the day the Torah was given.

===Agricultural===
What is textually connected in the Bible to the Feast of Shavuot is the season of the grain harvest, specifically of the wheat, in the Land of Israel. In ancient times, the grain harvest lasted seven weeks and was a season of gladness (, , ). It began with harvesting the barley during Passover and ended with harvesting the wheat at Shavuot. Shavuot was thus the concluding festival of the grain harvest, just as the eighth day of Sukkot was the concluding festival of the fruit harvest. During the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem, an offering of two loaves of bread from the wheat harvest was made on Shavuot according to the commandment in .

The penultimate Dead Sea text to be published has been discovered to contain two festival dates observed by the sect at Qumran as part of their formally perfect 364-day calendar. It was dedicated to New Wine and New Oil, which are not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible but were known from another Qumran manuscript, the Temple Scroll. These festivals &quot;constituted an extension of the festival of Shavuot... which celebrates the New Wheat.&quot; All three festivals are calculated starting from the first Sabbath following Passover by repeatedly adding exactly fifty days each time: first came New Wheat (Shavuot), then New Wine, and then New Oil. (See also below, at &quot;The Book of Jubilees and the Essenes&quot;.)

==Ancient observances==
===Pilgrimage===
Shavuot was one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals on which Jews would visit the Temple in Jerusalem.

===&quot;Bikkurim&quot;===
Shavuot was also the first day on which individuals could bring the bikkurim or &quot;first fruits&quot; to the Temple in Jerusalem. Bikkurim were so crucial to Shavuot that the Torah twice describes the holiday as a day of bikkurim; wheat was ready for harvest, summer fruits were beginning to ripen, and bikkurim were brought.

===&quot;Shtei Halechem&quot;===
The Torah prescribes a unique sacrifice for Shavuot: the &quot;shtei halechem&quot; or Two Loaves, which (atypically for sacrifices) must be chametz, and which are described as &quot;bikkurim&quot; of the wheat harvest. These loaves are accompanied by a set of other sacrifices.

According to Judah Loew ben Bezalel, there is a symbolic contrast between the omer offering of Passover and the Two Loaves. The former consists of barley, which is typically an animal food, and represents the low spiritual level of the Israelites immediately upon leaving Egypt during the Exodus; while the latter consists of wheat and represents the high spiritual level of the Israelites upon receiving the Torah.

==Modern religious observances==
Nowadays in the post-Temple era, Shavuot is the only biblically ordained holiday that has no specific laws attached to it other than usual festival requirements of abstaining from creative work. The rabbinic observances for the holiday include reciting additional prayers, making kiddush, partaking of meals and being in a state of joy. There are however many customs which are observed on Shavuot. A mnemonic for the customs largely observed in Ashkenazi communities spells the Hebrew word &quot;aḥarit&quot; (, &quot;last&quot;):
* – &quot;Aqdamut&quot;, the reading of a piyyut (liturgical poem) during Shavuot morning synagogue services
* – &quot;ḥalav&quot; (milk), the consumption of dairy products like milk and cheese
* – &quot;Rut&quot;, the reading of the Book of Ruth at morning services (outside Israel: on the second day)
* – &quot;Yereq&quot; (greening), the decoration of homes and synagogues with greenery
* – &quot;Torah&quot;, engaging in all-night Torah study.

The &quot;yahrzeit&quot; of King David is traditionally observed on Shavuot. Hasidic Jews also observe the &quot;yahrzeit&quot; of the Baal Shem Tov.

===Liturgical poems===
====&quot;Aqdamut&quot;====
The &quot;Aqdamut&quot; () is a liturgical poem recited by Ashkenazi Jews extolling the greatness of God, the Torah, and Israel that is read publicly in Ashkenazic synagogues in the middle ofor in some communities right beforethe morning Torah reading on the first day of Shavuot. It was composed by Meir of Worms. Meir was forced to defend the Torah and his Jewish faith in a debate with local priests and successfully conveyed his certainty of God&#x27;s power, His love for the Jewish people, and the excellence of Torah. Afterwards he wrote the &quot;Aqdamut&quot;, a 90-line poem in Aramaic that stresses these themes. The poem is written in a double acrostic pattern according to the order of the Hebrew alphabet. In addition, each line ends with the syllable &quot;ta&quot; (), the last and first letters of the Hebrew alphabet, alluding to the endlessness of Torah. The traditional melodies that accompanies this poem also conveys a sense of grandeur and triumph.

====&quot;Azharot&quot;====
There is an ancient tradition to recite poems known as Azharot ( listing the commandments. This was already considered a well-established custom in the 9th century. These piyyutim were originally recited during the chazzan&#x27;s repetition of the Mussaf amidah, in some communities they were later moved to a different part of the service.

Some Ashkenazic communities maintain the original practice of reciting the Azharot during mussaf; they recite &quot;&quot; on the first day and &quot;Azharat Reishit&quot; on the second, both from the early Geonic period. Italian Jews do the same except that they switch the piyyutim of the two day, and in recent centuries, &quot;Ata Hinchalta&quot; has been truncated to include only one 22-line poem instead of eight. Many Sephardic Jews recite the Azharot of Solomon ibn Gabirol before the mincha service; in many communities, the positive commandments are recited on the first day and the negative commandments on the second day.

====&quot;Yatziv Pitgam&quot;====
The liturgical poem &quot;Yatziv Pitgam&quot; () is recited by some synagogues in the diaspora on the second day of Shavuot. The author signs his name at the beginning of the poem&#x27;s 15 linesYaakov ben Meir Levi, better knows as Rabbeinu Tam.

===Dairy foods===
Dairy foods such as cheesecake, cheese &quot;blintzes&quot;, and cheese &quot;kreplach&quot; among Ashkenazi Jews; cheese &quot;sambusak&quot;, &quot;kelsonnes&quot; (ravioli filled with tzfatit cheese), and &quot;atayef&quot; (a cheese-filled pancake) among Sephardic and Syrian Jews; &quot;kahee&quot; (a dough that is buttered and sugared) among Iraqi Jews; &quot;kadeh&quot; (a cheese-filled bread) among Kurdish Jews, and a seven-layer cake called &quot;siete cielos&quot; (seven heavens) among Tunisian and Moroccan Jews are traditionally consumed on the Shavuot holiday. As a dessert, Sephardic Jews traditionally consume &quot;sütlaç&quot; (a rice pudding cooked in milk) decorated with cinnamon in designs such as the Star of David, flowers, and other patterns. Yemenite Jews do not eat dairy foods on Shavuot.

In keeping with the observance of other Jewish holidays, there is both a night meal and a day meal on Shavuot. Meat is usually served at night and dairy is served either for the day meal or for a morning kiddush.

Among the explanations given in rabbinic literature for the consumption of dairy foods on this holiday are:
*Before they received the Torah, the Israelites were not obligated to follow its laws, which include &quot;shechita&quot; (ritual slaughter of animals) and kashrut. Since all their meat pots and dishes now had to be made kosher before use, they opted to eat dairy foods.
*The Torah is compared to milk by King Solomon, who wrote: &quot;Like honey and milk, it lies under your tongue&quot; (Song of Songs ).
*The gematria of the Hebrew word &quot;ḥalav&quot; () is 40, corresponding to the forty days and forty nights that Moses spent on Mount Sinai before bringing down the Torah.
*According to the &quot;Zohar&quot;, each day of the year correlates to one of the Torah&#x27;s 365 negative commandments. Shavuot corresponds to the commandment &quot;Bring the first fruits of your land to the house of God your Lord; do not cook a kid in its mother&#x27;s milk&quot; (Exodus 34:26). Since the first day to bring &quot;Bikkurim&quot; (the first fruits) is Shavuot, the second half of the verse refers to the custom to eat two separate mealsone milk, one meaton Shavuot.
* calls Mount Sinai &quot;Har Gavnunim&quot; (, mountain of majestic peaks), which is possibly related to &quot;gevinah&quot; (, cheese).

===Book of Ruth===
The Five Megillot – five books from the Hebrew Bible – are traditionally read in synagogue on various Jewish holidays. Of these, the Book of Ruth is read on Shavuot. Reasons given for this custom include:
#Shavuot is harvest time (), and the events of Book of Ruth occur at harvest time.
#Because Shavuot is traditionally cited as the day of the giving of the Torah, the entry of the entire Jewish people into the covenant of the Torah is a major theme of the day. Ruth&#x27;s conversion to Judaism, and consequent entry into that covenant, is described in the book. This theme accordingly resonates with other themes of the day.
#King David (Ruth&#x27;s descendant, whose genealogy appears at the end of the Book of Ruth) was traditionally born and died on Shavuot.
#The gematria (numerical value) of Ruth is 606. Added to the Seven Laws of Noah, the total equals the 613 commandments in the Torah.
#Another central theme of the book is &quot;ḥesed&quot; (loving-kindness), a major theme of the Torah.
===Greenery===

In many Jewish communities, there is a tradition to decorate homes and synagogues with plants, flowers and leafy branches on Shavuot. In fact, Persian Jews referred to the holiday as &quot;The Mo&#x27;ed of Flowers&quot; (موعد گل) in Persian, and never as &quot;Shavuot&quot;.

A common reason given for this custom is the story that Mount Sinai suddenly blossomed with flowers in anticipation of the giving of the Torah on its summit. This idea is first mentioned in medieval Ashkenazi sources such as Maharil. In another interpretation, flowers represent the Jewish people, which received a covenant with God on this date. Other reasons have been suggested as well.

Some synagogues decorate the bimah with a canopy of flowers and plants so that it resembles a chuppah, as Shavuot is mystically referred to as the day the matchmaker (Moses) brought the bride (the nation of Israel) to the chuppah (Mount Sinai) to marry the bridegroom (God); the &quot;ketubah&quot; (marriage contract) was the Torah. Some Eastern Sephardi communities read out a &quot;ketubah&quot; between God and Israel, composed by Israel ben Moses Najara as part of the service. This custom was also adopted by some Hasidic communities, particularly from Hungary.

The Vilna Gaon cancelled the tradition of decorating with trees because it too closely resembles the Christian decorations for their holidays.

===All-night Torah study===
Some have the custom to learn Torah all night on the first night of Shavuot, a practice known as &quot;Tiqqun Leyl Shavuot&quot; () (&quot;Rectification for Shavuot Night&quot;).

The custom is first recorded in the . According to that work, &quot;Our righteous forebears, servants of the Most High, would never sleep on Shavuot eve—and now we do this on both nights—for all night they would read the Torah and the Nevi&#x27;im and the Ketuvim, and they would skip around the Talmud and the Aggadot, and they would read the secret wisdoms until dawn broke, and they would hold the legacy of their fathers in their very hands&quot;. The custom was later linked to a Midrash which relates that the night before the Torah was given, the Israelites retired early to be well-rested for the momentous day ahead. They overslept and Moses had to wake them up because God was already waiting on the mountaintop. To rectify this perceived flaw in the national character, many religious Jews stay up all night to learn Torah.

In 1533 Joseph Caro, author of the &quot;Shulchan Arukh&quot;, then living in Ottoman Salonika, invited Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz and other Kabbalistic colleagues to hold Shavuot-night study vigils for which they prepared for three days in advance, just as the Israelites had prepared for three days before the giving of the Torah. During one of those study sessions, an angel reportedly appeared and taught them Jewish law. 

It has been suggested that the introduction of coffee throughout the Ottoman empire may have attributed to the &quot;feasibility and popularity&quot; of the practice of all-night Torah study. In contrast, the custom of Yemenite Jews is to ingest the fresh leaves of a stimulant herb called Khat (containing cathinone) for the all-night ritual, an herb commonly used in that region of the world.

Any subject may be studied on Shavuot night, although Talmud, Mishnah, and Torah typically top the list. People may learn alone or with a &quot;chavruta&quot; (study partner), or attend late-night &quot;shiurim&quot; (lectures) and study groups. In keeping with the custom of engaging in all-night Torah study, leading 16th-century kabbalist Isaac Luria arranged a recital consisting of excerpts from the beginning and end of each of the 24 books of Tanakh (including the reading in full of several key sections such as the account of the days of creation, the Exodus, the giving of the Ten Commandments and the Shema) and the 63 tractates of Mishnah, followed by the reading of &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, the 613 commandments as enumerated by Maimonides, and excerpts from the Zohar, with opening and concluding prayers. The whole reading is divided into thirteen parts, after each of which a &quot;Kaddish d-Rabbanan&quot; is recited when the &quot;Tiqun&quot; is studied with a minyan. Today, this service is held in many communities, with the notable exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews. The service is printed in a book called &quot;Tiqun Leyl Shavuot&quot;. There exist similar books for the vigils before the seventh day of Pesach and Hosha&#x27;ana Rabbah.

In Jerusalem, at the conclusion of the night time study session, tens of thousands of people walk to the Western Wall to pray with sunrise. A week after Israel captured the Old City during the Six-Day War, more than 200,000 Jews streamed to the site on Shavuot, it having been made accessible to Jews for the first time since 1948.

==Modern secular observance==
In secular agricultural communities in Israel, such as most kibbutzim and moshavim, Shavuot is celebrated as a harvest and first-fruit festival including a wider, symbolic meaning of joy over the accomplishments of the year. As such, not just agricultural produce and machinery is presented to the community, but also the babies born during the preceding twelve months.

==Confirmation ceremonies==
In the 19th century several Orthodox synagogues in Britain and Australia held confirmation ceremonies for 12-year-old girls on Shavuot, a precursor to the modern Bat Mitzvah. The early Reform movement made Shavuot into a religious school graduation day. Today, Reform synagogues in North America typically hold confirmation ceremonies on Shavuot for students aged 16 to 18 who are completing their religious studies. The graduating class stands in front of an open ark, recalling the standing of the Israelites at Mount Sinai for the giving of the Torah.

==Date==
The Torah states that the Omer offering (i.e., the first day of counting the Omer) is the first day of the barley harvest. The omer count should begin &quot;on the morrow after the Shabbat&quot;, and continue to be counted for seven weeks.

The Talmudic Sages determined that &quot;Shabbat&quot; here means a day of rest and refers to the first day of Passover. Thus, the counting of the Omer begins on the second day of Passover and continues for the next 49 days, or seven complete weeks, ending on the day before Shavuot. According to this calculation, Shavuot will fall on the day of the week after that of the first day of Passover (e.g., if Passover starts on a Thursday, Shavuot will begin on a Friday).

===The Book of Jubilees and the Essenes===
This literal interpretation of &quot;Shabbat&quot; as the weekly Shabbat was shared by the author of the Book of Jubilees, who was motivated by the priestly sabbatical solar calendar to have festivals and Sabbaths fall on the same day of the week every year. On this calendar (best known from the Book of Luminaries in the Book of Enoch), Shavuot fell on the 15th of Sivan, a Sunday. The date was reckoned fifty days from the first Shabbat after Passover (i.e. from the 25th of Nisan). Thus, Jub. 1:1 claims that Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Torah &quot;on the sixteenth day of the third month in the first year of the Exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt&quot;.

In Jub. 6:15–22 and 44:1–5, the holiday is traced to the appearance of the first rainbow on the 15th of Sivan, the day on which God made his covenant with Noah.

The Qumran community, commonly associated with the Essenes, held in its library several texts mentioning Shavuot, most notably a Hebrew original of the Book of Jubilees, which sought to fix the celebration of Shavuot on 15 Sivan, following their interpretation of Exodus 19:1.

<text>The Last Samurai is a 2003 American epic period action drama film directed and produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz from a story devised by Logan. The film stars Tom Cruise, who also produced, along with Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Koyuki Kato in supporting roles.
The film&#x27;s plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion, led by Saigō Takamori, and the Westernization of Japan by foreign powers. 

Cruise portrays Nathan Algren, an American captain of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with samurai warriors in the wake of the Meiji Restoration in 19th century Japan. The character of Algren is very loosely based on Eugène Collache and Jules Brunet, both French Imperial Guard officers who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War.

&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; grossed a total of $456 million at the box office and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2003. It received praise for the acting, visuals, cinematography and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score but criticism for some of its portrayals. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two National Board of Review Awards.

== Plot ==

In 1876, former U.S. Army Captain Nathan Algren, an alcoholic traumatized by the atrocities during the American Indian Wars, is approached by his former commanding officer, Colonel Bagley. Bagley asks him to train the newly created Imperial Japanese Army for a Japanese businessman, Matsue Omura, who intends to use the army to suppress a samurai rebellion against Japan&#x27;s new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley, Algren takes the job for the money. His old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant, accompanies him. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the samurai.

Algren learns that the imperial soldiers are poorly trained conscripts. While training, he learns of a samurai attack on one of Omura&#x27;s railroads. Against Algren&#x27;s wishes, Omura sends the soldiers in pursuit. However, the battle becomes a disaster, as the soldiers are quickly routed and flee, and Gant is killed. Algren is wounded, and he is taken prisoner when samurai leader Katsumoto spares him. Imperial General Hasegawa is allowed to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;.

Algren is taken to Katsumoto&#x27;s village and, at Katsumoto&#x27;s request, is taken in and tended to by Taka, Katsumoto&#x27;s sister, who Algren later realizes is the widow of a samurai he killed before being taken prisoner. While initially poorly treated, he eventually gains the samurai&#x27;s respect. With Taka&#x27;s help, Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns the Japanese culture, and is trained in the art of kenjutsu. He develops sympathy for the samurai, who are upset that modernization has eroded their traditions. Algren and Taka develop an unspoken affection for each other.

One night, ninjas infiltrate the village and ambush Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto&#x27;s life and then helps defend the village, concluding that Omura is responsible. Katsumoto requests a meeting with Emperor Meiji in Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving, Algren sees that the Imperial Army is better trained under Bagley. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced emperor is a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto&#x27;s arrest for carrying a sword in public and tells him to perform &quot;seppuku&quot; the next day to redeem his honor. Meanwhile, Algren refuses Omura&#x27;s offer to resume command of the army. After defeating agents sent by Omura to assassinate him, Algren enlists Graham and Katsumoto&#x27;s men to free their leader. During the rescue, Katsumoto&#x27;s wounded son Nobutada sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.

As the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates &quot;seppuku&quot;, but Algren convinces him to fight and pledges to join the samurai in battle. They return to the village, and Taka dresses Algren in her late husband&#x27;s samurai armor, and Katsumoto presents him with a newly-forged samurai sword engraved with an inscription dubbing Algren &quot;the warrior in which the old ways have joined the new.&quot;

On the battlefield, Algren and Katsumoto meet with Omura and Bagley for parley; Bagley offers Katsumoto to surrender, which he refuses. The samurai use the Imperial Army&#x27;s overconfidence to lure them into a trap; the ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides. With their numbers dwindling and imminent imperial reinforcements arriving, Katsumoto orders a suicidal cavalry charge on horseback. The samurai break through Bagley&#x27;s line, and Algren kills Bagley, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by Gatling guns. The imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the slaughter, orders to cease fire. Katsumoto, mortally wounded, commits &quot;seppuku&quot; with Algren&#x27;s help as the soldiers kneel in respect.

Later, as trade negotiations conclude, the injured Algren interrupts the proceedings. He presents the emperor with Katsumoto&#x27;s sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow samurai fought and died. The emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it can&#x27;t forget its own culture and history. He rejects the trade offer, and when Omura protests, the emperor tells him he has done enough and threatens to seize his fortune and distribute it to the people. The emperor asks Algren how Katsumoto died, to which Algren responds that he will instead tell the emperor how he lived. Algren returns to the village to reunite with Taka.

==Cast==

*Tom Cruise as Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War and Indian War veteran. Although he is an exceptionally talented soldier, he is haunted by his role in the massacre of Native Americans at the Sand Creek or Chivington and/or the massacre of Native Americans at the Washita River. Following his discharge from the United States Army, he agrees to help the new Meiji Restoration government train its first Western-style conscript army for a significant sum of money. During the army&#x27;s first battle he is captured by the samurai Katsumoto and taken to the village of Katsumoto&#x27;s son, where he soon becomes intrigued with the way of the samurai and decides to join them in their cause. His journal entries reveal his impressions about traditional Japanese culture, which almost immediately evolve into unrestrained admiration of Japan. 
*Ken Watanabe as Lord Moritsugu Katsumoto, the eponymous &quot;Last Samurai,&quot; a former &quot;daimyo&quot; who was once Emperor Meiji&#x27;s most trusted teacher. His displeasure with the influence of Omura and other Western reformers on the Emperor lead him to organize his fellow samurai in a revolt, which he hopes will convince the government not to destroy the samurai&#x27;s place in Japanese society. Katsumoto is based on real-life samurai Saigō Takamori, who led the Satsuma Rebellion.
*Koyuki as Taka Katsumoto, widow of a samurai slain by Nathan Algren and younger sister of Moritsugu. She and Algren develop feelings for each other, and she gives him her husband&#x27;s armor to wear in the final battle of the rebellion.
*Timothy Spall as Simon Graham, a British photographer and scholar hired as an interpreter for Captain Algren and his non-English speaking soldiers. Initially portrayed as a friendly yet mission-oriented and practical-minded companion, he later comes to sympathize with the samurai cause and helps Algren rescue Katsumoto from Imperial soldiers. Graham is loosely based on real-life British Japanologist Ernest Mason Satow, who befriended Saigō Takamori during the Satsuma rebellion.
*Shin Koyamada as Moritsugu Nobutada, Katsumoto&#x27;s only son and lord of the village where Algren is sent. Nobutada befriends Algren when Katsumoto assigns him to teach Algren Japanese culture and the Japanese language. He dies when he willingly chooses to distract Imperial troops so his father can escape their custody.
*Tony Goldwyn as Colonel Bagley, Nathan Algren&#x27;s former commanding officer in the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Ruthless and amoral, Bagley convinces Algren to serve as a training instructor for the Imperial Army despite Algren&#x27;s hatred of Bagley for his role in the Washita River massacre. In contrast to Algren, Bagley is arrogant and dismissive of the samurai, at one point referring to them as nothing more than &quot;savages with bows and arrows&quot;. He is killed by Algren who throws a sword into his chest when Bagley tries to shoot Katsumoto in the final battle.
*Masato Harada as Matsue Omura, an industrialist and pro-reform politician. He quickly imports Westernization and modernization while making money for himself through his ownership of Japan&#x27;s railroads. Coming from a merchant family, a social class repressed during the days of Shogun rule, Omura openly expresses his contempt for the samurai and takes advantage of Emperor Meiji&#x27;s youth to become his chief advisor, persuading him to form a Western-style army for the sole purpose of wiping out Katsumoto and his rebels while ignoring their grievances. His appearance is designed to evoke the image of Okubo Toshimichi, a leading reformer during the Meiji Restoration. Harada noted that he was deeply interested in joining the film after witnessing the construction of Emperor Meiji&#x27;s conference room on sound stage 19 (where Humphrey Bogart had once acted) at Warner Brothers studios.
*Shichinosuke Nakamura as Emperor Meiji. Credited with the implementation of the Meiji reforms to Japanese society, the Emperor is eager to import Western ideas and practices to modernize and empower Japan to become a strong nation. However, his inexperience causes him to rely heavily on the advice of men like Omura, who have their own agendas. His appearance bears a strong resemblance to Emperor Meiji during the 1860s (when his authority as Emperor was not yet firmly established) rather than during the 1870s, when the film takes place.
*Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, a master swordsman and one of Katsumoto&#x27;s most trusted followers. Initially showing the most disdain towards Algren during the latter&#x27;s time in captivity, he teaches Algren the art of sword fighting, coming to respect him as an equal. He is one of the last samurai to die in the final battle, being gunned down during Katsumoto&#x27;s charge.
*Seizo Fukumoto as Silent Samurai, an elderly samurai tasked with monitoring Algren during his time in the village, who calls the samurai &quot;Bob&quot;. &quot;Bob&quot; ultimately saves Algren&#x27;s life (and speaking for the first and only time, &quot;Algren-san!&quot;) by taking a bullet meant for him in the final battle.
*Billy Connolly as Sergeant Zebulon Gant, an Irish American Civil War veteran who served with and is loyal to Algren, persuading him to come to Japan and working with him to train the Imperial Army. During the first battle, he is killed by Hirotaro (Taka&#x27;s husband) after being wounded with a spear.
*Shun Sugata as Nakao, a tall samurai who wields a naginata and is skilled in jujutsu. He assists Algren in rescuing Katsumoto and dies along with the other samurai in the final battle.
* Togo Igawa as General Hasegawa, a former Samurai serving in the Imperial Japanese Army. He commits seppuku after the first battle.

== Production ==

The producer&#x27;s involvement in the film was originally developed in 1992 when Interscope Communications, a predecessor to Radar Pictures, developed the film, which was originally written by Michael Alan Eddy. Eddy sued the film&#x27;s producers in 2004 claiming the WGA and Warner Bros. refused to give him credit.

Filming took place in New Zealand, mostly in the Taranaki region, with mostly Japanese cast members and an American production crew. This location was chosen due to the fact that Egmont/Mount Taranaki resembles Mount Fuji, and also because there is a lot of forest and farmland in the Taranaki region. American Location Manager Charlie Harrington saw the mountain in a travel book and encouraged the producers to send him to Taranaki to scout the locations. This acted as a backdrop for many scenes, as opposed to the built up cities of Japan. Several of the village scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot in Burbank, California. Some scenes were shot in Kyoto and Himeji, Japan. There were 13 filming locations altogether. Tom Cruise did his own stunts for the film.

The film is based on an original screenplay entitled &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; by John Logan. The project itself was inspired by writer and director Vincent Ward. Ward became executive producer on the film – working in development on it for nearly four years and after approaching several directors, including Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Weir, until he became interested with Edward Zwick. The film production went ahead with Zwick and was shot in Ward&#x27;s native New Zealand.

Cinematographer John Toll invited Gary Capo on the project to serve as second unit director and cinematographer. Capo specifically supervised a lot of the filming of the climatic battle sequence between the Japanese army and the samurai.

The film was based on the stories of Eugène Collache and Jules Brunet, both French Imperial Guard officers, who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War; and Philip Kearny, a United States Army (Union Army) and French Imperial Guard soldier, notable for his leadership in the American Civil War, who fought against the Tututni tribe in the Rogue River Wars in Oregon. The historical roles of other European nations who were involved in the westernization of Japan are largely attributed to the United States in the film, although the film references European involvement as well.

== Music ==

The Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score was released on November 25, 2003, by Warner Sunset Records. All music on the soundtrack was composed, arranged, and produced by Hans Zimmer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, and conducted by Blake Neely. It peaked at number 24 on the US Top Soundtracks chart.

== Release ==
&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; had its world premiere in Tokyo in November 20, 2003. The film was released worldwide to theaters on December 5, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
Critical reception in Japan was generally positive. Tomomi Katsuta of The &quot;Mainichi Shinbun&quot; thought that the film was &quot;a vast improvement over previous American attempts to portray Japan&quot;, noting that director Edward Zwick &quot;had researched Japanese history, cast well-known Japanese actors and consulted dialogue coaches to make sure he didn&#x27;t confuse the casual and formal categories of Japanese speech.&quot; Katsuta still found fault with the film&#x27;s idealistic, &quot;storybook&quot; portrayal of the samurai, stating: &quot;Our image of samurai is that they were more corrupt.&quot; As such, he said, the noble samurai leader Katsumoto &quot;set my teeth on edge.&quot;

In the United States, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 66% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 221 reviews, with an average score of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;With high production values and thrilling battle scenes, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is a satisfying epic.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 55, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying &quot;beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it&#x27;s an uncommonly thoughtful epic.&quot;

One online analyst compares the movie favorably to &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; in that each protagonist meets and combats a &quot;technologically backward people&quot;. Both Costner&#x27;s and Cruise&#x27;s characters have suffered through a series of traumatic and brutal battles. Each ultimately uses his experiences to later assist his new friends. Each comes to respect his newly adopted culture. Each even fights with his new community against the people and traditions from which he came.

=== Box office ===
The film achieved higher box office receipts in Japan than in the United States. Upon its debut, it collected a total opening weekend gross of $8 million. Overall, it ranked number two at the box office behind &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. It became the highest-grossing R-rated film there, surpassing &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The film grossed $456.8 million against a production budget of $140 million. It grossed $111,127,263 in the United States and Canada, and $345,631,718 in other countries. It was one of the most successful box office hits in Japan, where it grossed ().

=== Accolades ===


== Criticism and debate ==

Motoko Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the film has opened up a debate, &quot;particularly among Asian-Americans and Japanese,&quot; about whether the film and others like it were &quot;racist, naïve, well-intentioned, accurate – or all of the above.&quot;

Todd McCarthy, a film critic for the &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, wrote: &quot;Clearly enamored of the culture it examines while resolutely remaining an outsider&#x27;s romanticization of it, yarn is disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures, Western despoilment of them, liberal historical guilt, the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars.&quot;

According to the history professor Cathy Schultz, &quot;Many samurai fought Meiji modernization not for altruistic reasons but because it challenged their status as the privileged warrior caste. Meiji reformers proposed the radical idea that all men essentially being equal... The film also misses the historical reality that many Meiji policy advisors were former samurai, who had voluntarily given up their traditional privileges to follow a course they believed would strengthen Japan.&quot;

The fictional character of Katsumoto bears a striking resemblance to the historical figure of Saigō Takamori, a hero of the Meiji Restoration and the leader of the ineffective Satsuma Rebellion, who appears in the histories and legends of modern Japan as a hero against the corruption, extravagance, and unprincipled politics of his contemporaries. &quot;Though he had agreed to become a member of the new government,&quot; wrote the translator and historian Ivan Morris, &quot;it was clear from his writings and statements that he believed the ideals of the civil war were being vitiated. He was opposed to the excessively rapid changes in Japanese society and was particularly disturbed by the shabby treatment of the warrior class.&quot; Suspicious of the new bureaucracy, he wanted power to remain in the hands of the samurai class and the Emperor, and for those reasons, he had joined the central government. &quot;Edicts like the interdiction against carrying swords and wearing the traditional topknot seemed like a series of gratuitous provocations; and, though Saigō realized that Japan needed an effective standing army to resist pressure from the West, he could not countenance the social implications of the military reforms. For this reason Saigō, although participating in the Okinoerabu government, continued to exercise a powerful appeal among disgruntled ex-samurai in Satsuma and elsewhere.&quot; Saigō fought for a moral revolution, not a material one, and he described his revolt as a check on the declining morality of a new, Westernizing materialism.

In 2014, the movie was one of several discussed by Keli Goff in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in an article on white savior narratives in film, a cinematic trope studied in sociology, for which &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has been analyzed. David Sirota at &quot;Salon&quot; saw the film as &quot;yet another film presenting the white Union army official as personally embodying the North&#x27;s Civil War effort to liberate people of color&quot; and criticizing the release poster as &quot;a not-so-subtle message encouraging audiences to (wrongly) perceive the white guy -- and not a Japanese person -- as the last great leader of the ancient Japanese culture.&quot;

In a 2022 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ken Watanabe stated that he didn&#x27;t think of &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as a white savior narrative and that it was a turning point for Asian representation in Hollywood. Watanabe also stated, “Before &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, there was this stereotype of Asian people with glasses, bucked teeth and a camera,” [...] It was stupid, but after &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; came out, Hollywood tried to be more authentic when it came to Asian stories.”

<text>The Zimmermann telegram (or Zimmermann note or Zimmermann cable) was a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office on January 17, 1917, that proposed a military contract between the German Empire and Mexico if the United States entered World War I against Germany. With Germany&#x27;s aid, Mexico would recover Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The telegram was intercepted by British intelligence.

Revelation of the contents enraged Americans, especially after German State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Arthur Zimmermann publicly admitted on March 3, 1917, that the telegram was genuine. It helped to generate support for the American declaration of war on Germany in April 1917.

The decryption has been described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I and it marked one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events. The decryption was possible after the failure of the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition to Afghanistan, when Wilhelm Wassmuss abandoned his codebook, which the Allies later recovered, and allowed the British to decrypt the Zimmermann telegram.

==Content==

The message came in the form of a coded telegram dispatched by Arthur Zimmermann, the (a top-level civil servant, second only to their respective minister) in the Foreign Office of the German Empire on January 17, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador to Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany on February 1, which the German government presumed would almost certainly lead to war with the United States. The telegram instructed Von Eckardt that if the United States appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican government with a proposal for military alliance with funding from Germany. The decoded telegram was as follows:

==History==
===Previous German efforts to promote war===
Germany had long sought to incite a war between Mexico and the United States, which would have tied down American forces and slowed the export of American arms to the Allies. The Germans had aided in arming Mexico, as shown by the 1914 Ypiranga incident. German Naval Intelligence officer Franz von Rintelen had attempted to incite a war between Mexico and the United States in 1915, giving Victoriano Huerta $12 million for that purpose. The German saboteur Lothar Witzke, who was based in Mexico City, claimed to be responsible for the March 1917 munitions explosion at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was possibly responsible for the July 1916 Black Tom explosion in New Jersey.

The failure of United States troops to capture Pancho Villa in 1916 and the movement of President Carranza in favor of Germany emboldened the Germans to send the Zimmermann note.

The German provocations were partially successful. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the military invasion of Veracruz in 1914 in the context of the Ypiranga incident and against the advice of the British government. War was prevented thanks to the Niagara Falls peace conference organized by the ABC nations, but the occupation was a decisive factor in Mexican neutrality in World War I. Mexico refused to participate in the embargo against Germany and granted full guarantees to the German companies for keeping their operations open, specifically in Mexico City.

===German motivations===

The Zimmermann telegram was part of an effort carried out by the Germans to postpone the transportation of supplies and other war materials from the United States to the Allies, which were at war against Germany. The main purpose of the telegram was to make the Mexican government declare war on the United States in hopes of tying down American forces and slowing the export of American arms. The German High Command believed that it could defeat the British and French on the Western Front and strangle Britain with unrestricted submarine warfare before American forces could be trained and shipped to Europe in sufficient numbers to aid the Allies. The Germans were encouraged by their successes on the Eastern Front to believe that they could divert large numbers of troops to the Western Front in support of their goals.

==Mexican response==
Mexican President Venustiano Carranza assigned a military commission to assess the feasibility of the Mexican takeover of their former territories contemplated by Germany. The generals concluded that such a war was unwinnable for the following reasons:
* Mexico was in the midst of a civil war, and Carranza&#x27;s position was far from secure. (Carranza himself was later assassinated in 1920.) Picking a fight with the United States would have prompted the U.S. to support one of his rivals.
* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico&#x27;s military forces had been completely united and loyal to a single government, no serious scenario existed under which it could have invaded and won a war against the United States. Indeed, much of Mexico&#x27;s military hardware of 1917 reflected only modest upgrades since the Mexican-American War 70 years before, which the U.S. had won.
* The German government&#x27;s promises of &quot;generous financial support&quot; were very unreliable. It had already informed Carranza in June 1916 that it could not provide the necessary gold needed to stock a completely independent Mexican national bank. Even if Mexico received financial support, it would still need to purchase arms, ammunition, and other needed war supplies from the ABC nations (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), which would strain relations with them, as explained below.
* Even if by some chance Mexico had the military means to win a conflict against the United States and to reclaim the territories in question, it would have had severe difficulty conquering and pacifying a large English-speaking population which had long enjoyed self-government and was better supplied with arms than were most other civilian populations.
* Other foreign relations were at stake. The ABC nations had organized the Niagara Falls peace conference in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the United States occupation of Veracruz. Mexico entering a war against the United States would strain relations with those nations.

The Carranza government was recognized &quot;de jure&quot; by the United States on August 31, 1917, as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram to ensure Mexican neutrality during World War I. After the military invasion of Veracruz in 1914, Mexico did not participate in any military excursion with the United States in World War I. That ensured that Mexican neutrality was the best outcome that the United States could hope for even if it allowed German companies to keep their operations in Mexico open.

==British interception==
The decryption was possible after the failure of the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition to Afghanistan, when Wilhelm Wassmuss abandoned his codebook, which the Allies later recovered, and allowed the British to decrypt the Zimmermann telegram.

Zimmermann&#x27;s office sent the telegram to the German embassy in the United States for retransmission to Von Eckardt in Mexico. It has traditionally been understood that the telegram was sent over three routes. It went by radio, and passed via telegraph cable inside messages sent by diplomats of two neutral countries (the United States and Sweden).

Direct telegraph transmission of the telegram was impossible because the British had cut the German international cables at the outbreak of war. However, Germany could communicate wirelessly through the Telefunken plant, operating under Atlantic Communication Company in West Sayville, New York, where the telegram was relayed to the Mexican Consulate. Ironically, the station was under the control of the US Navy, which operated it for Atlantic Communication Company, the American subsidiary of the German entity.

The Swedish diplomatic message holding the Zimmerman telegram went from Stockholm to Buenos Aires over British submarine telegraph cables, and then moved from Buenos Aires to Mexico over the cable network of a United States company.

After the Germans&#x27; telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their diplomatic telegraphic messages for peace messages. President Wilson agreed in the belief both that such co-operation would sustain continued good relations with Germany and that more efficient German–American diplomacy could assist Wilson&#x27;s goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the American embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. The Germans assumed that this route was secure and so used it extensively.

However, that put German diplomats in a precarious situation since they relied on the United States to transmit Zimmermann&#x27;s note to its final destination, but the message&#x27;s unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The United States had placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in cleartext (uncoded). However, Wilson had later reversed the order and relaxed the wireless rules to allow coded messages to be sent. Thus the Germans were able to persuade US Ambassador James W. Gerard to accept Zimmermann&#x27;s note in coded form, and it was transmitted on January 16, 1917.

All traffic passing through British hands came to British intelligence, particularly to the codebreakers and analysts in Room 40 at the Admiralty. In Room 40, Nigel de Grey had partially decoded the telegram by the next day. By 1917, the diplomatic code 13040 had been in use for many years. Since there had been ample time for Room 40 to reconstruct the code cryptanalytically, it was readable to a fair degree. Room 40 had obtained German cryptographic documents, including the diplomatic code 3512 (captured during the Mesopotamian campaign), which was a later updated code that was similar to but not really related to code 13040, and naval code SKM (Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine), ⁠which was useless for decoding the Zimmermann telegram but valuable to decode naval traffic, which had been retrieved from the wrecked cruiser SMS &quot;Magdeburg&quot; by the Russians, who passed it to the British.

Disclosure of the telegram would sway American public opinion against Germany if the British could convince the Americans that the text was genuine, but the Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on United States diplomatic traffic. Hall waited three weeks during which de Grey and cryptographer William Montgomery completed the decryption. On February 1, Germany announced resumption of &quot;unrestricted&quot; submarine warfare, an act that led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on February 3.
Hall passed the telegram to the British Foreign Office on February 5 but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories to explain to the Americans how they obtained the coded text of the telegram and to explain how they obtained the cleartext of the telegram without letting anyone know that the codes had been broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.

For the first story, the British obtained the coded text of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that since the German embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, the Mexican telegraph office would have the coded text. &quot;Mr. H&quot;, a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. Sir Thomas Hohler, the British ambassador in Mexico, later claimed to have been &quot;Mr. H&quot; or at least to have been involved with the interception in his autobiography. The coded text could then be shown to the Americans without embarrassment.

Moreover, the retransmission was encoded with the older code 13040 and so by mid-February, the British had the complete text and the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but that was a risk worth taking against the possibility of United States entry into the war.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 code text would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the American government.

As a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram&#x27;s decoded text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 code so that the American government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records, but the Americans agreed to back the official cover story. The German Foreign Office refused to consider that their codes could have been broken but sent Von Eckardt on a witch hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. Von Eckardt indignantly rejected those accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.

===Use===
On February 19, Hall showed the telegram to Edward Bell, the secretary of the American Embassy in Britain. Bell was at first incredulous and thought that it was a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On February 20, Hall informally sent a copy to US Ambassador Walter Hines Page. On February 23, Page met with British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour and was given the codetext, the message in German, and the English translation. The British had obtained a further copy in Mexico City, and Balfour could obscure the real source with the half-truth that it had been &quot;bought in Mexico&quot;. Page then reported the story to Wilson on February 24, 1917, including details to be verified from telegraph-company files in the United States. Wilson felt &quot;much indignation&quot; toward the Germans and wanted to publish the Zimmermann Telegraph immediately after he had received it from the British, but he delayed until March 1, 1917.

==U.S. response==

Many Americans then held anti-Mexican as well as anti-German views. Mexicans had a considerable amount of anti-American sentiment in return, some of which was caused by the American occupation of Veracruz. General John J. Pershing had long been chasing the revolutionary Pancho Villa for raiding into American territory and carried out several cross-border expeditions. News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.

However, many Americans, particularly those with German or Irish ancestry, wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told falsely that the telegram had been stolen in a decoded form in Mexico, the message was at first widely believed to be an elaborate forgery created by British intelligence. That belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats alongside some antiwar American newspapers, especially those of the Hearst press empire.

On February 1, 1917, Germany had begun unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships. Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly-provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned &quot;ruthless employment of our submarines&quot;. Public opinion demanded action. Wilson had refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships, but once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships although antiwar members of the US Senate blocked his proposal.

The Wilson administration nevertheless remained with a dilemma. Evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British informed Wilson that the message was genuine, but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation. This problem was, however, resolved when any doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Zimmermann himself. At a press conference on March 3, 1917, he told an American journalist, &quot;I cannot deny it. It is true.&quot; Then, on March 29, 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the Reichstag in which he admitted that the telegram was genuine. Zimmermann hoped that Americans would understand that the idea was that Germany would not fund Mexico&#x27;s war with the United States unless the Americans joined World War I. Nevertheless, in his speech Zimmermann questioned how the Washington government obtained the telegram. According to Reuters news service, Zimmermann told the Reichstag, &quot;the instructions...came into its hands in a way which was not unobjectionable.&quot;

On April 6, 1917, Congress voted to declare war on Germany. Wilson had asked Congress for &quot;a war to end all wars&quot; that would &quot;make the world safe for democracy&quot;.

Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and Tampico in 1917–1918, to pacify the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Tampico oil fields and to ensure their continued production during the civil war, but this time, Mexican President Venustiano Carranza, recently installed, threatened to destroy the oil fields if the US Marines landed there.

==Japanese response==
The Japanese government, another nation mentioned in the Zimmerman telegram, was already involved in World War I, on the side of the Allies against Germany. The government later released a statement that Japan was not interested in changing sides or attacking America.

==Autograph discovery==

In October 2005, it was reported that an original typescript of the decoded Zimmermann telegram had recently been discovered by an unnamed historian who was researching and preparing a history of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Government Communications Headquarters. The document is believed to be the actual telegram shown to the American ambassador in London in 1917. Marked in Admiral Hall&#x27;s handwriting at the top of the document are the words: &quot;This is the one handed to Dr Page and exposed by the President.&quot; Since many of the secret documents in this incident had been destroyed, it had previously been assumed that the original typed &quot;decrypt&quot; was gone forever. However, after the discovery of this document, the GCHQ official historian said: &quot;I believe that this is indeed the same document that Balfour handed to Page.&quot;

As of 2006, there were six &quot;closed&quot; files on the Zimmermann telegram which had not been declassified held by The National Archives at Kew (formerly the PRO).

<text>The , also known by its nickname of &quot;Midori no U-Line&quot; (), is one of the two lines of the Kobe Municipal Subway. It links the central districts to the east and western suburbs of Kobe. The line color is green.

== Service pattern ==
The line has a reciprocal through service with the Hokushin Line (formerly the Hokushin Kyukuo Electric Railway); all trains run between either or and , stopping at every station. During rush hours, additional trains run between Shin-Kobe and .

==History==
On 15 October 1971, a railway license was issued to the Kobe Municipal Transportation Bureau to build a subway line linking the Myōdani district to the Shin-Kobe Shinkansen station; construction on the first segment of that line began on 25 November of that year. The first segment of the subway (between Shin-Nagata and Myodani, known as the Seishin Line) opened on 13 March 1977; a second segment of the line (between Shin-Nagata and Okurayama, known as the Yamate Line) opened on 17 February 1982. The line was extended to Shin-Kobe on 18 June 1985; a western extension to Gakuen-toshi (from Myodani) opened that same day. On 18 March 1987, the final segment of the subway line opened between Gakuen-toshi and Seishin-chūō.

The Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway opened on 2 April 1988, providing service between Tanigami and Shin-Kobe. An infill station () opened in between Seishin-chūō and Ikawadani stations on 20 March 1993, expanding the line to a total of 16 stations. On 17 January 1995, the subway line was shut down due to damage caused by the Great Hanshin earthquake; the line resumed operation with limited service between Seishin-chūō and Itayado the following day, along with the entirety of the Hokushin Kyuko line. Limited service was resumed across the entire line on 16 February, and full service was restored in March 1995 after repairs were completed, albeit with speed restrictions remaining in place until 21 July of that year.

The subway began to accept the Surotto Kansai smart card in October 1999; it would start accepting PiTaPa in October 2006.

Women-only cars began to be used on the subway line from 16 December 2002. Currently, one car heading in the direction of Seishin-chūō (car number 4) is reserved for women only; the restriction applies throughout the entire day.
==Stations==
== Rolling stock ==

* 1000 series (since 1977) (18 sets)
* 2000 series (1988–2022) (4 sets)
* 3000 series (1992–2021) (6 sets)
* 6000 series (since 2019) (25 sets)
* Hokushin Kyuko Railway 7000 series (since 1988) (5 sets)

All trains are based at Tanigami and Myōdani Depots.

A fleet of new trains (known as the 6000 series) is to be introduced on the line between fiscal 2018 and 2022; these trains will replace all existing trains on the line. Built by Kawasaki, the design of the new trains will be overseen by Ken Okuyama Design.

The last of the 2000 series sets were retired in March 2021.

<doc id="228282" wikidata="Q385484" url="?curid=228282" title="Brachioradialis">
<text>The brachioradialis is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus.

==Structure==
The brachioradialis is a superficial, fusiform muscle on the lateral side of the forearm. It originates proximally on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. It inserts distally on the radius, at the base of its styloid process. Near the elbow, it forms the lateral limit of the cubital fossa, or elbow pit.

===Nerve supply===
Despite the bulk of the muscle body being visible from the anterior aspect of the forearm, the brachioradialis is a posterior compartment muscle and consequently is innervated by the radial nerve. Of the muscles that receive innervation from the radial nerve, it is one of only four that receive input directly from the radial nerve. The other three are the triceps, anconeus, and extensor carpi radialis longus. (All other posterior compartment muscles that receive radial innervation are supplied by the deep branch of the radial nerve.)

==Function==
The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes. This also assists the biceps brachii.

The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the forearm is in a midposition between supination and pronation at the radioulnar joint. When pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.

With the insertion of the muscle so far from the fulcrum of the elbow, the brachioradialis does not generate as much joint torque as the brachialis or the biceps. It is effective mainly when those muscles have already partially flexed at the elbow. The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow, especially when quick movement is required and when a weight is lifted during slow flexion of the forearm.

The muscle is used to stabilize the elbow during rapid flexion and extension while in a midposition, such as in hammering. The brachioradialis is synergistic with the brachialis and biceps brachii; the triceps brachii and anconeus are antagonistic.

<text>Kōbe Rapid Transit Railway Company, Limited (神戸高速鉄道株式会社 &quot;Kōbe kōsoku-tetsudō&quot;) is a railway infrastructure company in central Kobe, Japan.

== Lines ==
Kobe Rapid Railway owns two lines.
*Tozai Line (east-west)
*Namboku Line (north-south)

The Tozai and Namboku lines have been operated since the founding of the railway company while the Hokushin Line is a recent addition to its business. The company is a under the 1986 Railway Business Act of Japan in respect to all three lines. 

=== Tozai Line and Namboku Line ===
The company does not run its own services on these lines, but provides the necessary infrastructure for four private railway lines (Hankyu Kobe Line (Hankyu), Hanshin Main Line (Hanshin), Shintetsu Arima Line (Shintetsu) and Sanyo Electric Railway Main Line (Sanyo) to be able to run trains through Kobe.

The company operated and administered the stations on the Tozai Line and the Namboku Line (except for Sannomiya Station operated by Hankyu, Motomachi Station operated by Hanshin, Nishidai Station operated by Sanyo and Minatogawa Station operated by Shintetsu) until September 2010, when the operation of the stations on the Tozai Line were transferred to Hanshin and Hankyu, and Shinkaichi Station on the Namboku Line to Shintetsu.

=== Hokushin Line ===
The Hokushin Line was formerly owned by the operator Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway. When Hokushin Kyuko suffered financial difficulties in 2002, Kobe Rapid Railway purchased the assets of the railway trackage from Hokushin Kyuko.

Unlike the Tozai Line and the Namboku Line stations, the stations of the Hokushin Line are operated and administrated by Hokushin Kyuko (Tanigami Station) and Kobe Municipal Subway (Shin-Kobe Station). On 1 June 2020, the operation of the line was transferred to Kobe Municipal Subway.

<text>The radial nerve is a nerve in the human body that supplies the posterior portion of the upper limb. It innervates the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii muscle of the arm, as well as all 12 muscles in the posterior osteofascial compartment of the forearm and the associated joints and overlying skin.

It originates from the brachial plexus, carrying fibers from the posterior roots of spinal nerves C5, C6, C7, C8 and T1.

The radial nerve and its branches provide motor innervation to the dorsal arm muscles (the triceps brachii and the anconeus) and the extrinsic extensors of the wrists and hands; it also provides cutaneous sensory innervation to most of the back of the hand, except for the back of the little finger and adjacent half of the ring finger (which are innervated by the ulnar nerve).

The radial nerve divides into a deep branch, which becomes the posterior interosseous nerve, and a superficial branch, which goes on to innervate the dorsum (back) of the hand.

This nerve was historically referred to as the musculospiral nerve.

==Structure==

The radial nerve originates as a terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It goes through the arm, first in the posterior compartment of the arm, and later in the anterior compartment of the arm, and continues in the posterior compartment of the forearm.

===Arm===
The radial nerve originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus with root values of C5 to C8 and T1. From the brachial plexus, it travels behind the third part of the axillary artery (part of the axillary artery distal to the pectoralis minor). In the arm, it runs behind the brachial artery and then enters the lower triangular space to reach the radial sulcus on the back of the humerus. It travels downwards together with profunda brachii artery, between the lateral and medial heads of triceps brachii until it reaches the lateral side the arm at 5 cm below the deltoid tuberosity where it pierces the lateral intermuscular septum to reach the anterior compartment of the arm. Then, it descends down to cross the lateral epicondyle of the humerus where the nerve terminates by branching itself into superficial and deep branch which continues into cubital fossa and then into the forearm.

The radial nerve gives out muscular branches to supply the long head, medial head, and lateral head of triceps brachii muscles before and during its course in the radial sulcus. After it emerges out from the radial sulcus, it supplies the brachialis, brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus.

Above the radial sulcus, the radial nerve gives off posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm which supplies the skin at the back of the arm. In the radial sulcus, it gives off lower lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm and posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The radial nerve also gives articular branches to supply the elbow joint.

===Forearm and hand===
In the forearm, it is divided into a superficial branch (primarily sensory) and a deep branch (primarily motor).
* The superficial branch of the radial nerve is widely separated from the radial artery in the upper one third of the forearm, closely related to radial artery in the middle third of the forearm, and in the lower third, it descends in the forearm under the tendon of brachioradialis. It crosses brachioradialis to enter posterior of forearm near the back of the wrist and supply dorsum of hand. It gives sensory supply to dorsal aspect of hand, dorsal aspect of thumb, index finger, middle finger and lateral side of ring finger except the nail beds, which are supplied by proper digital branches of median nerve.
* The deep branch of the radial nerve (also known as posterior interosseous nerve by some authors)) pierces the supinator muscle, winds around the radius under the cover of supinator to reach posterior of forearm where it again pierces supinator and after which it is known as the posterior interosseous nerve. It pierces the posterior extensor muscles and comes to lie between superficial and deep muscles of the back of the forearm. At the lower border of extensor pollicis brevis, it passes deep to the extensor pollicis longus and then run on the posterior interosseous membrane. It continues to move along with posterior interosseous artery (a deep branch of common interosseous artery which is a branch of ulnar artery), and ends as a pseudoganglion below extensor retinaculum by supplying the wrist and intercarpal joints.

===Variation===
It is commonly believed that the radial nerve provides motor innervation to the long head of the triceps. However, a study conducted in 2004 found that axillary nerve innervated the long head of the triceps in twenty cadavers without any supply from the radial nerve.

==Function==
The following are branches of the radial nerve (including the superficial branch of the radial nerve and the deep branch of the radial nerve/posterior interosseous nerve).

===Cutaneous===

Cutaneous innervation by the radial nerve is provided by the following nerve branches:
*Posterior cutaneous nerve of arm (originates in axilla)
*Inferior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm (originates in arm)
*Posterior cutaneous nerve of forearm (originates in arm)

The superficial branch of the radial nerve provides sensory innervation to much of the back of the hand, including the web of skin between the thumb and index finger.

===Motor===

Muscular branches of the radial nerve:
*Triceps brachii 
*Anconeus
*Brachioradialis
*Extensor carpi radialis longus

Deep branch of the radial nerve:
*Extensor carpi radialis brevis
*Supinator

Posterior interosseous nerve (a continuation of the deep branch after the supinator):
*Extensor digitorum
*Extensor digiti minimi
*Extensor carpi ulnaris
*Abductor pollicis longus
*Extensor pollicis brevis
*Extensor pollicis longus
*Extensor indicis

The radial nerve (and its deep branch) provides motor innervation to the muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm, which are mostly extensors.

==Clinical significance==
=== Injury ===
Injury to the radial nerve at different levels causes different syndromes with varying motor and sensory deficits.

At the axilla
* Common mechanisms of injury: Saturday night palsy, crutch palsy, lesions
* Motor deficit:
** Loss of extension of forearm, weakness of supination, and loss of extension of hand and fingers.
** Presence of wrist drop, due to inability to extend the hand and fingers.
* Sensory deficit: Loss of sensation in lateral arm, posterior forearm, the radial half of dorsum of hand, and dorsal aspect of radial digits, excluding their nail beds.

At mid-arm
* Common mechanism of injury: Mid-shaft humeral fracture
* Motor deficit:
** Weakness of supination, and loss of extension of hand and fingers.
** Presence of wrist drop, due to inability to extend the hand and fingers.
* Sensory deficit: Loss of sensation in posterior forearm, the radial half of dorsum of hand, and dorsal aspect of radial digits, excluding their nail beds.

Just below the elbow
* Common mechanism of injury: Neck of radius fracture, elbow dislocation or fracture, tight cast, rheumatoid nodules, injections due to tennis elbow, injuring the deep branch of the radial nerve that pierces the radial head, causing posterior interosseous nerve syndrome
* Motor deficit:
** Weakness in extension of hand and loss of extension of fingers.
** Presence of finger drop, and partial wrist drop, since the extensor carpi radialis longus and brachioradialis muscles are working.
* Sensory deficit: None, as sensation is supplied by the superficial radial nerve

Within the distal forearm:
* Common mechanism of injury: Wartenberg&#x27;s syndrome, (not to be confused with Wartenberg&#x27;s sign), due to nerve entrapment beneath the tendinous insertion of brachioradialis, tight jewellery, and watch bands.
* Motor deficit: None
* Sensory deficit: Numbness and tingling in radial half of dorsum of hand, and dorsal aspect of radial digits, excluding their nail beds.
* In Wartenberg&#x27;s syndrome, there is significant radial wrist pain, and close resemblance to symptoms in de Quervain&#x27;s tenosynovitis. Finkelstein&#x27;s test may be positive.

<doc id="228288" wikidata="Q7131100" url="?curid=228288" title="Panic of 1819">
<text>The Panic of 1819 was the first widespread and durable financial crisis in the United States that slowed westward expansion in the Cotton Belt and was followed by a general collapse of the American economy that persisted through 1821. The Panic heralded the transition of the nation from its colonial commercial status with Europe toward an independent economy.

Though the downturn was driven by global market adjustments in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, its severity was compounded by excessive speculation in public lands, fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns.

The Second Bank of the United States (SBUS), itself deeply enmeshed in these inflationary practices, sought to compensate for its laxness in regulating the state bank credit market by initiating a sharp curtailment in loans by its western branches, beginning in 1818. Failing to provide gold specie from their reserves when presented with their own banknotes for redemption by the SBUS, the state-chartered banks began foreclosing on the heavily mortgaged farms and business properties they had financed. The ensuing financial panic, in conjunction with a sudden recovery in European agricultural production in 1817, led to widespread bankruptcies and mass unemployment. The financial disaster and recession provoked popular resentment against banking and business enterprise, along with a general belief that federal government economic policy was fundamentally flawed. Americans, many for the first time, became politically engaged so as to defend their local economic interests.

The New Republicans and their American System—tariff protection, internal improvements, and the SBUS—were exposed to sharp criticism, eliciting a vigorous defense.

==Post-war European readjustments and the American economy: 1815–1818==
The United States and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814, ending the War of 1812. The British government effectively relinquished its effort to impose mercantilist policies on the United States, preparing the way for the development of free trade and the opening of America&#x27;s vast western frontier.
Europe was undergoing a period of disorganization as it readjusted to peacetime production and commerce in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. The general effect was a decline in prices throughout the Western world, due to a scarcity of gold and silver specie. Britain had advanced its industrial capacity to fully meet its wartime demands, but post-war continental Europe was temporarily too devastated to absorb Britain&#x27;s surplus manufactured goods. Moreover, European agriculture production, exhausted by years of warfare, was unable to feed its own population. The economy of the United States was not immune to the chaos that afflicted Europe, which contributed to the Panic of 1819.

American manufacturers faced U.S. markets swamped with British products, produced by low-paid workers and priced well below competitive rates and forcing many factories out of business. Continental Europe, its agrarian output crippled by the recent war, offered new markets for American staple crops, particularly cotton, wheat, corn and tobacco. As prices soared for agricultural goods, a speculative agrarian land boom ensued in the South and West United States, encouraged by liberal terms for government public land sales. &quot;The entire postwar American economy&quot;, observed historian George Dangerfield, was &quot;based on a land boom&quot;. The inflationary bubble grew from 1815 to 1818, obscuring the general deflationary trends in world prices.

==Unregulated banking and the imperatives of Republican enterprise==
With the failure to recharter the First Bank of the United States in 1811, regulatory influence over state banks ceased. Credit-friendly Republicans—entrepreneurs, bankers, farmers—adapted laissez-faire financial principles to the precepts of Jeffersonian political libertarianism—equating land speculation with &quot;rugged individualism&quot; and the frontier spirit. Private banking interests and their allies sought to evade or resist any threat to the profitability of their local enterprises, including the regulatory influence of a government bank limiting easy credit. There followed an enormous expansion in state-chartered banking, with chartered institutions increasing from 88 in 1811 to 208 in 1815, mostly in the mid-Atlantic states.

During the War of 1812 (1812–1815) with the United Kingdom, the American government turned to these new banks for loans, encouraging a proliferation of paper money. This practice tended to shift specie into the more conservatively lending New England banking apparatus, depleting the newer banks of their hard money reserves. In response, the U.S. government acquiesced in a suspension of specie payments from state banks in order to prolong the liberal wartime lending. The arrangement persisted in the war&#x27;s aftermath, allowing old and new banks to profitably lend without regard to their hard money currency reserves. A speculative bubble formed as a result of these inflationary practices, threatening the health of the economy.

By 1814, calls for a new central bank and a resumption of regulatory controls were heard from powerful capitalists and economic nationalists in the Republican party leadership.

==Resurrection of the Bank of the United States==

===The &quot;American System&quot;===

The Democratic-Republican party found itself in control of the national government with the collapse of the Federalist party at the end of the War of 1812. Some of the traditional Jeffersonian agrarian precepts—especially strict construction of the Constitution—had softened due to difficulties during the war arising from a lack of infrastructure, unregulated banking and a shortage of manufactured material, as well as the prospect of developing the vast natural resources with westward expansion. A mild nationalist outlook took hold among the &quot;New Republicans&quot;, neofederalists led by Speaker of the House Henry Clay and Congressman John C. Calhoun. A three-part program dubbed the American System, incorporating some of the Hamiltonian projects championed by the Federalists, proposed &quot;to create a stable economy through a centralized banking system, stimulated by an ever widening web of transportation and communication, through which domestic manufactures could eventually reach all parts of the Union&quot;.

Advocates of the American System called for a protective tariff to encourage manufacturing, a federally funded program for internal improvements and a revival of the First Bank of the United States to regulate finance.

===Astor, Girard, Parish===

In the crucible of the War of 1812, the Treasury of the United States had been compelled to offer $16 million in government war bonds in order to stave off bankruptcy due to military costs and wartime loss of revenue.
Financier Stephen Girard, business magnate John Jacob Astor and merchant David Parish bought up these government securities and rescued the nation&#x27;s credit. Through their influence, and in alliance with Republican Congressmen John C. Calhoun and Henry Clay, they sought to augment their investment by proposing that the securities be exchangeable for stock in a new central bank, the Second Bank of the United States (SBUS).

Secretary of State James Monroe supported the new bank initiative, wishing to bind these highly regarded and pro-Republican business figures to government financial operations. Republicans in the South and West joined with monied interests in the mid-Atlantic states. Pro-SBUS Congressman John C. Calhoun argued forcefully that the federal government had a constitutional obligation to regulate bank credit as part of the national money supply. In January 1816, he introduced a bill of incorporation in the House of Representatives for a government bank (which would become the Second Bank of the United States). The measure was passed by Congress and signed by President James Madison in April 1816.

Opposition to the Bank came from two fronts: the orthodox Tertium quids (or &quot;Old Republicans&quot;) who reflexively regarded an enlargement of the central government as an assault on personal liberty and a violation of Jeffersonian agrarianism, and state-chartered private banking interests, who favored paper money but considered federal regulation of local banking operations to be anti-Republican. These ideologies and interests would be arrayed against the central bank during the Andrew Jackson administration (1829–1837), erupting in a Bank War that would destroy the institution by 1833.

The Second Bank of the United States began operations in January 1817 under a twenty-year charter.

===Neofederalist expectations for the central bank===
The revival of the Bank of the United States had two primary objectives: first, to reverse the post-war inflationary practices of state-chartered banks by inducing resumption of convertibility, and second, to expand the opportunities for the common man to acquire bank credit, promoting enterprise and an orderly and profitable westward expansion.
The regulatory mechanism of the SBUS resided in its fiscal duties as depository for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As such, the bank accepted circulating state bank paper money from individuals, businesses and importers when they paid taxes or custom duty fees. The central bank immediately credited these payments to the U.S. Treasury with its own metallic reserves. The SBUS, in turn, anticipated that the state banks which had issued the paper money would, upon demand, redeem their currency with gold and silver—&quot;convertibility&quot;—reimbursing the government bank.
In order to remain solvent, the state banks would, ideally, constrain their lending of paper money—however profitable—so as not to allow the SBUS to become a significant creditor and deplete their specie reserves. Failing this, the Second Bank of the United States would, in theory, cease to honor the banknotes of those financial institutions that refused to promptly settle their government accounts with hard money—a recipe for bankruptcy.

The central bank&#x27;s direct influence on inflationary lending was limited to those chartered banks whose paper currency was extensively used to remit funds to the government (i.e. tax and duty payments).
The SBUS and its branches had little or no direct control over commercial paper emitted by unchartered lending outfits: &quot;All that was necessary to start a bank…was plates, presses and paper; &#x27;a church, a tavern, a blacksmith shop&#x27; would be a suitable site.&quot; These unregulated credit operations would &quot;to some extent interpenetrate&quot; the regulated banking system, especially in the regions of wildcat banking.

==Prelude to panic: 1816–1818==

President of the United States James Madison and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Dallas fully approved the elevation of William Jones—one of the federally appointed Bank directors—to SBUS President in October 1816. Jones, formerly a member of Madison&#x27;s cabinet, owed his promotion more to his political acumen than his skills as a banker. Financier and co-director Stephen Girard was troubled at Jones&#x27; promotion, concerned that he could never provide disinterested leadership for the bank, and businessman John Jacob Astor doubted Jones&#x27; ability to wield the bank&#x27;s regulatory powers effectively.

Jones extended the institution&#x27;s resources liberally in accordance with the post-war &quot;national exuberance&quot;, generating large dividends for its stockholders. His administration of the bank resonated with Secretary Crawford&#x27;s lenient policy with regard to public land receipts in the form of chartered-bank script when specie was scarce nationally.

===Setbacks and compromises for the Second Bank of the United States===

The Second Bank of the United States began operations in January 1817 as fiscal agent of the United States Treasury. After February 20, 1817, the SBUS was scheduled to begin to receive all government revenue in legal tender as required by its charter.

Hard money shortages prevailed because U.S. imports exceeded exports and Peruvian and Mexican gold and silver sources failed to replenish specie reserves. Due to this scarcity, the terms of the bank&#x27;s incorporation provided for private subscribers to invest with a combination of metallic currency and government stock. Further, they were granted an indulgence by Bank directors that effectively waived the specie requirement: ultimately, investors were allowed to purchase Bank shares on the security of the stock itself. Under its charter guidelines, the SBUS was expected to acquire specie totaling $28 million by the time it opened for business; but with only $2 million secured when it commenced operations, the bank was compelled to purchase specie at usurious rates from the London financial markets in 1817 and 1818, overburdening SBUS credit.

As the February 20 deadline approached to resume convertibility, the private (i.e. state-chartered) banks withheld cooperation from SBUS officials, loath to submit to the regulatory influence of the central bank—and diminish the large profits derived from the issue of unredeemable paper. On February 1, 1817, an association of bankers from Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and Virginia met with the new Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford and SBUS President William Jones, arranging a compromise which undermined the ability of the central bank to assert its role as creditor to the private banks.

The directors of the SBUS, with Secretary Crawford&#x27;s imprimatur, promised to refrain from collecting public deposits held in state banks until July 1, 1817. Moreover, they agreed to greatly expand the bank&#x27;s credit—at a discount of $6 million—before proceeding to collect public debt from the state institutions. In effect, the central bank transformed the private banks into its creditors, inviting them to draw specie from SBUS reserves months before the Bank of the United States assumed its regulatory functions. Under these &quot;ominous terms&quot; the bank was launched—its operational success already at risk.

===Second Bank of the United States branch office lending and the frontier land boom===

The eighteen branch offices of the SBUS in 1817 operated with little oversight from the Philadelphia headquarters, nor from the U.S. Treasury. This policy stemmed in part from a social philosophy that prevailed among Republicans during the Era of Good Feelings, which wished to Republicanize credit practices and encourage westward migration.

The United States government encouraged settlement of these lands by offering public land at $2 per acre (160-acre minimum), though auctioneering tended to retard sales and raised prices slightly. The terms required a down payment of one-fourth of the total cost and the balance in four annual payments. Failure to pay in full in five years meant forfeiture. Public land debt ballooned from $3 million in 1815 to $17 million in 1818.

The U.S. Treasury accepted land payments in the form of banknotes issued by western and southern state banks. These institutions often lacked sufficient specie reserves to back up their vastly over-extended credit. As long as the land boom continued, the Treasury Department was compelled to accept depreciated banknotes for its public land sales, undermining government efforts to pay down the war debt, but serving to stave off private bank failures.

As the branch offices in the West and Southwest over-issued their SBUS notes to land boom farmers and speculators, they sought to restock their specie reserves by redeeming their own notes for hard money at the SBUS branch offices in the North and East, to fuel another cycle of excessive lending.

The SBUS branch banks, emulating their wildcat counterparts, injected so much of their own paper money into circulation that they negated their regulatory capacity: they could not with impunity demand specie payments from state banks that held public deposits without being presented with their own script for convertibility in return.
Prior to the Panic, these precarious economic conditions—a manifestation of &quot;rapid expansion, speculation and wildcat banking&quot;—prevailed in the South and West, where the economic collapse would be most severe.
By July 1818, the Second Bank of the United States had demand liabilities exceeding $22.4 million, whereas its specie fund stood at $2.4 million—a 10:1 ratio and double the 5:1 ratio considered sustainable.

==Panic &quot;precipitated&quot;==

The onset of the financial panic has been variously described as &quot;triggered&quot;, &quot;pricked&quot;, or &quot;precipitated&quot; by the Second Bank of the United States when it initiated a sharp credit contraction beginning in the summer of 1818.

The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 had created the Year Without a Summer, causing European agriculture to fail that year. The link between the frontier land boom and overseas markets for staple goods was dramatically revealed in 1817, when Europe finally recovered from its post-war harvest shortages and began producing bumper crops. American planters and farmers, who had expanded production to exploit the European demand, discovered agricultural prices declining by half, even as production increased. Southwestern plantations were devastated when Britain began to increase its imports of East India cotton as a means to avoid purchasing the high-priced U.S. cotton. India enjoyed not only a longer growing season and lower cost of freight to Britain, but also more cotton-devoted land than the entire Louisiana Purchase. Tench Coxe, a Pennsylvanian political economist and delegate to the Continental Congress, warned of the &quot;substantial evil&quot; exhibited in the rivalry created by foreign competition. Coxe has been dubbed by many as the &quot;father of the American cotton industry&quot;. Cotton value began to waver in 1818, threatening to burst the speculative bubble. A general contraction in lending was indicated in response to these developments in Europe.

In August 1818, with credit dangerously overextended, BUS branch offices began to reject all state-chartered banknotes under the direction of William Jones. Exceptions were made for notes used as revenue payments to the U.S. Treasury. In October 1818, the U.S. Treasury demanded a transfer of $2 million in specie from the BUS to redeem bonds on the Louisiana Purchase.
State banks in the West and South, unable to provide the required specie, began to call in their loans on the heavily mortgaged lands they had financed. Cash-poor farmers and speculators found their land values dropping 50% to 75%. Banks began foreclosing on the properties and transferring them to their creditor: the Second Bank of the United States.

When news arrived in January 1819 that the value of cotton had broken—dropping 25% in a single day—the ensuing panic drove the country into recession. Williams Jones resigned from his position as BUS president and was replaced by South Carolinian Langdon Cheves.

===BUS reaction to the Panic===

The limited curtailment policy initiated by William Jones was rigorously applied by his successor, former Congressman from South Carolina, Langdon Cheves. Among his promoters were U.S. President James Monroe, BUS directors Stephen Girard and Nicholas Biddle and those stockholders who wanted Bank leadership that was fiscally conservative and immune to political influence.

The tight money policy Cheves implemented—a principled effort to cope with the financial disaster—had the effect of deepening the depression, undermining the recovery that was already underway. Through public land debt relief legislation, Cheves managed to reduce the bank&#x27;s land debt by $6 million within a year of assuming his position as BUS President. Specie was also replenished to a great extent, increasing from $2.5 million in 1819 to $3.4 million by 1820 and further rising to $8 million by 1821. As an added consequence, banknotes in circulation were reduced by about $23 million within a span of four years from 1816 to 1820.

Employing these &quot;stern procedures&quot;, Cheves placed the bank on sound footing in early 1819. A leading critic of the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War would observe: &quot;The bank was saved, and the people were ruined.&quot;

===Culpability of the BUS in the Panic===

Despite the Second Bank of the United States&#x27; inept management under the Jones-Cheves administrations, it was not the causative agent in the Panic of 1819 or its aftermath. The historical processes contributing to the panic and depression, which were beyond the bank&#x27;s control, included the European market fluctuations, obstruction from the numerous private banks to federal regulations and the widespread ignorance among lenders and borrowers as to the new financial mechanisms that made possible the credit expansion and land boom.

The bank&#x27;s role was properly one of restraint, so as to automatically suppress the volatility in financial markets—but not to prevent these boom-bust episodes. &quot;If the [Second Bank of the United States] had been wisely managed from the beginning&quot; writes historian George Dangerfield, &quot;it could not have prevented the panic; it could only have modified its effects.&quot;

==Responses to the crisis==

President Monroe, interpreting the economic crisis in the narrow monetary terms then current, limited governmental action to economizing and ensuring fiscal stability. He acquiesced in suspending specie payments to bank depositors, setting a precedent for the Panics of 1837 and 1857. Although Monroe agreed that improved transportation facilities were needed, he refused to approve appropriations for internal improvements without constitutional amendments.

In 1821, Congress passed the Relief for Public Land Debtors Act. The bill allowed debtors who owed money on land purchased from the government to keep the part of land they had already paid for and relinquish the remaining amount. It further extended the schedule of payments by several years, with a discount for quick payment. With the exception of New England states, most of the country strongly supported the measure. Many state legislatures, particularly in rural western states, passed extra relief measures for debtors.

Another response to the panic was monetary expansion, primarily at the state level. In Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois, state banks suspended specie payments and issued large amounts of inconvertible notes. However, most other states avoided inflationist policies and enforced the payment of specie. Every state witnessed vigorous debate on the merits of each policy. Treasury Secretary Crawford advocated restricting bank credit as a measure to prevent a future crisis. Banking regulation was seen as primarily a state responsibility, and several states passed regulations in the years following the panic that required banks to maintain certain fixed ratios of capital to ensure their ability to convert to specie.

A further effect of the Panic of 1819 was increased support for protective tariffs for American industry. Vocal protectionists, such as Philadelphia printer Mathew Carey, blamed free trade for the depression and argued that tariffs would protect American prosperity. In general, support for tariffs was strongest in the mid-Atlantic states and was opposed by export-heavy southern states.

==Long-term impacts==

The Panic brought attention, for the first time, to issues regarding debt-relief policy, as well as poor relief. City and state governments began to more effectively approach the public policy reform issues surrounding the poor; a classification system was also created (able-bodied vs. disabled, temporary vs. long-term, etc.). Public attention to solving poverty issues consequently led to public education systems.

Public support was great once again for protective tariffs. However, when the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; was implemented in 1828, regional discontent led to the outbreak of the Nullification Crisis. The Crisis is seen as a &quot;critical precedent for democratic action&quot;.

On a more contemporary note, many economic historians today agree that the Panic of 1819 marked the United States&#x27; entrance into the modern business cycle.

The Panic of 1819 has also been credited with spurring American citizens to emigrate to the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, which would later become the Republic of Texas, and later still the State of Texas within the United States. By 1830, over twelve thousand Americans had emigrated to what is now the State of Texas.

==Economic interpretations==

Different economic schools of thought have offered explanations for the Panic of 1819.

Austrian School economists view the nationwide recession resulting from the Panic of 1819 as the first failure of expansionary monetary policy. This theory was first expounded by Murray N. Rothbard, in his doctoral dissertation, The Panic of 1819, published in 1962. For many years, this was the only book on the subject. This explanation was based on the Austrian theory of the business cycle. The U.S. Government borrowed heavily to finance the War of 1812, causing tremendous strain on the banks&#x27; reserves of specie, which led to a suspension of specie payments in 1814, and then again during the recession of 1819–1821, violating contractual rights of depositors. The suspension of the obligation to redeem greatly spurred the establishment of new banks and the expansion of banknote issues, and this inflation of money encouraged unsustainable investments to take place. It soon became clear that the monetary situation was threatening, and the Second Bank of the United States was forced to call a halt to its expansion and launch a painful process of contraction. There was a wave of bankruptcies, bank failures, and bank runs; prices dropped and wide-scale urban unemployment began. By 1819, land measures in the U.S. had also reached and many Americans did not have enough money to pay off their loans.

Economists who adhere to Keynesian economic theory suggest that the Panic of 1819 was the early Republic&#x27;s first experience with the boom-bust cycles common to all modern economies. Clyde Haulman, Professor of Economics at the College of William and Mary, argues that the Panic was partly caused by a decision to call in loans of the Second Bank of the US. Combined with the issue of the depression and overspeculation, the Panic marked the beginning of a new phase of American economic history, in which mature market institutions would continue to move cyclically from boom to bust.

<text>Richard Dawson (born Colin Lionel Emm; 20 November 1932 – 2 June 2012) was an English-American actor, comedian, game-show host, and panelist in the United States. Dawson was well known for playing Corporal Peter Newkirk in &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, as a regular panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; (1973–1978), and as the original host of &quot;Family Feud&quot; (1976–1985, 1994–95).

==Early life==
Colin Lionel Emm was born in Gosport, Hampshire, England, on 20 November 1932 to Arthur Emm (born 1897) and Josephine Lucy Emm ( Lindsay; born 1903). His father drove a removal van and his mother worked in a munitions factory. Colin and his older brother John Leslie Emm were evacuated as children during World War II to escape the bombing of England&#x27;s major port cities in the south. In a radio interview with &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; co-star Bob Crane, Emm (by this point, known by his changed name) recounted how this experience severely limited his school attendance, stating that he attended school regularly for only two years.

At age 14, Emm ran away from home to join the British Merchant Navy, where he pursued a career in boxing, earning almost $5,000 in shipboard matches. During 1950 and 1951, Emm made several passages on the RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; from Southampton to ports of call, including Nassau, the Bahamas, Havana, and New York City. Following his discharge from the merchant service, Emm began pursuing a comedy career using the stage name Dickie Dawson; he later changed his alias to Richard Dawson, which he eventually adopted as his legal name.

==Career==
===Comedy and variety artist in the UK===
Dawson began his career in England as a stand-up comedian known as Dickie Dawson. Possibly his first television appearance occurred on 21 June 1954, when he was 21, and was featured on the &quot;Benny Hill Showcase&quot;, an early BBC Television programme focused on &quot;introducing artists and acts new to television&quot;.

Dawson also had at least four BBC Radio programme appearances during 1954, including two bookings on the &quot;Midday Music Hall&quot; on BBC Home Service and two spots on &quot;How Do You Do&quot;, a BBC Light Entertainment broadcast billed as &quot;a friendly get-together of Commonwealth artists.&quot;

In 1958, Dawson appeared alongside his future wife, Diana Dors, on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;A to Z: D&quot;, a programme featuring entertainers with names beginning with the letter D. In 1959, he made four appearances on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, three of them alongside Dors, to whom he was by then married.

===Actor and comedian in the US ===
After his move to the USA, in September 1961, Dawson began hosting a late-night talk show, the &quot;Mike Stokey Show&quot;, on Los Angeles television station KCOP-TV. On 8 January 1963, Dawson appeared on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, season 13, episode 15, as an audience member seated next to Jack, barely recognisable in glasses and false moustache. That same year, Dawson made a guest appearance on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (season two, episode 27) playing &quot;Racy&quot; Tracy Rattigan, a lecherous flirt who was the summer replacement host on the Alan Brady Show. He was credited as Dick Dawson.

In 1965, Dawson had a small role at the end of the film &quot;King Rat&quot;, starring George Segal, playing 1st Recon paratrooper Captain Weaver, sent to liberate allied POWs in a Japanese prison. Dawson had by then moved to Los Angeles. He gained fame in the television show &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; as Cpl. Peter Newkirk from 1965 to 1971. Dawson had a minor role in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Munster, Go Home!&quot;. A year later, he released a psychedelic 45-rpm single including the songs &quot;His Children&#x27;s Parade&quot; and &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot; on Carnation Records. In 1968, Dawson was in the film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; as Private Hugh McDonald.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, Dawson was a regular joke-telling panellist on the short-lived syndicated revival of the game show &quot;Can You Top This?&quot; in 1970 and joined the cast of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; that same year.

After &quot;Laugh-In&quot; was cancelled in 1973, game-show pioneer Mark Goodson signed Dawson to appear as a regular on &quot;Match Game &#x27;73&quot;, alongside Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, and host Gene Rayburn. Dawson, who had already served a year as panellist for Goodson&#x27;s revival of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, proved to be a solid and funny player, and was the frequent choice of contestants to participate in the Head-To-Head Match portion of the &quot;Super-Match&quot; bonus round, in which the contestant and a panellist of the contestant&#x27;s choice had to match exactly. During Dawson&#x27;s time on &quot;Match Game&quot;, he most often occupied the bottom centre seat, only sitting elsewhere (in the top centre seat) during one week early in the show&#x27;s run.

===&quot;Family Feud&quot; host and TV stardom===
Due to his popularity on &quot;Match Game&quot;, Dawson expressed to Goodson his desire to host a show of his own. In 1975, during Dawson&#x27;s tenure as one of &quot;Match Game&quot; regular panelists, Goodson began developing a spin-off game show, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, based on the &quot;Super Match&quot; portion of &quot;Match Game&quot;. Goodson specifically saw the show as a vehicle for Dawson, due to his popularity among &quot;Match Game&quot; contestants. &quot;Family Feud&quot; debuted on 12 July 1976, on ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule. &quot;Family Feud&quot; was a break-out hit, eventually surpassing the ratings of &quot;Match Game&quot; in late 1977. In 1978, Dawson left &quot;Match Game&quot; due to a combination of the recent introduction of the &quot;Star Wheel&quot;—which affected his being selected for the Head-To-Head Match portion of the show&#x27;s &quot;Super Match&quot; bonus round—and burnout from his regular appearances on both &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot;. That same year, Dawson won a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Game Show Host for his work on &quot;Family Feud&quot;. After Dawson left &quot;Match Game&quot;, his spot on the panel was filled with many other stars—most notably his best friend Bob Barker, who was then the host of &quot;The Price is Right&quot;.

One of Dawson&#x27;s trademarks on &quot;Family Feud&quot;, kissing the female contestants, earned him the nickname &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot;. Television executives repeatedly tried to get him to stop the kissing. After receiving criticism for the practice (which also included a great deal of physical contact such as holding hands and touching), Dawson asked viewers to write in and vote on the matter. The wide majority of the roughly 200,000 responses favoured the kissing. On the 1985 finale, Dawson explained that he kissed female contestants for love and luck, something his mother did with Dawson himself as a child.

Dawson was a frequent guest host for &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson, hosting 14 times during 1979. Dawson was a contender for the role of &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host in the event that Carson left the show, a move that Carson was seriously considering during 1979–80. (Carson ended up remaining as host until 1992.) Two of the few Carson-era &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episodes that did not air on the night they were intended were guest hosted by Dawson. During one, actress Della Reese suffered a near-fatal aneurysm midinterview during taping; the remainder of the episode was cancelled. (Reese later recovered.) The other featured an untimely monologue regarding the danger of flying on airplanes; it was replaced with a rerun because it would have aired the same night as the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in Chicago, which killed all 271 people aboard, as well as two on the ground. The episode was aired several weeks later.

===Later years===
Dawson parodied his TV persona in 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Running Man&quot; opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, portraying the evil, egotistical game-show host Damon Killian. He received rave reviews for his performance. Film critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film a thumbs down) wrote, &quot;Playing a character who always seems three-quarters drunk, he chain-smokes his way through backstage planning sessions and then pops up in front of the cameras as a cauldron of false jollity. Working the audience, milking the laughs and the tears, he is not really much different [from] most genuine game-show hosts—and that&#x27;s the film&#x27;s private joke&quot;.

Before Dawson was cast as Damon Killian, Chuck Woolery was originally considered for the role, but was unavailable and Schwarzenegger suggested Dawson because he and Dawson were close friends.

Dawson hosted an unsold pilot for a revival of the classic game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; that was to air on NBC in 1988, but the network declined to pick up the show. In 1990, he auditioned to host the syndicated game show &quot;Trump Card&quot;; the role went to Jimmy Cefalo.

On 12 September 1994, Dawson returned to &quot;Family Feud&quot;, hosting what became the last season of the show&#x27;s second run (1988–1995) after previous host Ray Combs was fired due to spiralling ratings. During his second tenure as host, Dawson did not kiss female contestants because of a promise he had made to his young daughter to kiss only her mother. The show&#x27;s ratings never recovered under Dawson and the final episode aired on 26 May 1995, after which Dawson officially retired. &quot;Family Feud&quot; remained out of production until being revived for a third run in 1999 with new host Louie Anderson, who asked Dawson to make a special appearance on the first episode to give Anderson his blessings. Dawson turned down the offer, wanting no further involvement with the show.

In 2000, Dawson narrated &quot;TV&#x27;s Funniest Game Shows&quot; for the Fox Network in what would prove to be his final public performance .

On 7 June 2012, GSN aired a four-hour marathon of Dawson&#x27;s greatest moments on &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot;, including the first episode of his 1994–95 &quot;Feud&quot; tenure.

==Personal life and family==
With his first wife, actress Diana Dors, Dawson had two sons, Mark (born in London, 4 February 1960) and Gary (born in Los Angeles, 27 June 1962). The marriage ended with a divorce granted in Los Angeles in April 1967, and Dawson gained custody of both sons. He has four grandchildren. Dawson became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1984.

On retiring, Dawson remained in Beverly Hills, California, where he had lived since 1964. He met his second wife, Gretchen Johnson (born 22 September 1955), when she was a contestant on &quot;Family Feud&quot; in May 1981. They married in 1991. Their daughter was born in 1990. Dawson announced the birth and showed a picture of his daughter during the inaugural episode of his second stint as host of &quot;Feud&quot; in 1994 as he was greeting a contestant who had been a contestant on &quot;Match Game&quot; when he was a panelist. The episode was featured on the 25th anniversary of &quot;Family Feud&quot; as number two on the Game Show Network&#x27;s top 25 &quot;Feud&quot; moments. He appeared with his daughter on at least two episodes of the show in 1995, including one taped on his birthday.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Dawson participated in various movements, including the Selma to Montgomery marches and George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign.

==Death==
Dawson died of complications from esophageal cancer at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles on 2 June 2012, aged 79. He is interred in Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles.

<doc id="228309" wikidata="Q8421679" url="?curid=228309" title="Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23">
<text>Article 23 is an article of the Hong Kong Basic Law. It states that Hong Kong &quot;shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People&#x27;s Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.&quot;

The first attempt to implement the article was foiled by a massive street protest on 1 July 2003, when a half-million people marched through downtown Hong Kong. The law was pulled from consideration after division in the pro-Beijing camp and lost the majority of support in the legislature. China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress imposed a national security law with similar language (though without the treason component) on Hong Kong on 30 June 2020, citing its authority under Article 18 of the Basic Law. A second attempt at implementing the article has undergone the legislative process. The bill was officially passed on 19 March 2024 and came into effect on 23 March 2024.

==Content==
Article 23 of the Basic Law (BL 23) states:
==Background==
Article 23 had undergone significant revisions before the promulgation of its current form on 4 April 1990. The 1987 version of Article 23 (Article 22 in 1987) was much shorter and only required that 

The 1989 February version of Article 23 only contained the first half of the enacted version, with identical wording with the promulgated version up to the phrase “or theft of state secrets”. The consultative committee noted views that Article 23 might affect the freedom of Hong Kong people. It also noted the view that the provision was against the Sino-British Joint Declaration since “it is generally held that the capitalist system is anti-communist and will undermine national unity and subvert the Central People&#x27;s Government”. 

Similar laws had been in force during the British colonial period, but they had not been strictly enforced since 1945. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) from the colonial period remains in force, but in 2019 the Court of First Instance ruled that it was &quot;not compatible with the constitutional order laid down by the Basic Law&quot; due to its unchecked and wide scope. The Court of Appeal later varied this by permitting the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation as reasonable and valid, but stated Emergency Regulations Ordinance regulations were &quot;subject to judicial scrutiny.&quot;

Before 1997, the British colonial government introduced the Crimes (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 1996 in an attempt to concretise the concepts of &quot;subversion&quot; and &quot;secession&quot; by confining them to actual violent conduct but of no avail. The bill was voted down in the elected Legislative Council of Hong Kong amid opposition from Beijing and thus left a vacuum in the present legislation.

==2003 National Security Bill==

Mainland national security laws do not apply in Hong Kong, by virtue of Article 18 of the Basic Law. As a result, there has been steady pressure from CPG on the HKSAR government to meet its obligations under Article 23. Laws for the purposes of this Article were introduced by the Tung administration in late 2002. In February 2003, the HKSAR government proposed the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 to the Legislative Council which aimed to amend the Crimes Ordinance, the Official Secrets Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance pursuant to the obligation imposed by Article 23 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and to provide for related, incidental and consequential amendments. The proposed bill caused considerable controversy in Hong Kong and a massive demonstration on 1 July 2003. In the aftermath, Liberal Party chairman James Tien resigned from the Executive Council and the bill was withdrawn after it became clear that it would not get the necessary support from the Legislative Council for it to be passed. The bill was then shelved indefinitely.

==After 2003==
There were calls for reintroducing the national security bill after the 2003 setbacks from the pro-Beijing camp occasionally. After the Beijing interpretation of the Basic Law in November 2016 over the Legislative Council oath-taking controversy to eject two pro-independence legislators from the legislature on the basis that &quot;[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution,&quot; Chief executive Leung Chun-ying said Hong Kong would enact Article 23 targeting the pro-independence movement in Hong Kong.

The Director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office Wang Zhimin accused pro-independence activists of &quot;engaging in activities that sought to separate the motherland and subvert the national regime&quot; and urged the Hong Kong government to enact national security legislation as he said &quot;Hong Kong is the only place in the world without a national security legislation – it’s a major weakness in the nation’s overall security, and it has a direct impact on residents.&quot; Wang said without a national security law, &quot;Hong Kong independence radicals have been challenging national sovereignty and security in recent years&quot;.

Xi Jinping&#x27;s accession to General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top position in November 2012, marked a more hardline authoritarian approach, most notably with the construction of Xinjiang internment camps. The spectre that Hong Kong may similarly be brought to heel became an important element in the democratic protests.

== Protests in 2019 and imposition of security law in 2020 ==
The 2019–20 Hong Kong protests led to an increasing desire within some pro-Beijing lawmakers for Hong Kong to legislate Article 23 of the Basic Law. On 21 May 2020, the Chinese Government proposed a new law on national security regulations that may be enacted in Hong Kong under the provisions of Annex III of its Basic law. It may set up the legal framework to prevent and punish subversion, terrorism, separatism and foreign interference. The following day, a dozen pan-democrat lawmakers marched to the Chinese Liaison Office to show their disapproval.

On 30 June 2020, the mainland 13th National People&#x27;s Congress and it&#x27;s Standing Committee imposed the Hong Kong national security law covering secession and subversion under Article 18 of the Basic Law. The areas of treason, sedition and theft of state secrets are not covered by the new Article 18 law, and remain to be implemented under Article 23 by the Hong Kong SAR. On 12 January 2022, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at the first session of the new legislature that new &quot;local legislation&quot; would be created to meet the requirements of Article 23.

== Safeguarding National Security Bill ==

On 12 April 2022, Chief Executive John Lee stated that implementing security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law would be a top priority for him. Lee later said in July 2022 that he preferred not to rush the law, which some saw as backtracking on his election pledge. The legislation was put on the back burner and was not scheduled for Legislative Council discussion in 2022.

In January 2023, after meeting with Chinese Communist Party officer Xia Baolong, who asked that the Lee administration revise local legislation to keep it aligned with the national security law, Lee said that he would once again prioritize legislation under Article 23 as soon as possible.

Hong Kong&#x27;s Security Bureau launched a public consultation on Article 23 legislation on 30 January 2024, which ended on 28 February 2024. A draft of the Safeguarding National Security Bill was introduced to the Legislative Council on 8 March 2024, which includes penalties up to life imprisonment for treason, insurrection and incitement of a member of Chinese armed forces to mutiny.

<text>In mathematics, the additive inverse of an element , denoted , is the element that when added to , yields the additive identity, 0 (zero). In the most familiar cases, this is the number 0, but it can also refer to a more generalized zero element.

In elementary mathematics, the additive inverse is often referred to as the opposite number, or its negative. The unary operation of arithmetic negation is closely related to &quot;subtraction&quot; and is important in solving algebraic equations. Not all sets where addition is defined have an additive inverse, such as the natural numbers.

== Common examples ==
When working with integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, the additive inverse of any number can be found by multiplying it by −1.
The concept can also be extended to algebraic expressions, which is often used when balancing equations.
== Relation to subtraction ==
The additive inverse is closely related to subtraction, which can be viewed as an addition using the inverse:
Conversely, the additive inverse can be thought of as subtraction from zero:
This connection lead to the minus sign being used for both opposite magnitudes and subtraction as far back as the 17th century. While this notation is standard today, it was met with opposition at the time, as some mathematicians felt it could be unclear and lead to errors.

== Formal definition ==
Given an algebraic structure defined under addition formula_1 with an additive identity formula_2, an element formula_3 has an additive inverse formula_4 if and only if formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7.

Addition is typically only used to refer to a commutative operation, but it is not necessarily associative. When it is associative, so formula_8, the left and right inverses, if they exist, will agree, and the additive inverse will be unique. In non-associative cases, the left and right inverses may disagree, and in these cases, the inverse is not considered to exist.

The definition requires closure, that the additive element formula_4 be found in formula_10. This is why despite addition being defined over the natural numbers, it does not an additive inverse for its members. The associated inverses would be negative numbers, which is why the integers do have an additive inverse.

== Further examples ==
* In a vector space, the additive inverse (often called the &quot;opposite vector&quot; of ) has the same magnitude as and but the opposite direction.
* In modular arithmetic, the modular additive inverse of is the number such that and always exists. For example, the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 8, as .
* In a Boolean ring, which has elements formula_11 addition is often defined as the symmetric difference. So formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15. Our additive identity is 0, and both elements are their own additive inverse as formula_12 and formula_15.

<text>Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch (12 August 1885 – 4 October 1952) was an Australian journalist and media proprietor who was the founder of the Murdoch media empire. He amassed significant media holdings in Australia which after his death were expanded globally by his son Rupert.

Murdoch was born in Melbourne, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He began his journalism career with &quot;The Age&quot; in 1903, eventually becoming a parliamentary reporter. In 1915, he moved to England as editor of Hugh Denison&#x27;s overseas cable service, where he rose to prominence as a war correspondent during World War I. Murdoch&#x27;s attacks on the Allied high command&#x27;s conduct in the Gallipoli campaign brought him to the attention of senior British politicians and press barons, including Lord Northcliffe who served as a mentor. He also became a confidant of Australian prime minister Billy Hughes, although they fell out by the end of the war.

In 1921, Murdoch returned to Melbourne as chief editor of &quot;The Herald&quot;, beginning a long association with its holding company, the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd (HWT). He would become managing director in 1928 and chairman in 1942, overseeing a significant expansion of the company into interstate newspaper markets and commercial radio. Murdoch established a monopoly in the Adelaide newspaper market in 1931 and in 1933 established &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; as Brisbane&#x27;s daily newspaper; he also controlled &quot;The West Australian&quot; for several years. Murdoch co-founded the Australian Associated Press (AAP) in 1935 and was the inaugural chairman of Australian Newsprint Mills. During World War II he briefly served as Director-General of Information.

Outside of his business activities Murdoch was an art collector, serving as chairman of the National Gallery of Victoria and endowing a chair of fine arts at the University of Melbourne. He had four children with his wife Elisabeth, a prominent philanthropist. He retired in 1949, dying of cancer in 1952. In his final years, he sold out of HWT and invested heavily in &quot;The News&quot;, an Adelaide tabloid. Its holding company News Limited formed the basis for his only son Rupert&#x27;s global media empire.

==Early life==
Murdoch was born in Melbourne in 1885, the son of Annie (née Brown) and the Rev. Patrick John Murdoch, who had married in 1882 and migrated from Cruden, Scotland, to Victoria, Australia, with his family in 1884. His paternal grandfather was a minister with the Free Church of Scotland, and his maternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister.

The family moved from West Melbourne to the affluent suburb of Camberwell in 1887. Keith was educated at his uncle Walter&#x27;s short-lived school, then at Camberwell Grammar School, where he became dux in 1903, despite extreme shyness and stammering. He decided not to go straight to university but to try a career in journalism, so family friend David Syme of &quot;The Age&quot; agreed to employ him as district correspondent for nearby Malvern. Over the next four years, he managed to create a significant increase in &quot;The Age&#x27;s&quot; local circulation, to earn promotion, and to save enough money for a ticket to England, where he hoped to gain further experience and find ways to manage his stammer.

== Education and career ==
From 1908 to 1909, in London, he took speech therapy with Lionel Logue, studied part-time at the London School of Economics, and tried to find employment as a journalist, with the help of recommendations from more family friends, including Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. His stammer became manageable, but shortly after it cost him a job with the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. In September 1909, Murdoch returned home to resume work for &quot;The Age&quot;, now as a parliamentary reporter, in which capacity he strengthened the family&#x27;s relationships with politicians such as Andrew Fisher, in some cases entertaining them at his aunt&#x27;s country guest house.

===First World War===

In 1912, he became Melbourne political correspondent for &quot;The Sun&quot; of Sydney. Losing out to the more experienced Charles Bean for the position of official Australian correspondent covering World War I, he was appointed managing editor of the London cable service run by the &quot;Sun&quot; and the &quot;Melbourne Herald&quot; in 1915. Murdoch travelled to New Zealand in January 1915 with Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, and two other MPs, the Hon. J. Boyd, and the Hon. D. Hall, covering war talks between Fisher and the New Zealand Prime Minister, William Massey, just before the engagement of Australian and New Zealand troops in the Gallipoli campaign. They travelled from Wellington aboard the &quot;Ulimaroa&quot;, arriving in Sydney on 2 February 1915. Andrew Fisher and Defence Minister George Pearce then asked him to take time on his journey to London, to check on some matters of concern relating to supplies and mail for Australian troops in the conflict, so he stopped off in Egypt. While there in August, he was able to secure the permission of Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Dardanelles campaign in Turkey, to visit Australian troops in Gallipoli and write his impressions for the newspapers, subject to the usual military censorship. The agreement he signed specified that he was &quot;not to attempt to correspond by any other route or by any other means than that officially sanctioned&quot; and during the war he must not &quot;impart to anyone military information of a confidential nature... unless first submitted to the Chief Field Censor.&quot;

Murdoch visited Anzac Cove at the beginning of September, then moved to the headquarters on the island of Imbros. Discussing the situation with other journalists, he was befriended by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, who was deeply concerned that censorship was being used to suppress criticism of the Dardanelles campaign, which, as Murdoch had seen for himself, had serious problems. Murdoch agreed to carry a letter from Ashmead-Bartlett to the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in London, written on 8 September, presenting his uncensored report of the situation. Hamilton quickly learned about the existence of this letter (another British reporter, Henry Nevinson, has been blamed for this but his biography points to an official Royal Navy war photographer). Reaching France on his route to London, Murdoch was arrested by Military Police in Marseille and the letter was confiscated. Arriving in London on 21 September, he spent some time at the Australian High Commission composing his own letter to his prime minister, Andrew Fisher, in a similar vein to the Ashmead-Bartlett letter and particularly critical of the British general and administrative staff:

After sending the letter to Australia, he supplied two copies to the British Munitions Minister David Lloyd George, with his letter of introduction from Andrew Fisher. Very quickly, Murdoch&#x27;s letter reached Asquith and was circulated to senior ministers of the British government. Ashmead-Bartlett, expelled from the Dardanelles, reached London about this time and soon, thanks to the influence of Lord Northcliffe, proprietor of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; and other national newspapers, his version of events began to be published. Murdoch, initially alarmed that Northcliffe&#x27;s staff had obtained a copy of his private letter, soon became a friend of the newspaper tycoon. Although his letter, written from memory, contained many mistakes and exaggerations, the main points were supported by other evidence and Hamilton was relieved of command, the subsequent operation to evacuate the troops from Gallipoli in December being accomplished with perfect effectiveness.

In 1917, while visiting the Western Front as an unofficial war correspondent, Murdoch attempted to conduct negotiations with Field Marshal Douglas Haig in support of the Australian government&#x27;s policy of the Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F.) divisions to be brought together into a united Australian Corps. Although Murdoch pushed for the appointment of Major General Brudenell White as the new corps commander while denigrating Major General John Monash (who was of Jewish German ancestry), the latter was given command when the Australian Corps was formed in 1918. Along with official war correspondent Charles Bean, Murdoch continued to lobby for Monash&#x27;s demotion by appealing directly to Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes and misleading him into the belief that the A.I.F.&#x27;s senior officers were strongly opposed to Monash. When Hughes visited the front just before the Battle of Hamel intending to replace Monash, he first consulted the same senior officers and discovered that their support for their commander was strongly positive and that Monash&#x27;s powers of planning and execution were excellent. The subsequent outcome of the Hamel assault closed the question of Monash&#x27;s suitability but later in the same year Murdoch attempted again to convince Hughes that Monash should not control the repatriation of Australian troops.

===&quot;Melbourne Herald&quot;===
Murdoch remained in London, expanding the cable service, writing influential journalism—and helping his friend Billy Hughes on visits to England—until he was offered the post of chief editor at the &quot;Melbourne Herald&quot;, which he took in January 1921. Arranging for the paper&#x27;s general manager to be demoted, he began applying Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s principles, with frequent advice from Northcliffe himself. As he had in London, he focused on political controversy, but he also made the &quot;Herald&quot; influential in other ways, through such devices as improved arts coverage, and celebrity contributions. When Hugh Denison, proprietor of the Sydney &quot;Sun&quot;, tried to break into the Melbourne market with the &quot;Sun News-Pictorial&quot; in 1922, Murdoch fought a long campaign which eventually resulted in the &quot;Herald&quot;, its own circulation up by 50%, taking over the new tabloid in 1925. He acquired the nickname &quot;Lord Southcliffe&quot; and in 1928 became managing director of the company, by which time the &quot;Sun&quot; was on its way to becoming Australia&#x27;s highest-selling newspaper.

In 1927 he saw a photograph of an attractive 18-year-old débutante, Elisabeth Joy Greene, in &quot;Table Talk&quot; magazine, and arranged for a friend to introduce him. She became Mrs Elisabeth Murdoch in June 1928, honeymooning on his Cruden Farm estate at Langwarrin. They had children Helen (later Mrs Geoff Handbury), Rupert Murdoch, Anne (later Mrs Milan Kantor) and Janet (now Mrs John Calvert-Jones). In the early years of World War I he had been engaged for a time to Isabel Law, daughter of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and future prime minister Bonar Law.

From 1926 onward, he had led a campaign to take over newspapers elsewhere in Australia, with varying success. In Adelaide, for example, the &quot;Herald&quot; publisher took over the feeble &quot;The Register&quot; in 1928, and turned it into a &quot;Sun&quot;-style picture tabloid. Within months, the previously dominant &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot; accepted a takeover bid, and &quot;The Register&quot; was quietly closed down in 1931, after the &quot;Herald&quot; acquired the evening &quot;Adelaide News&quot;, securing a local monopoly. Murdoch had also been investing in newspapers on his own account, notably in Brisbane, where he bought shares in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and which was subsequently merged with the rival &quot;Courier&quot;. He kept pace with new technology, and by 1935 the &quot;Herald&quot; was involved with 11 radio stations (while Murdoch campaigned to prevent the official Australian Broadcasting Commission from establishing its own news service). He also led both the merger of rival cable services to form Australian Associated Press Ltd in 1935, and a project to build a paper-mill in Tasmania.

===1930s and after===
In the Depression of the early 1930s, Murdoch&#x27;s papers campaigned against the Labor Party government of James Scullin, and gave full support to the breakaway ex-Labor politician Joseph Lyons in his successful 1931 campaign to become prime minister. He received a knighthood in July 1933, and being an art connoisseur with an appreciation of modern work, became a trustee of Victoria&#x27;s museums and galleries. He later had some regrets about his support for the strong-willed Lyons, stating in 1936, &quot;I put him there and I&#x27;ll put him out&quot;. Meanwhile, others were expressing deep concern about the dangers of concentrating so much press power in the hands of one person. This came to a head after Australia became involved in the Second World War. In June 1940, Murdoch was appointed to a newly created Australian Government post, Director-General of Information, and on 18 July he obtained authorisation to compel all news media to publish Government statements as and when necessary. Comparisons were made with Goebbels, press co-operation was swiftly withdrawn, politicians protested, and despite agreements to modify the regulation, in November he was obliged to resign the post.

Returning to the newspapers (from which he had agreed to distance himself while serving the Government) he spent the rest of the war encouraging a patriotic spirit, and attacking the Labor Prime Minister, John Curtin (who led a minority government in 1941, and was re-elected with a dramatic majority in 1943). In 1942 he became chairman of the &quot;Herald&quot; group, and in 1944, maintaining his connection with the art world, he established the Herald Chair of Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne. The following year he became chairman of the trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria. Becoming increasingly ill with cancer, he retired from most of his work except the &quot;Herald&quot; in 1949, and made a deal with the &quot;Herald&quot; board to buy control of the Adelaide newspapers, in return for first option in any future sale of his Brisbane newspaper shares.

==Death and legacy==
Murdoch died at the family property, Cruden Farm, Langwarrin, Victoria, in the night of 4–5 October 1952 and the funeral service was held at Toorak Presbyterian Church. Much of his estate, valued for probate at £410,004 (), was disposed of to pay off mortgages, death duties etc. (the &quot;Herald&quot; exercised its option to buy the Brisbane newspaper shares), but his family was still left with full control of News Limited, proprietors of the &quot;Adelaide News&quot;.

<text>Bucky Bug is a beetle who appears in Disney comics. He first appeared in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip, and later appeared as a regular feature in the comic book &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.

==Silly Symphony==
Bucky Bug first appeared in the initial &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip, beginning January 10, 1932; he was the first character to debut in Disney comics. He was initially drawn by Earl Duvall, who subsequently left Disney and joined Warner Brothers where he created Buddy (Looney Tunes).

Bucky only had one film appearance, in &quot;Bugs in Love&quot;, released in October 1932.

Bucky Bug also appeared in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. Starting in issue #20 (May 1942), the comic began reprinting some of Bucky&#x27;s original 1930s &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strips. The reprints continued until issue #28 (Jan 1943), and were then replaced by &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot; strips.

===Stories===
Bucky&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; storylines were initially unnamed; the action moved from one week to the next, with no explicit break between chapters. In reprints, however, a set of names has become the standard:

* &quot;Bucky Makes His Name&quot; (January 10 to April 10, 1932)
* &quot;The Quest for Fortune&quot; (April 17 to June 19)
* &quot;Adventures in Junkville&quot; (June 26 to August 7)
* &quot;Introducing Lucky Bucks&quot; (August 14)
* &quot;Bugs in Love&quot; (August 21 to November 6)
* &quot;War with the Flies&quot; (November 13, 1932 to April 16, 1933)
* &quot;The Old Folks&#x27; New Home&quot; (April 23 to June 4, 1933)
* &quot;In Mother Goose Land&quot; (June 11 to November 5)
* &quot;Return to Junkville&quot; (November 12, 1933 to March 14, 1934)

The Bucky strips ended with Bucky and June saying goodbye to the readers:
: We&#x27;re leaving this page,
: And saying good-bye --
: But we will not
: Ever forget ya!
: We&#x27;re settling down,
: As all bugs should!
: So long! We&#x27;re glad
: To have met ya!

On March 11, 1934, the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip moved to its next storyline, based on the short &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;.

==Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories==
In 1943, the anthology comic book &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; began publishing original full-length comic book stories, and the first new 10-page Bucky story appeared in issue #39 (December 1943) - &quot;A Cure for Gout&quot;, by Al Taliaferro. Bucky&#x27;s stories appeared monthly for the next six years, ending with issue #120 (September 1950). The stories were drawn by a number of artists, including Carl Buettner, Vivie Risto, Ralph Heimdahl and Tony Strobl.

Bucky&#x27;s supporting characters included June Bug (Bucky&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife), Bo Bug (a hobo and Bucky&#x27;s best friend), the Mayor (June&#x27;s father), Grandpa Bootle Beetle (Bucky&#x27;s adopted grandfather), and others. American Bucky stories almost always had the characters speaking in rhyme.

Bucky still makes frequent appearances in Dutch stories up to the present time.

Bucky is the first Disney character to make his first appearance in a comic strip outside the Mickey Mouse Universe.

He made a very brief cameo early in the 1988 Touchstone Pictures/Amblin Entertainment film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

<doc id="228331" wikidata="Q5302618" url="?curid=228331" title="Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc v Gutnick">
<text>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc v Gutnick was an Internet defamation case heard in the High Court of Australia, decided on 10 December 2002. The 28 October 2000 edition of Barron&#x27;s Online, published by Dow Jones, contained an article entitled &quot;Unholy Gains&quot; in which several references were made to the respondent, Joseph Gutnick. Gutnick contended that part of the article defamed him. A key judgement was that the suit could be brought in Australia.

== Facts ==

The article in question was entitled &quot;Unholy Gains&quot;, by William Alpert, published in Barron&#x27;s 2000 Oct 30. Australian courts described the details of the article in their written opinion on the case, as follows:
In court it was proved that only five copies of the Barron&#x27;s print edition were sent from New Jersey to be circulated in Australia, but that none had actually arrived in the Jurisdiction. Gutnick therefore resorted to the internet based publication in order to show an actionable tort in the jurisdiction. The Internet version of the magazine had 550,000 international subscribers and 1700 Australian-based credit cards.

Geoffrey Robertson QC argued for the publisher Dow Jones as to whether it was considered to be &quot;published from&quot; where it was uploaded in New Jersey or &quot;published into&quot; where it was downloaded by subscribers in Victoria, Australia. The argument was on publication and jurisdiction.

==Decision==

In a unanimous decision, all seven High Court justices decided that Gutnick had the right to sue for defamation at his primary residence and the place he was best known. Victoria was considered the place where damage to his reputation occurred. The High Court decided that defamation did not occur at the time of publishing, but as soon as a third party read the publication and thought less of the individual who was defamed.

Dow Jones was forced to admit in court that &quot;there was no reason to believe Mr Gutnick was a customer of Mr Goldberg or had any criminal or improper relations with Mr Goldberg&quot;. (quote from an Australian Broadcasting Corporation story)

The High Court&#x27;s ruling effectively allows defamation plaintiffs in Australia to sue for defamation on the internet against any defendant irrespective of their location. &quot;If people wish to do business in, or indeed travel to, or live in, or utilize the infrastructure of different countries, they can hardly expect to be absolved from compliance with the laws of those countries. The fact that publication might occur everywhere does not mean that it occurs nowhere.&quot; (per Callinan J at para 186)

Equally, however, the majority of the Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ handing down a joint decision) stated that they disagreed that this would cause open-slather defamation actions in Australia: (at para 54 of the decision)

The case was highly controversial and the subject of much commentary from legal analysts.
The case was appealed by the author, to the UN under the right of direct petition for individuals. In the teeth of that application prepared by Geoffrey Robertson, Tim Robertson SC, Mark Stephens (solicitor) and Johnson Winter Slattery lawyer Paul Reidy, the case was settled on 15 November 2004, Dow Jones settled the case, agreeing to pay Gutnick some of his legal fees.

<doc id="228339" wikidata="Q1263210" url="?curid=228339" title="Christmas frigatebird">
<text>The Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi), or Christmas Island frigatebird, is a seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae which is an endemic breeder to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Apart from the Ascension frigatebird, the three other species of frigatebird have much more widely distributed breeding locations.

The Christmas frigatebird is a large lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. It has a wingspan of around . The male has an egg shaped white patch on his belly and a striking red gular sac which he inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. They feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean&#x27;s surface (mostly flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Christmas frigatebird was once considered to belong to the species &quot;Fregata aquila&quot; but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the Christmas frigatebird should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name &quot;Fregata andrewsi&quot; in honour of the English paleontogist Charles Andrews. Of the four other species within the genus &quot;Fregata&quot;, genetic analysis has shown that the Christmas frigatebird is most closely related to the great frigatebird.

==Description==

The Christmas frigatebird measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs around . The adult male of this species is easily identified, since he is all black except for a white belly patch. Other plumages resemble those of the smaller lesser frigatebird, but have whiter bellies and longer white underwing spurs.

==Status==
The Christmas frigatebird is endemic to Christmas Island and breeds in only four main nesting colonies. In 2003 there were 1,200 breeding pairs but as frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to be between 3,600 and 7,200 individuals. The species has a small population and breeds on just one island. It was formerly listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, and is now listed as vulnerable. Populations, however, continue to decline due to persecution by fishermen, loss of breeding habitat associated with phosphate mining, marine pollution and entanglement in fishing equipment.

<doc id="228344" wikidata="Q114466" url="?curid=228344" title="Mixed martial arts">
<text>Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact fighting sport based on striking and grappling, incorporating techniques from various combat sports from around the world.

In the early 20th century, various inter-stylistic contests took place throughout Japan and the countries of East Asia. At the same time, in Brazil there was a phenomenon called vale tudo, which became known for unrestricted fights between various styles such as judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling, luta livre, Muay Thai and capoeira. An early high-profile mixed bout was Kimura vs. Gracie in 1951. In mid-20th century Hong Kong, rooftop street fighting contests between different martial arts styles gave rise to Bruce Lee&#x27;s hybrid martial arts style Jeet Kune Do. Another precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Ali vs. Inoki exhibition bout, fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of Shooto in 1985, Pancrase in 1993, and the Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.

In the 1990s, the Gracie family brought their Brazilian jiu-jitsu style, first developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States—which culminated in the founding of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) promotion company in 1993. The company held an event with almost no rules, mostly due to the influence of Art Davie and Rorion Gracie attempting to replicate mixed contests that existed in Brazil and Japan. They would later implement a different set of rules (example: eliminating kicking a grounded opponent), which differed from other leagues which were more in favour of realistic, &quot;street-like&quot; fights. The first documented use of the term &quot;mixed martial arts&quot; was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.

Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat, competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules. Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple martial arts into their style. MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to increase competitors&#x27; safety, to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport. Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity with a pay-per-view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling.

==History==

===Antiquity===

In ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed combat sport that combined Chinese martial arts, boxing and wrestling.

In ancient Greece, there was a sport called pankration, which featured grappling and striking skills similar to those found in modern MMA. Pankration was formed by combining the already established wrestling and boxing traditions and, in Olympic terms, first featured in the 33rd Olympiad in 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging, which were banned. The fighters, called pankratiasts, fought until someone could not continue or signaled submission by raising their index finger; there were no rounds. According to the historian E. Norman Gardiner, &quot;No branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration.&quot; There is also evidence of similar mixed combat sports in ancient Egypt, India and Japan.

===Modern-era precursors===
The mid-19th century saw the prominence of the new sport savate in the combat sports circle. French savate fighters wanted to test their techniques against the traditional combat styles of its time. In 1852, a contest was held in France between French &quot;savateurs&quot; and English bare-knuckle boxers in which French fighter Rambaud alias &quot;la Resistance&quot; fought English fighter Dickinson and won using his kicks. However, the English team still won the four other match-ups during the contest. Contests occurred in the late 19th to mid-20th century between French &quot;savateurs&quot; and other combat styles. Examples include a 1905 fight between French savateur George Dubois and a judo practitioner Re-nierand which resulted in the latter winning by submission, as well as the highly publicized 1957 fight between French savateur and professional boxer Jacques Cayron and a young Japanese karateka named Mochizuki Hiroo which ended when Cayron knocked Hiroo out with a hook.

Catch wrestling appeared in the late 19th century, combining several global styles of wrestling, including Indian pehlwani and English wrestling. In turn, catch wrestling went on to greatly influence modern MMA. No-holds-barred fighting reportedly took place in the late 1880s when wrestlers representing the style of catch wrestling and many others met in tournaments and music-hall challenge matches throughout Europe. In the US, the first major encounter between a boxer and a wrestler in modern times took place in 1887 when John L. Sullivan, then heavyweight world boxing champion, entered the ring with his trainer, wrestling champion William Muldoon, and was slammed to the mat in two minutes. The next publicized encounter occurred in the late 1890s when future heavyweight boxing champion Bob Fitzsimmons took on European wrestling champion Ernest Roeber. In September 1901, Frank &quot;Paddy&quot; Slavin, who had been a contender for Sullivan&#x27;s boxing title, knocked out future world wrestling champion Frank Gotch in Dawson City, Canada. The judo-practitioner Ren-nierand, who gained fame after defeating George Dubois, would fight again in another similar contest, which he lost to Ukrainian Catch wrestler Ivan Poddubny.

Another early example of mixed martial arts was Bartitsu, which Edward William Barton-Wright founded in London in 1899. Combining catch wrestling, judo, boxing, savate, jujutsu and canne de combat (French stick fighting), Bartitsu was the first martial art known to have combined Asian and European fighting styles, and which saw MMA-style contests throughout England, pitting European catch wrestlers and Japanese judoka champions against representatives of various European wrestling styles.

Among the precursors of modern MMA are mixed style contests throughout Europe, Japan, and the Pacific Rim during the early 1900s. In Japan, these contests were known as &quot;merikan&quot;, from the Japanese slang for &quot;American [fighting]&quot;. &quot;Merikan&quot; contests were fought under a variety of rules, including points decision, best of three throws or knockdowns, and victory via knockout or submission.

Sambo, a martial art and combat sport developed in Russia in the early 1920s, merged various forms of combat styles such as wrestling, judo and striking into one unique martial art. The popularity of professional wrestling, which was contested under various catch wrestling rules at the time, waned after World War I, when the sport split into two genres: &quot;shoot&quot;, in which the fighters actually competed, and &quot;show&quot;, which evolved into modern professional wrestling. In 1936, heavyweight boxing contender Kingfish Levinsky and professional wrestler Ray Steele competed in a mixed match, which catch wrestler Steele won in 35 seconds. 27 years later, Ray Steele&#x27;s protégé Lou Thesz fought boxer Jersey Joe Walcott twice in mixed style bouts. The first match was a real contest which Thesz won while the second match was a work, which Thesz also won.

In the 1940s in the Palama Settlement in Hawaii, five martial arts masters, under the leadership of Adriano Emperado, curious to determine which martial art was best, began testing each other in their respective arts of kenpo, jujitsu, Chinese and American boxing and tang soo do. From this they developed kajukenbo, the first American mixed martial arts.

In 1951, a high-profile grappling match was Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie, which was wrestled between judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu jitsu founder Hélio Gracie in Brazil. Kimura defeated Gracie using a gyaku-ude-garami armlock, which later became known as the &quot;Kimura&quot; in Brazilian jiu jitsu. In 1963, a catch wrestler and judoka &quot;Judo&quot; Gene Lebell fought professional boxer Milo Savage in a no-holds-barred match. Lebell won by Harai Goshi to rear naked choke, leaving Savage unconscious. This was the first televised bout of mixed-style fighting in North America. The hometown crowd was so enraged that they began to boo and throw chairs at Lebell.

On February 12, 1963, three karatekas from &quot;Oyama dojo&quot; (kyokushin later) went to the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Thailand and fought against three Muay Thai fighters. The three kyokushin karate fighters were Tadashi Nakamura, Kenji Kurosaki and AkiFujihira (also known as Noboru Osawa), while the Muay Thai team of three authentic Thai fighter. Japan won 2–1: Tadashi Nakamura and Akio Fujihira both knocked out their opponents with punches while Kenji Kurosaki, who fought the Thai, was knocked out by elbows. The Japanese fighter who lost, Kenji Kurosaki, was a kyokushin instructor, rather than a contender, and that he had stood in as a substitute for the absent chosen fighter. In June of the same year, karateka and future kickboxer Tadashi Sawamura faced top Thai fighter Samarn Sor Adisorn: Sawamura was knocked down sixteen times on his way to defeat. Sawamura went on to incorporate what he learned in that fight in kickboxing tournaments.
During the late 1960s to early 1970s, the concept of hybrid martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that &quot;the best fighter is not a boxer, karate or judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual&#x27;s own style and not following the system of styles.&quot; In 2004, UFC President Dana White would call Lee the &quot;father of mixed martial arts&quot; stating: &quot;If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, and many of the things he wrote, he said the perfect style was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the rest away&quot;.

A contemporary of Bruce Lee, Wing Chun practitioner Wong Shun Leung, gained prominence fighting in 60–100 illegal &quot;beimo&quot; fights against other Chinese martial artists of various styles. Wong also fought and won against Western fighters of other combat styles, such as his match against Russian boxer Giko, his televised fight against a fencer, and his fight against Taiwanese kung fu master Wu Ming Jeet. Wong combined boxing and kickboxing into his kung fu, as Bruce Lee did.
Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki took place in Japan in 1976. The classic match-up between professional boxer and professional wrestler turned sour as each fighter refused to engage in the other&#x27;s style, and after a 15-round stalemate it was declared a draw. Muhammad Ali sustained a substantial amount of damage to his legs, as Antonio Inoki slide-kicked him continuously for the duration of the bout, causing him to be hospitalized for the next three days. The fight played an important role in the history of mixed martial arts.

The basis of modern mixed martial arts in Japan can be found across several shoot-style professional wrestling promotions such as UWF International and Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi, both founded in 1991, that attempted to create a combat-based style which blended wrestling, kickboxing and submission grappling. Another promotion formed around the same time by Akira Maeda called Fighting Network RINGS initially started as a shoot-style professional wrestling promotion but it also promoted early mixed martial arts contests. From 1995 onwards it began identifying itself as a mixed martial arts promotion and moved away from the original shoot style. Professional wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki founded Pancrase in 1993 which promoted legitimate contests initially under professional wrestling rules. These promotions inspired Pride Fighting Championships which started in 1997. Pride was acquired by its rival Ultimate Fighting Championship in 2007.

A fight between Golden Gloves boxing champion Joey Hadley and Arkansas Karate Champion David Valovich happened on June 22, 1976, at Memphis Blues Baseball Park. The bout had mixed rules: the karateka was allowed to use his fists, feet and knees, while the boxer could only use his fists. Hadley won the fight via knockout on the first round.

In 1988, Rick Roufus challenged Changpuek Kiatsongrit to a non-title Muay Thai vs. kickboxing super fight. Roufus was at the time an undefeated Kickboxer and held both the KICK Super Middleweight World title and the PKC Middleweight U.S. title. Kiatsongrit was finding it increasingly difficult to get fights in Thailand as his weight (70 kg) was not typical for Thailand, where competitive bouts tended to be at the lower weights. Roufus knocked Changpuek down twice with punches in the first round, breaking Changpuek&#x27;s jaw, but lost by technical knockout in the fourth round due to the culmination of low kicks to the legs that he was unprepared for. This match was the first popular fight which showcased the power of such low kicks to a predominantly Western audience.

==Growth of MMA ==
The growth of mixed martial arts (MMA) globally has been remarkable over the past few decades. MMA has evolved from being a niche combat sport to one of the most popular and commercially successful sports worldwide.

==Timeline of major events==
==Modern sport==
The movement that led to the creation of present-day mixed martial arts scenes emerged from a confluence of several earlier martial arts scenes: the vale tudo events in Brazil, rooftop fights in Hong Kong&#x27;s street fighting culture, and professional wrestlers, especially in Japan.

Vale tudo began in the 1920s and became renowned through its association with the &quot;Gracie challenge&quot;, which was issued by Carlos Gracie and Hélio Gracie and upheld later by descendants of the Gracie family. The &quot;Gracie Challenges&quot; were held in the garages and gyms of the Gracie family members. When the popularity grew, these types of mixed bouts were a staple attraction at the carnivals in Brazil.

In the mid-20th century, mixed martial arts contests emerged in Hong Kong&#x27;s street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights. During the early 20th century, there was an influx of migrants from mainland China, including Chinese martial arts teachers who opened up martial arts schools in Hong Kong. In the mid-20th century, soaring crime in Hong Kong, combined with limited Hong Kong Police manpower, led to many young Hongkongers learning martial arts for self-defence. Around the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong, teaching their own distinctive styles of martial arts. In Hong Kong&#x27;s street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the 1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong&#x27;s rooftops, in order to avoid crackdowns by colonial British Hong Kong authorities. The most famous fighter to emerge from Hong Kong&#x27;s rooftop fight scene was Bruce Lee, who combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts system called Jeet Kune Do. Lee went on to popularize the concept of mixed martial arts internationally.

Early mixed-match martial arts professional wrestling bouts in Japan (known as &quot;Ishu Kakutōgi Sen&quot; (異種格闘技戦), literally &quot;heterogeneous combat sports bouts&quot;) became popular with Antonio Inoki only in the 1970s. Inoki was a disciple of Rikidōzan, but also of Karl Gotch, who trained numerous Japanese wrestlers in catch wrestling.

Regulated mixed martial arts competitions were first introduced in the United States by CV Productions, Inc. Its first competition, called &quot;Tough Guy Contest&quot; was held on March 20, 1980, New Kensington, Pennsylvania, Holiday Inn. During that year the company renamed the brand to &quot;Super Fighters&quot; and sanctioned ten regulated tournaments in Pennsylvania. In 1983, Pennsylvania State Senate passed a bill known as the &quot;Tough Guy Law&quot; that specifically called for: &quot;Prohibiting Tough Guy contests or Battle of the Brawlers contests&quot;, and ended the sport.

Japan had its own form of mixed martial arts discipline, Shooto, which evolved from shoot wrestling in 1985, as well as the shoot wrestling derivative Pancrase, which was founded as a promotion in 1993. was held in Japan in September 1993, two months before UFC 1 was held in the United States in November 1993.

In 1993, the sport was reintroduced to the United States by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). UFC promoters initially pitched the event as a real-life fighting video game tournament similar to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The sport gained international exposure and widespread publicity when jiu-jitsu fighter Royce Gracie won the first Ultimate Fighting Championship tournament, submitting three challengers in a total of just five minutes. sparking a revolution in martial arts.

The first Vale Tudo Japan tournaments were held in 1994 and 1995 and were both won by Rickson Gracie. Around the same time, International Vale Tudo competition started to develop through (World Vale Tudo Championship (WVC), VTJ, IVC, UVF etc.). Interest in mixed martial arts as a sport resulted in the creation of the Pride Fighting Championships (Pride) in 1997.

The sport reached a new peak of popularity in North America in December 2006: a rematch between then UFC light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell and former champion Tito Ortiz, rivaled the PPV sales of some of the biggest boxing events of all time, and helped the UFC&#x27;s 2006 PPV gross surpass that of any promotion in PPV history. In 2007, Zuffa LLC, the owners of the UFC MMA promotion, bought Japanese rival MMA brand Pride FC, merging the contracted fighters under one promotion. Comparisons were drawn to the consolidation that occurred in other sports, such as the AFL-NFL Merger in American football.

===Origin of the term &quot;MMA&quot;===
The first documented use of the name &quot;mixed martial arts&quot; was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic, Howard Rosenberg, in 1993. The term gained popularity when the website, newfullcontact.com (one of the biggest websites covering the sport at the time), hosted and reprinted the article. The first use of the term by a promotion was in September 1995 by Rick Blume, president and CEO of Battlecade Extreme Fighting, just after UFC 7.
UFC official, Jeff Blatnick, was responsible for the Ultimate Fighting Championship officially adopting the name mixed martial arts. It was previously marketed as &quot;Ultimate Fighting&quot; and &quot;No Holds Barred (NHB)&quot;, until Blatnick and John McCarthy proposed the name &quot;MMA&quot; at the UFC 17 rules meeting in response to increased public criticism. The question as to who actually coined the name is still in debate.

===Regulation===

The first state-regulated MMA event was held in Biloxi, Mississippi on August 23, 1996, with the sanctioning of IFC&#x27;s Mayhem in Mississippi show by the Mississippi Athletic Commission under William Lyons. The rules used were an adaptation of the kickboxing rules already accepted by most state athletic commissions. These modified kickboxing rules allowed for take downs and ground fighting and did away with rounds, although they did allow for fighters to be stood up by the referee and restarted if there was no action on the ground. These rules were the first in modern MMA to define fouls, fighting surfaces and the use of the cage.

In March 1997, the Iowa Athletic Commission officially sanctioned Battlecade Extreme Fighting under a modified form of its existing rules for Shootfighting. These rules created the three &#x27;five-minute round/one-minute break&#x27; format, and mandated shootfighting gloves, as well as weight classes for the first time. Illegal blows were listed as groin strikes, head butting, biting, eye gouging, hair pulling, striking an opponent with an elbow while the opponent is on the mat, kidney strikes, and striking the back of the head with closed fist. Holding onto the ring or cage for any reason was defined as a foul. While there are minor differences between these and the final Unified Rules, notably regarding elbow strikes, the Iowa rules allowed mixed martial arts promoters to conduct essentially modern events legally, anywhere in the state. On March 28, 1997, Extreme Fighting 4 was held under these rules, making it the first show conducted under a version of the modern rules.

In April 2000, the California State Athletic Commission voted unanimously in favor of regulations that later became the foundation for the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. However, when the legislation was sent to the California capital in Sacramento for review, it was determined that the sport fell outside the jurisdiction of the CSAC, rendering the vote meaningless.

On September 30, 2000, the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board (NJSACB) began allowing mixed martial arts promoters to conduct events in New Jersey. The first event was an IFC event titled Battleground 2000 held in Atlantic City. The intent was to allow the NJSACB to observe actual events and gather information to establish a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the sport effectively.

On April 3, 2001, the NJSACB held a meeting to discuss the regulation of mixed martial arts events. This meeting attempted to unify the myriad rules and regulations which had been utilized by the different mixed martial arts organizations. At this meeting, the proposed uniform rules were agreed upon by the NJSACB, several other regulatory bodies, numerous promoters of mixed martial arts events and other interested parties in attendance. At the conclusion of the meeting, all parties in attendance were able to agree upon a uniform set of rules to govern the sport of mixed martial arts.

The rules adopted by the NJSACB have become the de facto standard set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across North America. On July 30, 2009, a motion was made at the annual meeting of the Association of Boxing Commissions to adopt these rules as the &quot;Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts&quot;. The motion passed unanimously.

In November 2005, the United States Army began to sanction mixed martial arts with the first annual Army Combatives Championships held by the US Army Combatives School.

Canada formally decriminalized mixed martial arts with a vote on Bill S-209 on June 5, 2013. The bill allows for provinces to have the power to create athletic commissions to regulate and sanction professional mixed martial arts bouts.

These gyms provide structured environments for athletes to prepare for competition, offering coaching, sparring, and conditioning programs. Certain gyms, such as the UFC Performance Institute offer facilities like cryotherapy chambers, underwater treadmills, and DEXA machines. The following are popular MMA gyms along with notable fighters that have trained out of them.

===Fighter development===
As a result of an increased number of competitors, organized training camps, information sharing, and modern kinesiology, the understanding of the effectiveness of various strategies has been greatly improved. UFC commentator Joe Rogan claimed that martial arts evolved more in the ten years following 1993 (the first UFC event) than in the preceding 700 years combined.

The high profile of modern MMA promotions such as UFC and Pride has fostered an accelerated development of the sport. The early 1990s saw a wide variety of traditional styles competing in the sport. However, early competition saw varying levels of success among disparate styles.
In the early 1990s, practitioners of grappling based styles such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu dominated competition in the United States. Practitioners of striking based arts such as boxing, kickboxing, and karate, who were unfamiliar with submission grappling, proved to be unprepared to deal with its submission techniques. As competitions became more and more common, those with a base in striking arts became more competitive as they cross-trained in styles based around takedowns and submission holds. Likewise, those from the varying grappling styles added striking techniques to their arsenal. This increase of cross-training resulted in fighters becoming increasingly multidimensional and well-rounded in their skill-sets.

The new hybridization of fighting styles can be seen in the technique of &quot;ground and pound&quot; developed by wrestling-based UFC pioneers such as Dan Severn, Don Frye and Mark Coleman. These wrestlers realized the need for the incorporation of strikes on the ground as well as on the feet, and incorporated ground striking into their grappling-based styles. Mark Coleman stated at UFC 14 that his strategy was to &quot;Ground him and pound him&quot;, which may be the first televised use of the term.

Since the late 1990s, both strikers and grapplers have been successful at MMA, although it is rare to see any fighter who is not schooled in both striking and grappling arts reach the highest levels of competition.

==Rules==

The rules for modern mixed martial arts competitions have changed significantly since the early days of vale tudo, Japanese shoot wrestling, and UFC 1, and even more from the historic style of pankration. As the knowledge of fighting techniques spread among fighters and spectators, it became clear that the original minimalist rule systems needed to be amended.
The main motivations for these rule changes were protection of the health of the fighters, the desire to shed the perception of &quot;barbarism and lawlessness&quot;, and to be recognized as a legitimate sport.

The new rules included the introduction of weight classes; as knowledge about submissions spread, differences in weight had become a significant factor. There are nine different weight classes in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. These nine weight classes include flyweight (up to 125 lb / 56.7 kg), bantamweight (up to 135 lb / 61.2 kg), featherweight (up to 145 lb / 65.8 kg), lightweight (up to 155 lb / 70.3 kg), welterweight (up to 170 lb / 77.1 kg), middleweight (up to 185 lb / 83.9 kg), light heavyweight (up to 205 lb / 93.0 kg), heavyweight (up to 265 lb / 120.2 kg), and super heavyweight with no upper weight limit.

Small, open-fingered gloves were introduced to protect fists, reduce the occurrence of cuts (and stoppages due to cuts) and encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches. Gloves were first made mandatory in Japan&#x27;s Shooto promotion and were later adopted by the UFC as it developed into a regulated sport. Most professional fights have the fighters wear 4 oz gloves, whereas some jurisdictions require amateurs to wear a slightly heavier 6 oz glove for more protection for the hands and wrists.

Time limits were established to avoid long fights with little action where competitors conserved their strength. Matches without time limits also complicated the airing of live events. The time limits in most professional fights are three 5 minute rounds, and championship fights are normally five 5-minute rounds. Similar motivations produced the &quot;stand up&quot; rule, where the referee can stand fighters up if it is perceived that both are resting on the ground or not advancing toward a dominant position.

In the U.S., state athletic and boxing commissions have played a crucial role in the introduction of additional rules because they oversee MMA in a similar fashion to boxing. In Japan and most of Europe, there is no regulating authority over competitions, so these organizations have greater freedom in rule development and event structure.

Previously, Japan-based organization Pride Fighting Championships held an opening 10-minute round followed by two five-minute rounds. Stomps, soccer kicks and knees to the head of a grounded opponent are legal, but elbow strikes to the head are not. This rule set is more predominant in the Asian-based organizations as opposed to European and American rules. More recently, Singapore-based organization ONE Championship allows soccer kicks and knees to the head of a grounded opponent as well as elbow strikes to the head, but does not allow head stomps. In 2016, ONE later banned soccer kicks. However, they still allow knees to the head of a grounded opponent. In 2024, the Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports Mixed Martial Arts Committee made changes to the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, loosening the rules surrounding what a grounded opponent is, meaning fighters are now more vulnerable to kicks and knees to the head, and they also eliminated the rules prohibiting &quot;12 to 6&quot; elbows.

===Victory===

Victory in a match is normally gained either by the judges&#x27; decision after an allotted amount of time has elapsed, a stoppage by the referee (for example if a competitor cannot defend themselves intelligently) or the fight doctor (due to an injury), a submission, by a competitor&#x27;s cornerman throwing in the towel, or by knockout.

====Knockout (KO)====
As soon as a fighter is unable to continue due to legal strikes, his opponent is declared the winner. As MMA rules allow submissions and ground and pound, the fight is stopped to prevent further injury to the fighter.

====Technical knockout (TKO)====
Referee stoppage: The referee may stop a match in progress if:
* a fighter becomes dominant to the point where the opponent cannot intelligently defend themselves and is taking excessive damage as a result.
* a fighter appears to be losing consciousness as he/she is being struck.
* a fighter appears to have a significant injury such as a cut or a broken bone.
Doctor stoppage/cut: The referee will call for a time out if a fighter&#x27;s ability to continue is in question as a result of apparent injuries, such as a large cut. The ring doctor will inspect the fighter and stop the match if the fighter is deemed unable to continue safely, rendering the opponent the winner. However, if the match is stopped as a result of an injury from illegal actions by the opponent, either a disqualification or no contest will be issued instead.

Corner stoppage: A fighter&#x27;s corner may announce defeat on the fighter&#x27;s behalf by throwing in the towel during the match in progress or between rounds. This is normally done when a fighter is being beaten to the point where it is dangerous and unnecessary to continue. In some cases, the fighter may be injured.

Retirement: A fighter is so dazed or exhausted that he/she cannot physically continue fighting. Usually occurs between rounds.

====Submission====
A fighter may admit defeat during a match by:
* A physical tap on the opponent&#x27;s body or mat/floor.
* Tapping verbally.

Technical Submission: the referee stops the match when the fighter is caught in a submission hold and is in danger of being injured. This can occur when a fighter is choked unconscious, or when a bone has been broken in a submission hold (a broken arm due to a kimura, etc.).

====Decision====
If the match goes the distance, then the outcome of the bout is determined by three judges. The judging criteria are organization-specific.

Technical decision: in the unified rules of MMA, if a fighter is unable to continue due to an accidental illegal technique late in the fight, a technical decision is rendered by the judges based on who is ahead on the judges&#x27; scorecards at that time. In a three-round fight, two rounds must be completed for a technical decision to be awarded and in a five-round fight, three rounds must be completed.

====Other conditions====
Forfeit: a fighter or their representative may forfeit a match prior to the beginning of the match, thereby losing the match.

Disqualification: a &quot;warning&quot; will be given when a fighter commits a foul or illegal action or does not follow the referee&#x27;s instruction. Three warnings will result in a disqualification. Moreover, if a fighter is unable to continue due to a deliberate illegal technique from his opponent, the opponent will be disqualified.

No contest: in the event that both fighters commit a violation of the rules, or a fighter is unable to continue due to an injury from an accidental illegal technique, the match will be declared a &quot;no contest&quot;, except in the case of a technical decision in the unified rules. A result can also be overturned to a no contest if the fighter that was originally victorious fails a post fight drug test for banned substances.

===Clothing===
Mixed martial arts promotions typically require that male fighters wear shorts in addition to being barechested, thus precluding the use of gi or fighting kimono to inhibit or assist submission holds. Male fighters are required by most athletic commissions to wear groin protectors underneath their trunks. Female fighters wear short shorts and sports bras or other similarly snug-fitting tops. Both male and female fighters are required to wear a mouthguard.

The need for flexibility in the legs combined with durability prompted the creation of various fighting shorts brands, which then spawned a range of mixed martial arts clothing and casual wear available to the public.

===Fighting area===
According to the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, an MMA competition or exhibition may be held in a ring or a fenced area. The fenced area can be round or have at least six sides. Cages vary: some replace the metal fencing with a net, others have a different shape from an octagon, as the term &quot;The Octagon&quot; is trademarked by the UFC (although the 8-sided shape itself is not trademarked). The fenced area is called a cage generically, or a hexagon, an octagon or an octagon cage, depending on the shape.

==Common disciplines==

Most &#x27;traditional&#x27; martial arts have a specific focus and these arts may be trained to improve in that area. Popular disciplines of each type include:
* Stand-up: boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, karate, taekwondo, capoeira, combat sambo, savate and sanda are trained to improve stand-up striking.
* Clinch: judo, freestyle wrestling, folkstyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, catch wrestling, sanda and sambo are trained to improve clinching, takedowns and throws, while Muay Thai is trained to improve the striking aspect of the clinch.
* Ground: Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, sambo, folkstyle wrestling, freestyle wrestling, catch wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling and luta livre are trained to improve ground control and position, as well as to achieve submission holds, and defend against them.

Most styles have been adapted from their traditional forms, such as boxing stances, which lack effective counters to leg kicks, the Muay Thai stance, which is poor for defending against takedowns due to its static nature and a light front leg, and judo or Brazilian jiu-jitsu techniques, which must be adapted for no-gi competition and susceptibility to strikes. It is common for a fighter to train with multiple coaches of different styles or an organized fight team to improve various aspects of their game at once. Cardiovascular conditioning, speed drills, strength training and flexibility are also important aspects of a fighter&#x27;s training. Some schools advertise their styles as simply &quot;mixed martial arts&quot;, which has become a style in itself, but the training will still often be split into different sections.

While mixed martial arts was initially practiced almost exclusively by competitive fighters, this is no longer the case. As the sport has become more mainstream and more widely taught, it has become accessible to wider range of practitioners of all ages. Proponents of this sort of training argue that it is safe for anyone, of any age, with varying levels of competitiveness and fitness.

===Brazilian jiu-jitsu===
Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is a form of submission grappling. It came to international prominence in the martial arts community in the early 1990s, when BJJ expert Royce Gracie won the first, second, and fourth Ultimate Fighting Championships, which at the time were single-elimination martial arts tournaments. Royce often fought successfully against larger opponents who practiced other styles, including boxing, wrestling, shoot-fighting, karate, and taekwondo. It has since become a staple art and key component for many MMA fighters. BJJ is largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting. BJJ is primarily a ground-based fighting style that applies close range grappling techniques and uses joint locks and chokeholds to submit the adversary. But standup techniques can also be used such as throws, holds, and strikes.

Some notable fighters who are known for using BJJ skills include: Alexandre Pantoja, Amanda Nunes, Anderson Silva, Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira, Charles Oliveira, Cris Cyborg, Deiveson Figueiredo, Demian Maia, Fabrício Werdum, Glover Teixeira, José Aldo, Junior dos Santos, Lyoto Machida, Maurício &#x27;Shogun&#x27; Rua, Rafael dos Anjos, Ricardo Arona, Ronaldo Souza, Vitor Belfort, Wanderlei Silva, Mackenzie Dern, Aljamain Sterling, B.J. Penn, Brian Ortega, Brandon Moreno, Chael Sonnen, Demetrious Johnson, Frank Mir, Georges St-Pierre, José Alberto Quiñónez, Gerald Meerschaert, Ilia Topuria, Jim Miller, Nate Diaz, Gabriel Benítez, Tom Aspinall, and Tony Ferguson.

===Wrestling===
Wrestling (including freestyle, Greco-Roman and American folkstyle) gained tremendous respect due to its effectiveness in mixed martial arts competitions. It is widely studied by mixed martial artists as Wrestling allows competitors to control where the match will go: superior wrestlers can dominate the Clinch and take their opponents into the ground with its excellent takedowns, particularly against the legs, where they will transition into groundfighting and can either get a superior top position and start striking their opponent (a tactic known as G&quot;round-and-Pound&quot;) or start grappling for submissions. While wrestlers with stronger striking base can use defensive wrestling to defend takedowns maintain the fight in the feet where they use their superior striking, a tactic known as &quot;&quot;Sprawl&quot;&quot;-and-Brawl&quot;&quot;, or use wrestling to escape submission attempts. It is also credited for conferring an emphasis on conditioning for explosive movement and stamina, both of which are critical in competitive mixed martial arts.
There are multiple wrestling styles around the world which MMA fighters have as their base. American fighters are usually trained in folkstyle wrestling, the style competed in high school and college competitions. Many American champions were former NCAA Division I Wrestling Champions, such as Kevin Randleman and Mark Kerr. While fighters from around the world train primarily in &quot;international&quot; Olympic styles such as Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestling. Some former wrestlers who competed in the Olympics have joined MMA competition, such as Daniel Cormier, Dan Henderson, Ben Askren, silver medalists Matt Lindland and Yoel Romero, and gold medalist Henry Cejudo. Some fighters have also come from local Folk wrestling backgrounds, UFC flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo is trained at &quot;Luta Marajoara&quot;, a folk wrestling style from Marajó island.
Notable wrestlers who were MMA competitors include: Khabib Nurmagomedov, Jon Jones, Chael Sonnen, Georges St-Pierre, Cain Velasquez, Randy Couture, Brock Lesnar, Mark Coleman, Frankie Edgar, Colby Covington, Kamaru Usman, Justin Gaethje, Chris Weidman, Daniel Cormier, Dan Henderson, Tito Ortiz, Khamzat Chimaev, Ilia Topuria, Tyron Woodley, Yoel Romero, Deiveson Figueiredo, Michael Chandler and Henry Cejudo.

====Greco-Roman====
Greco-Roman wrestling is one of two styles of wrestling contested at the Olympic Games, the other being Freestyle. Greco-Roman wrestling only allows for holds above the waist and has a strong emphasis on clinch fighting. Due to the difficulty to achieve takedowns when one is not allowed to attack the legs, Greco-Roman is not utilized in MMA as often as styles that do allow fighters to attack the legs, such as Freestyle and Catch. Despite this, there have been fighters who come from a background in Greco-Roman wrestling. Notable examples are Randy Couture, Dan Henderson, Mark Madsen, Matt Lindland (all four were Olympic wrestlers or Olympic alternates), Jon Jones, Dan Severn, Ilia Topuria, Alexander Volkanovski, Magomed Ankalaev and Sergei Pavlovich.

====Catch-as-catch-can====
Catch wrestling is the ancestor of freestyle wrestling and includes submissions which are prohibited in freestyle wrestling. Widely popular around the world during the 19th and 20th centuries, catch wrestling underwent a decline as its amateur-side became olympic freestyle wrestling, while the professional side became modern professional wrestling. Catch survived in Japanese &quot;Puroresu&quot;-style Pro Wrestling, where wrestlers such as Antonio Inoki and Karl Gotch promoted &quot;strong style pro wrestling&quot;, that while worked, had realistic and full contact moves, resulting in the creation of the Universal Wrestling Federation and Shoot wrestling (which in their own turn would inspire the creation of legit proto-MMA shootfighting organizations such as Shooto and Pancrase). Many pro wrestlers that trained in shoot-style would later compete in MMA, which led to resurgence of Catch with the advent of mixed martial arts in the 90s. The term &quot;no holds barred&quot; was used originally to describe the wrestling method prevalent in catch wrestling tournaments during the late 19th century wherein no wrestling holds were banned from the competition, regardless of how dangerous they might be. The term was applied to mixed martial arts matches, especially at the advent of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

A lot of MMA fighters train in catch wrestling as their sole grappling style or as a complement to Brazilian jiu-jitsu, as it teaches techniques and tactics not found in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Notable MMA fighters who use catch wrestling as their primary grappling style include: Josh Barnett, Ken Shamrock, Frank Shamrock, Bas Rutten, Kazushi Sakuraba, Erik Paulson, Bobby Lashley, Minoru Suzuki, Masakatsu Funaki, Rumina Sato, Masakazu Imanari, Muhammad Mokaev and Paul Sass.

===Kickboxing===
Kickboxing, along with boxing, are recognised as a foundation for striking in mixed martial arts, and are both widely practiced and taught. Each has different techniques. kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat martial arts based on kicking and punching. The modern style originated in Japan, developed from Karate, and had additional development in the Netherlands and the United States. Different governing bodies apply different rules, such as allowing the use of elbows, knees, clinching or throws, etc. Notable fighters include Alex Pereira, Joanna Jędrzejczyk, Zhang Weili, Edson Barboza, Darren Till, Anderson Silva, José Aldo, Charles Oliveira, Mauricio Rua, Wanderlei Silva, Ciryl Gane, Donald Cerrone, Jiří Procházka Cris Cyborg, Stephen Thompson, Mirko Cro Cop, Alistair Overeem, Israel Adesanya, Sean O&#x27;Malley, Michael Page, Yair Rodríguez, Cory Sandhagen, Alexander Volkanovski, Volkan Oezdemir, Dricus Du Plessis and Leon Edwards.

===Boxing===
Boxing is a combat form that is widely used in MMA and is one of the primary striking bases for many fighters. Boxing punches account for the vast majority of strikes during the stand up portion of a bout and also account for the largest number of significant strikes, knock downs and KOs in MMA matches. Several aspects of boxing are extremely valuable such as footwork, combinations, and defensive techniques such as slips, head movement and stance (including chin protection and keeping hands up) commonly known as the Guard position. Boxing-based fighters have also been shown to throw and land a higher volume of strikes when compared with other striking bases, at a rate of 3.88 per minute with 9.64 per minute thrown (compared with Muay Thai at 3.46 and 7.50, respectively). Fighters known for using boxing include: Petr Yan, Dustin Poirier, Conor McGregor, Max Holloway, Erik Pérez, Calvin Kattar, Sean Strickland, Cain Velasquez, Nick Diaz, Glover Teixeira, José Aldo, Ilia Topuria, Junior dos Santos, B.J. Penn, Dan Hardy, Shane Carwin, Jack Della Maddalena, Francis Ngannou, Alexander Gustafsson, Gabriel Benítez, Jamahal Hill, Justin Gaethje and Andrei Arlovski.

===Luta Livre===
Luta Livre (also referred to Luta Livre &quot;Brasileira&quot;, &quot;Submission&quot; or &quot;Esportiva&quot;) is a Brazilian submission wrestling style, developed in Brazil in the 1920s by catch wrestling practitioner Euclydes &quot;Tatu&quot; Hatem, including techniques from catch wrestling, judo, wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Luta livre is divided in the categories of &quot;esportiva&quot;, which is a form of submission grappling, differentiating from no-gi BJJ with its focus on quick and energetic submissions, and &quot;vale tudo&quot;, which includes strikes both standing up and on the ground in addition to grappling and submissions. Luta livre was important to the development of mixed martial arts, as rivalry between jiu-jitsu and luta livre fueled the vale tudo scene. However, the success of Brazilian jiu-jitsu over luta livre practitioners, especially after the &quot;Desafio: Jiu Jitsu vs Luta Livre&quot; event in 1991 (which was broadcast live by Rede Globo), resulted in the style waning in popularity, although it seems to be making a resurgence, especially as an alternative to both Brazilian jiu-jitsu and catch wrestling. Some notable luta livre practitioners in MMA include: Marco Ruas, Eugenio Tadeu, José Aldo, Renato Sobral, Pedro Rizzo, Alexandre Franca Nogueira, Terry Etim, Jesus Pinedo and Darren Till.
===Judo===
Judo is a Japanese grappling martial art which has both &quot;ne-waza&quot; (ground grappling) and &quot;tachi-waza&quot; (standing grappling), several judo practitioners have competed in mixed martial arts matches. They use their knowledge in judo for clinching and for doing explosive and fast takedowns which quickly transition into submission holds in the ground. However, judo is traditionally and exclusively trained using the judogi, as such, many techniques and strategies from judo can not be translated into MMA. Fighters who hold a black belt in judo include Fedor Emelianenko, Marco Ruas, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Islam Makhachev, Ian Garry, Dong Hyun Kim, Cub Swanson, Don Frye, Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira, Fabricio Werdum, Vitor Belfort, Benoît Saint-Denis, Merab Dvalishvili, Reinier de Ridder and Olympian judokas Ronda Rousey, Hector Lombard, Rick Hawn and Hidehiko Yoshida. Former WEC middleweight champion Paulo Filho has credited judo for his success in an interview.

===Sambo===
Sambo is a Russian martial art, combat sport and self-defense system. It is a mixture of judo and freestyle wrestling using a keikogi known as kurtka. Sambo focuses on throwing, takedowns, grappling, and includes submissions from judo and catch wrestling. Sports sambo is characterized as a grappling style focused in pinning and in explosive takedowns which can be quickly transitioned into devastating leglocks. Sambo also has a modality known as &quot;combat sambo&quot;, which adds punches, kicks, elbows and knees, making it a proto-MMA hybrid fighting style. Sambo is popular in Russia and eastern Europe, where it is taught as a complement to judo and wrestling training, Sambo also provides a good base for MMA with all-around skills for combining grappling and striking. Some notable Sambo fighters that transitioned into MMA include: Fedor Emelianenko, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Islam Makhachev, Igor Vovchanchyn, Oleg Taktarov, Andrei Arlovski, Yaroslav Amosov, and Shavkat Rakhmonov.

===Karate===
Karate is a striking-based Japanese with Okinawan origins martial art using punches, kicks, sometimes elbows, knees and even limited grappling. It is divided in various schools and styles, which distinguishes techniques, training methods, among other things. Some styles, especially Kyokushin and other full contact styles, has proven to be effective in MMA as it is one of the core foundations of kickboxing, and specializes in striking techniques. Karate from all styles has also been a common base, with many getting introduced to martial arts and combat sports by training Karate in their youth. Various styles of karate are practiced by some MMA fighters, notably Stephen Chuck Liddell, Bas Rutten, Lyoto Machida, Stephen Thompson, John Makdessi, Uriah Hall, Erik Pérez, Ryan Jimmo, Georges St-Pierre, Kyoji Horiguchi, Giga Chikadze, Robert Whittaker, Henry Cejudo, and Louis Gaudinot. Liddell is known to have an extensive striking background in Kenpō with Fabio Martella. Lyoto Machida practices Shotokan Ryu, and St-Pierre practices Kyokushin.

===Wushu Sanda===
Sanda, or Sanshou, is one of the two disciplines of sport &quot;wushu&quot;. It is a modernized and full contact version of &quot;wushu&quot;, created in the late 20th century as a condensation of traditional Chinese kung fu techniques to be used in a full contact competition environment. It is a kickboxing style which has punching, kicking, some use of elbows and knee strikes—similar to Kickboxing or Muay Thai— but it has the distinction of allowing a range of takedowns, throws and sweeps, similar to judo and wrestling.

They can be highly effective in competition due to their mixture of striking and takedowns, which can be easily synthesized with the rest of MMA training, such as groundfighting. It is prominently used by fighters from China, but it has found a following amongst many fighters around the world. Chief amongst these fighters is Cung Le, who is most notable for his TKO and KO victories over former UFC champions Frank Shamrock and Rich Franklin, and UFC strawweight champion Zhang Weili, the first Chinese champion in the UFC. Other wushu sanshou based fighters who have entered MMA include Michael Page, Song Yadong, K. J. Noons, Pat Barry, Zhang Tiequan, Muslim Salihov, and Zabit Magomedsharipov.

===Taekwondo===
Taekwondo is a Korean martial art, emerging in the 1950s as a mixture between Japanese Karate, traditional Korean martial arts and some Chinese kung fu. It is a striking-based style with heavy focus on various styles of kicking, such as head-height kicks, spinning jump kicks, and fast kicking techniques. Several accomplished MMA fighters have an extensive background in taekwondo, and many were introduced to martial arts through it. Some fighters who use taekwondo techniques in MMA are former UFC lightweight champion and WEC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis, who is 3rd dan black belt as well as an instructor, Benson Henderson, Yair Rodriguez, Marco Ruas and former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, who is a 5th dan black belt.

In his instructional book, Anderson Silva admitted the influence of taekwondo in the formation of his unique style. &quot;In each of my fights, I tried to utilize techniques from all the various styles I had studied. I threw taekwondo kicks. I threw Muay Thai knees and elbows, and I used my knowledge of Brazilian jiu-jitsu on the ground.&quot; Anthony Pettis has also stated that he is &quot;definitely a traditional martial artist first and a mixed martial artist second&quot;, as well as his &quot;style of attacking is different [because of his] taekwondo background&quot;.

Other notable fighters who have a base in Taekwondo or are known for using their Taekwondo skills while fighting include Edson Barboza, Valentina Shevchenko, Benson Henderson, Yair Rodriguez, Anthony Pettis, Mirko Cro Cop, Cory Sandhagen, Israel Adesanya and Conor McGregor.

===Capoeira===
Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian art form that incorporates elements of martial arts, games, music, and dance. Capoeira is often practiced as a form of dancing and game, but its origins lie as a concealed style of self-defense and combat, and can be used as such. It uses a style of fighting with quick and complex maneuvers, which use power, speed, and leverage across a wide variety of kicks, spins and techniques. Pure Capoeira is difficult to use in MMA due its complexity, but many fighters incorporated individual techniques into their reportoire. Additionally, Capoeira has an importance to MMA history, as many capoeiristas participated in Vale Tudo challenges in Brazil against practitioners of other martial arts, in particular with a rivalry with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In 1995 at the &quot;Desafio Internacional de Vale Tudo&quot; event, Capoeirista Mestre Hulk defeated two-time BJJ world champion Amaury Bitetti using Capoeira techniques in an underdog victory.

Some fighters which have trained Capoeira and incorporated techniques include Anderson Silva, Conor McGregor, Deiveson Figueiredo, Thiago Santos, Marco Ruas and Michel Pereira.

===Savate===

Although not as common as other disciplines, some fighters have used Savate effectively in MMA. Savate restricts the use of shins and knees, allowing only foot kicks. It focuses on kicking more than punching, and its kicks are characteristically very fast, mobile and flexible. It also possesses a complex and evasive footwork. However, because Savatuers train wearing shoes, adjustments have to be made to how they throw kicks in MMA. Notable Savate fighters include Karl Amoussou, Gerard Gordeau, Cheick Kongo, and former Bellator Light Heavyweight Champion Christian M&#x27;Pumbu.

==Basic strategies==

The techniques utilized in mixed martial arts competition generally fall into two categories: striking techniques (such as kicks, knees, punches and elbows) and grappling techniques (such as clinch holds, pinning holds, submission holds, sweeps, takedowns and throws).

Today, mixed martial artists must cross-train in a variety of styles to counter their opponent&#x27;s strengths and remain effective in all the phases of combat.

===Sprawl-and-Brawl===

Sprawl-and-Brawl is a stand-up fighting tactic that consists of effective stand-up striking while avoiding ground fighting typically by using sprawls to defend against takedowns or throws.

A Sprawl-and-Brawler is usually a boxer, kickboxer, or karateka who has trained in various styles of wrestling, judo, and/or sambo to avoid takedowns to keep the fight standing. This is a form which is heavily practiced in the amateur leagues.

These fighters will often study submission grappling to avoid being forced into submission should they find themselves on the ground. This style can be deceptively different from traditional kickboxing styles, since sprawl-and-brawlers must adapt their techniques to incorporate takedown and ground fighting defense. A few notable examples are Igor Vovchanchyn, Mirko Filipović, Chuck Liddell, Mark Hunt and more recently Alex Pereira, Francis Ngannou, Junior dos Santos, Justin Gaethje, Andrei Arlovski, and Joanna Jędrzejczyk.
===Ground-and-pound===

Ground-and-pound is a strategy consisting of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw, obtaining a top, or dominant grappling position, and then striking the opponent repeatedly, primarily with fists, hammerfists, and elbows. Ground-and-pound is also used as a precursor to attempting submission holds.

The style is used by fighters well-versed in submission defense and skilled at takedowns. They take the fight to the ground, maintain a grappling position, and strike until their opponent submits or is knocked out. Although not a traditional style of striking, the effectiveness and reliability of ground-and-pound has made it a popular tactic. It was first demonstrated as an effective technique by Mark Coleman, then popularized by fighters such as Chael Sonnen, Glover Teixeira, Don Frye, Frank Trigg, Jon Jones, Cheick Kongo, Mark Kerr, Frank Shamrock, Tito Ortiz, Matt Hughes, Daniel Cormier, Chris Weidman, and Khabib Nurmagomedov.

While most fighters use ground-and-pound statically, by way of holding their opponents down and hitting them with short strikes from the top position, a few fighters manage to utilize it dynamically by striking their opponents while changing positions, thus not allowing their opponents to settle once they take them down. Cain Velasquez is one of the most devastating ground strikers in MMA and is known for continuing to strike his opponents on the ground while transitioning between positions. Fedor Emelianenko, considered among the greatest masters of ground-and-pound in MMA history, was the first to demonstrate this dynamic style of striking in transition. He was striking his opponents on the ground while passing guard, or while his opponents were attempting to recover guard.

In the year 2000, MMA play-by-play commentator Stephen Quadros coined the popular phrase &quot;lay and pray&quot;. This refers to a situation where a wrestler or grappler keeps another fighter pinned or controlled on the mat, throwing light strikes to avoid a stand up, yet exhibit little urgency to finish the grounded opponent with a knockout or a submission for the majority or entirety of the fight, looking for a decision win through high control time. The implication of &quot;lay and pray&quot; is that after the wrestler/grappler takes the striker down and &#x27;lays&#x27; on them to neutralize the opponent&#x27;s striking weapons, they &#x27;prays&#x27; that the referee does not return them to the standing position. This style is considered by many fans as the most boring style of fighting and is highly criticized for intentionally creating non-action, yet it is effective. Some argue that &#x27;lay-and-pray&#x27; is justified and that it is the responsibility of the downed fighter to be able to protect themselves from this legitimate technique. Former UFC Welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre has been criticized by fans for playing it safe and applying the lay-and-pray tactic in his fights, as has former Bellator MMA Welterweight champion Ben Askren, who justified the tactic, explaining that championship fights are much harder, as they are five rounds long compared with the usual three.
===Submission-seeking===
Submission-seeking is a reference to the strategy of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw and then applying a submission hold, forcing the opponent to submit. While grapplers will often work to attain dominant position, some may be more comfortable fighting from other positions (ex. fighters pulling guard). It enable fighters to force opponents into submission through joint locks or chokes. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) plays a significant role in MMA submission grappling, with techniques such as armbars, triangles, rear-naked chokes, guillotines, and kimuras being commonly utilized.

If a grappler finds themselves unable to force a takedown, they may resort to &quot;pulling guard&quot;, whereby they voluntarily pull their opponent into a dominant position on the ground. This was one of the first fighting styles that had shown success, popularized by BJJ exponent Royce Gracie during early UFC events. 
Submissions are an essential part of many disciplines, most notably Brazilian jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling, judo, sambo, luta livre and shoot wrestling. Submission-based styles were popularized in the early UFC events by Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, and were the dominant tactic in the early UFCs. Modern proponents of the submission-seeking style, such as Demian Maia, Ronaldo Souza, Charles Oliveira, Ryan Hall, Marcin Held, and Paul Craig tend to come from a Brazilian jiu-jitsu background.

===Clinch-fighting===
Clinch-Fighting is a tactic consisting of using a clinch hold to prevent the opponent from moving away into more distant striking range, while also attempting takedowns or throws and striking the opponent using knees, stomps, elbows, and punches. The clinch is often utilized by wrestlers and judokas that have added components of the striking game (typically boxing), and Muay Thai fighters.

Ken Shamrock was known for his impressive clinch work when he submitted Dan Severn with a standing guillotine choke at UFC 6.

Wrestlers and judoka may use clinch fighting as a way to neutralize the superior striking skills of a stand-up fighter to prevent takedowns or throws by a superior ground fighter. Ronda Rousey, with her judo background, is considered a master at initiating throws from the clinch to set up armbars.

The clinch or &quot;plum&quot; of a Muay Thai fighter is often used to improve the accuracy of knees and elbows by physically controlling the position of the opponent. Anderson Silva is well known for his devastating Muay Thai clinch. He defeated UFC middle weight champion Rich Franklin using the Muay Thai clinch and kneeing Franklin repeatedly to the body and face—breaking Franklin&#x27;s nose. In their rematch Silva repeated this and won again.

Other fighters may use the clinch to push their opponent against the cage or ropes, where they can effectively control their opponent&#x27;s movement and restrict mobility while striking them with punches to the body or stomps also known as &quot;dirty boxing&quot; or &quot;Wall and Maul&quot;. Randy Couture used his Greco-Roman wrestling background to popularize this style en route to six title reigns in the UFC.

===Score-oriented fighting===
Score-oriented fighting is a style that is based around trying to win through outscoring their opponent and winning a decision. Usually fighters who adopt this strategy use takedowns only for scoring, allowing the adversary to stand up and continue the fight. They also want to land clear strikes and control the octagon. In order to win the fight by decision, all score oriented fighters have to have strong defensive techniques and avoid takedowns.

In general, fighters who cannot win fights through lightning offense, or are more suited to win fights in the later rounds or via decision are commonly known as &quot;grinders&quot;. Grinders aim to shut down their opponent&#x27;s game plan and chip away at them via light strikes, clinching, smothering and ground-and-pound for most of the rounds. Prominent examples of grinders are Sean Strickland, who has a very defensive and stand-up striking focused style, and Merab Dvalishvili who has a very aggressive, wrestling focused style.

==Women&#x27;s mixed martial arts==
While mixed martial arts is primarily a male dominated sport, it does have female athletes. Female competition in Japan includes promotions such as the all-female Valkyrie, and Jewels (formerly known as Smackgirl). However historically, there has been only a select few major professional mixed martial arts organizations in the United States that invite women to compete. Among those are the UFC, Strikeforce, Bellator Fighting Championships, the all female Invicta Fighting Championships, and the now defunct EliteXC.

There has been a growing awareness of women in mixed martial arts due to popular female fighters and personalities such as Ronda Rousey, Megumi Fujii, Miesha Tate, Cristiane Santos, Joanna Jędrzejczyk, Holly Holm, Alexa Grasso and Gina Carano among others.

===History===
In Japan, female competition has been documented since the mid-1990s. Influenced by female professional wrestling and kickboxing, the Smackgirl competition was formed in 2001 and became the only major all-female promotion in mixed martial arts. Other early successful Japanese female organizations included Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling, ReMix (a predecessor to Smackgirl), U-Top Tournament, K-Grace, and AX.

Aside from all-female organizations, most major Japanese male dominated promotions have held select female competitions. These have included DEEP, MARS, Gladiator, HEAT, Cage Force, K-1, Sengoku, Shooto (under the name G-Shooto), and Pancrase (under the name Pancrase Athena).

In the United States, prior to the success of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; reality show that launched mixed martial arts into the mainstream media, there was no major coverage of female competitions. Some early organizations who invited women to compete included, International Fighting Championships, SuperBrawl, King of the Cage, Rage in the Cage, Ring of Combat, Bas Rutten Invitational, and HOOKnSHOOT. From the mid-2000s, more coverage came when organizations such as Strikeforce, EliteXC, Bellator Fighting Championships, and Shark Fights invited women to compete.

Outside Japan and the United States, female competition is almost exclusively found in minor local promotions. However, in Europe some major organizations have held select female competitions, including It&#x27;s Showtime, Shooto Europe, Cage Warriors, and M-1 Global.

Following Zuffa&#x27;s acquisition of Strikeforce in March 2011, the UFC began promoting women&#x27;s fights, with Ronda Rousey rapidly becoming one of the promotion&#x27;s biggest draws.

Controversy arose in 2013, when CFA (Championship Fighting Alliance) fighter Fallon Fox came out as a transgender woman. The case became a centerpiece of debates concerning whether it was fair to have a transgender woman compete against cisgender women in a contact sport. Neither the UFC nor Invicta FC says they will allow her to fight, and then-UFC Bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey said she would not fight her.

==Amateur mixed martial arts==
Amateur Mixed Martial Arts is the amateur version of the Mixed Martial Arts in which participants engage largely or entirely without remuneration. Under the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation (IMMAF) and World MMA Association (WMMAA), it is practiced within a safe and regulated environment which relies on a fair and objective scoring system and competition procedures similar to those in force in the professional Mixed Martial Arts rules.
Amateur MMA is practiced with board shorts and with approved protection gear that includes shin protectors, and amateur MMA gloves.

The International Mixed Martial Arts Federation and the World Mixed Martial Arts Association announced an amalgamation on April 11, 2018, uniting the two organizations behind one bid for Olympic sport recognition after being instructed by Global Association of International Sport Federations (GAISF). The WMMAA and the IMMAF signed a legally binding affiliation memorandum of understanding (MOU) in May 2018 and finalized the agreement by November 2018, along with the first unified world championships.

The Global Association of Mixed Martial Arts (GAMMA) was established in 2018 by former WMMAA and IMMAF federations and representatives. From 8 to 12 March 2024, mixed martial arts was included as a demonstration sport in the 2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana, under GAMMA. From 11 to 13 July 2024, GAMMA member federations participated in the 2nd Asian Mixed Martial Arts Championships organised by the Asian Mixed Martial Arts Association (AMMA) under the Olympic Council of Asia.

===World Mixed Martial Arts Association===
World Mixed Martial Arts Association (WMMAA) was founded in 2012 in Monaco by M-1 Global commercial promoters and is under the leadership of the General Secretary Alexander Endelgarth, President Finkelstein and Fedor Emelianenko. The World MMA Association was an organization that managed and developed mixed martial arts, establishing rules and procedures, hosting MMA competitions.

On October 20, 2013, the first World MMA Championship was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

By December 2013, WMMAA had 38 member states representing the sport and registered in accordance with national laws. By 2017, WMMAA had expanded to 83 members: Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Guatemala, Georgia, Greece, India, Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.

===International Mixed Martial Arts Federation===

On February 29, 2012, the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation (IMMAF) was set up to bring international structure, development and support to mixed martial arts worldwide. IMMAF launched with support of market leader, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The IMMAF is a non-profit, democratic federation organized according to international federation standards to ensure that MMA as a sport is allowed the same recognition, representation and rights as all other major sports. The IMMAF is registered under Swedish law and is founded on democratic principles, as outlined in their statutes. As of March 2015, there were 39 total members from 38 countries, which come from Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Ireland (Northern Ireland), Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Romania, The Seychelles, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The IMMAF held its first Amateur World Championships in Las Vegas, US, from June 30 to July 6, 2014.

===Global Association of Mixed Martial Arts (GAMMA)===

GAMMA was founded in 2018 as the international governing body for mixed martial arts, with the support of main sponsor ONE Championship. It aims are to achieve official international sport recognition for mixed martial arts, to develop the sport and its governance structures globally and promote its growth and benefits in communities worldwide. Its vision is Olympic Games inclusion. GAMMA is a non-profit organisation registered in the Netherlands with Alexander Engelhardt as president. GAMMA has 80 national federations as members across 5 continents and organises international, nations tournaments around the world under amateur MMA rules. In 2024, GAMMA achieved the inclusion of mixed martial arts as a demonstration discipline in the 2023 African Games in Accra.

==Safety==

Mixed Martial Arts competitions have changed dramatically since the first Ultimate Fighting
Championship in 1993, specifically with the inception of the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. There remains a paucity of data on injuries that occur in MMA, and resulting concerns with regard to MMA&#x27;s safety remain. A 2014 systematic review concluded that the injury incidence rate in MMA appears to be greater than in most, if not all, other popular and commonly practiced combat sports.

===Injury rates===
In a 2014 meta-analysis of the available injury data in MMA, the injury incidence rate was estimated to be 228.7 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures (one athlete-exposure is defined as one athlete participating in a single fight). The estimated injury incidence rate in MMA is greater than in other full-contact combat sports such as judo (44.0 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures), taekwondo (79.4 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures), amateur boxing (77.7 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures), and professional boxing (118.0–250.6 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures).

===Injury pattern===
In general, the injury pattern in MMA is very similar to that in professional boxing but unlike that found in other combat sports such as judo and taekwondo. The most commonly injured body region is the head (66.8% to 78.0% of reported injuries) followed by the wrist/hand (6.0% to 12.0% of reported injuries), while the most frequent types of injury were laceration (36.7% to 59.4% of reported injuries), fracture (7.4% to 43.3% of reported injuries), and concussion (3.8% to 20.4% of reported injuries). The frequency of impact to the ear and low utilization of ear protection leads to a high frequency of perichondral hematoma that can lead to cauliflower ear.

===Brain injury and CTE===

The repeated head strikes received by MMA competitors causes frequent concussions and permanent brain damage. Also, the repeated head trauma in contact sports, especially combat sports, are directly related to a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This disease begins to develop during the life of the athlete, and continues to develop even after sports activity has ceased.

Because the disease is detected post-mortem, and MMA as a sport is relatively young, there are still few cases of CTE recognized in MMA, although there are more and more suspected and confirmed cases of CTE. In preliminary results reported in April 2012 as part of an ongoing study of a 109 professional boxers and MMA fighters being conducted by Charles Bernick and his colleagues at Cleveland Clinic&#x27;s Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, fighters with more than six years of ring experience were observed to have reductions in size in their hippocampus and thalamus, while fighters with more than twelve years of ring experience were observed to have both reductions in size and symptoms such as memory loss (the hippocampus and thalamus deal with memory and alertness). Bernick speculates that the cumulative damage over time from lesser blows may eventually prove an even more important topic of study than that of infrequent concussions.

In January 2021, veteran UFC fighter Spencer Fisher confirmed to MMA Fighting that he suffered from all the symptoms of CTE: &quot;I&#x27;m just beat up, and it&#x27;s just gotten worse, like all my injuries are catching up with me now, aside from the brain thing, which is the biggest one, because it adds, it adds the depression, and putting things, thoughts together and staying on track.&quot; Later, Dana White ruled on this: &quot;He&#x27;s not the first and he&#x27;s definitely not going to be the last. This is a contact sport and anybody who&#x27;s ever done this younger, myself included, is dealing with brain issues. It&#x27;s part of the gig.&quot; In late 2021, Rose Gracie, daughter of UFC founder Rorion Gracie, in an interview about CTE on the &quot;Trocação Franca&quot; podcast, called the lack of CTE awareness in MMA &#x27;criminal negligence&#x27;.

Although brain damage is common for MMA fighters, some, like Demetrious Johnson, managed to avoid it. Johnson participated in a long-term brain study from 2012 to 2023 by the Cleveland Clinic, where he underwent regular evaluations. Despite his 17-year MMA career, doctors concluded that his brain had not deteriorated at all. In fact, they found improvements in his cognitive abilities, including speech articulation and IQ. However, it is important to note that throughout his career, he only suffered one knockout and much less head trauma than other fighters.

===Fatalities===

There have been seven known deaths in MMA to date.
There were no documented cases of deaths after a sanctioned MMA event prior to 2007.

Since 2007, there have been six fatalities in mixed martial arts matches. The first was the death of Sam Vasquez on November 30, 2007. Vasquez collapsed shortly after being knocked out by Vince Libardi in the third round of an October 20, 2007, fight at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Vasquez had two separate surgeries to remove blood clots from his brain, and shortly after the second operation suffered a stroke and did not regain consciousness.

The second death stemming from a sanctioned mixed martial arts contest occurred in South Carolina on June 28, 2010, when 30-year-old Michael Kirkham was knocked out and never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead two days after the fight.

The third death on August 11, 2012, involved 30 year old Tyrone Mims, who was making his amateur MMA debut at &quot;Conflict MMA: Fight Night at the Point VI&quot; in South Carolina, making his the second MMA-related death in the state. After being TKO&#x27;d in the second round of the fight he became unresponsive and was taken to Medical University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead one hour later. No evidence of brain trauma or concussion was found and the initial autopsy has proved inconclusive. Coroner Rae Wooten explained that his death may probably have been from an irregular heartbeat caused by over exertion; however whether or not his death was a direct result of his fight remains a mystery.

On February 27, 2014, 29-year-old Booto Guylain was transported to Johannesburg General Hospital to be treated for swelling and bleeding on the brain after suffering a KO loss via elbow in the last round of his fight in South African promotion &quot;Extreme Fighting Championship Africa&quot;. He was unable to make a recovery, and after one week in the hospital he was pronounced dead.

On April 9, 2016, 28-year-old João Carvalho, died following a Total Extreme Fighting event at the National Stadium in Dublin (Ireland). The Portuguese fighter was beaten by technical knockout in a fight on 9 April 2016 against Charlie Ward, and fell ill twenty minutes after the fight. He was taken immediately to Beaumont hospital, where he underwent emergency brain surgery, but died two days later.

On July 15, 2017, after a TKO loss resulting from unanswered punches in the second round of his fight, 37 year old Donshay White became unresponsive and collapsed in his locker room and was rushed to the KentuckyOne Health Sts. Mary &amp; Elizabeth Hospital in Kentucky. He was soon pronounced dead and was revealed to be caused by hypertensive/atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

==Legality of professional competitions==
Professional MMA competitions enjoy different levels of legality in different countries. This is dependent on the laws of the specific state.

The International Mixed Martial Arts Federation attempts to provide an internationally recognised set of standards which will be universally adhered to. However, they have no basis in national law and are meant as advisement only. Whereby regulation exists, however, the likelihood of MMA being legally recognised as a legitimate sport is increased. This was the case with France who banned it as a sport in 2016, due to a lack of regulation, then unbanned it in 2020 after a French federation began regulating it.

<text>The yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), also known as the long-legged ant or Maldive ant, is a species of ant, thought to be native to West Africa or Asia. They have been accidentally introduced to numerous places in the world&#x27;s tropics.

The yellow crazy ant has colloquially been given the modifier &quot;crazy&quot; on account of the ant&#x27;s erratic movements when disturbed. Its long legs and antennae make it one of the largest invasive ant species in the world.

Like several other invasive ants, such as the red imported fire ant (&quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;), the big-headed ant (&quot;Pheidole megacephala&quot;), the little fire ant (&quot;Wasmannia auropunctata&quot;), and the Argentine ant (&quot;Linepithema humile&quot;), the yellow crazy ant is a &quot;tramp ant&quot;, a species that easily becomes established and dominant in new habitat due to traits such as aggression toward other ant species, little aggression toward members of its own species, efficient recruitment, and large colony size.

It is on a list of &quot;one hundred of the world&#x27;s worst invasive species&quot; formulated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having invaded ecosystems from Hawaii to the Seychelles, and formed supercolonies on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

In 2023, a scientific article postulated a unique reproductive cycle for &quot;A. gracilipes&quot;, suggesting that males are obligate chimeras.

==Physiology==
&quot;Anoplolepis gracilipes&quot; is a relatively large, yellow to orange ant with long legs, large eyes and extremely long antennal scapes.

Although &quot;A. gracilipes&quot; is the only invasive species in the genus &quot;Anoplolepis&quot;, there are several other genera for which it can be mistaken. Both &quot;Leptomyrmex&quot; and &quot;Oecophylla&quot; can be confused with &quot;Anoplolepis&quot; because of their similar sizes and very long limbs. &quot;Anoplolepis&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;Leptomyrmex&quot; by the presence of an acidopore, while &quot;Anoplolepis&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;Oecophylla&quot; by the more compact petiole. Although both of these genera occur in the Pacific, neither contain any invasive species.

Several species of invasive ants belonging to the genera &quot;Camponotus&quot; and &quot;Paratrechina&quot; can appear similar to &quot;A. gracilipes&quot;. Although several invasive species of &quot;Pheidole&quot; can also be slender-bodied with long legs and long antennal scapes, they can be separated from &quot;A. gracilipes&quot; by their two-segmented waists.

&quot;A. gracilipes&quot; is widespread across the tropics, and populations are especially dense in the Pacific region. The species is most infamous for causing the ecological &quot;meltdown&quot; of Christmas Island. Although widespread across the Pacific, &quot;A. gracilipes&quot; can cause significant damage to native biological diversity. Strong quarantine measures are encouraged to keep it from spreading to new localities.

==Geographical range and dispersal==
The yellow crazy ant&#x27;s natural habitats are the moist tropical lowlands of Southeast Asia, and surrounding areas and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It has been introduced into a wide range of tropical and subtropical environments including northern Australia, some of the Caribbean islands, some Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion, the Cocos Islands and the Christmas Islands) and some Pacific islands (New Caledonia, Hawaii, French Polynesia, Okinawa, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Johnston Atoll, and the Galapagos archipelago). The species has been known to occupy such agricultural systems as cinnamon, citrus, coffee and coconut plantations. Because yellow crazy ants have generalized nesting habits, they are able to disperse via trucks, boats and other forms of human transport.

Crazy ant colonies naturally disperse through &quot;budding&quot;, i.e. when mated queens and workers leave the nest to establish a new one, and only rarely through flight via female winged reproductive forms. Generally, colonies that disperse through budding have a lower rate of dispersal, requiring human intervention to reach distant areas. It has been recorded that &quot;A. gracilipes&quot; moves as much as a year in the Seychelles. A survey on Christmas Island, however, yielded an average spreading speed of per day, the equivalent of one kilometer (0.6 mile) per year.

==Diet==

&quot;A gracilipes&quot; has been described as a &quot;scavenging predator&quot; exhibiting a broad diet, a characteristic of many invasive species. It consumes a wide variety of foods, including grains, seeds, arthropods, and decaying matter such as vertebrate corpses. They have been reported to attack and dismember invertebrates such as small isopods, myriapods, molluscs, arachnids, land crabs, earthworms and insects.

Like all ants, &quot;A gracilipes&quot; requires a protein-rich food source for the queen to lay eggs and carbohydrates as energy for the workers. They get their carbohydrates from plant nectar and honeydew producing insects, especially scale insects, aphids, and other Sternorrhyncha. Studies indicate that crazy ants rely so much on scale insects that a scarcity of them can actually limit ant population growth.

==Reproduction==
Similar to other ants, the queen produces eggs which are fertilized by male sperm that are stored in sperm stores. When an egg is fertilized, there are three distinct events that can happen: (i) the resulting diploid organism develops into a queen if the egg is fertilized by an R sperm or (ii) into an infertile diploid worker if the egg is fertilized by a W sperm. However, a third outcome has been described in a 2023 scientific study: (iii) the egg is fertilized by a W sperm but the parental nuclei bypasses the fusion of the two gametes and divide separately within the same egg, leading to a haploid male that is chimeric with a portion of cells carrying the W genome and a portion of cells carrying the R genome. Interestingly, not all tissues have equal proportions of each cell line, with sperm cells mostly carrying the W genome and thus providing the W alleles with a fitness advantage. This is the first known case of obligate chimerism in animals.

==Mutualism==
Crazy ants obtain much of their food requirements from scale insects, which are plant pests that feed on sap of trees and release honeydew, a sugary liquid. Ants eat honeydew, and in return protect the scale insects from their enemies and spread them among trees, an example of mutualism. The honeydew not eaten by the ants drips onto the trees and encourages the growth of sooty mold over the leaves and stems. This gives plants an ugly black appearance and reduces their health and vigor.

The ants protect the insects by &quot;nannying&quot; the mobile crawler stages and protecting them against their natural enemies. Experiments have shown that this connection is so strong that, in environments where &quot;A. gracilipes&quot; was removed, the density of scale insects dropped by 67% within 11 weeks, and to zero after 12 months.

==In Australia==
In Australia, yellow crazy ants have been found at more than 30 sites in Queensland, and in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, where a large scattered population exists. A single New South Wales infestation was detected and eradicated, and, in Western Australia, yellow crazy ants have been intercepted in shipping freight arriving at Fremantle.

Queensland&#x27;s main infestation is in and around Wet Tropics of Queensland rainforest, a World Heritage Site. The Northern Territory infestation covers , an area larger than the Australian Capital Territory.

Climate modelling indicates yellow crazy ants could spread across northern Australia from Queensland to Western Australia, across much of Queensland and into coastal and inland parts of New South Wales. Areas with the most ideal habitat and climatic conditions, such as the Wet Tropics of Queensland rainforests, are likely to experience the highest impacts.

A costbenefit analysis by the Queensland government undertaken in 2012 found that yellow crazy ants could cost Australia&#x27;s economy over A$3 billion if the ants were not treated. This analysis did not take potential impacts on Australia&#x27;s biodiversity into account. The known impacts of crazy ants in tropical rainforests overseas may provide useful insights into these impacts, bearing in mind that the most significant impacts are associated with relatively small islands, such as Christmas Island.

==Impact on Christmas Island==
Crazy ants have had a profound impact on the biodiversity of Christmas Island.

The crazy ant has a significant destructive impact on the island&#x27;s ecosystem, killing and displacing crabs on the forest floor. The supercolonies also devastate crab numbers migrating to the coast. This has seen a rapid depletion in the number of land crabs — killing up to 20 million of them — which are vital to Christmas Island&#x27;s biodiversity; land crabs are a keystone species in the forest ecology: they dig burrows, turn over the soil, and fertilize it with their droppings.

Seedlings that were previously eaten by crabs started to grow and, as a result, changed the structure of the forest. Weeds have spread into the rainforest because there are no crabs to control them. One of the most noticeable changes in the forest is the increased numbers of the stinging tree &quot;Dendrocnide peltata&quot;, which now flourishes in many areas frequently visited by humans. The forest canopy also changed as the scale insects tended by yellow crazy ants multiplied and killed mature trees.

Christmas Island red crabs are completely wiped out in infested areas. Populations of other ground and canopy dwelling animals, such as reptiles and other leaf litter fauna, have also decreased. During crab migrations, many crabs move through areas infested with ants and are killed. Studies show that the ant has displaced an estimated 15–20 million crabs by occupying their burrows, killing and eating resident crabs, and using their burrows as nest sites. This factor has greatly depleted red crabs, and made their annual land migrations far more perilous.

Although crazy ants do not bite or sting, they spray formic acid as a defence mechanism and to subdue their prey. In areas of high ant density, the movement of a land crab disturbs the ants and, as a result, the ants instinctively spray formic acid as a form of defence. The high levels of formic acid at ground level eventually overwhelm the crabs, and they are usually blinded then eventually die from dehydration (while attempting to flush off the formic acid) and exhaustion. As the dead crabs decay, the protein becomes available to the ants.
Crazy ants kill fauna, but encourage scale insects. Increased densities of scale insects cause forest die back, and even the death of large forest trees. These changes create a cascade of negative impacts, including weed invasion, significantly altering the forest landscape.

===Supercolonies===
Christmas Island is a focal point for international control efforts. These supercolonies spread farther and cause more damage than single colonies, and they pose the single greatest known threat to the island&#x27;s biodiversity.

Staff from Christmas Island National Park have worked in recent years to keep ant numbers in check. With help from the Christmas Island Crazy Ant Scientific Advisory Panel and support from the Australian Government they are holding ground.

Another supercolony nearly devastated the bird fauna of Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The single massive colony was found to occupy nearly a quarter of the island, with up to 1,000 queens in a plot of land wide. The infestation is thought to have been eradicated.

===Control measures===
To reduce the impacts of crazy ants on red crabs and Christmas Island&#x27;s ecosystems the Parks Australia carried out a major aerial baiting program in 2009, to follow up the first aerial baiting conducted in 2002. The first step was conducting an extensive island-wide survey to determine the exact locations of the supercolonies. For several months, staff traversed the island surveying over 900 sites. The result was a map of crazy ant supercolonies and red crab burrow densities, together with other biodiversity data.

In September 2009, a helicopter was used to precisely bait crazy ant supercolonies, which covered of the island. A very low concentration of fipronil bait (0.1%) was used to control the ants. Monthly monitoring of these baited supercolony sites shows that crazy ant densities were reduced by 99%.

Park staff placed a high emphasis on minimising non-target impact of baiting. Food lures were dropped from a helicopter to attract robber crabs away from areas that were about to be baited. This technique, combined with the low concentration fipronil bait, proved to be highly successful with extremely low numbers of robber crabs and no red crabs known to be killed by the baiting.

While baiting has slowed the decline of the red crab, its effects on the crazy ant populations are only temporary, as escaping colonies invade the treated areas again, and it is expensive, requiring much man power. In an effort to find a better control, after research, Australian Parks in December 2016 imported &quot;Tachardiaephagus somervillei&quot;, a small () wasp and began breeding them for release. The wasp, which attacks only scale insects, is a voracious predator of what is believed to be one of the crazy ant&#x27;s largest source of honeydew on Christmas Island, the yellow lac scale insect.

Researchers from La Trobe University in Melbourne, funded by Parks Australia, began looking for biological controls in 2009. While the ants are omnivores, studies have shown honeydew is an important part of the diet of Christmas Island crazy ants. Samples of ants taken from colonies that are growing rapidly have more honeydew in their diet than when the colonies decline. Further, restricting access to honeydew, by binding trees where the scale insects feed, dramatically reduced the colony as ant activity on the ground fell by 95% in just four weeks. In the laboratory, colonies with limited sources of sugar were compared to colonies with access to abundant sugar. Those with abundant sugar had more fertile queens and lower death rates among workers. The workers were also more aggressive toward other ant species and explored their environments more. This is believed to show why the ants decline when deprived of access to scale insects in the field, and confirm reduced honeydew will greatly reduce the ants&#x27; ability to form super colonies.

While controlling the scale insect is expected to control the yellow crazy ant on Christmas Island, on mainland Australia it is thought this would not help. There are at least a dozen honeydew producing insects as well as extrafloral nectar from native acacia trees, all of which fuel yellow crazy ants.

Experts continue to call for a fully funded, long-term baiting program on mainland Australia.

<doc id="228350" wikidata="Q1509345" url="?curid=228350" title="Georgian Dublin">
<text>Georgian Dublin is a phrase used in terms of the history of Dublin that has two interwoven meanings:
# to describe a historic period in the development of the city of Dublin, Ireland, from 1714 (the beginning of the reign of King George I of Great Britain and of Ireland) to the death in 1830 of King George IV. During this period, the reign of the four Georges, hence the word &quot;Georgian&quot;, covers a particular and unified style, derived from Palladian Architecture, which was used in erecting public and private buildings
# to describe the modern day surviving buildings in Dublin erected in that period and which share that architectural style

Though, strictly speaking, Georgian architecture could only exist during the reigns of the four Georges, it had its antecedents prior to 1714 and its style of building continued to be erected after 1830, until replaced by later styles named after the then monarch, Queen Victoria, i.e. &quot;Victorian&quot;.

==Dublin&#x27;s development==
Dublin was for much of its existence a medieval city, marked by the existence of a particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King Charles II when the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Ormonde (later made Duke of Ormonde) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the River Liffey, as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin&#x27;s quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the &quot;frontages&quot; of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its quays lined by large three and four-storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the Four Courts, the Custom House (1707) and, later and grander, Custom House designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect James Gandon. For his initiative, Ormonde&#x27;s name is now given to one of the city quays.

It was, however, only one of a number of crucial developments. As the city grew in size, stature, population and wealth, two changes were needed. (1) The existing narrow street medieval city required major redevelopment, and (2) major new development of residential areas was required.

==Rebuilding Dublin&#x27;s core==
 A new body called the Wide Streets Commission was created to remodel the old medieval city. It created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones. On the north side of the city, a series of narrow streets were merged and widened enormously to create a new street, called &quot;Sackville Street&quot; (now called O&#x27;Connell Street). At its lower end, a new bridge (now called O&#x27;Connell Bridge) was erected, beyond which two new streets in the form of a &#x27;V&#x27; appeared, known as Westmoreland Street and D&#x27;Olier Street. Westmoreland Street in turn led to a renamed &quot;Hoggen Green&quot;, which became &quot;College Green&quot; because it faced unto Trinity College Dublin. The new Irish Houses of Parliament, designed by Edward Lovett Pearce, also faced onto College Green, while from College Green a new widened Dame Street led directly down to the medieval Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin, past Dublin Castle and the Royal Exchange, the latter a new building. The Castle began the process of rebuilding, turning it from a medieval castle to a Georgian palace.

===Contemporary impressions===
In 1764, John Bush, an English traveller, visited Dublin and had the following to say about the city:
:&quot; &quot;Dublin is a large, populous, and, for the greater part of it, well built city; not much ornamented, indeed, with grand or magnificent buildings, a few, however, there are, of which the college or university, the only one they have in the kingdom - the parliament houses - the king&#x27;s and the lying-in hospital, and Swift&#x27;s for lunatics - with the marquis of Kildare&#x27;s house are the principal. Their churches in general make but a very indifferent figure as to their architecture; and, what I was very much surprised at, are amazingly destitute of monumental ornament. The two houses of parliament are infinitely superior, in point of grandeur and magnificence, to those of Westminster. The house of lords is, perhaps, as elegant a room as any in Great-Britain or Ireland [..] The whole extent of the city of Dublin may be about one-third of London, including Westminster and Southwark, and one-fourth, at least, of the whole, from the accounts we received, has been built within these 40 years. Those parts of the town which have been added since that time are well built, and the streets in general well laid out, especially on the north side of the river; where the most considerable additions have been made within the term above mentioned.&quot;&quot; 

==18th-century property developers==
While the rebuilding by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century building booms in Dublin the eighteenth century developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity that came to be called Georgian Dublin.Initially developments were focused on the city&#x27;s north side. Among the earliest developments was &quot;Henrietta Street&quot;, a wide street lined on both sides by massive Georgian houses built on a palatial scale. At the top end of the street, a new James Gandon building, the &quot;King&#x27;s Inns&quot;, was erected between 1795 and 1816. In this building, barristers were (and continue to be) trained and earned their academic qualifications. Such was the prestige of the street that many of the most senior figures in Irish &#x27;establishment&#x27; society, peers of the realm, judges, barristers, bishops bought houses here. Under the anti-Catholic Penal Laws, Roman Catholics, though the overwhelming majority in Ireland, were harshly discriminated against, barred from holding property rights or from voting in parliamentary elections until 1793. Thus the houses of Georgian Dublin, particularly in the early phase before Catholic Emancipation was granted in 1829, were almost invariably owned by a small Church of Ireland Anglican elite, with Catholics only gaining admittance to the houses as skivvies and servants. Ultimately the north side was laid out centred on two major squares, &quot;Rutland Square&quot; (now called &quot;Parnell Square&quot; for Charles Stewart Parnell), at the top end of Sackville Street, and &quot;Mountjoy Square&quot;. Such was the prestige of the latter square that among its many prominent residents was the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. Many of the streets in the new areas were named after the property developers, often with developers commemorated both in their name and by their peerage should they have received one. Among the streets named after developers are &quot;Capel Street&quot;, &quot;Mountjoy Square&quot; and &quot;Aungier Street&quot;.

For the initial years of the Georgian era, the north side of the city was considered a far more respectable area to live. However, when the Earl of Kildare chose to move to a new large ducal palace built for him on what up to that point was seen as the &quot;inferior&quot; southside, he caused shock. When his Dublin townhouse, Kildare House (renamed Leinster House when he was made Duke of Leinster) was finished, it was by far the biggest aristocratic residence other than Dublin Castle, and it was greeted with envy.

The Earl had predicted that his move would be followed, and it was. Three new residential squares appeared on the southside, Merrion Square (facing his residence&#x27;s garden front), St Stephen&#x27;s Green and the smallest and last of Dublin&#x27;s five Georgian squares to be built, Fitzwilliam Square. Aristocrats, bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments, even though many of the developments, particularly in Fitzwilliam Square, were smaller and less impressive than the buildings in Henrietta Street. While the wealthier people lived in houses &quot;on&quot; the squares, those with lesser means and lesser titles lived in smaller, less grand but still impressive developments off the main squares, such as Upper and Lower Mount Street and Leeson Street.

Despite the rebuilding of Dublin during this time, sanitation continued to be an issue for the city. With the lack of sewers, the city continued to rely on cesspits. The period was also marked by overcrowding in cemeteries. In 1809, the Paving Board was established to erect lamps, clean and pave the streets, and install sewers.

==The Act of Union and Georgian Dublin==
Although the Irish Parliament was composed exclusively of representatives of the Anglo-Irish Ascendency, the established ruling minority Protestant community in Ireland, it did show significant sparks of independence, most notably the achievement of full legislative independence in 1782, where all the restrictions previously surrounding the powers of the new parliament in College Green, notably Poynings&#x27; Law were repealed. This period of legislative freedom however was short-lived.

In 1800, under pressure from the British Government of Mr. Pitt, in the wake of the rebellion of the last years of the century, which was aided and abetted by the French invasion in support of the rebels Dublin Castle administration of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland both the House of Commons and the House of Lords passed the Irish Act of Union, uniting both the Kingdom of Ireland and its parliament with the Kingdom of Great Britain and its parliament in London. As a result, from 1 January 1801 Dublin found itself without a parliament with which to draw hundreds of peers and bishops, along with their thousands of servants. While many did come to Dublin still for the &quot;Social Season&quot;, where the Lord Lieutenant hosted debutantes balls, state balls and drawing rooms in a period from January until St. Patrick&#x27;s Day (17 March) every year, many found them less appealing than in the days when they could sit in parliament for a session in College Green. Many of the leading peers, including the Duke of Leinster and Viscount Powerscourt, almost immediately sold their palatial Dublin townhouses, Powerscourt House and Leinster House. Though many still flocked to Dublin every social season, many did not or went to London. The loss of their revenue and that of their extensive staff hurt the Dublin economy severely. While the &#x27;new&#x27; Georgian centres southside continued to flourish, the northside Georgian squares soon fell into squalor, as new owners of the buildings crammed in massive numbers of poor into the former residences of earls and bishops, in some cases cramming an entire family into one old drawing room. Mountjoy Square in particular became run-down, until such was its state and degree of dereliction in the 1980s that it was used as a film set for stories set in post-blitz London and post-war Berlin. The empty shells of the graceful houses, reduced to unsanitary tenements before being demolished in the 1980s, were used as a backdrop for a U2 rock video.

==Georgian Dublin today==

In the years after independence in 1922, independent Ireland had little sympathy for Georgian Dublin, viewing it as a symbol of British rule and of the unionist identity that was alien to Irish identity. By this time, many of the gentry who had lived in them had moved elsewhere; some to the wealthy Victorian suburbs of Rathmines and Rathgar, Killiney and Ballsbridge, where Victorian residences were built on larger plots of land, allowing for gardens, rather than the lack of space of the Georgian eras. Those that had not moved in many cases had by the early twentieth century sold their mansions in Dublin. The abolition of the Dublin Castle administration and the Lord Lieutenant in 1922 saw an end to Dublin&#x27;s traditional &quot;Social Season&quot; of masked balls, drawing rooms and court functions in the Castle. Many of the aristocratic families lost their heirs in the First World War, their homes in the country to IRA burnings (during the Irish War of Independence) and their townhouses to the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Daisy, the Countess of Fingall, in her regularly republished memoirs &quot;Seventy Years Young&quot;, wrote in the 1920s of the disappearance of that world and of her change from a big townhouse in Dublin, full of servants to a small flat with one maid. By the 1920s and certainly by the 1930s, many of the previous homes in Merrion Square had become business addresses of companies, with only Fitzwilliam Square of all the five squares having any residents. (Curiously, in the 1990s, new wealthy businessmen such as Sir Tony O&#x27;Reilly and Dermot Desmond began returning to live in former offices they had bought and converted &quot;back&quot; into homes.) By the 1930s, plans were discussed in Éamon de Valera&#x27;s government to demolish all of Merrion Square, perhaps the most intact of the five squares, on the basis that the houses were &quot;old fashioned&quot; and &quot;un-national&quot;. These plans were put on hold in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II and a lack of capital and investment and had been essentially forgotten about by 1945.

Many of the houses had been subdivided into tenement flats, and were often poorly maintained by the owners. In June 1963, two tenement houses collapsed within 10 days. The first happened in early on 2 June, when a house collapsed on Bolton Street, killing two elderly occupants. Then, on 12 June two young girls were killed when two 4-storey tenement houses on Fenian Street collapsed on to the street, crushing them. This led to local residents to call on the authorities to &quot;clear the slums&quot; and crack down on negligent landlords, but also is viewed as clearing the way for developers to demolish the older buildings regardless of their condition. The tenements came to symbolise Dublin&#x27;s urban poverty, with the focus being on clearing the inner-city slums and demolishing these Georgian structures under the building code as dangerous.
Further destruction of Georgian buildings did occur despite these circumstances. Mountjoy Square, was under threat when a large amount of property on the south side was demolished by property speculators during the 1960s and 70s; even so, buildings with facsimile facades were subsequently built in place, re-completing the square&#x27;s uniform external appearance. The world&#x27;s longest row of Georgian houses, running from the corner of Merrion Square down to Leeson Street Bridge, was divided in the early 1960s to demolish part of the row and replace them with a modern styled office block.
By the 1990s, attitudes had changed dramatically. Stricter new planning guidelines sought to protect the remaining Georgian buildings. During this period, a number of old houses in poor repair, which had been refused planning permission, caught fire and burnt to the ground, paved the way for redevelopment. However, in contrast with the lax development controls applied in Ireland for many decades, by the 1990s a changed mindset among politicians, planners and the leaders of Dublin City Council (formerly Dublin Corporation) desired to preserve as much as possible of the remaining Georgian buildings.

Perhaps the biggest irony for some is that residence that marked the move of the aristocrats from the northside to the southside (where the wealthier Dubliners have remained to this day), and that in some ways embodied Georgian Dublin, Leinster House, home of the Duke of Leinster, ended up as the parliament of independent republican Ireland; but his family also produced the republican leader Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The decision in the late 1950s to demolish a row of Georgian houses in Kildare Place and replace them with a brick wall was greeted with jubilation by a republican minister at the time, Kevin Boland, who said they stood for everything he opposed. He described members of the fledgling Irish Georgian Society, newly formed to seek to protect Georgian buildings, of being &quot;belted earls&quot;.

<text>In marketing, a publicity stunt is a planned event designed to attract the public&#x27;s attention to the event&#x27;s organizers or their cause. Publicity stunts can be professionally organized, or set up by amateurs. Such events are frequently utilized by advertisers and celebrities, many of whom are athletes and politicians. Stunts employing humour and pranks have been regularly used by protest movements to promote their ideas and campaigns as well as challenge opponents.

Organizations sometimes seek publicity by staging newsworthy events that attract media coverage. They can be in the form of groundbreakings, world record attempts, dedications, press conferences, or organized protests. By staging and managing these types of events, the organizations attempt to gain some form of control over what is reported in the media. Successful publicity stunts have news value, offer photo, video, and sound bite opportunities, and are arranged primarily for media coverage.

It can be difficult for organizations to design successful publicity stunts that highlight the message instead of burying it. The importance of publicity stunts is for generating news interest and awareness for the concept, product, or service being marketed.

== Examples ==

=== JP Morgan and Ringling Brothers ===
In 1933, J.P. Morgan Jr. was summoned to appear before Senate Banking and Currency Committee due to their suspicions of his previous banking activity throughout the financial crash. During the congressional hearings, U.S. Senator Carter Glass remarked that the proceedings had turned into a circus as things had begun to appear out of hand. The Ringling Brothers as well as Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus were both in D.C. at the time of the hearing. Thus, they interpreted Senator Glass&#x27; remarks as an invitation and asked their press agent to place a female circus dwarf named Lya Graf, on Morgan Jr.&#x27;s lap during one of the hearings. While the addition of the small lady surprised Morgan and infuriated Glass, it also gained significant publicity for Ringling Brothers Circus.

=== Calendar Girls ===
In 1999, a group of 11 women from the Women&#x27;s Institute (in Yorkshire, UK) stripped for a calendar to raise money for the Leukaemia Research Fund. Setting a goal of $5,000, the group of Women&#x27;s Institute women feared that they would struggle to sell even a 1,000 copies. The calendar was eventually released on April 12, 1999, and featured all 11 women posing nude – obscured by baked goods, flower arrangements, sewing adornments, teapots, song sheets, and even a grand piano. Despite leaving people of this time stunned, over 800,000 copies of the calendar were sold worldwide. After its initial release in 1999, the calendar raised over 5 million euros or over 4.8 million U.S dollars. This publicity stunt eventually went on to inspire a multitude of media productions including a British comedy film, titled &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; in 2003, a West End show in 2009, and a musical production in 2012, titled The Girls. Tricia Stewart, one of the original calendar girls, also known as Miss October, even went on to publish her own autobiography, Calendar Girl, in which she retells the initial creation of the publicity stunt and how it changed their lives forever.

<text>An open formula is a formula that contains at least one free variable.

An open formula does not have a truth value assigned to it, in contrast with a closed formula which constitutes a proposition and thus can have a truth value like &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. An open formula can be transformed into a closed formula by applying a quantifier for each free variable. This transformation is called capture of the free variables to make them bound variables.

For example, when reasoning about natural numbers, the formula &quot;&quot;x&quot;+2 &gt; &quot;y&quot;&quot; is open, since it contains the free variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. In contrast, the formula &quot;∃&quot;y&quot; ∀&quot;x&quot;: &quot;x&quot;+2 &gt; &quot;y&quot; is closed, and has truth value &quot;true&quot;.

Open formulas are often used in rigorous mathematical definitions of properties, like 
:&quot;x&quot; is an aunt of &quot;y&quot; if, for some person &quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot; is a parent of &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;x&quot; is a sister of &quot;z&quot;&quot;
(with free variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and bound variable &quot;z&quot;) defining the notion of &quot;aunt&quot; in terms of &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;sister&quot;.
Another, more formal example, which defines the property of being a prime number, is 
:&quot;&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) if ∀&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;∈formula_1: &quot;m&quot;&gt;1 ∧ &quot;n&quot;&gt;1 → &quot;x&quot;≠ &quot;m&quot;⋅&quot;n&quot;&quot;,
(with free variable &quot;x&quot; and bound variables &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;).

An example of a closed formula with truth value &quot;false&quot; involves the sequence of Fermat numbers

:formula_2

studied by Fermat in connection to the primality. The attachment of the predicate letter P (&quot;is prime&quot;) to each number from the Fermat sequence gives a set of closed formulae. While they are true for &quot;n&quot; = 0...,4, no larger value of &quot;n&quot; is known that obtains a true formula, ; for example, formula_3 is not a prime. Thus the closed formula ∀&quot;n&quot; &quot;P&quot;(&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is false.

<text>Applebee&#x27;s Restaurants LLC. is an American company that develops, franchises, and operates the Applebee&#x27;s Neighborhood Grill + Bar restaurant chain. The Applebee&#x27;s concept focuses on casual dining, with mainstream American dishes such as salads, chicken, burgers, and &quot;riblets&quot; (Applebee&#x27;s signature dish).

== History ==
===1980–2006: Founding and going public===
The Applebee&#x27;s chain was founded by Bill and T. J. Palmer in July 1980. Their vision was &quot;to create a restaurant that had a neighborhood pub feel to it and could offer friendly service along with quality fare at a lower price than most of their competition.&quot; The name “Appleby” was their first choice for this concept, but they found that it had already been registered. They also considered &quot;Cinnamon&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Pepper&#x27;s&quot; before arriving at Applebee&#x27;s. They opened their first location on November 19, 1980 in Decatur, Georgia, at the time named T.J. Applebee&#x27;s Rx for Edibles &amp; Elixirs. They opened a second location outside of Atlanta, Georgia, a few years later, and sold the company to W. R. Grace and Company in May 1983. As part of the transaction, Bill Palmer was named president of the Applebee&#x27;s Division, an indirect subsidiary of W. R. Grace and Company. In that capacity, Palmer guided the operation from its entrepreneurial beginnings to a full-fledged franchise system. He became an Applebee&#x27;s franchisee in 1985. Bill Palmer died in 2020.

In 1986, the name of the concept was changed to Applebee&#x27;s Neighborhood Grill &amp; Bar. In 1988, Applebee&#x27;s International, Inc., became the restaurant chain&#x27;s franchiser when Kansas City franchisees Abe Gustin and John Hamra purchased the rights to the Applebee&#x27;s concept from W. R. Grace. In 1989, Applebee&#x27;s opened their 100th restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee.

In the 1990s, Applebee&#x27;s became one of the largest sit-down restaurant chains in the United States, and it began trading publicly in November 1991. In 1998, Applebee&#x27;s opened its 1000th restaurant.

=== 2007–present: Acquisition by IHOP ===

On July 16, 2007, IHOP Corp. announced that it agreed to buy Applebee&#x27;s International for about $2.1 billion. Applebee&#x27;s shareholders would receive $25.50 in cash per share, representing a 4.6% premium to the closing price on July 13, 2007.

The acquisition was completed on November 29, 2007, after which IHOP Corp. was renamed Dine Equity. The combined company became the largest full-service restaurant company in the world, with more than 3,250 locations. A major goal for the new ownership was to revitalize the chain, as well as shift towards a franchise model for the majority of its locations.

In 2013, the chain faced an uproar on the Internet after firing a waitress who posted a picture of a customer&#x27;s receipt that had a rude note written on it objecting to a required gratuity, and then poorly handling their response to the incident.

On August 11, 2017, DineEquity announced that Applebee&#x27;s would close between 105 and 135 locations by the end of the year. Same-store sales decreased 7% in the previous quarter.

In-late 2017, Applebee&#x27;s began to place an increased focus on promotions involving low-cost cocktails, including a $1 margarita promotion dubbed the &quot;Dollarita&quot; in October, and $1 Long Island iced tea (promoted as &quot;L.I.T.s&quot;) in December. The drinks would serve as a loss leader, with customers subsequently upsold towards higher-priced food products. Despite hesitation by some franchisees to participate, the promotions were associated with a major increase in traffic at some locations, and prompted the chain to offer similar promotions later on. Dine Brands&#x27; new CEO Steve Joyce credited the promotions with having helped influence a major financial turnaround at the company, noting that almost all customers who ordered one also ordered food, and that some customers also moved towards the other cocktails on its menu.

As of December 31, 2019, there were 1,787 restaurants operating system-wide in the United States and 15 other countries, including 69 that are company owned and 1,718 that are franchised. United States locations have steadily declined in recent years and as of December 26, 2022, there were 1,586 locations.

In March 2024, Dine Brands announced it was exploring Applebee’s-IHOP dual-branded restaurants that might launch within 12-24 months, after the successful introduction of prototypes in international markets. CEO John Peyton said the restaurants were the same size as standalone restaurants of each brand but generated twice the revenue.

== Advertising ==
As part of the company&#x27;s marketing campaign and slogan, Wanda Sykes was hired in 2007 to voice the chain&#x27;s new mascot, the Applebee&#x27;s Apple. The character appears in commercials touting Applebee&#x27;s various specials and stating the new slogan &quot;Together is good&quot; or saying &quot;Get it together, baby!&quot; as the slogan appears at the bottom right of the screen. A new campaign started on February 25, 2008, without Sykes&#x27; character (the spokesapple), with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s a whole new neighborhood.&quot; The commercials used both the original and new logos. In 2009 Applebee&#x27;s changed its slogan again to &quot;There&#x27;s no place like the neighborhood.&quot;

From 2012 to 2016, Applebee&#x27;s aired an advertising campaign focusing on fresh ingredients and new dishes, narrated by Jason Sudeikis, featuring the slogan &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;

In 2012, Applebee&#x27;s partnered with the country group Zac Brown Band on a Veteran&#x27;s Day-themed &quot;Thank You Movement&quot; campaign to honor members of the U.S. military. The band&#x27;s song &quot;Chicken Fried&quot; has also been featured in a Applebee&#x27;s commercial; in February 2022, Applebee&#x27;s pulled its advertising from CNN after an incident where an inappropriately timed split-screen commercial break featured live footage of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine shown alongside the ad.

In late September 2017, Applebee&#x27;s brought back its most famous slogan from the early-to-mid 2000s, &quot;Eatin&#x27; Good in the Neighborhood.&quot; In 2022, Applebee&#x27;s advertising fees accounted for 177.4 million U.S. dollars.

In August 2021, after having removed it due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Applebee&#x27;s restored its Oreo Cookie Shake to its menu. The chain and beverage had been mentioned in Walker Hayes&#x27; song &quot;Fancy Like&quot;, which was subsequently featured in a new Applebee&#x27;s commercial as well.

In January 2024, the company introduced Applebee’s Date Night Pass. The $300 card would provide holders 52 date nights, from February 1, 2024 to January 21, 2025, the opportunity to spend $30 on food and non-alcoholic beverages either in restaurants or using takeout. It came during an inflationary environment for restaurants and was designed to make going out more accessible. &quot;CNN&quot; reported this move came amid others that indicated the chain was emphasizing its role as an affordable place to eat, like bringing back all-you-can-eat boneless wings or heavily discounted margaritas. At the time of the announcement, it could also be used for online orders but not for those through third-party services.

== Controversies ==
=== Side-work compensation ===
Since 2006, Applebee&#x27;s and its servers have been engaged in a lawsuit over hourly wages. The servers, who received a federal minimum wage of $2.13 per hour as tipped employees, allege that the company requires them to spend 20% of their time doing non-serving labor, for which they should be paid the federal non-tipped minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The case has gone through several stages, including a judicially mandated binding arbitration session.

In September 2012, a judge in Illinois ruled in favor of the Applebee&#x27;s employees and will evaluate damages at a later date.

<doc id="228370" wikidata="Q129297" url="?curid=228370" title="Growing pains">
<text>Growing pains are recurring pain symptoms that are relatively common in children ages 3 to 14-16. The pains normally appear at night and affect the calf or thigh muscles of both legs. The pain stops on its own before morning.

Growing pains are one of the most common causes of recurring pain in children. Although these pains reliably stop when the child has completely finished growing, it likely has nothing to do with growth.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Growing pains usually affect both legs, especially the calf muscle in the lower leg or the muscles in the front of the thighs. Less commonly, the arms are affected. They are normally felt on both sides. Typically, the pains are felt in the muscles, rather than in the joints. The amount of pain varies from mild to very severe.

The pains may start in the evening or at night. Because the pains normally appear while the child is sleeping, they often wake the child up at night. The pains often last for 30 minutes to two hours, and are often but not always gone by the morning. Typically, the pains appear once or twice each week, but it can be more frequent or less frequent.

The pains are not in the same place as an injury, including overuse injuries such as shin splints, and the child does not limp while walking.

==Cause==
The causes of growing pains are unknown. They are not associated with growth spurts, and some authors suggest alternative terms as providing a more accurate description, such as recurrent limb pain in childhood, paroxysmal nocturnal pains, or benign idiopathic paroxysmal nocturnal limb pains of childhood.

Theories of causation include:
* poor posture or other mechanical or anatomical defects, such as joint hypermobility;
* vascular perfusion disorder, 
* lower pain threshold or a pain amplification syndrome,
* tiredness, perhaps especially among children with weaker bones than average who have overexerted themselves; and 
* psychological factors, such as stress within the family. 
Some parents are able to associate episodes of pain with physical exercise or mood changes in the child.

== Diagnosis ==
This diagnosis is normally made by considering the information presented by the child and family members, and by doing a physical exam to make sure that the child seems to be otherwise healthy. When the child has the typical symptoms and appears to be healthy, then laboratory investigations to exclude other diagnoses is not warranted.

When a child has growing pains, there are no objective clinical signs of inflammation, such as swollen joints. Children with growing pains do not have signs of any systemic diseases (such as fever or skin rashes), any abnormal pain sensations, tender spots, or joint disorders. Children do not have growing pains if the pain worsens over time, persists during the daytime, only involves one limb, or is located in a joint. It should be excluded if the child is limping, loses the ability to walk, or has physical signs that suggest other medical conditions.

Childhood-onset restless legs syndrome is sometimes misdiagnosed as growing pains. Other possible causes of pain in the limbs include injuries, infections, benign tumors such as osteoid osteoma, malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma, and problems that affect the shape and function of the legs, such as genu valgum (knock-knees).

==Treatment==
Parents and children can be substantially reassured by explaining the benign and self-limiting nature of the pains. Local massage, hot baths, hot water bottles or heating pads, and analgesic drugs such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are often used during pain episodes. Twice-daily stretching of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrosoleus muscles can make the leg pains resolve more quickly when it appears.

==Prognosis==
Growing pains are not associated with other serious disease and usually resolves by late childhood. Commonly, episodes of growing pains become less severe and less frequent over time, and many children outgrow them after one or two years.

Frequent episodes are capable of having a substantial effect on the life of the child.

==Epidemiology==
Growing pains likely affect about 10 to 20% of children, and the rate may be as high as about 40% among children aged four to six. Individuals can vary markedly in when they experience growing pains.

==History==
Growing pains were first described as such in 1823 by a French doctor, Marcel Duchamp, and the cause was attributed to the growth process. A century later, mainstream medicine thought that the pains were caused by a mild case of rheumatic fever.

<text>Jiujiang University () is a local university in Jiujiang, northwestern of landlocked Jiangxi Province in China.

==History==

Jiujiang University is a comprehensive public university authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, enrolling students from 30 provinces of China with many different backgrounds. Its history can be traced back to 1901 when it existed as Danforth Hospital Nursing School.

The university was formed out of the 2006 merger of what had been the four local Jiujiang colleges: Jiujiang Teacher&#x27;s College, Jiujiang Medical College, Jiujiang Vocational College, and Jiujiang College of Finance and Economics.

Jiujiang University has four campuses covering an area of about 184 hectares with a total space of buildings being 780,000 square meters. There are over 30,000 full-time Chinese students, with over 200 foreign students, 1683 full-time teachers, 21 faculties or colleges offering a total of 159 programs and a library collecting over 2.46 million books.

Jiujiang University is one of the 25 Chinese Language Education Centres approved by Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs under the State Council of P. R. China. Jiujiang University has been entitled to enrolling overseas students and established collaborative relationship with universities of more than 10 countries.

In October 1980, the 10th military meeting of the Central Military Committee eliminated the department of enterprise administration, a rear-service school of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and replaced it with a cadre school for enterprise. On September 21, 1981, the PLA Enterprise Cadre School was established.

In September 1982, the school began its first training classes. At the beginning of 1983, the Jiangxi provincial government brought the enrollment plan of the school into line with the state plan.

In March 1994, the National Education Committee approved the establishment of the Jiujiang Financial and Economic College, the added name Military Supplies Finance and Economics College of the PLA added in April of the same year. The two names have since been used in parallel.

==Leadership==
Jiujiang University&#x27;s vice chancellor is professor Chen Xiaolin in 2022

==Ranking==
In QS 2021, Jiujiang University ranked 512th in the world.

<doc id="228385" wikidata="Q911691" url="?curid=228385" title="Clock rate">
<text>Clock rate or clock speed in computing typically refers to the frequency at which the clock generator of a processor can generate pulses used to synchronize the operations of its components. It is used as an indicator of the processor&#x27;s speed. Clock rate is measured in the SI unit of frequency hertz (Hz).

The clock rate of the first generation of computers was measured in hertz or kilohertz (kHz), the first personal computers from the 1970s through the 1980s had clock rates measured in megahertz (MHz). In the 21st century the speed of modern CPUs is commonly advertised in gigahertz (GHz). This metric is most useful when comparing processors within the same family, holding constant other features that may affect performance.

==Determining factors==
=== Binning ===

Manufacturers of modern processors typically charge higher prices for processors that operate at higher clock rates, a practice called binning. For a given CPU, the clock rates are determined at the end of the manufacturing process through testing of each processor. Chip manufacturers publish a &quot;maximum clock rate&quot; specification, and they test chips before selling them to make sure they meet that specification, even when executing the most complicated instructions with the data patterns that take the longest to settle (testing at the temperature and voltage that gives the lowest performance). Processors successfully tested for compliance with a given set of standards may be labeled with a higher clock rate, e.g., 3.50 GHz, while those that fail the standards of the higher clock rate yet pass the standards of a lower clock rate may be labeled with the lower clock rate, e.g., 3.3 GHz, and sold at a lower price.

===Engineering===
The clock rate of a CPU is normally determined by the frequency of an oscillator crystal. Typically a crystal oscillator produces a fixed sine wave—the frequency reference signal. Electronic circuitry translates that into a square wave at the same frequency for digital electronics applications (or, when using a CPU multiplier, some fixed multiple of the crystal reference frequency). The clock distribution network inside the CPU carries that clock signal to all the parts that need it. An A/D Converter has a &quot;clock&quot; pin driven by a similar system to set the sampling rate. With any particular CPU, replacing the crystal with another crystal that oscillates at half the frequency (&quot;underclocking&quot;) will generally make the CPU run at half the performance and reduce waste heat produced by the CPU. Conversely, some people try to increase performance of a CPU by replacing the oscillator crystal with a higher frequency crystal (&quot;overclocking&quot;). However, the amount of overclocking is limited by the time for the CPU to settle after each pulse, and by the extra heat created.

After each clock pulse, the signal lines inside the CPU need time to settle to their new state. That is, every signal line must finish transitioning from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. If the next clock pulse comes before that, the results will be incorrect. In the process of transitioning, some energy is wasted as heat (mostly inside the driving transistors). When executing complicated instructions that cause many transitions, the higher the clock rate the more heat produced. Transistors may be damaged by excessive heat.

There is also a lower limit of the clock rate, unless a fully static core is used.

==Historical milestones and current records==
The first fully mechanical digital computer, the Z1, operated at 1 Hz (cycle per second) clock frequency and the first electromechanical general purpose computer, the Z3, operated at a frequency of about 5–10 Hz. The first electronic general purpose computer, the ENIAC, used a 100 kHz clock in its cycling unit. As each instruction took 20 cycles, it had an instruction rate of 5 kHz.

The first commercial PC, the Altair 8800 (by MITS), used an Intel 8080 CPU with a clock rate of 2 MHz (2 million cycles per second). The original IBM PC (c. 1981) had a clock rate of 4.77 MHz (4,772,727 cycles per second). In 1992, both Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) exceeded 100 MHz with RISC techniques in the PA-7100 and AXP 21064 DEC Alpha respectively. In 1995, Intel&#x27;s P5 Pentium chip ran at 100 MHz (100 million cycles per second). On March 6, 2000, AMD demonstrated passing the 1 GHz milestone a few days ahead of Intel shipping 1 GHz in systems. In 2002, an Intel Pentium 4 model was introduced as the first CPU with a clock rate of 3 GHz (three billion cycles per second corresponding to ~ 0.33 nanoseconds per cycle). Since then, the clock rate of production processors has increased more slowly, with performance improvements coming from other design changes.

Set in 2011, the Guinness World Record for the highest CPU clock rate is 8.42938 GHz with an overclocked AMD FX-8150 Bulldozer-based chip in an LHe/LN2 cryobath, 5 GHz on air. This is surpassed by the CPU-Z overclocking record for the highest CPU clock rate at 8.79433 GHz with an AMD FX-8350 Piledriver-based chip bathed in LN2, achieved in November 2012. It is also surpassed by the slightly slower AMD FX-8370 overclocked to 8.72 GHz which tops off the HWBOT frequency rankings. These records were broken in late 2022 when an Intel Core i9-13900K was overclocked to 9.008 GHz.

The highest base clock rate on a production processor is the i9-14900KS, clocked at 6.2 GHz, which was released in Q1 2024.

== Research ==
Engineers continue to find new ways to design CPUs that settle a little more quickly or use slightly less energy per transition, pushing back those limits, producing new CPUs that can run at slightly higher clock rates. The ultimate limits to energy per transition are explored in reversible computing.

The first fully reversible CPU, the Pendulum, was implemented using standard CMOS transistors in the late 1990s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Engineers also continue to find new ways to design CPUs so that they complete more instructions per clock cycle, thus achieving a lower CPI (cycles or clock cycles per instruction) count, although they may run at the same or a lower clock rate as older CPUs. This is achieved through architectural techniques such as instruction pipelining and out-of-order execution which attempts to exploit instruction level parallelism in the code.

== Comparing ==

The clock rate of a CPU is most useful for providing comparisons between CPUs in the same family. The clock rate is only one of several factors that can influence performance when comparing processors in different families. For example, an IBM PC with an Intel 80486 CPU running at 50 MHz will be about twice as fast (internally only) as one with the same CPU and memory running at 25 MHz, while the same will not be true for MIPS R4000 running at the same clock rate as the two are different processors that implement different architectures and microarchitectures. Further, a &quot;cumulative clock rate&quot; measure is sometimes assumed by taking the total cores and multiplying by the total clock rate (e.g. a dual-core 2.8 GHz processor running at a cumulative 5.6 GHz). There are many other factors to consider when comparing the performance of CPUs, like the width of the CPU&#x27;s data bus, the latency of the memory, and the cache architecture.

The clock rate alone is generally considered to be an inaccurate measure of performance when comparing different CPUs families. Software benchmarks are more useful. Clock rates can sometimes be misleading since the amount of work different CPUs can do in one cycle varies. For example, superscalar processors can execute more than one instruction per cycle (on average), yet it is not uncommon for them to do &quot;less&quot; in a clock cycle. In addition, subscalar CPUs or use of parallelism can also affect the performance of the computer regardless of clock rate.

<doc id="228394" wikidata="Q891128" url="?curid=228394" title="Disk controller">
<text>A disk controller is a controller circuit that enables a CPU to communicate with a hard disk, floppy disk or other kind of disk drive. It also provides an interface between the disk drive and the bus connecting it to the rest of the system.

Early disk controllers were identified by their storage methods and data encoding. They were typically implemented on a separate controller card. Modified frequency modulation (MFM) controllers were the most common type in small computers, used for both floppy disk and hard disk drives. Run length limited (RLL) controllers used data compression to increase storage capacity by about 50%. Priam created a proprietary storage algorithm that could double the disk storage. Shugart Associates Systems Interface (SASI) was a predecessor to SCSI. 

Modern disk controllers are integrated into the disk drive as peripheral controllers. For example, &quot;SCSI disks&quot; have built-in SCSI controllers. In the past, before most SCSI controller functionality was implemented in a single chip, separate SCSI controllers interfaced disks to the SCSI bus.

These integrated peripheral controllers communicate with a host adapter in the host system over a standardized, high-level storage bus interface. The most common types of interfaces provided nowadays by host controllers are PATA (IDE) and Serial ATA for home use. High-end disks use Parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel or Serial Attached SCSI.

Disk controllers can also control the timing of access to flash memory which is not mechanical in nature (i.e. no spinning disk).

==Disk controller versus host adapter==
The component that allows a &quot;computer&quot; to talk to a peripheral bus is a host adapter or host bus adapter (HBA, e.g. Advanced Host Controller Interface or AHDC). A disk controller allows a &quot;disk&quot; to talk to the same bus. Signals read by a disk read-and-write head are converted by a disk controller, then transmitted over the peripheral bus, then converted again by the host adapter into the suitable format for the motherboard&#x27;s bus, and then read by the CPU into the memory (RAM).

Sometimes there may be yet another controller between a host adapter and a disk controller - a disk array controller that allows hardware RAID to be formed. Sometimes it may be even physically integrated with an HBA.

<doc id="228424" wikidata="Q650881" url="?curid=228424" title="Compiere">
<text>Compiere (pronounced KOM-pyeh-reh, &quot;to accomplish, complete, fulfill&quot; in Italian) is an open-source ERP and CRM business solution for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) in distribution, retail, service, and manufacturing. Compiere is distributed by Consona Corporation and through a Partner Network, who are a collection of trained and authorized business partners.

Compiere was founded in 1999 by Jorg Janke and was among the top 10 projects in SourceForge from 2002 for 4 years, reaching one million downloads and 100 partners in 2006.

In 2006, Compiere, Inc. raised venture capital from New Enterprise Associates with the goal of transforming the successful open-source ERP project into a growing and sustainable commercial open-source business. In 2007, the company added new executives, revamped engineering and support processes, and expanded its sales and services channels. The Compiere product line expanded to include Professional, Enterprise, and Cloud Editions while the company continued to maintain the open-source foundation as Community Edition.

Like many commercial ventures built around open-source projects, there was a degree of contention between company management (who sought to monetize the investments in R&amp;D, Services and Support) and voices from the community (who desired that Compiere source code and business processes remained free and open as Adempiere at that moment and iDempiere some years later). On June 16, 2010, Consona acquired Compiere, Inc. Terms of the deal were not disclosed

The application and source code are provided based on the GNU General Public License version 2; this comprises the Community Edition. Also available for a fee is a Professional Edition with more features, a commercial license, documentation and support contracts.

==Functionality==

Compiere encompasses ERP functionality, but in order to avoid the duplication of information and fulfill the need for synchronization, it was organized in a different way. Compiere modules are: Quote to Cash, Requisition-to-Pay, Customer relationship management, Partner Relations Management, Supply Chain Management, Performance Analysis, Warehouse, Double-entry bookkeeping, Work-flow-Management and Web Store. A manufacturing module is being developed within an independent project CMPCS &quot;(see external links section)&quot;.

==Architecture==

Compiere is a Model Driven Architecture development, deployment and maintenance framework designed with the intention of following changes as business evolves. At any time, customers can change the information structure, adjusting to new information needs. Compiere provides multiple views of business information based on the detail of the actual transactions. This structure allows flexibility and integration of supplemental external information. And since information is presented as views (using Compiere&#x27;s MVC architecture), they can be changed to meet the needs of the business. Compiere is entirely based on the concept of &quot;Active Data Dictionary&quot; (ADD). Compiere &quot;Data Dictionary&quot; contains definitions of a data entity (type, validation, etc.), how it is displayed (label on screens and reports, help, display sequence and position relative to other fields), and the display rules. It also contains security and access rules.

Compiere has been developed with Java EE.

==Database independence==
Compiere has been criticized for not being a pure open-source product because of its dependence on Oracle database (including the free Oracle XE); this is changing now, since version 2.5.2 Compiere is database independent to some extent. The project has released a &quot;Database Kit&quot; for porting Compiere to multiple databases. PostgreSQL, MySQL and Sybase ports are in Beta status. Compiere can also be run under the Firebird database using the Fyracle extensions, without porting.

Taking advantage of the &quot;Database Kit&quot; to create a port for the Apache Derby database the ER/Box project provides an integrated all-Java, all open source &quot;Compiere distribution&quot;. In addition to the Apache Derby database port ER/Box is also capable of running on PostgreSQL.

Compiere also works with the open-source alternative to Oracle database, EnterpriseDB. User documentation is still offered on a fee-based accessibility.

== Spin-offs ==
*Adempiere: Disagreement between a component of the Compiere user community and Compiere, Inc. resulted in the creation of this spin-off Open-Source project. The primary point of dispute was a belief by members of the user community that Compiere, Inc. had ignored the contributions and concerns of community members. Their claim was that the continuing direction of the product was driven mainly by Compiere, Inc.&#x27;s venture capital partners and not the user community at-large.
*metasfresh - originally based on ADempiere, developed in Germany.
*iDempiere also known as OSGI + ADempiere. It modularized the code through the OSGi framework so it allows a plugin architecture. Today it is the ERP project driven by the most widespread, active and open community (not backed by a single company).

<doc id="228425" wikidata="Q318214" url="?curid=228425" title="John Newlands (chemist)">
<text>John Alexander Reina Newlands (26 November 1837 – 29 July 1898) was a British chemist who worked concerning the periodicity of elements.

==Biography==
Newlands was born in London in England, at West Square in Southwark, the son of a Scottish Presbyterian minister and his Italian wife.

Newlands was home-schooled by his father, and later studied at the Royal College of Chemistry, now part of Imperial College London. He was interested in social reform and during 1860 served as a volunteer with Giuseppe Garibaldi in his military campaign to unify Italy. Returning to London, Newlands established himself as an analytical chemist in 1864. In 1868 he became chief chemist of James Duncan&#x27;s London sugar refinery, where he introduced a number of improvements in processing. Later he quit the refinery and again became an analyst with his brother, Benjamin.

Newlands was the first person to devise a periodic table of chemical elements arranged in order of their relative atomic masses published in &quot;Chemical News&quot; in February 1863. Continuing Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner&#x27;s work with triads and Jean-Baptiste Dumas&#x27; families of similar elements, he published in 1865 his &quot;Law of Octaves&quot;, which stated that &quot;any given element will exhibit analogous behaviour to the eighth element following it in the table.&quot; Newlands arranged all of the known elements, starting with hydrogen and ending with thorium (atomic weight 232), into eight groups of seven, which he likened to octaves of music. In Newlands&#x27; table, the elements were ordered by the atomic weights that were known at the time and were numbered sequentially to show their order. Groups were shown going across the table, with periods going down – the opposite from the modern form of the periodic table.

The incompleteness of the table alluded to the possible existence of additional, undiscovered elements. However, the Law of Octaves was ridiculed by some of Newlands&#x27; contemporaries, and the Society of Chemists did not accept his work for publication.

After Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer received the Davy Medal from the Royal Society for their later &#x27;discovery&#x27; of the periodic table in 1882, Newlands fought for recognition of his earlier work and eventually received the Davy Medal in 1887.

John Newlands died due to complications of surgery at his home in Lower Clapton, Middlesex and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His businesses was continued after his death by his younger brother, Benjamin.

<text>SQL-Ledger is an ERP and double entry accounting system. Accounting data is stored in an SQL database server and a standard web browser can be used as its user interface. The system uses the Perl language with a database interface module for processing and PostgreSQL for data storage which is the preferred platform. The download version also includes schemas for IBM&#x27;s DB2 database server as well as Oracle.

== Capabilities ==

SQL-Ledger offers all of the standard features of SMB accounting software. Specific customization is available as part of an enterprise support contract.

Not only is the user interface multi-lingual, but it also offers the ability to print out statements, invoices, and the like in the language of the customer, even if the user does not know the language in which the content is being printed.

== Supported languages ==
==Business model==

DWS generates their revenue from selling a manual and customizations. For free, DWS provides the source code of the current and all the previous versions, installation instructions, an FAQ collection and a user forum.

Version 3.0 of this program was released under the GNU GPL 2.0 license.

Version 3.2.6 released in December 2017.

== Licensing issues ==

At its inception, SQL-Ledger used the GNU GPL 2.0 license. In 2005, Debian legal questioned whether or not the program belonged in Free or Non-Free, due to wording in the &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; notice in the tarball.
In late 2006, LedgerSMB was created as a secure fork of SQL-Ledger. In early 2007, SQL-Ledger 2.8 was released under the &quot;&#x27;SQL-Ledger Open Source License&quot;, a license which retroactively revokes all previous licenses under which the covered code had been released. That version also contained an &quot;anti-forking&quot; clause.
However, within a month, SQL-Ledger 2.8.1 was released, under the GNU GPL 2.0.

<doc id="228428" wikidata="Q62400" url="?curid=228428" title="Heinrich von Treitschke">
<text>Heinrich Gotthard Freiherr von Treitschke (; 15 September 1834 – 28 April 1896) was a German historian, political writer and National Liberal member of the Reichstag during the time of the German Empire. He was an extreme nationalist, who favored German colonialism and opposed the British Empire. He also opposed Catholics, Poles, Jews and socialists inside Germany.

==Early life and teaching career==
Treitschke was born in Dresden. He was the son of an officer of the Kingdom of Saxony&#x27;s army who became governor of Königstein and military governor of Dresden. Treitschke developed an increasing hearing problem at a young age, and so was prevented from entering public service. After studying at the universities of Leipzig and Bonn, where he was a student of Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, he established himself as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Leipzig, lecturing on history and politics. At one time he became very popular with the students, but his political opinions made it impossible for the Saxon government to appoint him to a professorship.

At that time Treitschke was a strong Liberal; he hoped to see Germany united into a single state with a parliamentary government, and all the smaller states annexed. He praised colonialism, stating:
Treitschke also endorsed Social Darwinian theories of brutal competition among races. In an essay published in 1862, Treitschke praised the &quot;pitiless racial struggle&quot; of Germans against Lithuanians, Poles and Old Prussians; he claimed that &quot;magic&quot; emanated from &quot;eastern German soil&quot; which had been &quot;fertilised&quot; by &quot;noble German blood&quot;. While his main objective was to give historical legitimisation to the Germanising of Poles in Prussia, the praise of a legendary migration eastward performed by German ancestors would eventually become a means of legitimising claims to further eastern territories.

He was appointed professor at the University of Freiburg in 1863; in 1866, at the beginning of the Austro-Prussian War, his sympathies with the Kingdom of Prussia were so strong that he went to Berlin, became a Prussian subject, and was appointed editor of the &quot;Preussische Jahrbücher&quot;. His violent article, in which he demanded the annexation of the Kingdoms of Hanover and Saxony, and attacked with great invective the Saxon royal house, caused an estrangement from his father, a personal friend of the king. It was only equalled in its ill humour by his attacks on Bavaria during 1870. After possessing appointments at the University of Kiel and the University of Heidelberg, he was made professor at Friedrich Wilhelm University (what is now named Humboldt University) in Berlin in 1874.

==Political career==

Treitschke became a member of the Reichstag in 1871 and until his death was one of the best known people in Berlin. He was largely deaf during this period and had an aide sit by his side to transcribe discussion into writing so that he could participate.

On Heinrich von Sybel&#x27;s death, Treitschke succeeded him as editor of the &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot;. He had outgrown his early Liberalism and become the chief panegyrist of the House of Hohenzollern. He made violent and influential attacks on all opinions and all parties which seemed in any way to be injurious to the increasing power of Germany. He endorsed Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his program to subdue the Socialists, Poles and Catholics (&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;), but the attempts were unsuccessful because the victims organized themselves and used universal male suffrage to their advantage in the Reichstag until Bismarck finally relented.

A strong proponent of German colonialism, Treitschke was a strong critic of the British Empire, and his condemnations were favoured by some German imperialists. His increasingly-chauvinistic Anglophobia in the late-19th century increasingly considered England as the strongest potential adversary of the rapidly-industrialising German Empire.

In the Reichstag, he had originally been a member of the National Liberal Party, but in 1879, he was the first to accept the new commercial policy of Bismarck. During his later years, he joined the Moderate Conservatives though his deafness prevented him from taking a prominent part in debate.

Treitschke rejected the concern of the Enlightenment and liberalism for individual rights and the separation of powers, in favour of an authoritarian monarchist and militarist concept of the state. He deplored the &quot;penetration of French liberalism&quot; (&quot;Eindringen des französischen Liberalismus&quot;) within the German nation.

Treitschke was one of the few celebrities who endorsed antisemitic attacks which became prevalent from 1879 onwards. He accused German Jews of refusing to assimilate into German culture and society and attacked the flow of Jewish immigrants from Russian Poland. Treitschke popularised the phrase &quot;Die Juden sind unser Unglück!&quot; (&quot;The Jews are our misfortune!&quot;), which would be adopted as a motto by the Nazi publication &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; several decades later. He made several antisemitic remarks such as the following:
Because of his prominent status, Treitschke&#x27;s remarks aroused widespread controversy.

Treitschke was considered favorably by the political elites of Prussia, and Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow personally declared that he kept a copy of von Treitschke&#x27;s book for &quot;several years&quot; on his desk.
==Death and legacy==
In 1896, Treitschke died in Berlin at 61 and is buried at the Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof Berlin.

Throughout his life, Treitschke endorsed militarism and racism, praised the conquest of other nations and eradication of inferior peoples (&quot;Brave peoples expand, cowardly peoples perish&quot;) and claimed that people of African heritage were &quot;inferior&quot;.

Endorsing the idea of exterminating conquered nations, he wrote:

Treitschke considered political history as a German nationalist and emphasized periods of great political change. He was a patriotic historian devoted to Prussia. His great achievement was the &quot;History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century&quot;. The first volume was published in 1879, and for 26 years, four more volumes appeared. At his death, he had only advanced to 1847.

He also wrote biographical and historical essays, as well as essays concerning contemporary politics. The most important essays were collected as &quot;Historische und politische Aufsatze&quot;. A selection from his more controversial writings was made with the title &quot;Zehn Jahre deutscher Kämpfe&quot;. In 1896 a new volume was published, &quot;Deutsche Kämpfe, neue Folge&quot;. After his death his lectures on political subjects were published with the title &quot;Politik&quot;.

He also published in 1856 a short volume of poems named &quot;Vaterländische Gedichte&quot; and another volume the next year. His first works to be translated into English were two pamphlets on the War of 1870, &quot;What we demand from France&quot; (London, 1870) and &quot;The Baptism of Fire of the North German Confederation&quot; (1870).

Treitschke&#x27;s students included Heinrich Claß, Hans Delbrück, W. E. B. Du Bois, Otto Hintze, Max Lenz, Erich Marcks, Friedrich Meinecke, Karl Peters, Gustav Schnürer, Georg Simmel and Friedrich von Bernhardi. During World War I, many writers in the West, particularly in Britain, blamed Bernhardi for creating attitudes among the political class of Germany that were considered an incitement to war. This opinion was repeated by historians such as Fritz Fischer, who deemed him a major influence on decision-makers before World War I.

A complete translation of both volumes of Treitschke&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; was published in London in 1916. &quot;Politics&quot; was published in 1963 in an abridged English translation edited by Hans Kohn.

<text>Roller skating is the act of travelling on surfaces with roller skates. It is a recreational activity, a sport, and a form of transportation. Roller rinks and skate parks are built for roller skating, though it also takes place on streets, sidewalks, and bike paths.

Roller skating originated in the performing arts in the 18th century. It gained widespread popularity starting in the 1880s. Roller skating was very popular in the United States from the 1930s to the 1950s, then again in the 1970s when it was associated with disco music and roller discos. During the 1990s, inline outdoor roller skating became popular. Roller skating has often been a part of Black and LGBT history in particular.

Sport roller skating includes speed skating, roller hockey, roller derby, figure skating and aggressive quad skating.

==History==
The earliest roller skates known are from 18th-century Europe. These skates were used in theater and musical performances, possibly to simulate ice skating onstage. Early roller skating was done in a straight line because turning or curving was very difficult with the primitive skate designs of the time. Limited to an occasional performance prop at the time, roller skating would not see widespread use until the 1840s.

Waitresses in an 1840s beer hall in Berlin used roller skates to serve customers. Ballet and opera of the late 1840s, such as &quot;Le prophète&quot;, featured roller skating. This helped to make roller skating popular for the first time, in 1850s Europe. Technological improvements, such as rubber wheels in 1859 and four-wheeled turning skates in 1863, contributed to the spread of roller skating. The popularity of roller skating has fluctuated greatly since then; it is typically called a &quot;craze&quot; at its high points.

Roller skating boomed in popularity from 1880 to 1910; roller skates were mass produced and skating in rinks became popular with the general public in Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Specialized types of roller skating appeared in this period, such as figure skating and speed skating.

After a decline in popularity, roller skating became widespread again in the 1930s to the 1950s. This era is known as the Golden Age of Roller Skating. Many skating rinks offering electric organ music were built throughout the United States in this period.

In the 1970s, roller disco became widespread. This style of skating originated with disco music predominantly among Black and gay skaters. During the late 1980s and the 1990s, outdoor and indoor inline skating (with &quot;rollerblades&quot;) became popular. Roller skating declined in popularity in the early 21st century, but became more popular again during the COVID pandemic.

Roller skating has long been tied to Black American social movements, immigrant communities, and the LGBT community, particularly for women in roller derby. As a hobby it is perceived as whimsical and is widely accessible to many people.

=== Historical timeline ===

* 1743: First recorded use of roller skates, in a London stage performance. The inventor of this skate is unknown.
* 1760: First recorded skate invention, by John Joseph Merlin, who created a primitive inline skate with small metal wheels.
* 1818: Roller skates appeared on the ballet stage in Berlin.
* 1819: First patented roller skate design, in France by M. Petitbled. These early skates were similar to today&#x27;s inline skates, but they were not very maneuverable. It was difficult with these skates to do anything but move in a straight line and perhaps make wide sweeping turns.

* Rest of the 19th century: inventors continued to work on improving skate design.
*1823: Robert John Tyers of London patented a skate called the Rolito. This skate had five wheels in a single row on the bottom of a shoe or boot.
* 1857: The hobby of roller skating gained enough momentum to warrant the opening of the first public skating rinks. The Strand, London and Floral Hall had these first roller rinks.
* 1863: The four-wheeled turning roller skate, or quad skate, with four wheels set in two side-by-side pairs (front and rear), was first designed, in New York City by James Leonard Plimpton in an attempt to improve upon previous designs. The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion that allowed the skater to skate a curve just by pressing his weight to one side or the other, most commonly by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, so much so that the first public roller skating rinks were opened in 1866, first in New York City by Plimpton in his furniture store and then in Newport, Rhode Island with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad skate allowed easier turns and maneuverability, and the quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.
*1875: Roller skating rink in Plymouth, England held its first competition.
*1876: William Brown in Birmingham, England, patented a design for the wheels of roller skates. Brown&#x27;s design embodied his effort to keep the two bearing surfaces of an axle, fixed and moving, apart. Brown worked closely with Joseph Henry Hughes, who drew up the patent for a ball or roller bearing race for bicycle and carriage wheels in 1877. Hughes&#x27; patent included all the elements of an adjustable system. These two men are thus responsible for modern roller skate and skateboard wheels, as well as the ball bearing race inclusion in velocipedes—later to become motorbikes and automobiles. This was arguably the most important advance in the realistic use of roller skates as a pleasurable pastime.

*1876: The toe stop was first patented. This braking implement provided skaters with the ability to stop promptly upon tipping the skate onto the toe. Toe stops are still used today on most quad skates, as well as some types of inline skates.
*1877: The &quot;Royal Skating&quot; indoor skating ring building is erected rue Veydt, Brussels.
*1878: In Boston, 17-year-old Pawnee skater Fred &quot;Bright Star&quot; Murree defeats Kenneth Skinner, the fastest speed skater in the area at the time. This begins Murree&#x27;s career.
*1880s: Roller skates were being mass-produced in America. This was the sport&#x27;s first of several boom periods. Micajah C. Henley of Richmond, Indiana produced thousands of skates every week during peak sales. Henley skates were the first skate with adjustable tension via a screw, the ancestor of the kingbolt mechanism on modern quad skates.
*1884: Levant M. Richardson received a patent for the use of steel ball bearings in skate wheels to reduce friction, allowing skaters to increase speed with minimum effort.
*1898: Richardson started the Richardson Ball Bearing and Skate Company, which provided skates to most professional skate racers of the time, including Harley Davidson (no relation to the Harley-Davidson motorcycle brand).
*:The design of the quad skate has remained essentially unchanged since then, and remained as the dominant roller skate design until nearly the end of the 20th century. The quad skate has begun to make a comeback recently due to the popularity of roller derby and jam skating.
*1900: The Peck &amp; Snyder Company patented an inline skate with two wheels.
*1902: The Chicago Coliseum opened a public skating rink. Over 7,000 people attended the opening night.
*1935: The Chicago Coliseum hosts the first Transcontinental Roller Derby with a pair of men and women and Chicago becomes the birthplace of roller derby.
*1937: Roller skating the sport was organized nationally by the Roller Skate Rink Owner&#x27;s Association and the onset of roller skating&#x27;s golden age
*1977: Inline skates looking like ice skates were used by DEFA, the East German state film studio, in the film &quot;Die zertanzten Schuhe&quot;, based on the fairy tale &quot;The Twelve Dancing Princesses&quot;, in some winter scenes on a frozen lake.
*1979: The roller disco trend in America occurs, highlighted in films like that year&#x27;s &quot;Roller Boogie&quot;. Scott Olson and Brennan Olson of Minneapolis, Minnesota came across a pair of inline skates created in the 1960s by the Chicago Roller Skate Company and, seeing the potential for off-ice hockey training, set about redesigning the skates using modern materials and attaching ice hockey boots. A few years later Scott Olson began heavily promoting the skates and launched the company Rollerblade, Inc.
*1983: President Ronald Reagan declared October National Roller Skating Month.
*1993: Active Brake Technology, Rollerblade, Inc. developed ABT or Active Brake Technology for increased safety.
*2020–2021: Roller skates are in short supply worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Types of roller skating==

===Artistic===
Artistic roller skating is a sport which consists of a number of events. These are usually accomplished on quad skates, but inline skates may be used for some events. Various flights of events are organized by age and ability/experience. In the US, local competitions lead to 9 regional competitions which led to the National Championships and World Championships.

* Figures: Figure artistic skating involves prescribed movement symmetrically composed of at least two circles, but not more than three circles, involving primary, or primary and secondary movements, with or without turns. Figures are skated on circles, which have been inscribed on the skating surface.
* Dance: Skaters are judged by the accuracy of steps that they skate when performing a particular dance. In addition to being judged on their edges and turns, skaters must carry themselves in an elegant manner while paying careful attention to the rhythm and timing of the music.
* Freestyle: Freestyle roller dancing is a style of physical movement, usually done to music, that is not choreographed or planned ahead of time. It occurs in many genres, including those where people dance with partners. By definition, this kind of dance is never the same from performance to performance, although it can be done formally and informally, sometimes using some sparse choreography as a very loose outline for the improvisation.
* Precision teams: A team of skaters (usually counted in multiples of four) creates various patterns and movements to music. Often used elements include skating in a line, skating in a box, &quot;splicing&quot; (subgroups skating towards each other such that they do not contact each other), and skating in a circle. The team is judged on its choreography and the ability to skate together precisely, and jumps and spins are not as important. In this category, they are classified as &quot;small groups&quot; (6 to 15 people) or &quot;big groups&quot; (16 to 30 skaters). These show groups are also divided due to the level and ages.
* Singles and pairs: A single skater or a pair of skaters present routines to music. They are judged on skating ability and creativity. Jumps, spins and turns are expected in these events. Sometimes with a pair or couple skaters slow music will play, and usually it is two songs.

===Speed skating===

Speed skating originally started on traditional roller skates, quads or four wheels per skate. The first organized, national competition was held in 1938 in Detroit Michigan at the Arena Gardens Roller Rink, once home of &quot;Detroit&#x27;s Premier Sports Palace. The Arena opened in 1935 as roller skating began its ascension as a top sport. In the early years, competitors representing the mid-west states, primarily Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio dominated the sport. By 1950 as rinks hired speed skating coaches who trained competitors, the east and west coast began to compete effectively for the national titles. But in the early years, national titles were dominated by Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati.

As rules were established for state and national competitions, the speed skating season began in fall and continued through spring leading up to a state tournament. Eventually approximately 1947, due to the growth of speed skating, the top three places at a state tournament would qualify skaters for a regional tournament. The top three places at regional tournaments then went on to compete at a national tournament. Skaters could qualify as individuals or as part of a two-person or four-person (relay) team. Qualification at regional events could warrant an invite to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO for a one-week training session on their outdoor velodrome. Inline speed skating is a competitive non-contact sport on inline skates. Variants include indoor, track and road racing, with many different grades of skaters, so the whole family can compete.

===Jam skating===

Jam skating is a skating style consisting of a combination of dance, gymnastics, and roller skating, performed on roller skates. The 2018 documentary film &quot;United Skates&quot; prominently features the technique.

===Group skating===

Among skaters not committed to a particular discipline, a popular social activity is the &quot;group skate&quot; or street skate, in which large groups of skaters regularly meet to skate together, usually on city streets. One such group is the San Francisco Midnight Rollers. In 1989 the small 15–20 group that became the Midnight Rollers explored the closed doubIe-decker Embarcadero Freeway after the Loma-Prieta earthquake until it was torn down. At which point the new route was created settling on Friday nights at 9 pm from the San Francisco Ferry Building circling 12 miles around the city back at midnight to the start. Although such touring existed among quad roller skate clubs in the 1970s and 1980s, it made the jump to inline skates in 1990 with groups in large cities throughout the United States. In some cases, hundreds of skaters would regularly participate, resembling a rolling party. In the late 1990s, the group skate phenomenon spread to Europe and east Asia. The weekly Friday night skate in Paris, France (called Pari Roller) is believed to be one of the largest repeating group skates in the world. At times, it has had as many as 35,000 skaters participating on the boulevards of Paris, on a single night. The Sunday Skate Night in Berlin also attracts over 10,000 skaters during the summer, and Copenhagen, Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo host other popular events. Charity skates in Paris have attracted 50,000 participants (the yearly Paris-Versailles skate). The current Official Guinness World Record holder is Nightskating Warszawa (Poland) in number of 4013 participants from 19 June 2014, but their real record from 25 April 2015, is 7303 participants and over 38 000 skaters total in 10 events in season 2015.

===Aggressive inline===

This form of roller skating usually involves performing air tricks like spins or flips, grinds, and various types of stalls on the coping. Aggressive quad skating usually takes place on a street, or in a skate park on mini ramps, vert, and bowls. 

Any roller skate can be used for park skating though many skaters prefer a higher-ankle boot over speed style boot. The boot of the skate may also be modified to withstand the higher impact that comes with this style of skating, whether it be at a park or on a street. Additional modifications to traditional rollers skates include the addition of a plastic block between the front and rear trucks commonly called slide blocks or grind blocks. The front and rear trucks can also be modified to use a 3-inch wide truck to allow for different tricks. Many skaters prefer small, hard wheels to allow more speed and less wheel bite.

===Roller hockey===

Roller hockey is the overarching name for variants of hockey played on quad or inline skates. Quad hockey (also called rink hockey, hardball hockey, or simply roller hockey) has been played since the 19th century. It is played in many countries worldwide and was a demonstration rollersport in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Other variations include inline hockey and inline skater hockey.

===Roller derby===

Roller derby is a team sport played on roller skates on an oval track. Originally a trademarked product developed out of speed skating demonstrations, the sport underwent a revival in the early 2000s as a grass-roots-driven, five-a-side sport played mainly by women. Most roller derby leagues adopt the rules and guidelines set by the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association or its open gender counterpart, Men&#x27;s Roller Derby Association, but there are leagues that play on a banked track, as the sport was originally played from the 1930s.

==Skating federations==
The Fédération Internationale de Patinage a Roulettes was founded in 1924, and in the 1960s it was renamed the Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports. In 2017 it merged with the International Skateboarding Federation to form the World Skate. It currently has over 130 national federations.

In the United States, the Roller Skating Rink Operators Association was founded in 1937 and the United States Amateur Roller Skating Association was founded in 1939. They merged in 1972 to form the USA Confederation of Roller Skating, later renamed USA Roller Sports. It is headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, also home of the National Museum of Roller Skating. Nationals are held each summer with skaters required to qualify through state and regional competitions.

==Alternatives==

Roller skating, like skateboarding, has created a number of spin-off sports and sports devices. In addition to rollerblades/inline skates, there have also been:
* Soaps, normal-looking street/skate shoes with a concave plastic plate in the sole to allow grinds.
* Heelys, normal-looking street/skate shoes with a single retractable wheel in the heel of each shoe, allowing the wearer to perform unique rollerskating-like moves at leisure while still walking normally when the skating functionality isn&#x27;t desired (and the wheel is mostly retracted into a recessed slot in the heel). The fact that skateboarding and related wheeled sports are outlawed in many cities and suburbs makes the low key and spontaneous nature of Heelys all the more enticing to the same demographic. Heelys were later also combined with Soaps into a single hybrid shoe.
* Freeline skates, a class of unattached skates that wearers place under their normal street or skate shoes. They typically have 2 closely set inline wheels set with a short base under a small squarish plate (usually surfaced with grip tape about the same width as the rider&#x27;s shoe). This arrangement allows for a range of motion similar to single-wheeled skates like Heelys. Due to the lack of straps on the contact plate, freeline skates require constant motion to stay on, and are a particular challenge for novices.
* Two-wheeled skates: there are also other lesser seen two-wheeled skate arrangements. Some resemble inline skates but with 2 very large wheels bolted in at an angle from the outside rather than a center-balanced row of 4 smaller wheels underneath of inline skates. Others resemble freeline skates in that they have a small squarish platform, but with 2 medium-sized wheels on either side, somewhat between a freeline skate and roller skates (but with inline-skate-styled wheels).
* Orbit wheel skates, another spiritual relative of the freeline skate whereby the skate stands on a grip-tape-surfaced platform (just slightly larger than a freeline skate&#x27;s) inside of a large hoop that contains a trapped wheel that can freely rotate under the grip plate each foot is planted on. The foot plates normally rest on the trough of the inner surface of these orbital wheels, with the toes pointing orthogonal to the rotation of the ringed wheel. It&#x27;s said the experience of riding them is somewhat similar to skateboarding, and there are variants with the two wheels connected so the rider is fixed in a skateboarding-like stance.
*Razor Jetts Heel Wheels, a unattached heel wheel set up, uses hook and loop straps to keep your feet in place during use. In relation to freeline skates, the heel wheels can be unattached and reattached under any normal street shoe, skate shoe or gym shoe. Polyurethane wheels allow for a smooth ride when using the heel wheels. This type of activity is done outdoors on cement.

<text>Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (13 December 1780 – 24 March 1849) was a German chemist who is known best for work that was suggestive of the periodic law for the chemical elements, and for inventing the first lighter, which was known as the Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp. He became a professor of chemistry and pharmacy for the University of Jena.

== Life and work==

As a coachman&#x27;s son, Döbereiner had little opportunity for formal schooling. Thus, he was apprenticed to an apothecary, and began to read widely and to attend science lectures. He eventually became a professor for the University of Jena in 1810 and also studied chemistry at Strasbourg. In work published during 1829, Döbereiner reported trends in certain properties of selected groups of elements. For example, the average of the atomic masses of lithium and potassium was close to the atomic mass of sodium. A similar pattern was found with calcium, strontium, and barium; with sulfur, selenium, tellurium; and with chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Moreover, the densities for some of these triads had a similar pattern. These sets of elements became known as &quot;Döbereiner&#x27;s triads&quot;. 

Döbereiner is also known for his discovery of furfural, for his work concerning the use of platinum as a catalyst, and for the invention of a lighter, known as Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp. By 1828 hundreds of thousands of these lighters had been mass produced by the German manufacturer Gottfried Piegler in Schleiz.

The German writer Goethe was a friend of Döbereiner, attended his lectures weekly, and used his theories of chemical affinities as a basis for his famous 1809 novella Elective Affinities.

<doc id="228432" wikidata="Q1160192" url="?curid=228432" title="Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats">
<text>The Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (, ; Open Vld) is a Flemish liberal political party in Belgium. The party has been described as centre-right and has smaller factions within the party that have conservative liberal and social liberal views. The party is a member of the Liberal Group, Renew Europe, and Liberal International.

The party was created in 1992 from the former bilingual Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV) and politicians from other parties after Belgium was reconstituted as a federal state based on language, with the French-speaking faction forming the Reformist Movement (MR) in Wallonia. The party led the government for three cabinets under Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 until March 2008. Open VLD then formed the Federal Government (the so-called &quot;Swedish government&quot;) with N-VA, CD&amp;V and Mouvement Réformateur.

In the Flemish Parliament, the VLD formed a coalition government with sp.a-Spirit and Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V) from after the 2004 regional election until the 2009 regional election. Open VLD has been a member of the Leterme I Government formed on 22 March 2008, the Van Rompuy I Government formed on 2 January 2009, the Leterme II Government formed on 24 November 2009 and the Di Rupo Government formed on 6 December 2011.

Ideologically, Open VLD started as an economically liberal and somewhat libertarian Thatcherite party under its founder, Guy Verhofstadt, which mirrored some of the original ideology of the PVV. The VLD rapidly became more centrist and gave up much of its free market approach, partly under the influence of Verhofstadt&#x27;s political scientist brother Dirk Verhofstadt. However, the VLD continued to contain conservative-libertarian and classical liberal wings with ties to think-tanks like Nova Civitas. Party chairman Bart Somers called in November 2006 for a &quot;revolution&quot; within the party, saying that &quot;a liberal party&quot;, like the VLD, &quot;can be only progressive and social&quot;.

From 2000 to 2004, during the second period of its participation in the Belgian federal government and under Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, the VLD allegedly lost most of its ideological appeal. Several of its thinkers such as (former member) Boudewijn Bouckaert, president of Nova Civitas, heavily criticized the party. Many others, particularly from the party&#x27;s conservative and Flemish autonomist wing, resented the priority it placed on the &#x27;Belgian compromise&#x27;, which enabled the French Community&#x27;s Socialist Party to gain a dominant position in the formulation of Belgian federal government policy.

In 2004, the VLD teamed up with the minority social-liberal party Vivant for both the Flemish and European elections. VLD-Vivant lost the elections to arch rivals CD&amp;V and the Flemish Bloc. The VLD fell from second to third place among the Flemish political parties, slipping narrowly behind the sp.a-Spirit cartel. Internal feuds, the support for electoral rights for immigrants and an unsuccessful economic policy were seen as the main reasons for its election defeat. From 2007, the party kept having electoral difficulties, first due to competition from split-off List Dedecker and after 2010 from the liberal-conservative Flemish-nationalist party N-VA.

==History==
The VLD has its origins in the Party for Freedom and Progress (which in turn was a successor to the Liberal Party), a bilingual party which stood in both the Flemish and Walloon regions of Belgium. As such the liberal party is the oldest political party of Belgium. In 1846, Walthère Frère-Orban succeeded in creating a political program which could unite several liberal groups into one party. Before 1960, the Liberal Party of Belgium was barely organised. The school pact of 1958, as a result of which the most important argument for the traditional anti-clericalism was removed, gave the necessary impetus for a thorough renewal. During the liberal party congress of 1961, the Liberal Party was reformed into the bilingual Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV-PLP), and Omer Vanaudenhove became the chairman of the new party. The new liberal party, which struggled with an anti-clerical image, opened its doors for believers, but wasn&#x27;t too concerned about the situation of workers and primarily defended the interests of employers. It is a central principle of Classical Liberalism that employers and employees do NOT have opposed long term interests.

In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the tensions between the different communities in Belgium rose and there were disagreements within the liberal movement as well. In 1972, the unitary PVV-PLP was split into separate a Flemish and a Francophone parties. On Flemish side, under the guidance of Frans Grootjans, Herman Vanderpoorten and Willy De Clercq, the PVV was created, on Walloon side Milou Jeunehomme became the head of the PLP and Brussels got its own but totally disintegrated liberal party landscape. Willy De Clercq became the first chairman of the independent Party of Freedom and Progress (, PVV). De Clercq, together with Frans Grootjans and Herman Vanderpoorten, set out the lines for the new party. This reform was coupled an Ethical Congress, on which the PVV adopted very progressive and tolerant stances regarding abortion, euthanasia, adultery, homosexuality and gender equality.

In 1982, the 29-year-old reformer Guy Verhofstadt became the chairman of the party, and even was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget from 1986 to 1988. Annemie Neyts succeeded him as chairman, becoming the first female party chairman. In 1989, Verhofstadt once more became the chairman of the PVV, after his party had been condemned to the opposition by the Christian People&#x27;s Party (CVP) in 1987.

In 1992, the PVV was reformed into the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (&quot;Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&quot;, VLD) under the impulse of Verhofstadt. Although the VLD was the successor of the PVV, many politicians with democratic nationalist or socialist roots joined the new party. Notable examples are Jaak Gabriëls, then-president of the Flemish People&#x27;s Union, and Hugo Coveliers. From the early 1990s, the VLD advanced in every election, only to get in government following the 1999 general election when the VLD became the largest party. Guy Verhofstadt became Prime Minister and Patrick Dewael became Minister-President of Flanders. They were both at the head of a coalition of liberals, social democrats and greens.

===2007 elections===
Before the 2007 general election, the VLD participated in a cartel with Vivant and Liberal Appeal. In February 2007, it decided to cease the cartel and start operating under the name Open VLD. On the 10 June 2007 general elections, Open VLD won 18 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and five out of 40 seats in the Senate.

===2010 elections===
In the 2010 general election, Open VLD won 13 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives. After the long government formation process, on 6 December 2011 the Di Rupo Government was formed, with Open VLD one of the six constituent parties.

==Ideology and support==

At its inception, the Open VLD was a classical liberal and somewhat right-libertarian party with support for free-markets and deregulation. Former party leader Guy Verhofstadt was compared to Margaret Thatcher in his beliefs during his time as party chairman. In the 1990s, the party switched from a libertarian to a more socially liberal position under Bart Somers. Some of the party&#x27;s ideological influences have been Karl Popper, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Paine, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. The party also contained members from both social democratic and Flemish nationalist liberal-conservative backgrounds who have influenced the VLD&#x27;s course, such as former Volksunie leader Jaak Gabriëls and Hugo Coveliers falling into the latter camp. Others had ties to the conservative-libertarian organization Nova Civitas, and were open to working with the Vlaams Blok and later Vlaams Belang party, although this was strongly opposed by the party leadership as a whole. Presently, the Open VLD retains an economically liberal position by supporting lower taxes and private property ownership while also closing tax loopholes. It supports a Canadian model of migration and for a more inclusive society towards immigrants, but claims not to endorse open borders and wants quicker deportation of illegal immigrants. It also retains a socially liberal stance on matters such as same-sex marriage, LGBT rights and introducing a third gender option on official documents, but also believes the government shouldn&#x27;t interfere with matters related to sexuality. For a period, the party was considered the main centre-right rival to the Christian Democratic CD&amp;V in the Flemish region and saw its highest period of support in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, the emergence of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party and the LDD drew some of the party&#x27;s conservative leaning voters away and contributed to a decline in votes. Ideological disputes also caused some of the party&#x27;s more conservative and traditionalist libertarian wing such as Boudewijn Bouckaert, Jean-Marie Dedecker and Hugo Coveliers to leave the party. Dedecker later founded the LDD and Coveliers VLOTT while others joined the N-VA.

In 2024, Open VLD (along with MR) blocked Belgium from recognizing the State of Palestine.

==Representation in EU institutions==
The party is fairly pro-European, and sits in the Renew Europe group with two MEPs.

Then-Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (VLD) was rejected as a candidate for the presidency of the European Commission in June 2004.

In the European Committee of the Regions, Open VLD sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with two alternate members for the 2020-2025 mandate. Jean-Luc Vanraes is Coordinator in the CIVEX Commission.

<doc id="228433" wikidata="Q610696" url="?curid=228433" title="Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra">
<text>, commonly abbreviated by fans as Skapara or TSPO, is a Japanese ska and jazz band formed in 1988 by the percussionist Asa-Chang, and initially composed of over 10 veterans of Tokyo&#x27;s underground scene. At the time, the band&#x27;s sound was unlike that of any of its contemporaries in the then fledgling Japanese ska scene, and over the course of the past 31 years, they have been influential on Japanese music as a whole. Its sound, the product of the musical influences of its members, is a mix of traditional ska, jazz, and rock. In the vein of many other more traditional ska acts, many of Skapara&#x27;s songs are purely instrumental.

Since its inception, the band has gone on several nationwide tours of Japan, and have toured worldwide. They have collaborated with several vocalists outside of their band, including Shiina Ringo, Akira Kobayashi, Kyōko Koizumi, Schadaraparr, Puffy, Yoshie Nakano and Tamio Okuda. They also performed the Japanese theme song to the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus&quot;, entitled &quot;Black Jack&quot;, as well as songs for the PlayStation game &quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; released in 1999, the 2020–21 Japanese drama &quot;Kamen Rider Saber&quot; and the closing ceremony for the 2020 Olympic Games.

==History==

===Early beginnings===
The band&#x27;s first release was 1989&#x27;s eponymous six-track EP, released on vinyl by local independent label Kokusai Records. That record&#x27;s acceptance, coupled with the band&#x27;s live shows, got them a deal with Epic Records. At this time the &#x27;classic&#x27; lineup of the band included: Asa-Chang (percussions), Tsuyoshi Kawakami (Bass), Tatsuyuki Aoki (drums), Yuichi Oki (keyboards), Marc Hayashi (guitar), Tatsuyuki Hiyamuta (alto sax/agitate man), Gamo (tenor sax), Atsushi Yanaka (baritone sax), Nargo (trumpet), Masahiko Kitahara (trombone) and Cleanhead Gimura (vocals). Yuhei Takeuchi (alto sax) was part of the original lineup, but left in 1990, though he has re-joined the band live on several occasions.

===1990s===
 was released in 1990, and includes their first big hit, &quot;Monster Rock&quot;. Within a year, the band was playing Tokyo&#x27;s Budokan Arena in front of 10,000 fans. After their second album, , original guitarist Marc Hayashi left the band and was replaced by Toru Terashi. Their third album, &quot;Pioneers&quot;, marked the last recording of the band with founder Asa-Chang, who decided to pursue a solo career. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was recorded as a 10 piece with no permanent replacement on percussion.

While the band worked on their fifth album, vocalist Cleanhead Gimura lost his ongoing battle with brain cancer and died. &quot;Grand Prix&quot; was released in 1995 as a tribute to the singer. This record continued the band&#x27;s progression into a more pop-oriented sound, and it featured a number of guest musicians and singers. As far as live performances, Tatsuyuki Hiyamuta essentially became the front-man for the band.

1996 saw the release of , which toned back the pop stylings of &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. This marked the first appearance on record of new percussionist Hajime Ohmori. During the band&#x27;s visit to Thailand, Alto Sax/Agitate Man Tatsuyuki Hiyamuta was involved in a motorcycle accident, suffering damage to his legs. He missed out on some shows, but after recovery decided to continue performing, in many cases carrying a cane, or just sitting down while playing. Shortly thereafter Toru Terashi left the band.

After this album, the band decided to leave Epic Records, as there was a feeling that the label had not been able to properly convert their popularity into record sales. They signed with indie label Avex Trax, who also created an exclusive imprint for Skapara, Justa Record. The band recruited Rui Sugimura (brother of Cleanhead Gimura) as a full-time singer. This would become the band&#x27;s most prolific period, with a number of releases, including the &quot;Arkestra&quot; album, various 12” and 7” records (which included remixes from &quot;Arkestra&quot; songs as well as completely new tracks), the &quot;Hinotama Jive&quot; EP, the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Incredible Crisis&quot;, and several tribute album appearances. The band embarked on a tour of Japan (documented on the DVD &quot;Ska Evangelists on the Run&quot;). Since no official guitarist had been hired yet, they toured with the two guitarists that worked on the album: Takashi Kato (of Lost Candi) and 會田茂一 (of El Malo).

During the &quot;Arkestra&quot; tour, original drummer Tatsuyuki Aoki died in a train accident. He was temporarily replaced by Tatsuya Nakamura (Blankey Jet City and Losalios). At the end of the tour, Kin-Ichi Motegi (Fishmans) also filled in. Rui Sugimura left in mid-1999 as well. Takashi Kato became a permanent member of the band.

===2000s===
2000&#x27;s Full Tension Beaters was a full-on Ska record, and their first album to be released outside of Asia (by Grover Records in Germany). Even though Motegi was still working as support drummer during this recording, it was the first record with the band&#x27;s most stable line-up, consisting of Yanaka, Gamo, Nargo, Kitahara and Hiyamuta on the horn section, Oki on keyboards, Kawakami on Bass, Ohmori on percussions, Kato on guitar and Motegi on drums. The lineup would remain the same until 2008.

For their next record, &quot;Stomping on Downbeat Alley&quot;, the band invited three guest singers: Yusuke Chiba (Thee Michelle Gun Elephant), Tajima Takao (Original Love, Pizzicato Five) and Tamio Okuda (Unicorn). The album and singles were a huge success and a gig at Yokohama Arena (with all three guest singers) was released as &quot;Downbeat Arena&quot;. The band also embarked on a European tour which was documented on the DVD &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot;.

&quot;High Numbers&quot; was a more low-profile release, having mostly instrumental tracks, along with Kin-Ichi Motegi&#x27;s first lead vocal track, &quot;Ginga to Meiro&quot;. 2004&#x27;s &quot;Answer&quot; was a similar affair.

For 2006&#x27;s &quot;Wild Peace&quot;, the band once again recruited three guest vocalists: Chara, Hanaregumi, and Hiroto Komoto (The High-Lows). As with &quot;Downbeat Alley&quot; these singles became huge hits, and the band also recorded a DVD at the final show for the tour, with all three singers. They once again toured Europe with this record. The DVD &quot;Smile&quot; was released to document this tour.

&quot;Perfect Future&quot; soon followed, with more jazz leanings, and only one guest vocalist, Fumio Ito (of Kemuri). Kin-Ichi Motegi also recorded a vocal track for this album. A few months after the release of &quot;Perfect Future&quot;, Tatsuyuki Hiyamuta, essentially the band&#x27;s front man in live performances, decided to leave the band in order to concentrate on healing his legs, due to the accident suffered in 1996. The band decided not to replace him, thereby remaining as a nine-piece.

In early 2009 &quot;Paradise Blue&quot; was released, with the first line-up difference in almost a decade. This marked the 20th anniversary since the band&#x27;s first EP was released, and they toured Japan in support of the album.

===2010s===
2010 saw the release of &quot;World Ska Symphony&quot;, featuring guest vocals from Tamio Okuda, Crystal Kay, and Kazuyoshi Saito.

They played at Vive Latino Festival in Mexico City in April 2011. This was their first show in Latin America. They played at Coachella in California on April 12, 2013.

In 2014, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary. For the release of &quot;Ska Me Forever&quot;, the album featured guest vocals from 10-Feet, MONGOL800, and Asian Kung-Fu Generation.

In October 2014, the band released &quot;Ska Me Forever&quot; Mexican Edition, edited by &quot;Casete&quot;, which includes a CD bonus with 2 special songs: &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot; and an arrangement of &quot;Cafe Tacvba&quot; hit &quot;Eres&quot;. They also played a show in Mexico City to promote this edition for more than 6,000 people, making it their highest attended solo concert in North America.

In 2020, the band composed and performed the opening and ending songs for the Tokusatsu series, &quot;Kamen Rider Saber&quot;.

<doc id="228434" wikidata="Q1361059" url="?curid=228434" title="François de La Rochefoucauld, 7th Duke of La Rochefoucauld">
<text>François Alexandre Frédéric de La Rochefoucauld, 7th [[Duke of La Rochefoucauld]], 1st Duke of Liancourt, 2nd Duke of Estissac (; 11 January 1747 – 27 March 1827) was a French social reformer.

==Early life==

He was born at La Roche Guyon, the son of François Armand de La Rochefoucauld, duc d&#x27;Estissac, grand master of the royal wardrobe. One of his cousins was Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld d&#x27;Enville.

Known as the duc de Liancourt in infancy, he became an officer of carbineers, and married at seventeen. A visit to England seems to have suggested the establishment of a model farm at Liancourt, where he reared cattle imported from England and Switzerland. He also set up spinning machines on his estate, and founded a school, École nationale supérieure d&#x27;arts et métiers, for the sons of soldiers, which became in 1788 the &quot;École des Enfants de la Patrie&quot; under royal protection. 
In 2008, this school was renamed Arts et Métiers ParisTech.

==French Revolution==
Frédéric de Liancourt was elected to the Estates-General of 1789, where he sought in vain to support the monarchy while furthering social reform.

On 14 July, following the storming of the Bastille, he warned Louis XVI of the state of affairs in Paris, and met his exclamation that there was a revolt with the answer, &quot;Non, sire, c&#x27;est une révolution.&quot; (&quot;No, majesty, it is a revolution.&quot;) 

On 18 July, he became president of the National Constituent Assembly. 
Established in command of a military division in Normandy, he offered Louis a refuge in Rouen, and, failing in this effort, assisted him with a large sum of money.

==Exile==
After the events of 10 August 1792 (storming of the Tuileries Palace), he fled to England, where he was the guest of Arthur Young. There also he met Young&#x27;s nieces by marriage, Frances and Sarah Burney. The former gives a long description of him in her journal. After the assassination of his cousin, Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld d&#x27;Enville, at Gisors on 14 September 1792 he assumed the title of duc de La Rochefoucauld.

He left England in 1794, and travelled to the United States. 
In 1795, he and five associates began a tour which covered much of the northern United States and Upper Canada. They crossed the Niagara River to Fort Erie and also saw Fort Chippawa. From there they travelled to Newark, Canada where they were entertained by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. 
Their trip was cut short when they were prohibited from entering Lower Canada. François Alexandre Frédéric returned to the US and, in 1799, his exile ended, he returned to France.

==Return to France==

On his return to Paris, he was treated with dignity, but distantly by Napoleon. At the Restoration he entered the House of Peers, but Louis XVIII refused to reinstate him as master of the wardrobe, although his father had paid 400,000 francs for the honour. Successive governments, revolutionary and otherwise, recognized the value of his institutions at Liancourt, and he was for twenty-three years government inspector of his school, École nationale supérieure d&#x27;arts et métiers, which had been removed to Châlons-en-Champagne.

The 19 member jury for the 5th Exposition des produits de l&#x27;industrie française was chosen in May 1819, with the Duc de la Rochefoucauld as president and Jean-Antoine Chaptal as vice-president and rapporteur. Chaptal had arranged the 2nd and 3rd expositions, and again played a leading role.
The 5th exposition opened on 25 August 1819 in the great halls of the Louvre palace.

Rochefoucauld was one of the first promoters of vaccination in France; he established a dispensary in Paris, and he was an active member of the central boards of administration for hospitals, prisons and agriculture. His opposition to the government in the House of Peers led to his removal in 1823 from the honorary positions he held, while the vaccination committee, of which he was president, was suppressed. The academies of science and of medicine admitted him to their membership by way of protest. Official hostility pursued him even after his death, for the old pupils of his school were charged by the military at his funeral.

==Works==
His works, chiefly on economic questions, include books on the English system of taxation, poor-relief and education.

==Family==
His eldest son, François, duc de La Rochefoucauld (1765–1848), succeeded his father in the House of Peers.

The second, Alexandre, comte de La Rochefoucauld (1767–1841), married Adélaïde de Pyvart de Chastullé, a San Domingo heiress allied to the Beauharnais family. Mme de La Rochefoucauld became &quot;dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; to the empress Josephine, and their eldest daughter married , a brother-in-law of Pauline Bonaparte, Princess Borghese. La Rochefoucauld became ambassador successively to Vienna (1805) and to The Hague (1808–1810), where he negotiated the union of the Kingdom of Holland with France. During the &quot;Hundred Days&quot; he was made a peer of France. He subsequently devoted himself to philanthropic work, and in 1822 became deputy to the Chamber of Deputies and sat with the constitutional royalists. He was again raised to the peerage in 1831. His descendants became Dukes of Estissac and Princes of La Rochefoucauld-Montbel (Dominique and his son Gabriel).

The third son, Frederic Gaetan, marquis de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt (1779–1863), was a zealous philanthropist and a partisan of constitutional monarchy. He took no part in politics after 1848. The marquis wrote on social questions, notably on prison administration; he edited the works of La Rochefoucauld, and the memoirs of Condorcet; and he was the author of some vaudevilles, tragedies and poems.

<text>Christian Democratic and Flemish (, ; CD&amp;V) is a Flemish Christian-democratic political party in Belgium. The party has historical ties to both trade unionism (ACV) and trade associations (UNIZO) and the Farmer&#x27;s League. Until 2001, the party was named the Christian People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Christelijke Volkspartij&quot; , CVP).

It was traditionally the largest political party of Flanders, until it was overtaken by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in the 2010s. CD&amp;V participated in most governments and has generally the largest number of mayors. Most prime ministers of Belgium and minister-presidents of Flanders have been CD&amp;V politicians. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council from 2009 to 2014, is one of the leading politicians of CD&amp;V.

CD&amp;V is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and Centrist Democrat International.

==History==
The history of the CD&amp;V dates back to the 19th century. It originated in the 19th century Catholic Party. At the end of the century, the new fraction of Christian democrats shifted the focus of the party slightly to the left. In the interwar years the party was renamed Catholic Bloc. Then, the Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP) existed from 1945 until 1968. In 1968, the PSC-CVP was split into the French-speaking Christian Social Party (PSC, now Les Engagés) and Flemish Christian People&#x27;s Party (Christelijke Volkspartij CVP). In 2001 the CVP changed its name to the CD&amp;V.

The party was almost continually in power from its establishment until 1999, with the exception of 1954–1958. In 1999, the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) became the largest party in Belgium, and formed a majority purple government of liberals, social democrats and greens. The same happened in the Flemish Government, but with the addition of Flemish nationalists. In 2003 CD&amp;V again lost the federal elections which continued the federal centre-left coalition, but this time without the Greens.

In 2004, Flemish elections were held and the CD&amp;V once more became the largest political party by representation in the Flemish Parliament. Yves Leterme became Flemish minister-president. After successful local elections in 2006, the party became the largest party in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives after the federal elections of 2007. The CD&amp;V led the subsequent coalition talks, which repeatedly stalled (see 2007–2008 Belgian government formation). On the 20 March 2008, a new federal government was finally assembled, led by Yves Leterme. Kris Peeters subsequently became the next minister-president of Flanders. From 30 December 2008 till 25 November 2009, Herman Van Rompuy led his first cabinet before becoming the first permanent president of the European Council. Afterwards, Yves Leterme led his second government.

In June 2009, Flemish elections were held and the CD&amp;V remained the largest party of Flanders. Kris Peeters stayed as Flemish minister-president. The party also remained the largest Flemish party in the European Parliament after the 2009 European elections.

In 2010, the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) decided to step out of the federal coalition, consequently ending the government. The federal elections of 2010 resulted in a major loss of historic proportions for CD&amp;V, largely due to votes lost to the Flemish-nationalist New Flemish Alliance. In the campaign, former prime minister Yves Leterme took a subtle step aside as frontrunner of the party. The president of the party, Marianne Thyssen, had pre-electorally stated that she was a candidate to become prime minister.

On 6 December 2011, the Di Rupo Government was formed, with the CD&amp;V as the largest Flemish party.

During the local elections in 2012, CD&amp;V managed to remain the largest Flemish party on the local level. It remained in the coalition of all five Flemish provinces and in three quarters of the municipalities. Almost half of these municipalities were subsequently led by CD&amp;V mayors.

==Ideology==
CD&amp;V is a Flemish party that follows the principle of Christian democracy. Its core values include the importance of the family, promoting a respectful and warm society, and recognizing the intrinsic value of each individual. The party places a strong emphasis on well-being and health care, as well as the pursuit of an equitable income for all citizens. However, on the ethical front, CD&amp;V holds conservative positions, particularly on issues such as abortion and euthanasia, where the party is reluctant to fast-track relaxations. Combining these conservative ethics with progressive socioeconomic policies, CD&amp;V is often considered a &quot;centre party&quot;. In its administrative activities, CD&amp;V nurtures close ties with civil society, including trade unions, professional federations and various associations. In doing so, the party strives to represent the voice of rural areas and the agricultural sector.
